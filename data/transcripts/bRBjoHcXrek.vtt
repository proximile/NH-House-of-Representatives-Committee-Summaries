00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the Judiciary
 
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
Committee I'm here today to introduce a
 
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
law currently our
 
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
law doesn't Define although the
 
00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 align:start position:0%
Constitution says that we shall not
 
00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
unreasonably restrict records we don't
 
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 align:start position:0%
Define what reasonable is so what that's
 
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
resulted in
 
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 align:start position:0%
is the ability to
 
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
make enormous
 
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
requests and that ability also branches
 
00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
out to outof State businesses to also
 
00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
make rather large requests because
 
00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps perhaps those
 
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
requests benefit them financially to get
 
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 align:start position:0%
data that they could then sell
 
00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
products and so what this bill seeks to
 
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
do is to help to define a little bit
 
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
more what reasonable is and part of the
 
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
reason for doing it is because towns
 
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
have become
 
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
so buried in these large requests that
 
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
then when somebody's trying to get a
 
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
really reasonable small request they're
 
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
waiting a really long time to get it and
 
00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 align:start position:0%
we' we've got to fix that because when
 
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
people need something they should be
 
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 align:start position:0%
able to get it so this is trying to seek
 
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
to balance that so what this says is
 
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
that if the time to make a record
 
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 align:start position:0%
available is greater than 10 hours in a
 
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
one- month time
 
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
period Then the then the body May charge
 
00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 align:start position:0%
up to $25 an hour to make that record
 
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
available and in
 
00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
surveying through nhma and the school
 
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
board Association the the towns and the
 
00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
school districts there weren't many
 
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
requests that did exceed that amount so
 
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
I don't expect this to end
 
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
up costing many people any money at all
 
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's really just for the large
 
00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 align:start position:0%
requests and balancing and and balancing
 
00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
out what we're requesting at the same
 
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
time this also seeks to put in here that
 
00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 align:start position:0%
a public body or agency may suggest to a
 
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
requester a reasonable modification of
 
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
the scope of the request if doing so
 
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
would enable the body or agency to
 
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
produce the records more efficiently and
 
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
affordably and that's so that we're
 
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 align:start position:0%
working together in the spirit of how
 
00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 align:start position:0%
be and I am happy to take any questions
 
00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
bill questions for uh the
 
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor yes representative
 
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
Perez thank you thanks for taking my
 
00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
question my concern is that this hurts
 
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
the little guy
 
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
um there's nothing in here that I read
 
00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 align:start position:0%
but correct me if I'm wrong that I mean
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
you can't go by hours because you could
 
00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 align:start position:0%
have someone who um takes two hours to
 
00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
do that task and another person that
 
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
would take 10 hours to do that P task it
 
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.830 align:start position:0%
would take 10 hours to do that P task it
depends

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
depends
 
00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 align:start position:0%
on you know what they want how fast they
 
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
want to do it how able they are to do it
 
00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:30.199 align:start position:0%
so doing it by hours is to me
 
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
is very arbitrary and I have a concern
 
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 align:start position:0%
about that because if you're putting
 
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:37.880 align:start position:0%
stuff together for me in the
 
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
municipality and you don't like me you
 
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
could take a lot longer and that stuff
 
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
happens all the time so that's my
 
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
concern that this hurts the little guy
 
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question so that was
 
00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
actually raised and I did pass around an
 
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
amendment to this um and what that is
 
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
saying is that if a party believes that
 
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
the estimated number of hours or cost to
 
00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 align:start position:0%
make the records available as
 
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
unreasonable that they may file a
 
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
complaint with the EMB budsman for
 
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
determination whether the estimate is
 
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable and to be clear really what
 
00:07:12.869 --> 00:07:12.879 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here is this $25
 
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
isn't going to even cover the cost of it
 
00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:16.599 align:start position:0%
because a lot of times what this is is
 
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
having to have records redacted by an
 
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
attorney at a rate of $350 an hour so
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
this isn't even going to cover the
 
00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:26.919 align:start position:0%
actual cost of making many of these
 
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
records available so if it's something
 
00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:32.199 align:start position:0%
where a municipal worker is putting this
 
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
together and they're not even actually
 
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
having to have an attorney redact it you
 
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
know I think if they're if they're
 
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
putting together estimates that are
 
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
unreasonable certainly the EMB budsman
 
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
could step in and put that put that
 
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
forward I think if you're paying an
 
00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:48.879 align:start position:0%
attorney an hourly rate to to redact
 
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
stuff I think I mean they've got
 
00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
professional conduct to make sure that
 
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
they're they're giving an accurate
 
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:55.720 align:start position:0%
estimate in
 
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.950 align:start position:0%
estimate in
it

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:01.159 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:05.800 align:start position:0%
um $25 an hour is a lot of money for
 
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
people today especially and I you always
 
00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:10.759 align:start position:0%
hear me talk about the little guy the
 
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
guy who's going to work putting gas in
 
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
his car trying to feed his family clothe
 
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
his family and
 
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
time they don't have time to go the next
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
step or the money to go to a lawyer or
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
this and that I think once again this
 
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
91a those are the people that it's
 
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to help and I think this really
 
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
hurts it it hurts them because you're
 
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
charging them you have no way of knowing
 
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
what it actually takes to do and you're
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
expecting them to follow up if they
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
think it's unreasonable and personally I
 
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.990 align:start position:0%
think it's unreasonable and personally I
just

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
think um it hurts a little guy but thank
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
you right other questions for this word
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:03.399 align:start position:0%
you representative um my kind of along
 
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
the same lines representative Perez one
 
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
of my concerns is um a town can possibly
 
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:10.120 align:start position:0%
make it a discriminatory practice to
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
charge some and not others um and I'm
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
concerned about the Civil Rights
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
implications of that
 
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
and would you be open or is there any
 
00:09:21.069 --> 00:09:21.079 align:start position:0%
way to add language to make sure that
 
00:09:21.079 --> 00:09:22.150 align:start position:0%
way to add language to make sure that
you

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
know I'm concerned that if if the town
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
thinks that something is
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
politically um unreasonable the town
 
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
employees decide that it is and then
 
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
they decide that something else is
 
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable I'm afraid that you know
 
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:38.200 align:start position:0%
there might be some
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
political um push back depending on what
 
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
the request
 
00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
is thank you for that question so I'd be
 
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:48.200 align:start position:0%
happy to put something in here that that
 
00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
about relative to the public bodies
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
developing a policy so that it's more
 
00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:54.200 align:start position:0%
consistent the reason why I use the word
 
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
may is that perhaps you have somebody
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
that comes in and that the town knows
 
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
that that maybe that person has gotten a
 
00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:04.519 align:start position:0%
a tax abatement for the year and they
 
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
financially this might be a hardship to
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
them and they're trying to work with
 
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
them and they don't want to charge them
 
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
I didn't want to say that they shall
 
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
charge I wanted to give them the
 
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that but to make it
 
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
more consistent I'd be open to
 
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
discussing potentially putting something
 
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
in there that they had to develop a
 
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
policy on it if that would would that
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
make you feel better well just to follow
 
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
up I not that I'm advocating for this
 
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
but if you put sh at least it's like
 
00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
uniform across the board but when you
 
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
say may it opens it up to some sort of a
 
00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
town bureaucrat deciding that they're
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
going to charge this person because they
 
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
don't agree with the politics of the
 
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
right to no request and not charge this
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
person that's my
 
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
concern so perhaps to balance that we
 
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
could say shell in there and then we
 
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
could say that maybe something along the
 
00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
lines of the Town may choose to wave
 
00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
this fee if the party is is Indigent of
 
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
some sort like some some way of putting
 
00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
that in there well I'm I'm I'm gonna let
 
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
the public hearing continue but now it's
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
we're in control of the bill so just a
 
00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
suggestion that's all other questions
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
yes representative M thank you Mr chair
 
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I had
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
assumed when I read uh the bill that the
 
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
May applied to keeping a local option
 
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
for municipalities and towns to decide
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
whether they wanted to charge or not
 
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
charge whether it would be $25 an hour
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
or some lesser amount and that the towns
 
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
would have the option to set a uniform
 
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
policy it didn't occur to me as I read
 
00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:39.160 align:start position:0%
this that it would be on an instance by
 
00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:41.959 align:start position:0%
instance judgment so I'm just wondering
 
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
that so I think it could be interpreted
 
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:53.240 align:start position:0%
either way so I think if if that's a
 
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
concern I think we could definitely
 
00:11:57.069 --> 00:11:57.079 align:start position:0%
clarify the language a bit I I do I do
 
00:11:59.310 --> 00:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
think it's a bit ambiguous with that
 
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839 align:start position:0%
with that terminology so I think we
 
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
could clarify that a
 
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
bit other questions for this uh yes
 
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton and then
 
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
representative CH thank you and thank
 
00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:12.519 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question on page two
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh line four multiple request from any
 
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
person or entity to the same public body
 
00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
within a 30-day time period shall be
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
considered one request but what was the
 
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
purpose um of putting a group
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
like that U does that represent
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
difficulty for the town or
 
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
municipality thank you for the question
 
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
so the purpose of that was just that if
 
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
you asked for a request that took 10
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
hours that you didn't get that request
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
and then go back the next day and then
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
ask for another 10 hours worth
 
00:12:51.189 --> 00:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
of research and data if you wanted
 
00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%
to really again like part of my goal
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
here is that many of the of the public
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
bodies are now backed up with right to
 
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:01.240 align:start position:0%
no requ quests they can't answer them as
 
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
quickly as they'd like to because they
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
are backed up and so I was trying to
 
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
Define what a
 
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount of time would be for a
 
00:13:13.949 --> 00:13:13.959 align:start position:0%
request and I think 10 hours worth of
 
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
data in a 30-day time period is a is a
 
00:13:18.509 --> 00:13:18.519 align:start position:0%
pretty substantial amount
 
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
of time put into requesting it and so
 
00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:22.279 align:start position:0%
that was really the purpose give
 
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
somebody else a chance to get the data
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
that they need as well I mean we've got
 
00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
you know if a newspaper is putting in a
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
right to no request for example
 
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
and they can't get the stuff back for
 
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
two months I mean that's no longer news
 
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
anymore once it's the story is two
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
months old so I want to make sure that
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
we're able to to quickly serve everybody
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
we're working together on this thank you
 
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.389 align:start position:0%
we're working together on this thank you
representative

00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
tur yeah thanks for taking the question
 
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm a bit late I hope this hasn't
 
00:13:51.389 --> 00:13:51.399 align:start position:0%
been covered um but I was wondering on
 
00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
on the last page uh Section 8 um where
 
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
it talks about the reasonable charge may
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
be made for employee time time um I'm my
 
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
understanding is sometimes this is also
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
uh particularly for the redaction and
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
the the the legal thing uh aspects chart
 
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
uh the town will um involve the town um
 
00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
Council so I didn't know whether that
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
was something that you'd considered
 
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
whether or not that would be part of of
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
the fees associated with these requests
 
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so that was part of it and again
 
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
that won't cover the full amount often
 
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:26.959 align:start position:0%
these attorneys are charging 350 an hour
 
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
and this is only two 25 an hour hour um
 
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
but I didn't want to make
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
it unaffordable for anybody to possibly
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
get data that they may need yeah what
 
00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
one quick f i what what I was really
 
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
saying is it says employee time I didn't
 
00:14:42.189 --> 00:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
know whether that needed to be broadened
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
in order to allow for for um
 
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
non-employees that the town might
 
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
contract to to take care of these
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
requests thank you for the question yeah
 
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
let me let me look into that because
 
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
that perhaps that needs a little bit of
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
clarifying thank you for the question
 
00:14:59.790 --> 00:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate it other question yes
 
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:00.949 align:start position:0%
appreciate it other question yes
representative

00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:03.759 align:start position:0%
trip thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh it appears that
 
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
there's some fear that there's going to
 
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
be discriminatory practices on uh the
 
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
cost of uh fulfilling these
 
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.350 align:start position:0%
cost of uh fulfilling these
requests

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
requests
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh my question is if you are concerned
 
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
with this would it be possible to make
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
an RSA 91a request to to find out
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
what the costs of other requests are so
 
00:15:33.389 --> 00:15:33.399 align:start position:0%
that you could determine whether there
 
00:15:36.749 --> 00:15:36.759 align:start position:0%
is or is not discriminatory practices
 
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes you could
 
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely put in that to see what
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
others have been charged and if they had
 
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
been if it was being unfairly put in
 
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you other questions for
 
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.030 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you other questions for
this

00:16:40.509 --> 00:16:40.519 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
people all the magistrates and offices
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
of government are their substitutes and
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
agents and at all times accountable to
 
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
them amended 1976 by providing right of
 
00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
access to governmental proced
 
00:16:59.790 --> 00:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
proceedings and
 
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
Records yet this bill is taking away
 
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
opinion many people that ask for
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
information ask for it they can't get it
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
from an a public office so then they
 
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
have to do a right to know many people
 
00:17:26.029 --> 00:17:26.039 align:start position:0%
cannot afford to pay fees and they
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have
 
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
to I have asked for information from my
 
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
town my school district quite
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
often and
 
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
nobody usually gives asks for
 
00:17:44.909 --> 00:17:44.919 align:start position:0%
fees I realize once in a
 
00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919 align:start position:0%
while there are people that are
 
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
excessive in asking for information how
 
00:17:54.669 --> 00:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
we balance that I don't have the answer
 
00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
but the ordinary citizen has a right to
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
know what's going on in any public
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
office and that information is
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
theirs our taxes pay for those employees
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
working in those
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
places our taxes pay for all the paper
 
00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:17.240 align:start position:0%
all the copying everything we shouldn't
 
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
have to pay double
 
00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.870 align:start position:0%
have to pay double
fees

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
fees
 
00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
where I don't know if this a
 
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
contradiction in RSA
 
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
32 excuse me
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
3210 it
 
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
states that in a budget committee or a
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
citizen can
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
ask their school district for a transfer
 
00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:50.950 align:start position:0%
ask their school district for a transfer
of

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
funds I have done that to my school
 
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.470 align:start position:0%
funds I have done that to my school
district

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:55.480 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
recently there are so many things that
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
go on in our government and when like a
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
budget is handed to us from our school
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
district those total figures mean
 
00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.470 align:start position:0%
district those total figures mean
actually

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
nothing and sometimes people want to dig
 
00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
in to know what's going on and unless
 
00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:17.559 align:start position:0%
you do a right to know
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
request nobody will answer you now I
 
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
have an a right to no request into my
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
school district right now but transfer
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
of funds because there's so many
 
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars that are
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
transferred now they are not going to
 
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.029 align:start position:0%
transferred now they are not going to
charge

00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:36.039 align:start position:0%
charge
 
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
me it's going to take 60 days which I
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
told them was fine but I want the
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
information and I have that right I
 
00:19:47.549 --> 00:19:47.559 align:start position:0%
believe if we start charging fees and
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
making laws that everybody's going to
 
00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
pay for this and that we are taking away
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
our rights of our citizens of New
 
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we can't do it and so in
 
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
the end I'm asking you to itl this Bill
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this witness
 
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.750 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this witness
representative

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:20:08.149 --> 00:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
Perez thank you thanks for taking my
 
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
question do you think
 
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
if municipalities or whatever people
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
were more
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
transparent and better about answering
 
00:20:22.029 --> 00:20:22.039 align:start position:0%
requests there would be a lot less
 
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:26.440 align:start position:0%
91a because I know people in my town
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
have asked for information
 
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
maybe because I'm a rep they're pretty
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
good about giving it to me but they
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
don't get it and that's why they file a
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
91a and that this would hurt those
 
00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:42.919 align:start position:0%
people whereas if the town was just more
 
00:20:45.149 --> 00:20:45.159 align:start position:0%
transparent and said yes I can get that
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
information for you you wouldn't even
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
have to file a 91a your
 
00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
thoughts I think it depends on the
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
municip municipality or the school
 
00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
district I mean some municip ality no
 
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
matter what you ask them you get the
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
information and the next municipality it
 
00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
might be so political that they don't
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
want to give out information I look at
 
00:21:09.789 --> 00:21:09.799 align:start position:0%
life this way and this is just my
 
00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
opinion if they don't want to give out
 
00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
information what are they trying to hide
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
that's just
 
00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
me other questions for this witness all
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much representative
 
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
Andrew all right uh next I'm going to
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
call on uh representative Michael K
 
00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:34.549 align:start position:0%
call on uh representative Michael K
pleas

00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for the record my
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
name is Michael Cahill I represent the
 
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:40.360 align:start position:0%
towns of newfields and New Market in
 
00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 10 and I'm a co-sponsor of
 
00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
this bill as are so many other people
 
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
listed at the top they've almost run out
 
00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:50.919 align:start position:0%
of room uh and they're co-sponsoring
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
because this is an issue that does
 
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
affect taxpayers uh residents and VAR
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
many communities uh who are asked to pay
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
for legal costs cost of of producing
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
information often times uh it's
 
00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
weaponized the the right to no law is
 
00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:11.799 align:start position:0%
weaponized so as to inflict cost and and
 
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
uh it said Vendetta against a perceived
 
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
grievance you know to address a
 
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
perceived grievance
 
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
um in my community we had The Misfortune
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
of uh having a a disgruntled former
 
00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
employee set set his sights upon uh New
 
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
Market and every every current and and
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh future superintendent school board
 
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
member because the person lost his job
 
00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
he went to the uh um uh public Labor
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
Relations Board lost there and took 91a
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
as his Avenue of
 
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:50.200 align:start position:0%
Revenge and this is not the routine this
 
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
is not how the the law was intended to
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
be used it was intended for citizens to
 
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
gather information that they that they
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
feel is uh
 
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:01.240 align:start position:0%
unavailable otherwise and for the
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities to provide it uh which I
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
think is a normal normal occurrence and
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
now if there are people who uh uh ask
 
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
for qu ask for information and don't
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
receive it promptly uh maybe they need
 
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
to make uh not request everything quite
 
00:23:17.679 --> 00:23:18.470 align:start position:0%
to make uh not request everything quite
so

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
broadly uh all the rec all the emails
 
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
ever sent to and from anyone in the in
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
the municipality or school or or super
 
00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.390 align:start position:0%
the municipality or school or or super
us

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
um or School District you know it's it's
 
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
a bit
 
00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:37.400 align:start position:0%
excessive um hypothetically
 
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
hypothetically now what if a person were
 
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
what if a person uh were not satisfied
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
with the information they were getting
 
00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:47.240 align:start position:0%
and understood that they were costing
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
the district a quite a quite a bit of
 
00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
money said to them uh well you know I
 
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
know you're you may be getting weary of
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
this and and I could use a little
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
money and would that what would that
 
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
would that be construed as some sort of
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
coercion uh
 
00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.830 align:start position:0%
coercion uh
extortion

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
extortion
 
00:24:08.909 --> 00:24:08.919 align:start position:0%
blackmail intimidation is that is that
 
00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:11.720 align:start position:0%
uh legal and and just for questioning
 
00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:13.799 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing just for raising that
 
00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
point uh this might lead to a whole
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
search of uh law enforcement uh emails
 
00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
and uh records and time sheets and all
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
manner of things in order to inflict
 
00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:31.240 align:start position:0%
cost on the on the community now we
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
worried about taxpayers being able to
 
00:24:35.789 --> 00:24:35.799 align:start position:0%
afford to pay $25 in the event that
 
00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
their request takes more than 10 hours
 
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:41.240 align:start position:0%
we have taxpayers paying uh the cost of
 
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
these sometimes frivolous requests and
 
00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
this money would obviously be going
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
toward other uh uh purposes that are
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
benefit to the community uh speaking of
 
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
communities I know we had we had an
 
00:24:57.870 --> 00:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
email from someone talking about how uh
 
00:25:00.029 --> 00:25:00.039 align:start position:0%
V there's a ruling in Virginia that
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
their uh that their rights to no request
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
are only for citizens of Virginia our
 
00:25:06.669 --> 00:25:06.679 align:start position:0%
law does not is not that specific it's
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
citizens of the world I don't know so we
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
do get requests from all over the
 
00:25:15.149 --> 00:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
country asking for for the curricula uh
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
in in the public school and why is that
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
of interest to someone in Las Vegas or
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
usbekistan or
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
anywhere uh so that the law it's a good
 
00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
law but it has has been weaponized and
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
it needs a bit of Revision in order to
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
pull in the scope and to make it a more
 
00:25:36.669 --> 00:25:36.679 align:start position:0%
userfriendly uh more
 
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
accommodating uh law when needed and and
 
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
it may not be that it's needed all the
 
00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:44.799 align:start position:0%
time if you simply say i' like this
 
00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
information and the clerk says it's on
 
00:25:49.389 --> 00:25:49.399 align:start position:0%
this website and this here's the page
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
here's the link to it you don't need to
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
file a right to no request if you ask
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
for something and you feel the person is
 
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh not giving you exactly what what
 
00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
you want then you can do the right to no
 
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
request but again ask for what you want
 
00:26:05.389 --> 00:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
and and I know we don't we can't ask why
 
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
so it's not on a need to know basis is I
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
want to know so uh I support the bill
 
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
and I I hope that uh the committee will
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
work hard to make any necessary changes
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
but in the end do something because we
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
have we have a serious problem we may
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
not the communities may not want to
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
advertise just how much this is costing
 
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
them so is not to incentivize further uh
 
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.549 align:start position:0%
them so is not to incentivize further uh
frivolous

00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:32.559 align:start position:0%
frivolous
 
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
requests that concludes my testimony
 
00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this witness
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative Perez thank you thanks
 
00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question is the example
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
you gave the exception or the
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
rule uh well I'm looking at the number
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
of co-sponsors here and I'm thinking
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's a l it's not quite the exception
 
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
and nor the rule but it's frequent
 
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:55.480 align:start position:0%
enough to bring in uh members of the
 
00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
other body who uh I think were were
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
interested in this issue for some time
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
and uh it's a bipartisan concern so I
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say that it's the exception and
 
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't say it's the rule but it does
 
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
happen other questions for this follow
 
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
yeah would you be comfortable if the
 
00:27:19.149 --> 00:27:19.159 align:start position:0%
rule or the the amendment said
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
for Citizens or companies outside of New
 
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire charge the companies that want
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
big stuff and not charge the citizen
 
00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:33.919 align:start position:0%
would would something like that appeal
 
00:27:36.029 --> 00:27:36.039 align:start position:0%
to you
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh I I think there may still be citizens
 
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
who would in fact abuse the the law so I
 
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
I think a fee you know when something
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
costs there there are costs involved and
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
to recover a small portion of the cost
 
00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
uh I think is reasonable I I do see I
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
did hear that the you know the
 
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
the concern about sh and May and and you
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
know could it be this way and that way
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
you know you're try if you're trying to
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
do enabling
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
legislation you know you don't want to
 
00:28:09.389 --> 00:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
say shall but you want to say that you
 
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
may do it but the degree to which you do
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
it or how you're do it in the
 
00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:15.919 align:start position:0%
community it gets a little it gets a
 
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
little challenging there I do think the
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
idea of saying shall uh establish a
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
policy and have it consistent I think
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
that could that could be a step although
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
I heard a something about indigence and
 
00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:30.919 align:start position:0%
can you make an exception but you have
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
to be careful making an exception
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
because it might be
 
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
discriminatory the law is uh as some of
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
you know uh very difficult to uh design
 
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
and Implement and and
 
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
follow other questions for this
 
00:28:49.389 --> 00:28:49.399 align:start position:0%

would good morning Mr chairman members
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
of the Judiciary
 
00:29:31.149 --> 00:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
Committee got a lot of documents here
 
00:29:32.669 --> 00:29:32.679 align:start position:0%
and I'm not going to read them to you
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
this is just for show this is a partial
 
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
right to no request and I'm I'm a
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
mechanic by trade so I'm going to just
 
00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
give you a couple examples of what I've
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
been through in Rochester and why the
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
right to noar it's good to hear the
 
00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:50.519 align:start position:0%
questioning because several of you know
 
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
how valuable the right to noar is and
 
00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
with newspapers going out it's becoming
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's St starting to fall more and more
 
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:01.480 align:start position:0%
on the citizen to keep their government
 
00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
accountable and right now if we find a
 
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:05.720 align:start position:0%
problem with the right to no law we've
 
00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:08.039 align:start position:0%
got to take him to court and that can
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
cost up to
 
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
$450 if you represent yourself and I
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
understand that the city of Rochester is
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
taking the Rochester voice to court over
 
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
an issue of what who is a citizen and
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
the county of marac waved the fee to the
 
00:30:27.549 --> 00:30:27.559 align:start position:0%
city so the can cities take people Court
 
00:30:30.029 --> 00:30:30.039 align:start position:0%
over the right to know and at no cost
 
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
and citizens they have to pay
 
00:30:36.509 --> 00:30:36.519 align:start position:0%
$450 is that right you know that that's
 
00:30:38.669 --> 00:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
what I heard and the the editor of the
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
Rochester voice is here today and I'll
 
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
say I count on his blog if you will a
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
newspaper to get my information on
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the city and I'll
 
00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
share with you how important the right
 
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
to olar is from past experience in
 
00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
2010 the city of Rochester brought
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
forward a comprehensive resoning 132
 
00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.750 align:start position:0%
forward a comprehensive resoning 132
page

00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:31:02.509 --> 00:31:02.519 align:start position:0%
document they worked on it for almost 9
 
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
years they couldn't provide any minutes
 
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
to any meetings that they had in those
 
00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
nine years to discuss the comprehensive
 
00:31:14.669 --> 00:31:14.679 align:start position:0%
resoning I took that to the at the time
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
the state had redress grievances
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
committee and we had eight or nine hours
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
of testimony the city's excuse was we
 
00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
never had a quorum so we never had a
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
meeting and I said then how did did this
 
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
132 page document come where did this
 
00:31:32.669 --> 00:31:32.679 align:start position:0%
come from if you never met so they
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
finally admitted that they were wrong
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
and as a result they had to do it over
 
00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:39.039 align:start position:0%
and it took them three more years to do
 
00:31:41.389 --> 00:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
it over but when they did it over they
 
00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:44.679 align:start position:0%
had public hearings they had minutes and
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
the citizens got to see what was going
 
00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:49.519 align:start position:0%
on and it made a change and a lot of
 
00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
stuff was changed that's one example now
 
00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:55.799 align:start position:0%

right to0 request to the city City and
 
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:00.679 align:start position:0%

15th to September 15
 
00:32:40.029 --> 00:32:40.039 align:start position:0%
2023 um what I got was a catch initially
 
00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
within 10 days I got a small maybe six
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
or seven pieces one of the things I was
 
00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:49.240 align:start position:0%
looking for is a a man died on Main
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
Street in
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
Rochester he was on a motorcycle and he
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
got hit by a car and the the traffic
 
00:32:58.509 --> 00:32:58.519 align:start position:0%
lights were not functioning and they
 
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
hadn't been for some time and trying to
 
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
find out what the heck happened and what
 
00:33:05.629 --> 00:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
the city was doing about it I'm on
 
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:07.519 align:start position:0%
public works and highways committee I
 
00:33:10.269 --> 00:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to be able to compare so I got a
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
a small amount of information $3 worth
 
00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
and it had the dispatch and it had one
 
00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
Memo from the uh uh though I just got
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
dispatched at that time and in dispatch
 
00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
several of the people called and said
 
00:33:25.629 --> 00:33:25.639 align:start position:0%
there's going to be an accident you got
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
to do something about these law
 
00:33:31.149 --> 00:33:31.159 align:start position:0%
so then I made a WR to all request and
 
00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
then uh the city provided 339
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
pages but I didn't get these till
 
00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
November and I filed the request October
 
00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
10th so I paid $42 for and this 332
 
00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
pages but if it was a book it would be
 
00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:52.039 align:start position:0%
twice as many
 
00:33:54.389 --> 00:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
pages and it wouldn't be a bestseller I
 
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
can assure you of that so they said well
 
00:33:58.509 --> 00:33:58.519 align:start position:0%
we've got more information coming for
 
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
you I said Okay I want it so I got
 
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
another uh 902
 
00:34:07.389 --> 00:34:07.399 align:start position:0%
pages and and this amount just covered
 
00:34:10.349 --> 00:34:10.359 align:start position:0%
from August 15th to August
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
24th and the rest of it was from August
 
00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:17.960 align:start position:0%
25th to September 15 902 Pages or
 
00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
1,800 uh uh 92 or 1800 pages so a total
 
00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
of 2500 pages I got and several of them
 
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
that I got were just email warnings they
 
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
had you know nothing on them one or two
 
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
sentences I was charged 10 cents a page
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
for that copy this amount of pages I
 
00:34:38.669 --> 00:34:38.679 align:start position:0%
paid for cost me half of what I get paid
 
00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
as a state representative to get this
 
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
information and that's that's kind of
 
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
what's going on here in the city so to
 
00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
get to the bill when you say things like
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
in an estimate of the cost of making
 
00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
that record available if a charge would
 
00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
be incurred in Rochester you've got a
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
City attorney who can charge billable
 
00:35:02.349 --> 00:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
hours to to Citizens trying to get
 
00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:04.839 align:start position:0%
information and it you could very easily
 
00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
with what you've seen here he could
 
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
easily run into 10 hours so you ask for
 
00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
$250 that's you can't have that you
 
00:35:19.069 --> 00:35:19.079 align:start position:0%
can't have that not in the right to know
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
because it's going to be the citizens of
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
the first line of defense to find out
 
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
what their government's up to Foster's
 
00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
Daily Democrat was a a very well- noted
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
paper and I talked to a a editorial
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
manager he worked there in the 70s and '
 
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:38.200 align:start position:0%
80s he said we had 44 reporters back
 
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
then you're lucky if there's four now so
 
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
what's going to get out there about
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
stuff that's going
 
00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
on and uh you know I I I'll give you an
 
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
example some questions I asked and how
 
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
they reply to it because I think it's
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
important a request this was the
 
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
December 11th 20 uh 23 request I made I
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to know more about the right to
 
00:36:00.309 --> 00:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
know and Rochester to find out because
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
we're hearing all these cities are
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed they can't keep up blah blah
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
blah all these requests so I asked all
 
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:09.880 align:start position:0%
government documents emails regarding
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
the cost of Personnel hours travel
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
research and any other cost and or
 
00:36:17.309 --> 00:36:17.319 align:start position:0%
payments made associated with the right
 
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
to know on budsman case between the city
 
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
and the Rochester voice and any further
 
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
actions and cost on this issue to date
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
now the Rochester voice is here he took
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
the city to court with the Ombudsman in
 
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
a very interesting
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
case uh what the City attorney his
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
response to my that right to no request
 
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
was no governmental records exist
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
responsive to this request he doesn't
 
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
know how much it cost for him and his
 
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
assistant to go Testify the UN budsman
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't know how much research cost and
 
00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:53.240 align:start position:0%
this is the guy that will be making
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
estimates for this bill that you're
 
00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
bringing forward so the second request
 
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
made to the city for this calendar year
 
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:02.839 align:start position:0%
these government records uh I ask for
 
00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:04.359 align:start position:0%
all right to no requests made to the
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
city for this calendar year to date
 
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
these governmental records are not
 
00:37:10.829 --> 00:37:10.839 align:start position:0%
readily available for inspection the
 
00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
city requires 30 days to compile the
 
00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
governmental records and prepare them
 
00:37:19.109 --> 00:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
for public inspection 30 days you don't
 
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
think they can find 10 billable hours in
 
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
30 days ladies and gentlemen this is
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
what we're look this is what we're
 
00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
facing and the third request the total
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
cost of the legal department for this
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
calendar year for handling processing
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
and answering all right to no request
 
00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
submitted to the city his reply no
 
00:37:41.069 --> 00:37:41.079 align:start position:0%
governmental records exist responsive to
 
00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:43.640 align:start position:0%
this request and this gentleman has done
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
this repeatedly to write to no request
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
that's the first line of defense no
 
00:37:50.309 --> 00:37:50.319 align:start position:0%
government records
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
exist I had an issue where the city did
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
Capital reserves and the amount of the
 
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
three of them in the amount of million5
 
00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
500,000 for each I asked the the uh city
 
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
under the right to know it had been a
 
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
while since it was voted on I did not
 
00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
see the money get transferred to the
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
trustees of the trust fund I asked under
 
00:38:12.589 --> 00:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
the right to know where is that money
 
00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
where is that million five and I got the
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
request no no government records exist
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
on that and I I had to argue with them I
 
00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
said well they got to exist because the
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
state law says the treasurer shall have
 
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
accounting of all monies at all times
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
so they got to know where that million
 
00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:31.240 align:start position:0%
five is and I want to know where it is
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
and then they change their tune and this
 
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
is what you dealing with when you get
 
00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
to having
 
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
somebody figure out billable hours and
 
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
the other thing is allowing them to
 
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
change what you're asking for by
 
00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
allowing them to to uh as as the bill
 
00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:54.200 align:start position:0%
said allowing them to I'm paraphrasing
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
to work with you to adjust it well how
 
00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
what's to say they don't adjust it so
 
00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
they don't give you what you want and
 
00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
they change it to something else and
 
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
then if you don't agree with them then
 
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
you got to go to court the only
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
resolution to the right to know is to
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
take them to
 
00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:13.720 align:start position:0%
court that's all you can do and uh the
 
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
Rochester voice again I count on him for
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
information and the problem he had with
 
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
the uh and I hope you guys address this
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
is a word Citizen and the Ombudsman in
 
00:39:27.069 --> 00:39:27.079 align:start position:0%
his in his uh ruling he's felt that the
 
00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:29.720 align:start position:0%
Rochester voice had standing and he
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned in there how it doesn't matter
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
anybody can ask for information and get
 
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
it and that was in the ruling and he
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
cited a case I think from 2018 of the
 
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court that had that his an email
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
he sent December 28th and the Rochester
 
00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:49.400 align:start position:0%

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
which is the city clerk's office and the
 
00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
city attorney's office their budget is
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
$2.4 million a
 
00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
year if they're having trouble getting
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%

all the material that was given to you
 
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
by the city of Rochester did you find
 
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
the information you were looking for
 
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
about this much but I didn't know I was
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
just one memo explaining the accident
 
00:42:14.829 --> 00:42:14.839 align:start position:0%
that I didn't get I asked for uh uh um
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
standard operating procedure for the
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
city when there were traffic issues when
 
00:42:20.589 --> 00:42:20.599 align:start position:0%
there were roads out and stuff I never
 
00:42:23.549 --> 00:42:23.559 align:start position:0%
got that basically what I got I got 30
 
00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
pages of uh quick claim deeds I got
 
00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
multiple copies of the same thing I got
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh multiple pages with just one sentence
 
00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:35.480 align:start position:0%
an email email warning on them so I got
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of it was waste I'd say
 
00:42:41.549 --> 00:42:41.559 align:start position:0%
maybe out of maybe out of uh 1,400 pages
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
I might have got 120 that I had interest
 
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
in that weren't directly I got dates
 
00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
that weren't were relevant to what I
 
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
asked for and on and on so what if we're
 
00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
going to pay them to do research and
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
this is an example of the research
 
00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
you're doing it it's it's bad it's bad
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
may I follow up yes please thank you so
 
00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:03.400 align:start position:0%
then um you mentioned some dates uh
 
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
towards the end of 2023 you said
 
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
December 11th and you made some um
 
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
requests in the month of December did
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
you do more than one during that month
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
did I do what did you do more than one
 
00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
right to know request within no I did
 
00:43:19.069 --> 00:43:19.079 align:start position:0%
that in response to what I got from the
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
other ones it usually when you do a
 
00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
right to0 request it leads to more
 
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
questions because you get information
 
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
that you you in the right to no request
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
you're you're asking for something you
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
don't have the documents in front of so
 
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
you don't know exactly what you're going
 
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
to get until they give it to you all
 
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
right thank you y thank you other
 
00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
representative stapled thank you for
 
00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
um this bill does it answer the needs uh
 
00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
or some of the needs that you've
 
00:43:52.829 --> 00:43:52.839 align:start position:0%
described here or not uh what's your
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
position on that I don't support this
 
00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
bill at all because I feel it weakens
 
00:43:58.589 --> 00:43:58.599 align:start position:0%
the right to no
 
00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
law thank you and I think the right to
 
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
no law is very important right other
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness all right
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much sir
 
00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:11.549 --> 00:44:11.559 align:start position:0%
um next I'm gonna
 
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh oh yes I'm G to call on
 
00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
please and you know just just uh we have
 
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
a number of other Witnesses who wish to
 
00:44:26.549 --> 00:44:26.559 align:start position:0%
testify and obviously we're running late
 
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
which is fine but I just ask you to
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
everyone to please keep your testimony
 
00:44:33.309 --> 00:44:33.319 align:start position:0%
to about 3 minutes or so I I wasn't
 
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
planning on testifying at all Mr
 
00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
chairman but I sat in the room listen to
 
00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
this I'm representative Chuck Rassy I
 
00:44:41.549 --> 00:44:41.559 align:start position:0%
represented Rochester wood4 and um I
 
00:44:43.829 --> 00:44:43.839 align:start position:0%
will tell you that uh I co-sponsored
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
this bill and one of the reasons why I
 
00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored this bill is because when I
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
um heard talk about a bill coming in to
 
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
deal with this issue with uh what we
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
call dilatory request under the right to
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
no law I was talking to with members of
 
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
the school department and they have
 
00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
actually a file draw which has dozens
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
and dozens and dozens of thumb drives
 
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
and files paper files probably thousands
 
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:07.480 align:start position:0%
of pages which have been requested and
 
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
never picked
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
up so this is you know that's a
 
00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:14.079 align:start position:0%
obviously request that was made just to
 
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
waste people's time having worked in
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
municipal government for quite a number
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
of years as well I know that when you
 
00:45:22.109 --> 00:45:22.119 align:start position:0%
get a right to no request you make every
 
00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
effort you can to get it and then you
 
00:45:25.549 --> 00:45:25.559 align:start position:0%
get a question you get a request which
 
00:45:25.559 --> 00:45:26.589 align:start position:0%
get a question you get a request which
is

00:45:26.589 --> 00:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:45:28.829 --> 00:45:28.839 align:start position:0%
maybe not specific to something but but
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
very vague and you try to answer as best
 
00:45:33.309 --> 00:45:33.319 align:start position:0%
you can can and you get three more
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
requests because you didn't answer it
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
the way they wanted you to answer it and
 
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
and and I think that that's what we see
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
a lot and particularly in Rochester I
 
00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
will tell you having served on the city
 
00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:43.640 align:start position:0%
council there for over 30 years and been
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
a state representative there for 18
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
years I will tell you that the people in
 
00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
the city of Rochester work hard we have
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
fewer staff than most other communities
 
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
of similar size and I the the members of
 
00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
the city clerk's office who put this in
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
information together do the best they
 
00:45:59.950 --> 00:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
can I know that they've moved a lot of
 
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
stuff over to the attorney's office
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
because a lot of the requests that have
 
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
been dilatory and have been just to take
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
up your time uh the requests many times
 
00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
are vague you try to answer them uh and
 
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not accepted so you get
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
more requests and a lot of times these
 
00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
requests that come in that when people
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
don't even come and pick up the
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
information so you know that this is a
 
00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
problem and it's something that
 
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
certainly has to be done dealt with I
 
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
would be happy to tell you the story
 
00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
that representative Newton addressed as
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
far as the the zoning requirements we
 
00:46:34.349 --> 00:46:34.359 align:start position:0%
actually had a subcommittee and
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
interesting thing it was the gentleman I
 
00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
ran against in the two Thai elections
 
00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
that I just had he and I were two
 
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
members of the five members of that
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
committee Mr Newton was a third member
 
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
of that committee we never could get a
 
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
quorum so we basically worked on it
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
between the two of us and when they were
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
you know we got 5 years down the road we
 
00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
said hey look we've been waiting long
 
00:46:54.309 --> 00:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
enough here's the work that we have but
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
we were never able to get a quorum at
 
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
any of our meetings so we never had
 
00:46:58.670 --> 00:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
minutes if you don't have a quorum you
 
00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:01.480 align:start position:0%
don't have a meeting so but the thing is
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
is that sometimes the the questions are
 
00:47:08.549 --> 00:47:08.559 align:start position:0%
vague for a reason because they just
 
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
want to take up your time thank you Mr
 
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
shamman thank you uh questions for this
 
00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:17.240 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
um next I'm going to call on Susan Rice
 
00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
please and I'm gonna uh ask you to
 
00:47:26.829 --> 00:47:26.839 align:start position:0%
please limit your remarks to 3 minutes
 
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
cuz we do have a lot of witnesses and I
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
want to get through everybody thank you
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
and I will try to honor your request
 
00:47:37.309 --> 00:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Susan Rice I reside at
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
1591 Rod Road in Rochester New Hampshire
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
I had a career in public service I was
 
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
an employee I've also been an elected
 
00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
and appointed official and now a
 
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
resident and business owner in Rochester
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
an opportunity of a lifetime occurred at
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
the age of 18 to testify in Superior
 
00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:55.480 align:start position:0%
Court in the total I have been involved
 
00:47:58.710 --> 00:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
in four major land use court cases I do
 
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
owe my education to Attorney Peter
 
00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:03.160 align:start position:0%
Laughlin and attorney SAR calman they
 
00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:10.109 --> 00:48:10.119 align:start position:0%
91a and it was reinforced with the
 
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
attorney general's memo of March 20th
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
2015 the schooling I received allowed
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
one particular businessman and also
 
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
several other businessmen to continue
 
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
their business operations because I was
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
able to give them information under 91a
 
00:48:26.829 --> 00:48:26.839 align:start position:0%
requests that is what is called Public
 
00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
Service the New Hampshire Constitution
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
and the right of right to no law ensure
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
that the public has reasonable access to
 
00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
meetings of public bodies and to
 
00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:39.640 align:start position:0%
governmental records in 1976 the people
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire amended our
 
00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional government therefore it
 
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
should be open accessible accountable
 
00:48:47.069 --> 00:48:47.079 align:start position:0%
and responsive and to that end the
 
00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
Public's right of access to governmental
 
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
proceedings and Records shall not be
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
unreasonably restricted the RSA is clear
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
on this subject and I'm going to skip
 
00:48:58.109 --> 00:48:58.119 align:start position:0%
ahead head so that you can get more of a
 
00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
perspective of what I've recently gone
 
00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:03.640 align:start position:0%
through in Rochester I recently
 
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
requested informational exchanges
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
emails from the mayor to a city employee
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
for a period of 30
 
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
days in the end I received
 
00:49:20.349 --> 00:49:20.359 align:start position:0%
198 Pages some double-sided some knot
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
and was charged for
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
448 Pages or
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
$488 cents ironically this was nothing
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
more than an absolute pile of bull
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
 and 99% of it was not what I had
 
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
asked for completely off topic the same
 
00:49:41.309 --> 00:49:41.319 align:start position:0%
request was placed by another person and
 
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
that person received approximately 60
 
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
pages of information he requested I
 
00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
received from the city attorney excuses
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
of malfunctioning computer software an
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
excuse of 30 to 45 days after the
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
information download to review for
 
00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
redaction and what I've seen so far
 
00:50:00.789 --> 00:50:00.799 align:start position:0%
there is not one redaction in this and
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
most infuriating I only received 198
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
Pages many of which were single-sided
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
this is clearly an excellent example of
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
incompetence by a highly educated fool a
 
00:50:15.789 --> 00:50:15.799 align:start position:0%
public body or agency may suggest to the
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
requestor a reasonable modification of
 
00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
request these visions of our
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
Constitution and RSA 91a are intended to
 
00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:31.079 align:start position:0%
provide the utmost information to the
 
00:50:32.789 --> 00:50:32.799 align:start position:0%
people about what their government is
 
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
doing while preserving individual rights
 
00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
to privacy something I value very highly
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court has
 
00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
recognized that the right to no law
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
helps to carry out the Constitution's
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
requirement you know what Ram you've
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
arrived at the three minute Mark so I'm
 
00:50:50.349 --> 00:50:50.359 align:start position:0%
going to ask you to please sum up oh

okay my next sentence you cannot fix
 
00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
stupid in my recent encounter with the
 
00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
city attorney and I would not trust him
 
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
to ask me for a summary of what I would
 
00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
need thank you very much questions for
 
00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:03.150 align:start position:0%
need thank you very much questions for
this

this
 
00:51:05.549 --> 00:51:05.559 align:start position:0%
witness being none thank you very much
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:24.359 --> 00:51:26.069 align:start position:0%
 
pet

00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
pet
 
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes um if the witness has
 
00:51:31.789 --> 00:51:31.799 align:start position:0%
written testimony knowing that we will
 
00:51:35.309 --> 00:51:35.319 align:start position:0%
read that testimony could you ask him to
 
00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
just give us the highlights and not read
 
00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:39.880 align:start position:0%
that thank you no that's a very good
 
00:51:41.549 --> 00:51:41.559 align:start position:0%
suggestion thank you I'm I'm sure Mr
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
biset will will keep his remarks within
 
00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
the time thank you absolutely I know uh
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
I know I know the committee's already
 
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
running over uh jel Binet legal director
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
of the ACLU of New Hampshire strongly in
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
opposition uh to this legis ation um I
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
do want to be very clear and I know this
 
00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
goes back to the representative
 
00:52:02.109 --> 00:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
statements about the the little guy how
 
00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
would this impact regular requesters
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
this would have a direct impact on
 
00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%
regular requesters and it would deter uh
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
I think even um modest requests because
 
00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
what I think was generally going to
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
happen if this bill is passed you put a
 
00:52:18.789 --> 00:52:18.799 align:start position:0%
request in there'll be General
 
00:52:20.829 --> 00:52:20.839 align:start position:0%
overestimates concerning how long things
 
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
will take which we already see right now
 
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
we see overestimates concerning how long
 
00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
documents will take from a response time
 
00:52:29.309 --> 00:52:29.319 align:start position:0%
perspective to be delivered and this
 
00:52:31.549 --> 00:52:31.559 align:start position:0%
will just pile on that level of
 
00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:33.640 align:start position:0%
uncertainty you'll be told things may
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
take 10 20 30 hours and what that will
 
00:52:38.549 --> 00:52:38.559 align:start position:0%
do is even if it's a modest request it
 
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
will deter the requestor from moving
 
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
forward because they know gosh I'm going
 
00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
to get a bill for several hundred doll
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
and that is incredibly problematic so I
 
00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
just want to be very clear I know the
 
00:52:52.109 --> 00:52:52.119 align:start position:0%
intent behind this bill is to kind of
 
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
get at overb you know requests that are
 
00:52:57.549 --> 00:52:57.559 align:start position:0%
perceived as over broad this is not just
 
00:52:59.230 --> 00:52:59.240 align:start position:0%
going to address those requests it's
 
00:53:01.589 --> 00:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
going to address even modded requests
 
00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
and it goes so far as to even bill for
 
00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
things like redactions I could just tell
 
00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
you as someone that makes frequent
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
requests I get things that are heavily
 
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
redacted that I think are incredibly
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
problematic and that's because sometimes
 
00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
not always but sometimes there are some
 
00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
overzealous assertions of exemptions and
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
as a requester why should I have to pay
 
00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
for that overzealous assertion of an
 
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
exemption through redactions that's
 
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
exact ly what would happen here and of
 
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
course too what this bill would do is
 
00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:31.960 align:start position:0%
put the burden on requesters to pay for
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
bad document retention policies that
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
cities and towns may have you're now
 
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
having to pay um Municipal actors to go
 
00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:41.720 align:start position:0%
get documents that may be hard to find
 
00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:43.160 align:start position:0%
but maybe they shouldn't be hard to find
 
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
if you had better practices so I think
 
00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:47.720 align:start position:0%
this is this is problematic on multiple
 
00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
levels as echoed in my uh testimony I
 
00:53:52.270 --> 00:53:52.280 align:start position:0%
think it's over Brad in many ways
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
there's no indigency uh exception it's
 
00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
not limited to commercial reasons I know
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
it was one of the rationals proposed for
 
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
the law it's not limited to out ofate
 
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
persons none of those limitations should
 
00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
be in the bill anyway um but I just
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
think that highlights uh the over breath
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
of this legislation and I I think the
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
Deep harm it would do to transparency
 
00:54:11.309 --> 00:54:11.319 align:start position:0%
and accountability and I genuinely
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
believe that thank you questions for
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
this WT yes representative Alexander um
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
my question thank you um my my concern
 
00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
is along the same lines it's the
 
00:54:23.309 --> 00:54:23.319 align:start position:0%
discriminatory practice and I guess I'm
 
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
wondering if the ACLU has any sort of
 
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
um information on how other states have
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
if they have a law like this in place if
 
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
they do and then how they've navigated
 
00:54:36.589 --> 00:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
that sort of concern I have regarding um
 
00:54:38.589 --> 00:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
discriminatory practice and I know on
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
the my second question is I know on the
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
last page you have um a fee waver for
 
00:54:44.829 --> 00:54:44.839 align:start position:0%
indigents and I know there's um some
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
states that charge coffee costs but not
 
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:49.240 align:start position:0%
staff costs I guess I'm wondering like
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
if you have suggested language on
 
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
indigency too yeah I I don't I haven't
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
done a 50 state survey to be BL
 
00:54:58.030 --> 00:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
um I I also want to be honest there are
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
there are some states that do this right
 
00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
that charge for labor costs um and there
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
are many states like New Hampshire
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
currently that do not and I think we
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
should stay where we are so there are
 
00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:11.720 align:start position:0%
states kind of all over the map on this
 
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh but with we are surrounded by some
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
neighboring states frankly that do
 
00:55:17.549 --> 00:55:17.559 align:start position:0%
charge labor costs and I think
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
transparency has probably suffered as a
 
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
result if you talk to some of the
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
Advocates there so I don't think we
 
00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:25.240 align:start position:0%
should copy that policy from from other
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
states and let's keep you know a good
 
00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:30.200 align:start position:0%
part of our law intact and in fact I
 
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
would argue that there are many other
 
00:55:33.150 --> 00:55:33.160 align:start position:0%
ways we should be making this law better
 
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
not worse other questions for this
 
00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative Perez thank
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
you thanks for taking my question so am
 
00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
I hearing you say that you believe the
 
00:55:45.029 --> 00:55:45.039 align:start position:0%
right to L law should be the right to
 
00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
low law as it exists and not the right
 
00:55:51.029 --> 00:55:51.039 align:start position:0%
to know if you can afford it absolutely
 
00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you other questions for
 
00:55:55.150 --> 00:55:55.160 align:start position:0%
this witness Mr chair yes yes
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
representative dorenzo uh thank you for
 
00:55:59.549 --> 00:55:59.559 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you so um could
 
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
you please tell me um overall we know
 
00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:07.160 align:start position:0%
that there are people that abuse the law
 
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
um but then there are also honest
 
00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:11.839 align:start position:0%
Earnest people so how do you balance all
 
00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:13.960 align:start position:0%
of that yeah I you know I actually think
 
00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
in many ways though it's not really
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
hasn't been reflected in the prior
 
00:56:19.789 --> 00:56:19.799 align:start position:0%
testimony I think we actually have on
 
00:56:22.029 --> 00:56:22.039 align:start position:0%
this front with respect to costs a good
 
00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:25.160 align:start position:0%
balance there are still costs that think
 
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
that requesters have to bear in terms of
 
00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
copy costs that is a real cost and I do
 
00:56:32.109 --> 00:56:32.119 align:start position:0%
think even today that probably provides
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
some sort of filtering mechanism here
 
00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
those costs can be as little as you can
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
get it for free some municipalities
 
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
permit it some 5 10 cents some upwards
 
00:56:43.789 --> 00:56:43.799 align:start position:0%
of a dollar and the court has recognized
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
that those costs um are are not
 
00:56:49.029 --> 00:56:49.039 align:start position:0%
unreasonable so I do think that is one
 
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
current mechanism we have where
 
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
requesters still actually have some sort
 
00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
of skin in the game and of course
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
they're always are the provisions of RSA
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
918 that um if the request is frivolous
 
00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
and there's ultimate litigation they
 
00:57:04.829 --> 00:57:04.839 align:start position:0%
themselves would have to pay uh costs to
 
00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities so I think a lot of that
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
is built in there are always going to be
 
00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
examples on the margins and I think
 
00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
that's just part of any type of
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
legislative regime and I think we are
 
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
hearing examples of you know what seemed
 
00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
to be pretty excessive I would submit
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
they're in a minority of cases I could
 
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
recite and I wanton today time after
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
time of what I think are excessive
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
misuse of government agencies not biing
 
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
information um and I think that is kind
 
00:57:30.349 --> 00:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
of the nature of the system but I don't
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
want the pendulum to swing towards
 
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
secrecy and that's what this bill would
 
00:57:36.029 --> 00:57:36.039 align:start position:0%
do in my view okay thank you other
 
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness seeing none
 
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much next I'm going to
 
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
Lori AA orano
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.799 --> 00:58:16.789 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
and again ma' I'm just going to ask you
 
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
to limit your remarks to three minutes
 
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
and if you have written testimony we
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
will read it so please don't just read
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
your written testim okay thank you can
 
00:58:28.349 --> 00:58:28.359 align:start position:0%
you hear me yes good I'm going to avoid
 
00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:29.720 align:start position:0%
that and you do have my written
 
00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:31.720 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'll submit it online my
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
name is Lori ortolano I'm from NASA I'm
 
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
a resident of right to know New
 
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in 2023 I was an Honore
 
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
for the nacki lobe uh First Amendment
 
00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:43.720 align:start position:0%
award and um this award was given to me
 
00:58:46.109 --> 00:58:46.119 align:start position:0%
in recognition of the work I had done
 
00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
starting in 2018 using the right to no
 
00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:50.200 align:start position:0%
law to try and deal with assessing
 
00:58:52.589 --> 00:58:52.599 align:start position:0%
issues down in nasua and it was quite a
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
battle um I'm in strong opposition I to
 
00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
this bill um HB 102 for a number of
 
00:59:00.109 --> 00:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
reasons on the surface it appears
 
00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable but um I'm concerned about
 
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
discrimination and retaliation issues
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
that will result in this and the
 
00:59:09.309 --> 00:59:09.319 align:start position:0%
targeting of individuals who are trying
 
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
to uncover wrongdoing that's going on in
 
00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
a municipality Nashua has had a
 
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
four-year history of right to no
 
00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
requests coming in to court with four or
 
00:59:20.789 --> 00:59:20.799 align:start position:0%
five citizens and we've done pretty well
 
00:59:23.069 --> 00:59:23.079 align:start position:0%
in battling the city on these issues
 
00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:25.640 align:start position:0%
most of them prosay
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
um it's very difficult to go into court
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
on your own and try and deal with these
 
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
issues with a um City legal office that
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
is so non-transparent and opposed to
 
00:59:37.870 --> 00:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
working with us and I want to just point
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
out an example of a case that recently
 
00:59:42.510 --> 00:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
occurred to me that I think is exactly
 
00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:44.200 align:start position:0%
the reason I don't want to see fees put
 
00:59:46.990 --> 00:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
in I put in a request his collect video
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
surveillance um footage of me where the
 
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
city was capturing me in City Hall I had
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
requested surveillance video be stored
 
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
on me at certain occasions when the city
 
00:59:58.109 --> 00:59:58.119 align:start position:0%
was trying to bring criminal charges
 
01:00:00.549 --> 01:00:00.559 align:start position:0%
against me for going for information and
 
01:00:02.589 --> 01:00:02.599 align:start position:0%
I got those tapes but I wanted I
 
01:00:04.990 --> 01:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
wondered if they were doing others and I
 
01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
got a response and I wrote my request to
 
01:00:08.829 --> 01:00:08.839 align:start position:0%
say don't provide me with any videos
 
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
that you've already given me I don't
 
01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:12.799 align:start position:0%
want to burden you with volume I got a
 
01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
response back that there was over 15
 
01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
gigs of data and I was really surprised
 
01:00:18.190 --> 01:00:18.200 align:start position:0%
by that I thought wow they're taping me
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
a lot I went to the department knocked
 
01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
on the door was able to get in and said
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
to the clerk you know are these all
 
01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
videos that the city has produced on me
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
she said no there's only one all the
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
others we gave to you and I said well
 
01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
did you repeat and give me all the data
 
01:00:36.029 --> 01:00:36.039 align:start position:0%
you already gave me and she said yes
 
01:00:37.829 --> 01:00:37.839 align:start position:0%
because the administration told us to
 
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
only read the first line of your request
 
01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
and to ignore the rest of it so we
 
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
ignored it that's an act of bad faith
 
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you time and time again I
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
have seen this I want that shut down now
 
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
um um tracking of costs the city early
 
01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
on when I was doing the assessing work
 
01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
was making public announcements that I
 
01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
was costing the city hundreds of
 
01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars the mayor referred
 
01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:05.839 align:start position:0%
to it as a million frustrated by hearing
 
01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
this I put in a right to know get costs
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
what what where are they they had none
 
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
it was an estimate okay there's no
 
01:01:16.589 --> 01:01:16.599 align:start position:0%
tracking at all um when it comes to
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
questions so this city absolutely
 
01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
refuses to reduce the burden if you file
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
a right to know and say would you be
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
willing to work with me to reduce the
 
01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:24.950 align:start position:0%
willing to work with me to reduce the
Bur

01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
Bur
 
01:01:28.109 --> 01:01:28.119 align:start position:0%
their answer is no okay I put in a right
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
to no request to receive emails on a new
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
market tax credit federal transaction
 
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
that was used to build the Performing
 
01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
Art Center in nashwa and I got a
 
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
response back that it would take four
 
01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
years to get them your it was ridiculous
 
01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
I took it into court and the judge
 
01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:47.480 align:start position:0%
Consolidated it into a larger case that
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
took is going to take two years to
 
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
hear I'm done I can't get the records
 
01:01:55.150 --> 01:01:55.160 align:start position:0%
okay at that case is going to cost me
 
01:01:57.870 --> 01:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
$10,000 if these fees that request if
 
01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:00.200 align:start position:0%
you put these fees in line I'm I'm going
 
01:02:02.910 --> 01:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
to be sunk and those emails uncovered
 
01:02:05.069 --> 01:02:05.079 align:start position:0%
some criminal acts that are now before
 
01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:07.720 align:start position:0%
the AG you know you're getting close to
 
01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
your three minute line so I'd ask you to
 
01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:13.799 align:start position:0%
sum up please so um questions the city
 
01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:15.640 align:start position:0%
when we initially started these right to
 
01:02:17.549 --> 01:02:17.559 align:start position:0%
no requests the city said to us they
 
01:02:19.390 --> 01:02:19.400 align:start position:0%
would write back and say could you tell
 
01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:21.160 align:start position:0%
us what you mean by this could you
 
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
explain further they would ask us
 
01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
questions fine you'd write back and say
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
this is what I'm looking for but if we
 
01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
wrote questions back to them and said
 
01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
what do you expect or what's the volume
 
01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
of data it doesn't sound like you're
 
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
summing up ma'am that's I'm I'm summing
 
01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
up just to say that questioning the city
 
01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
to reduce the burden is not a problem is
 
01:02:41.109 --> 01:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
not is not done at all the response back
 
01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:43.480 align:start position:0%
from the city is under RSA 91a we're not
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
required to answer questions so there's
 
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of bad faith and Bad actors down
 
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
in Nashua and I don't believe I'm a bad
 
01:02:52.349 --> 01:02:52.359 align:start position:0%
actor going for data I believe I'm a
 
01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
citizen really trying hard to understand
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
what my government's up to and there's
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
been some things that have not been so
 
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
cool and this kind of legislation is
 
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
going to hurt us I attached to my filing
 
01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
a court order from Judge Temple where he
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
strongly wrote that the city is
 
01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
violating My First Amendment rights that
 
01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:13.240 align:start position:0%
it's not proper that they have to stop
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
doing that and work to fix the problems
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
that was written in July the needle
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
hasn't moved five degrees to correct
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
these issues this legis painful
 
01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much man
 
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
thank you next I'm going to call on
 
01:03:38.029 --> 01:03:38.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
please sorry so I'm a little nervous so
 
01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
I talk fast when I'm nervous so excuse
 
01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:46.599 align:start position:0%
me okay all right so uh thank you for
 
01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:49.160 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak and um for
 
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
contemplating this important matter I
 
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
think it's not an easy thing to
 
01:03:54.990 --> 01:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
contemplate what the right
 
01:03:57.269 --> 01:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
um balances when it comes to the right
 
01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
to know so my name is Shannon Martinez
 
01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:01.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm the town manager in ctie if I
 
01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
had to sum up the way that I spent 2023
 
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
I would say right to nose in the
 
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
weaponization of right to nose in 2023
 
01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
we processed just over 70 right to nose
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
several of the right to knows took over
 
01:04:14.269 --> 01:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
30 hours to process moreover of their 70
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
right to knows several required multiple
 
01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
responses because the community members
 
01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
in question wanted to dialogue and not
 
01:04:23.789 --> 01:04:23.799 align:start position:0%
not to request records themselves so we
 
01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
processed way over the 70 requests 29 of
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
the right to no request we processed
 
01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
were from the same person about the same
 
01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:33.640 align:start position:0%
subject matter I estimate that in 2023 I
 
01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
spent on average 5 hours a week on this
 
01:04:37.269 --> 01:04:37.279 align:start position:0%
person's right to know requests and
 
01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
subsequent emails this is 260 hours or
 
01:04:43.269 --> 01:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
32.5 days I'm the highest paid employee
 
01:04:44.829 --> 01:04:44.839 align:start position:0%
for the town of sentie and that's how I
 
01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
spent one month of my um tenure this
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
year this hardly seems fair to Residents
 
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
who are seeking information on um other
 
01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
matters that they're struggling with
 
01:04:58.069 --> 01:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
concerning serious zoning issues um a
 
01:05:00.829 --> 01:05:00.839 align:start position:0%
junkyard and other community members
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
wanting to move um important issues
 
01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
forward I'm not able to contribute my
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
time to those issues because I have to
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
comply with the rules and regulations as
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
they pertain to
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
91a um I just want to give some
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
illustrative examples to say that the
 
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
right to no requests that we are
 
01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
receiving do not have anything about
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
learning more about what the business of
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
government is doing these right to no
 
01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
requests are asking about how people are
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
talking about them so any and all email
 
01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:29.240 align:start position:0%
correspondents from or to the town
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
manager or select board that has my name
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
that has my name in conjunction with the
 
01:05:35.269 --> 01:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
agenda that has my name in conjunction
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
with the documents my name in
 
01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
conjunction with an attorney or any
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
other that was like one example a second
 
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
example of the same person giv the same
 
01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
right to no request is that in today in
 
01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
isolation or in Combined was my name
 
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
ever used in an email again these are
 
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
not illustrative examples of getting to
 
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
to know the business of government or
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
understanding how the workings of the
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
government is happening I as a general
 
01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:02.200 align:start position:0%
rule have a deep appreciation for the
 
01:06:03.870 --> 01:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
Freedom of Information Act or as we call
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
it the right to know act I'm an advocate
 
01:06:07.269 --> 01:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
of government transparency and deeply
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
believe that residents should have
 
01:06:11.309 --> 01:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
access to the government's records in my
 
01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:13.240 align:start position:0%
time as Town manager we've gone above
 
01:06:16.029 --> 01:06:16.039 align:start position:0%
and beyond to make sure that we are as
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
transparent as we possibly can be all of
 
01:06:20.589 --> 01:06:20.599 align:start position:0%
our meetings are recorded we produce
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
minutes um our Board of Selectmen agenda
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
packets or over 100 Pages often times so
 
01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
it's not that I want to minimize the
 
01:06:32.549 --> 01:06:32.559 align:start position:0%
amount of transparency we have but I
 
01:06:34.829 --> 01:06:34.839 align:start position:0%
would like to see how we could curtail
 
01:06:38.109 --> 01:06:38.119 align:start position:0%
how these um requests are being
 
01:06:41.069 --> 01:06:41.079 align:start position:0%
weaponized the 41 remaining qu requests
 
01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
of the 70 were from two other people and
 
01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
in those requests all they did was
 
01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
riddle um and
 
01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
call um my staff violent and egregious
 
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
allegations and violent names um it
 
01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
creates a truly toxic work environment
 
01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
from the outside coming in and again I
 
01:07:00.269 --> 01:07:00.279 align:start position:0%
don't think that that is what the right
 
01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
to no request is meant to do the right
 
01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
to no request should be us presenting um
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
the documents I personally and my team
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
personally would rather us not have to
 
01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
do the right to no request because we
 
01:07:12.589 --> 01:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
feel like we have a more open dialogue
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
and we can give people the documents
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
that they want if it was more of a given
 
01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
taken not and the right to no request my
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
sense can I just ask you to sum up
 
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
please my sense is when you get to the
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
right to no request you have to comply
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
with 91a specifically but if you can
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
have a conversation with people and get
 
01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
them the documents in a different way
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
you end up having a better relationship
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
with your constituents so for me I think
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
that um I'd like to see us take
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
seriously the $25 rule I would actually
 
01:07:41.549 --> 01:07:41.559 align:start position:0%
like to see you bring down the number of
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
hours that you require I think it's five
 
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
hours and then it's $25 because again
 
01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
we're spending so much time on these
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
request and people are just weaponizing
 
01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
them and attacking and name calling and
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
not getting transparency and not getting
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
down to the business of government all
 
01:07:57.630 --> 01:07:57.640 align:start position:0%
right questions for this
 
01:08:00.549 --> 01:08:00.559 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very
 
01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
much uh next I'm going to call on JD
 
01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
office morning morning Mr chairman
 
01:08:22.269 --> 01:08:22.279 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee I'll
 
01:08:24.829 --> 01:08:24.839 align:start position:0%
I'll be quick um my name is is J Lali I
 
01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
have the pleasure of serving the people
 
01:08:28.189 --> 01:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire as a senior Assistant
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
Attorney General up at the AG's office
 
01:08:32.669 --> 01:08:32.679 align:start position:0%
um Department of Justice is thankful for
 
01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to come here and testify
 
01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
in support of HB uh 10002 Department
 
01:08:40.829 --> 01:08:40.839 align:start position:0%
believes that the implementation of a
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable fee system for large right to
 
01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
no requests supports the spirit and
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
purpose of the right to no law and our
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
state's constitutional principle of
 
01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:49.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable public access to governmental
 
01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
records how does a fee structure do this
 
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
a reasonable fee system can facilitate
 
01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
conversations between State agencies
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
state public bodies and requesters uh
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
sort of as you just heard the last
 
01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
commentator talk about the need for
 
01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:05.719 align:start position:0%
dialogue um a reasonable fee system can
 
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
create greater efficiency in the
 
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
processing and access uh to governmental
 
01:09:13.709 --> 01:09:13.719 align:start position:0%
records and in the rare instance uh a
 
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable fee uh system can
 
01:09:17.789 --> 01:09:17.799 align:start position:0%
disincentivize the rare but highly
 
01:09:20.349 --> 01:09:20.359 align:start position:0%
problematic uh vexatious uh requests
 
01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
that are only meant to burden or impede
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
governmental business
 
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
um I think we can all agree uh that a
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
strong system of public access to
 
01:09:31.630 --> 01:09:31.640 align:start position:0%
governmental records is built on
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
communication and having uh a natural
 
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity such as this bill creates to
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
enhance uh that communication between a
 
01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
requester and the government uh can
 
01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully enhance the Public's
 
01:09:43.950 --> 01:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
understanding of how its government
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
works uh whether it's a better
 
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
understanding of the burden uh a request
 
01:09:51.269 --> 01:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
May impose or perhaps a more efficient
 
01:09:53.149 --> 01:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
way to access the ultimate information
 
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
that is sought
 
01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh implementing a reasonable fee system
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
can also lead to Greater efficiency uh
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
and you sort of just heard a great case
 
01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
a compelling case for efficiency
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
supporting the fundamental purpose of
 
01:10:07.709 --> 01:10:07.719 align:start position:0%
the right to no law which is the public
 
01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
access to governmental records uh by
 
01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
creating an opportunity to uh discuss
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
requests it's the department of
 
01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
Justice's hope and belief that not only
 
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
individual requesters will receive a
 
01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
more timely response uh but the public
 
01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
at large will be better served because
 
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
the state will be able to handle an
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
increased number of requests uh you're
 
01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
all aware we're all aware uh our resour
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
resources are finite uh and especially
 
01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
the most precious resource of all time
 
01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh this bill helps address that however
 
01:10:38.990 --> 01:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh not by creating more time but by
 
01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
implementing a system in which time can
 
01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
be valued and used most efficiently and
 
01:10:46.110 --> 01:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
then last um though the department
 
01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
believes the vast majority of requests
 
01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
uh do not fall into this category youve
 
01:10:53.070 --> 01:10:53.080 align:start position:0%
heard uh some officials uh talk about
 
01:10:55.229 --> 01:10:55.239 align:start position:0%
the occasion where state agencies or or
 
01:10:57.550 --> 01:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities or public bodies receive
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
vexatious requests that are incredibly
 
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
burdensome and require significant
 
01:11:03.669 --> 01:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
resources tying those up and preventing
 
01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
them uh from being used to uh for other
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
public purposes to serve the people of
 
01:11:12.189 --> 01:11:12.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh so uh the department uh
 
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
supports the incentive structure created
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
by this bill overall we believe it
 
01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
strikes an appropriate balance uh and
 
01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
here to questions for this witness yes
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
01:11:27.709 --> 01:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
thank you very here I am here I
 
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
am um good morning thank you very much
 
01:11:35.470 --> 01:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
for for being here I have a question and
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
I probably should know the answer but I
 
01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
don't so can you help me
 
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
out is there any language in the
 
01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
legislation that created the Ombudsman
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
to deal with right to know issues in
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
which a public agent
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
a town for example the town of sunap for
 
01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
example could go to the
 
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
edsman to in some legal way Express
 
01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
concern about the requests that had come
 
01:12:14.629 --> 01:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
in thank you very much representative
 
01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
ma'am I uh I am not sure that that
 
01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
exists there's not language that I've
 
01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
seen uh in the new language regarding
 
01:12:25.149 --> 01:12:25.159 align:start position:0%
the EMB budsman that that uh would offer
 
01:12:29.229 --> 01:12:29.239 align:start position:0%
that Avenue thank you yes representative
 
01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
Perez thank you thanks for taking my
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
question I'm a little concerned because
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
you used the term problematic
 
01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
requests that bothers me um who
 
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
determines that it's problematic and
 
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
does someone I believe it's my
 
01:12:46.750 --> 01:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
everyone has the right to utilize the
 
01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
right to know so I'm a little concerned
 
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
about calling
 
01:12:57.870 --> 01:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
something problematic problematic to the
 
01:13:01.149 --> 01:13:01.159 align:start position:0%
town because it takes more
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
time that person has as much right as
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
anyone else so I'm a little concerned
 
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
that you use the term problematic and
 
01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
this would help with
 
01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
problematic things because as I say
 
01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
everybody it's my understanding has the
 
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
right to utilize the right to know
 
01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
certainly representative thank you for
 
01:13:23.950 --> 01:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
the question or or the comment um
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
to the extent that I I use the ambiguous
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
term problematic what I I probably
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
should have used was more vexatious sort
 
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
of going back to the previous comments
 
01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
that you've heard about weaponization so
 
01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
a a right to no request the intent
 
01:13:44.590 --> 01:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
of the intent being only to uh impede
 
01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
governmental business now I I completely
 
01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
understand ma' uh you know intent is
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult to sus out and so I
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
I would note uh you know it's the
 
01:13:58.270 --> 01:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
Department's uh view that everybody
 
01:13:59.709 --> 01:13:59.719 align:start position:0%
should be able to make a right to no
 
01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
request we certainly do not want to uh
 
01:14:05.229 --> 01:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
uh come off of saying oh you know this
 
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
is a problematic request so therefore it
 
01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't need need to be dealt with or
 
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
something of that nature all right other
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Alexander
 
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
you for indulging me um I previously
 
01:14:18.669 --> 01:14:18.679 align:start position:0%
asked a question about the difference
 
01:14:21.149 --> 01:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
between May and shall how would the um
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
AG's office deal with this sort of
 
01:14:27.310 --> 01:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
ability for the town to charge for some
 
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
but not others and really not having a
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
conrete policy either way and how that
 
01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:35.960 align:start position:0%
could be considered discrimination
 
01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
depending on what their policy is set up
 
01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
and who they who they charge and who
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
they decide not to charge uh certainly
 
01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for the
 
01:14:45.870 --> 01:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
question uh I think you've already heard
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
and and had some back and forth earlier
 
01:14:49.950 --> 01:14:49.960 align:start position:0%
today about um you know potential
 
01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
amendments or or thoughts I I think the
 
01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
Department's position at this point in
 
01:14:58.350 --> 01:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
time is uh that we would defer to the
 
01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
policy decisions of the legislature um I
 
01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
would just offer you know the the
 
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
Freedom of Information Act which I'm
 
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
sure U the ACLU and and many other
 
01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:09.080 align:start position:0%
requesters are very familiar with has a
 
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
waver system uh so it's not a um I I
 
01:15:16.629 --> 01:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
would offer that there's sort of a
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
greater Clarity in when is uh when there
 
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
will or won't be a charge and uh the OM
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
the Office of Management budget at the
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
federal level has you know published a
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
fee schedule so it's not um there's not
 
01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
a lack of clarity I guess I would
 
01:15:35.070 --> 01:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
offer other questions thank you very
 
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
much thank you sir next I'm going to
 
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
please good morning good morning my name
 
01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
is Amanda pal I'm the assistant City
 
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
attorney in in the city of Kean we the
 
01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
city of Keane are in support of this
 
01:15:58.990 --> 01:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
bill I wanted to quickly run through
 
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
some amendments we would like to see if
 
01:16:02.590 --> 01:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
possible since the language is being
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
considered um in the bill there is a
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
section with added language concerning
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
inspection or delivery without copying
 
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
this is under section 4
 
01:16:17.629 --> 01:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
d the added language is unless time to
 
01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
make the records available exceeds 10
 
01:16:21.189 --> 01:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
hours I'd like to talk about the
 
01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
language that's not in bold there was a
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
case in 2017 Taylor
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
vs55 that helped clarify the first part
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
of that sentence inspection or delivery
 
01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:34.280 align:start position:0%
without copying um the way that this
 
01:16:36.189 --> 01:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
comes off on its face is that both
 
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
inspection and delivery would be without
 
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
copying but the court clarified we're
 
01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
not sending out Originals delivery is
 
01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
definitely going to be a copy so we
 
01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
would just like to propose that we
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
invert those phrases to say for the
 
01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
inspection without copying or delivery
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
of governmental records um what the
 
01:16:56.189 --> 01:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
court had considered was the concept of
 
01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
the cost of copying records in
 
01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:59.070 align:start position:0%
the cost of copying records in
electronic

01:16:59.070 --> 01:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
electronic
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
format uh of course inspection without
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
copying would be without cost at the
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
time if there's a copy fee whereas
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
copying even in electronic format had a
 
01:17:11.310 --> 01:17:11.320 align:start position:0%
copy fee so just like to tune that up um
 
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
since we're there then in looking at the
 
01:17:15.790 --> 01:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
last provision that's going to be new
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
language in Section
 
01:17:21.229 --> 01:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
8 we also thought it would be helpful to
 
01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
clarify what the 10 hour is we wanted to
 
01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
propose that the clause in excess of 10
 
01:17:32.629 --> 01:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
hours is added so that the phrase is for
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
the employee time in excess of 10 hours
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding the intent is not
 
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
to charge for you know if it's a 12
 
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
hour cost or time that you charge for 12
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
it's just the two on top of the 10 so um
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
over in Keen uh our staff and I adore
 
01:17:51.070 --> 01:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
them for it looks at rsas pretty closely
 
01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
tries to stick with the words very
 
01:17:54.669 --> 01:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
helpful to me um but therefore I want to
 
01:17:56.229 --> 01:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
take an opportunity to clarify the
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
language a little bit um and also in
 
01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
light of that the second sentence in
 
01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
that section Section 8 um would like it
 
01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
to say hourly cost shall not exceed $25
 
01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
per hour and no hourly costs shall be
 
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
charged for requests under 10 so just
 
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
adding the word hourly for those two
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
mentions to be
 
01:18:17.709 --> 01:18:17.719 align:start position:0%
consistent So speaking more generally
 
01:18:19.229 --> 01:18:19.239 align:start position:0%
the city is in support of this bill
 
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
particularly with those amendments I
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
referenced uh the goal of the bill as we
 
01:18:26.229 --> 01:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
understand it is for protection of our
 
01:18:29.229 --> 01:18:29.239 align:start position:0%
Municipal staff um our time our taxpayer
 
01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
funding the law currently prohibits any
 
01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
cost for our staff time only allows for
 
01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:35.470 align:start position:0%
cost for our staff time only allows for
copy

01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
copy
 
01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
charges um and we found that staff time
 
01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
really is the largest impact of the work
 
01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
required for the right to no law um and
 
01:18:47.470 --> 01:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
coming from the city of Kean even with
 
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
this back stop the vast majority of our
 
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
requests do not take 10 hours I did um a
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
rudimentary survey of our requests and
 
01:18:56.629 --> 01:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
and speaking to our clerk's office on
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
average it's two to three hours of
 
01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
request um and then the two years I've
 
01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
been with the city I've worked with the
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
keing police requests um and I've only
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
ever seen one that's been more than 10
 
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
hours at all so so can I just ask you to
 
01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
wrap up for sure thank you so our
 
01:19:12.669 --> 01:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
position is that this bill would not
 
01:19:14.629 --> 01:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
dtor right to no requests it would serve
 
01:19:17.629 --> 01:19:17.639 align:start position:0%
as a very good protection of uh City
 
01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
staff time taxpayer funding particularly
 
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
in uh smaller towns who who may need to
 
01:19:24.669 --> 01:19:24.679 align:start position:0%
spend more time great thank you
 
01:19:26.189 --> 01:19:26.199 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
01:19:28.669 --> 01:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
01:19:41.550 --> 01:19:41.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
please my name is Alber andano I'm from
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
Kensington New Hampshire and I'm
 
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
speaking in opposition to this
 
01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
bill I want to read article 38 of the
 
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
Constitution to you it's called social
 
01:19:59.790 --> 01:19:59.800 align:start position:0%
uh virtues but Artic in in calculated
 
01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
but just a small part of it here it says
 
01:20:04.270 --> 01:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
the people ought therefore to have a
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
particular regard to all those
 
01:20:10.510 --> 01:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
principles in the choice of the offices
 
01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
and representatives and they have a
 
01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:14.719 align:start position:0%
right to require of the lawgivers and
 
01:20:18.149 --> 01:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
the magistrates an exact and constant
 
01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
observance of them in the formation and
 
01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
execution of the laws
 
01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
necessary for the good administration of
 
01:20:30.189 --> 01:20:30.199 align:start position:0%
government you're taxing if this goes
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
through our enumerated rights the rights
 
01:20:35.629 --> 01:20:35.639 align:start position:0%
that are given to us in the
 
01:20:38.910 --> 01:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution you're going to tax
 
01:20:42.910 --> 01:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
us it it's it's you know regardless if
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
you're Republican Democrat or
 
01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:47.320 align:start position:0%
independent doesn't matter we need to go
 
01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
back to
 
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
this sometimes the rsas a repugnant to
 
01:20:54.910 --> 01:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
the Constitution and this case it is we
 
01:20:57.629 --> 01:20:57.639 align:start position:0%
surely can't charge people for the right
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
to know and what really troubles me is
 
01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
we have a line item in town budgets for
 
01:21:06.510 --> 01:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
insurance for police for
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
attorneys put a line item in if this is
 
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
a problem in a town put a line item in
 
01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
and have the town vote on it and appoint
 
01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
somebody that does this on especially
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
the bigger towns that need this but you
 
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
cannot charge a citizen under this
 
01:21:25.709 --> 01:21:25.719 align:start position:0%
constitution are we we we might as well
 
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
not even have
 
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
it and last for me it when there the
 
01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
discussion about people outside of being
 
01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
a citizen in New Hampshire you know
 
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
maybe there is something for that but
 
01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
not for the people in New
 
01:21:44.790 --> 01:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I will take any questions
 
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560 align:start position:0%

witness thank you very much sir thank
 
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:07.480 align:start position:0%

professional life insurance
 
01:22:21.679 --> 01:22:23.270 align:start position:0%
professional life insurance
certification

01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
certification
 
01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh I am agency counsel there um the
 
01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
office does not take a position on this
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
bill but um I would like to offer some
 
01:22:33.149 --> 01:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
insight on what part of my job is a
 
01:22:36.189 --> 01:22:36.199 align:start position:0%
substantial part of my job in fact um I
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
handle the majority of the 91a requests
 
01:22:42.669 --> 01:22:42.679 align:start position:0%
that come into the office um we get on
 
01:22:46.030 --> 01:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
average one request a day um a lot of
 
01:22:48.189 --> 01:22:48.199 align:start position:0%
times more than that some of them are
 
01:22:49.709 --> 01:22:49.719 align:start position:0%
misdirected they're not write to no
 
01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
requests at all others just require
 
01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
simple answers
 
01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
um but a lot of them are for commercial
 
01:22:58.629 --> 01:22:58.639 align:start position:0%
purposes people requesting mailing lists
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
requesting um addresses um uh emails to
 
01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
lenses so that they can send them um
 
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
solicitations for continuing education
 
01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
or or other um reasons um we don't have
 
01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
to compile lists if we don't already
 
01:23:19.830 --> 01:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
keep them in that Ma manner um according
 
01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:21.470 align:start position:0%
keep them in that Ma manner um according
to

01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
91847 um and there are a lot of requests
 
01:23:28.669 --> 01:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
for uh non-public items such as um
 
01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
investigations that um are exempt from
 
01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:32.950 align:start position:0%
investigations that um are exempt from
public

01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
disclosure um on average a right to no
 
01:23:39.310 --> 01:23:39.320 align:start position:0%
request a simple one would probably take
 
01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
between two to five hours um three hours
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
would probably be spent by board
 
01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:48.199 align:start position:0%
Administration to try to locate and
 
01:23:51.229 --> 01:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
gather the information and probably uh
 
01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
another two hours
 
01:23:55.709 --> 01:23:55.719 align:start position:0%
um of my time um to check to make sure
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
that no private information was being
 
01:24:00.629 --> 01:24:00.639 align:start position:0%
disclosed and to do redactions and so
 
01:24:03.310 --> 01:24:03.320 align:start position:0%
forth um now a board administrator makes
 
01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
anywhere between uh $25 and $30 an hour
 
01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
um I make upwards of $45 an hour so in
 
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
salary alone for a very simple request
 
01:24:15.629 --> 01:24:15.639 align:start position:0%
we're probably talking about
 
01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
$165 um not including benefits and
 
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
overhead and these costs are not paid by
 
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
the tax ta payers they actually paid by
 
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
the lenses board administrators and I
 
01:24:30.149 --> 01:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
had started on work um and spent several
 
01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
hours um the request was modified to
 
01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
only require um information from Medical
 
01:24:38.910 --> 01:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
Dental mental health and nursing and
 
01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:41.119 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic uh later the request was
 
01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:43.400 align:start position:0%
again modified the requestor wanted to
 
01:24:45.709 --> 01:24:45.719 align:start position:0%
see videos of any public hearings you
 
01:24:47.709 --> 01:24:47.719 align:start position:0%
know can I just ask you to wrap up man'
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
please certainly um so I think that a
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
lot of times that the the
 
01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
um the people think that it's a matter
 
01:24:58.189 --> 01:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
of pushing a button or just getting some
 
01:24:59.830 --> 01:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
quick information to fulfill these
 
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
requests we can't just have people come
 
01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
into the offices in these case and make
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
copies or examine items because they're
 
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
not isolated from items that have
 
01:25:13.109 --> 01:25:13.119 align:start position:0%
personal information on it um so in in
 
01:25:16.350 --> 01:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
this case um again these are for
 
01:25:18.669 --> 01:25:18.679 align:start position:0%
commercial purposes and somebody wants
 
01:25:21.310 --> 01:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
this information to make and is making a
 
01:25:24.109 --> 01:25:24.119 align:start position:0%
lot of money from this information and
 
01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
um I think that um if if anything to
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
charge something in these cases um might
 
01:25:34.590 --> 01:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
deter some of the larger commercial
 
01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
requests all right questions for this
 
01:25:40.350 --> 01:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:59.629 align:start position:0%
 
please

01:25:59.629 --> 01:25:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:02.910 --> 01:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
good morning uh this is all about right
 
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
to know and I've been living the right
 
01:26:10.189 --> 01:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
to know nightmare for about 8 10 months
 
01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
uh basically on this bill right here the
 
01:26:14.910 --> 01:26:14.920 align:start position:0%
one thing I have a problem with is
 
01:26:17.149 --> 01:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
saying that town or city can come back
 
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
with a suggestion now does that mean
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
that the that suggestion is the final
 
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
amount of what is going to be allowed to
 
01:26:28.030 --> 01:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
be given as per your right to no request
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
because if that's mandated then that's
 
01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
weakening the law because you call for
 
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
one thing and they says well you can't
 
01:26:36.070 --> 01:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
have this but you can have that that's
 
01:26:38.430 --> 01:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
my suggestion do you have to take it and
 
01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
if you have to take it that's that's a
 
01:26:41.669 --> 01:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
01:26:45.629 --> 01:26:45.639 align:start position:0%
nonstarter uh also uh I want I need an
 
01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
addendum into this bill that says
 
01:26:50.669 --> 01:26:50.679 align:start position:0%
citizen means citizen of the United
 
01:26:52.590 --> 01:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
States or citizen of the world world
 
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
because as a citizen of Maine that
 
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
covers the city of Rochester and has one
 
01:27:03.149 --> 01:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
you know 10 15 20 awards from the New
 
01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:06.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire press Association that is
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
recognized and uh business of the year
 
01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:10.470 align:start position:0%
recognized and uh business of the year
in

01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
2021 and a community service award which
 
01:27:15.870 --> 01:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't have been able to get without
 
01:27:18.870 --> 01:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
having right to no ability uh from the
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire press Association I would
 
01:27:22.390 --> 01:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
never have done it that was about a
 
01:27:24.109 --> 01:27:24.119 align:start position:0%
flawed land deal by the city of
 
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
Rochester for a third fire station that
 
01:27:28.750 --> 01:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
the purchase and sale agreement had no
 
01:27:31.149 --> 01:27:31.159 align:start position:0%
hold harmless agreement on the city of
 
01:27:33.870 --> 01:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
Rochester the city council voted down
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
the land purchase so the city council
 
01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
voted down the land purchase they went
 
01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
into a non- meeting with the attorney
 
01:27:43.270 --> 01:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
they came back a half hour later and
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
they approved the purchase because they
 
01:27:47.070 --> 01:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
were under threat of a lawsuit for
 
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
breaking a purchase and sale agreement
 
01:27:52.830 --> 01:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm a citizen of Maine I covered this
 
01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:54.679 align:start position:0%
Rochester voice I cover the city of
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
Rochester every single day and on April
 
01:28:01.629 --> 01:28:01.639 align:start position:0%
12th the City attorney sent me an email
 
01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
saying we have discovered that you 30
 
01:28:08.790 --> 01:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
hours of time preparing for my uh on
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
budman's uh because I I did a right to
 
01:28:14.189 --> 01:28:14.199 align:start position:0%
no request to the on buzzman I spent 30
 
01:28:17.149 --> 01:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
hours he ended up not even making a
 
01:28:19.109 --> 01:28:19.119 align:start position:0%
decision he said it was not in his
 
01:28:21.390 --> 01:28:21.400 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to determine whether
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
citizen citizen of New Hampshire or
 
01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
citizen of has to be a citizen of New
 
01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:29.229 align:start position:0%
citizen of has to be a citizen of New
Hampshire

01:28:29.229 --> 01:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
so when he did that now the city of
 
01:28:33.070 --> 01:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
Rochester is
 
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
appealing that to the Judiciary so I'm
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
asking the legislature to determine that
 
01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
the citizen means citizen of the United
 
01:28:46.510 --> 01:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
States because the city of Rochester is
 
01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
looking to have the Judiciary determine
 
01:28:52.669 --> 01:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
what citizen means whether means citizen
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire or citizen of the
 
01:28:56.669 --> 01:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
United States all right thank you very
 
01:28:58.950 --> 01:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
much sir questions for this
 
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
01:29:03.629 --> 01:29:03.639 align:start position:0%
thank you next
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:19.229 --> 01:29:19.239 align:start position:0%
please good morning members of the
 
01:29:20.990 --> 01:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee my name is Katherine
 
01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
coko I am the president of right to know
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we are an all volunteer
 
01:29:28.590 --> 01:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
citizen-based group um spanning the
 
01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
entire state that advocates for
 
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
transparency in government um I will try
 
01:29:35.189 --> 01:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
to keep my points to a number of things
 
01:29:36.990 --> 01:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
that I actually have not heard raised
 
01:29:38.709 --> 01:29:38.719 align:start position:0%
today so I hope they will be of interest
 
01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
to you um the first is uh the concern
 
01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
that this bill first and foremost is
 
01:29:45.390 --> 01:29:45.400 align:start position:0%
based on a need that has been defined
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
only anecdotally at best our
 
01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:49.480 align:start position:0%
organization itself had a member who
 
01:29:51.109 --> 01:29:51.119 align:start position:0%
volunteered to solicit input about the
 
01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
size of this issue
 
01:29:53.870 --> 01:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
um it's been referred to as
 
01:29:56.350 --> 01:29:56.360 align:start position:0%
weaponization uh problematic other terms
 
01:29:58.430 --> 01:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
that we've heard the response that she
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
received from nhma and uh stated that
 
01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
large requests are infrequent the input
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
that she got from other communities was
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
very limited the sponsor itself has said
 
01:30:10.430 --> 01:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
there are very few examples of these
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
large requests um we do know that
 
01:30:15.229 --> 01:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
sizable requests tend to occur as the
 
01:30:16.990 --> 01:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
result of commercial requests from data
 
01:30:18.350 --> 01:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
Gathering entities rather from
 
01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
individuals or the Bad actors that we
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
are hearing about some of those today
 
01:30:24.149 --> 01:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
but without a well-defined need this
 
01:30:26.030 --> 01:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
bill imposes an unreasonable restriction
 
01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire's only operational
 
01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
protection of citizen access to
 
01:30:31.629 --> 01:30:31.639 align:start position:0%
transparent government if this bill is
 
01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
not deemed itl which is what we would
 
01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
like to see it should at least require
 
01:30:37.390 --> 01:30:37.400 align:start position:0%
further study to quantify the actual
 
01:30:39.070 --> 01:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
problem before attempting to impose the
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
statutory solution more importantly the
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
mechanism that is proposed by this bill
 
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
is entirely unnecessary voluminous
 
01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
requests regardless of source are and
 
01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
always will be subject to the standard
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
that they be reasonably described this
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
standard was most recently addressed in
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
the 2022 case of kin versus nasua there
 
01:30:58.629 --> 01:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
is a plethora of state and federal case
 
01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
law that has already determined what
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
kind of request is reasonable and how a
 
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
public body May Place reasonable
 
01:31:06.270 --> 01:31:06.280 align:start position:0%
restrictions on a right to no request to
 
01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
ensure that it is not unreasonably
 
01:31:10.950 --> 01:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
burdensome it is largely contextual and
 
01:31:12.910 --> 01:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
it requires an understanding of the law
 
01:31:14.709 --> 01:31:14.719 align:start position:0%
and is not as simple as the language
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
that is put forward the public body can
 
01:31:18.229 --> 01:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
also apply the standard of
 
01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
reasonableness to its own search for
 
01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
documents and Define what thinks is a
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable search the case law defining
 
01:31:26.709 --> 01:31:26.719 align:start position:0%
that reasonableness standard includes
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
American oversight versus the US EPA
 
01:31:30.790 --> 01:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
Freedom watch Inc versus Department of
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
State Dale Versus Internal Revenue
 
01:31:36.030 --> 01:31:36.040 align:start position:0%
Service muckrock LLC versus the CIA and
 
01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
ATV watch versus the New Hampshire
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
Transportation in Rel finally in
 
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
relation to reasonableness public bodies
 
01:31:46.390 --> 01:31:46.400 align:start position:0%
also have considerable leeway to set
 
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable timelines on the response
 
01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:49.480 align:start position:0%
that they give and that has also been
 
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
upheld in case law including in my own
 
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
case person versus the town of Milford
 
01:31:55.070 --> 01:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
it can be difficult for communities to
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
understand those parameters and some may
 
01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
think that this is a simple solution um
 
01:32:01.830 --> 01:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
but we believe the real issue here is
 
01:32:04.109 --> 01:32:04.119 align:start position:0%
Education and Training of public bodies
 
01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
as an example after discussing these
 
01:32:07.950 --> 01:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
kinds of requests with my own Community
 
01:32:10.430 --> 01:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
it became very clear that one voluminous
 
01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
requests tend to come routinely from
 
01:32:13.470 --> 01:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
those commercial entities that have been
 
01:32:15.709 --> 01:32:15.719 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned and two that a
 
01:32:16.950 --> 01:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
thorough understanding of what the
 
01:32:18.669 --> 01:32:18.679 align:start position:0%
community is and is not required to
 
01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
provide and an internal policy on
 
01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with those have been incredibly
 
01:32:24.189 --> 01:32:24.199 align:start position:0%
effective in my hometown in managing
 
01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
those requests and understanding that
 
01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
reasonableness standard is key to that
 
01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
can I ask you to just sum up please
 
01:32:32.189 --> 01:32:32.199 align:start position:0%
you're you're at the three minute Mark
 
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
we would like to work with public bodies
 
01:32:35.550 --> 01:32:35.560 align:start position:0%
and nhma to make sure that those who
 
01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
receive these requests understand that
 
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
standard I have a number of points here
 
01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
about it being incredibly important to
 
01:32:43.950 --> 01:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
understand that in you have written
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
testimony you may certainly do submit
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
that but uh I you're you're really at
 
01:32:50.830 --> 01:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
over your time limit now is the advocate
 
01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
and I will then at and wrap up saying
 
01:32:55.390 --> 01:32:55.400 align:start position:0%
this bill is bad for public interest
 
01:32:57.070 --> 01:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
it's bad for communities and instead
 
01:32:58.390 --> 01:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
communities should be working to
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
understand the right to no law trained
 
01:33:03.109 --> 01:33:03.119 align:start position:0%
on the public um on right to know and
 
01:33:04.830 --> 01:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
ensure that they're properly equipped to
 
01:33:06.270 --> 01:33:06.280 align:start position:0%
understand the reasonableness standard
 
01:33:07.830 --> 01:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
and I will add particularly given the
 
01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
presence of the AG's office here that
 
01:33:11.109 --> 01:33:11.119 align:start position:0%
another step forward be would be
 
01:33:13.709 --> 01:33:13.719 align:start position:0%
updating the AG's 2015 memo to reflect
 
01:33:15.629 --> 01:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
the most recent case law which has been
 
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
repeatedly requested by our group and
 
01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
other agencies and has not been done all
 
01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
right questions for this week yes Mr
 
01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
chair yeah uh yes uh represent D Lorenzo
 
01:33:27.109 --> 01:33:27.119 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I'm just a
 
01:33:31.390 --> 01:33:31.400 align:start position:0%
little curious what was your thought
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
when we heard the Assistant Attorney
 
01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
General um say that he's in favor of the
 
01:33:40.590 --> 01:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you representative D Lorenzo
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
I I was um probably not surprised but I
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
am very concerned that there is numerous
 
01:33:49.629 --> 01:33:49.639 align:start position:0%
case law that has impacted how
 
01:33:52.189 --> 01:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
communities respond to this that um
 
01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
current memo actually has a reference to
 
01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
the citizen issue that has repeatedly
 
01:33:57.870 --> 01:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
come up and I will reference in another
 
01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
upcoming bill um that clarify some of
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
that and um feel that that really needs
 
01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
to be the priority is understanding what
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
the current situation is rather than
 
01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
instituting a fee structure
 
01:34:10.750 --> 01:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you could you
 
01:34:14.430 --> 01:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
please submit your written testimony to
 
01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
us um if you could get copies to us and
 
01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
that's a much better way to give us
 
01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
complicated information than to speed
 
01:34:26.430 --> 01:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
read thank you I I will I tried to keep
 
01:34:29.390 --> 01:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
the bullets but I will synthesize it
 
01:34:30.750 --> 01:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
thank you great thank you other
 
01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
01:34:37.149 --> 01:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
next I'm going to uh call on MAR uh
 
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:51.550 --> 01:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
Moy all right I don't see Mr Mobley here
 
01:34:54.870 --> 01:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
all right next I will uh call on uh
 
01:34:59.229 --> 01:34:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
please I do have some written testimony
 
01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
you so my name is Brendan McCade I am a
 
01:35:23.669 --> 01:35:23.679 align:start position:0%
resident of Manchester I am the
 
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
publisher of the New Hampshire union
 
01:35:26.910 --> 01:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
leader and I am the President of the New
 
01:35:28.750 --> 01:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire press Association uh the New
 
01:35:31.510 --> 01:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire press Association is strongly
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill um and a few of my
 
01:35:39.310 --> 01:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
thoughts number one um I'm disturbed by
 
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
the notion I feel you all should be
 
01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
disturbed too that we keep hearing which
 
01:35:45.669 --> 01:35:45.679 align:start position:0%
is geez these citizens that want to know
 
01:35:47.470 --> 01:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
what we're doing are really annoying
 
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
it'd be great if we could do something
 
01:35:52.750 --> 01:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
about that um we keep hearing about out
 
01:35:55.030 --> 01:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
of state and Commercial interests uh
 
01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:56.719 align:start position:0%
that may be a problem that needs to be
 
01:35:58.870 --> 01:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
dealt with but this bill doesn't deal
 
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
with that this bill creates a situation
 
01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:03.070 align:start position:0%
with that this bill creates a situation
for

01:36:03.070 --> 01:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:36:05.669 --> 01:36:05.679 align:start position:0%
everyone putting in right to no requests
 
01:36:08.189 --> 01:36:08.199 align:start position:0%
of which our paper puts in a lot and our
 
01:36:11.109 --> 01:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
membership uh including Harrison uh put
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
in a lot too um I would caution if you
 
01:36:17.910 --> 01:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
do attempt to address the outof state
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
interest think of entities like Mr har
 
01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
person who are out of state but covering
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the Boston Globe is
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
another example um and we had someone
 
01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
from Keen here the students at Keen
 
01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:34.159 align:start position:0%
State also had a right to know issue a
 
01:36:36.669 --> 01:36:36.679 align:start position:0%
couple years ago for which they won an
 
01:36:40.229 --> 01:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
award they are likely out of state some
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
of them because they're students and
 
01:36:43.229 --> 01:36:43.239 align:start position:0%
they're in state and they're studying
 
01:36:44.189 --> 01:36:44.199 align:start position:0%
and they're trying to figure out how
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
government works so I would caution you
 
01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
against anything blanket on out of state
 
01:36:51.910 --> 01:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
or commercial um and please don't do
 
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
commercial because that would really hit
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
our media um the fees that you put into
 
01:37:00.510 --> 01:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
place in this law will do nothing for
 
01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
those big commercial operators they will
 
01:37:04.750 --> 01:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
laugh at paying 250 bucks for the
 
01:37:07.109 --> 01:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
information they want if they can get
 
01:37:10.030 --> 01:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
it um there are problems now as many of
 
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
you know with exceptions under 91a and a
 
01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
lot of entities just don't want to
 
01:37:18.510 --> 01:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
provide stuff so um you know we've we've
 
01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
had a lot of talk about weaponizing of
 
01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
91a here uh this bill provides a very
 
01:37:26.910 --> 01:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
potent weapon to any agency that's
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
currently unresponsive and I would
 
01:37:31.149 --> 01:37:31.159 align:start position:0%
encourage you not to give them
 
01:37:33.390 --> 01:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
that thank you questions for this
 
01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative Smith thank
 
01:37:38.709 --> 01:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
you Mr McQuade
 
01:37:41.870 --> 01:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
um when I came to the legislature The
 
01:37:45.149 --> 01:37:45.159 align:start position:0%
Press Room was full and now it's empty
 
01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
and we have very few ways of getting out
 
01:37:50.790 --> 01:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
to the public information about what we
 
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
do here I'm thinking I live on the Sea
 
01:37:55.470 --> 01:37:55.480 align:start position:0%
Coast and I'm thinking in fact that the
 
01:37:58.350 --> 01:37:58.360 align:start position:0%
newspapers and the Sea Coast not only
 
01:38:00.629 --> 01:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
don't have reporters here but they're
 
01:38:03.070 --> 01:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
owned by an outof State entity they're
 
01:38:05.950 --> 01:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
no longer owned by anyone in the state
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
does that mean that if a right to our
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
request came
 
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
in from one of those members of the
 
01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
fourth estate that they would be
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
considered out of state and therefore
 
01:38:22.709 --> 01:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
not relevant that's why I say if you're
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
if you're going to look at anything
 
01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
addressing out of state or commercial
 
01:38:28.189 --> 01:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
operations to consider that in any
 
01:38:30.589 --> 01:38:30.599 align:start position:0%
legislation that you might put forward
 
01:38:32.830 --> 01:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
 
01:38:35.390 --> 01:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um and I'm now I'm G to call
 
01:38:50.109 --> 01:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:50.119 --> 01:38:53.189 align:start position:0%
 
please

01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:54.669 --> 01:38:54.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:38:56.510 --> 01:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
committee I'm n Grace with the municipal
 
01:38:59.589 --> 01:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
Association we do support this bill um
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
I've handed out and I also uploaded
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
earlier this morning um a copy of uh
 
01:39:08.149 --> 01:39:08.159 align:start position:0%
written testimony um really the second
 
01:39:10.669 --> 01:39:10.679 align:start position:0%
page uh is the second piece of paper is
 
01:39:13.229 --> 01:39:13.239 align:start position:0%
the relevant one it contains our survey
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
results um one of the questions that we
 
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
had as the conversation evolved over the
 
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
course of the summer and fall was well
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
what are large requests what are average
 
01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
requests let's see what our members
 
01:39:28.589 --> 01:39:28.599 align:start position:0%
think we had about 70 members respond uh
 
01:39:31.109 --> 01:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
and the way they defined average request
 
01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of time inputed to respond was
 
01:39:37.310 --> 01:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
a maximum of 5 hours with a mean and a
 
01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
median of 1 hour and two hours um and I
 
01:39:43.870 --> 01:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
think this is some important data that
 
01:39:45.790 --> 01:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
you can review later at your at your
 
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
leisure uh that really demonstrates the
 
01:39:51.070 --> 01:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
fear of of uh hurting the average
 
01:39:53.149 --> 01:39:53.159 align:start position:0%
citizen is misplaced with this
 
01:39:56.430 --> 01:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
legislation um I think the 10hour um
 
01:39:58.430 --> 01:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
10hour limit uh gives a good buffer
 
01:40:00.350 --> 01:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
between what what we saw our members
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
report versus what actually
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
happens um there were we've heard a lot
 
01:40:07.629 --> 01:40:07.639 align:start position:0%
of complaints today about uh citizens
 
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
getting the wrong stuff um I think that
 
01:40:13.070 --> 01:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
section e that's proposed in this
 
01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
legislation is very important um it
 
01:40:18.669 --> 01:40:18.679 align:start position:0%
really incentivizes and creates the
 
01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity for conversation to occur
 
01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
between between the government and the
 
01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
citizen um so we can be sure the
 
01:40:25.550 --> 01:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
citizens are getting what they actually
 
01:40:29.229 --> 01:40:29.239 align:start position:0%
want and not what they don't want um and
 
01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
I think that really helps uh Define the
 
01:40:34.830 --> 01:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
need of of this legislation that's in
 
01:40:35.910 --> 01:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
front of you
 
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
today um there were a couple questions
 
01:40:41.589 --> 01:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
about how exactly uh
 
01:40:44.350 --> 01:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
Roman uh the last paragraph here would
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
be interpreted um our interpretation was
 
01:40:50.109 --> 01:40:50.119 align:start position:0%
that it's a a local option um so that it
 
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
would be a a set fee um at your
 
01:40:56.350 --> 01:40:56.360 align:start position:0%
municipality so if someone came in for a
 
01:40:58.109 --> 01:40:58.119 align:start position:0%
request that took 12 hours they could
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
only be charged for two of those hours
 
01:41:04.270 --> 01:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
um and those two hours would be whatever
 
01:41:06.510 --> 01:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
that locally adopted fee is up to the
 
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
statutory amount of $25 so it may be the
 
01:41:10.510 --> 01:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
case that your community wants a minimum
 
01:41:13.109 --> 01:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
wage it may be the case that your um
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
Community doesn't want a fee it may be
 
01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
the case they want $25 an hour if the
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
request takes uh that amount of time
 
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
they would get that charge um that way
 
01:41:27.550 --> 01:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
we don't have any local officials in
 
01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
inquiring into the purpose of your
 
01:41:32.149 --> 01:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
request because really our our only job
 
01:41:34.629 --> 01:41:34.639 align:start position:0%
is to uh make sure you get what you want
 
01:41:36.229 --> 01:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
so so can I just interrupt just for one
 
01:41:37.950 --> 01:41:37.960 align:start position:0%
second Mr Grace am I understanding it
 
01:41:39.589 --> 01:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
correctly then from from what you just
 
01:41:42.589 --> 01:41:42.599 align:start position:0%
said that um there was a a question
 
01:41:45.669 --> 01:41:45.679 align:start position:0%
raised earlier about that there's some I
 
01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
mean the the way the the language of the
 
01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
bill is now drafted it could be read to
 
01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
say that if the request is over 10 hours
 
01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:57.679 align:start position:0%
then you can charge for the whole in
 
01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
other words if it's a 12h hour request
 
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
you can charge for the whole 12 hours
 
01:42:04.510 --> 01:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is you would have no
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
you you would have no problem if it said
 
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
and if it's over 10 hours you can only
 
01:42:12.149 --> 01:42:12.159 align:start position:0%
charge for the excess correct and that
 
01:42:14.990 --> 01:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
was my original understanding um I'm
 
01:42:16.589 --> 01:42:16.599 align:start position:0%
glad that the city of Keane brought that
 
01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
up um we do not want to charge for 10
 
01:42:24.109 --> 01:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
hours or less okay um for uh two other
 
01:42:26.950 --> 01:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
quick points um uh a number of
 
01:42:28.830 --> 01:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
individuals have brought up the question
 
01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
of citizen in the
 
01:42:33.229 --> 01:42:33.239 align:start position:0%
definition um that's contained in 91 A4
 
01:42:36.669 --> 01:42:36.679 align:start position:0%
Roman 1 um that isn't touched by this
 
01:42:40.189 --> 01:42:40.199 align:start position:0%
bill um at the risk of incurring some
 
01:42:42.270 --> 01:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
unhappiness behind me um I do want to
 
01:42:45.229 --> 01:42:45.239 align:start position:0%
point out that house bill 1696 which is
 
01:42:47.109 --> 01:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
also scheduled uh here
 
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
today uh deals with that section so that
 
01:42:52.109 --> 01:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
may be the appro appropriate Bill to
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
deal with that section on just so
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
there's no overlapping or
 
01:42:59.870 --> 01:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
confusion um and five I don't believe
 
01:43:03.709 --> 01:43:03.719 align:start position:0%
anyone mentioned this today um but um
 
01:43:05.589 --> 01:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
there is in the legislation in front of
 
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
you a uh provision that for these large
 
01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
requests the government has to provide
 
01:43:13.709 --> 01:43:13.719 align:start position:0%
an estimate of the time as well as the
 
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
cost which means they have to account
 
01:43:18.910 --> 01:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
for their time accurately um that's kind
 
01:43:20.750 --> 01:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
of inherently built in there and it
 
01:43:23.589 --> 01:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
protects citizens from surprised bills
 
01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
as I understand it the um Prime sponsor
 
01:43:28.149 --> 01:43:28.159 align:start position:0%
has handed out an amendment to all of
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
you um that clarifies that if someone is
 
01:43:33.589 --> 01:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
concerned about how much time it's
 
01:43:35.470 --> 01:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
taking to get their records back or how
 
01:43:37.629 --> 01:43:37.639 align:start position:0%
much that cost is they can appeal to the
 
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
right to no I'm spudman and obviously uh
 
01:43:42.629 --> 01:43:42.639 align:start position:0%
a check to make sure that everyone's uh
 
01:43:46.589 --> 01:43:46.599 align:start position:0%
following the law doing it fairly um and
 
01:43:48.350 --> 01:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
everything is being applied equally is
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
very important because we want to make
 
01:43:51.310 --> 01:43:51.320 align:start position:0%
sure that citizens are getting what
 
01:43:53.589 --> 01:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
they're entitled to uh and fairly I'm
 
01:43:55.270 --> 01:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions questions
 
01:43:56.629 --> 01:43:56.639 align:start position:0%
for this
 
01:44:00.270 --> 01:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you well I'm
 
01:44:03.510 --> 01:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Perez thank you
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question my concern
 
01:44:09.669 --> 01:44:09.679 align:start position:0%
about giving a Time on how long it's
 
01:44:11.149 --> 01:44:11.159 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
take how long it takes me to do
 
01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
something could be very different than
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
how long it takes you to do something
 
01:44:22.830 --> 01:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
and and if I don't like
 
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
you I may take a longer period of time I
 
01:44:29.550 --> 01:44:29.560 align:start position:0%
have a problem with that because as some
 
01:44:31.870 --> 01:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
of you here know we've had big problems
 
01:44:34.149 --> 01:44:34.159 align:start position:0%
in different towns with people who don't
 
01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
like people and things that they do so
 
01:44:40.669 --> 01:44:40.679 align:start position:0%
that concerns me because you are trying
 
01:44:43.870 --> 01:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
to say that everybody does something at
 
01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:44.629 align:start position:0%
to say that everybody does something at
the

01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:44:47.669 --> 01:44:47.679 align:start position:0%
same in the same amount of time
 
01:44:50.750 --> 01:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
so well I I think if you look at the the
 
01:44:53.149 --> 01:44:53.159 align:start position:0%
second page uh the second sheet of paper
 
01:44:55.310 --> 01:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
of my handout um you'll see that I
 
01:44:57.790 --> 01:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
provided you a graph of the different
 
01:45:00.790 --> 01:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
responses for the maximum amount of time
 
01:45:02.350 --> 01:45:02.360 align:start position:0%
it took to respond to the average
 
01:45:05.149 --> 01:45:05.159 align:start position:0%
request with the maximum being 5 hours
 
01:45:07.229 --> 01:45:07.239 align:start position:0%
many municipalities were quicker than
 
01:45:11.830 --> 01:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
that I think um that this is important
 
01:45:14.229 --> 01:45:14.239 align:start position:0%
data to look at because even if there is
 
01:45:17.229 --> 01:45:17.239 align:start position:0%
a personality conflict having a buffer
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
between what the data shows is the
 
01:45:21.149 --> 01:45:21.159 align:start position:0%
maximum and what
 
01:45:22.709 --> 01:45:22.719 align:start position:0%
uh the committee decides is an
 
01:45:26.550 --> 01:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate hour limit um will help
 
01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
ensure that if it goes P if if a request
 
01:45:33.310 --> 01:45:33.320 align:start position:0%
comes in that's you know pretty basic
 
01:45:36.189 --> 01:45:36.199 align:start position:0%
request and it goes past that time that
 
01:45:39.430 --> 01:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
when that person sees that estimate and
 
01:45:41.109 --> 01:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
they realize hey wait a minute I think
 
01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
that somebody hates me they can go to
 
01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
the right to Noom budsman ask for that
 
01:45:48.070 --> 01:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
to be reviewed and the right to OMS
 
01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
buman would logically say that's an
 
01:45:54.030 --> 01:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount of time um and I think
 
01:45:55.950 --> 01:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
that's yep go
 
01:45:58.430 --> 01:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
ahead that doesn't bother me as much and
 
01:46:00.109 --> 01:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
going to the on budsman is a wonderful
 
01:46:03.070 --> 01:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
idea but not everybody has the time to
 
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
go to the on
 
01:46:10.350 --> 01:46:10.360 align:start position:0%
budsman I think it's a great thing for
 
01:46:14.669 --> 01:46:14.679 align:start position:0%
91a what concerns me the most is you're
 
01:46:18.189 --> 01:46:18.199 align:start position:0%
trying to make a judgment on how long it
 
01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
takes you as opposed to me or as opposed
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
to her to do the same thing and I don't
 
01:46:29.109 --> 01:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
think we can we can do that you know I
 
01:46:31.350 --> 01:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
mean it's based on if you know what
 
01:46:33.270 --> 01:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
you're looking for it your knowledge of
 
01:46:36.550 --> 01:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
it and how fast you can get it and your
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
almost based on your personality whether
 
01:46:42.109 --> 01:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
you tend to go or not go so that's my
 
01:46:45.030 --> 01:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
concern is trying to put ours and I
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
understand I and I think it's great to
 
01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
have you know um
 
01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
request but you're still trying to put
 
01:46:57.870 --> 01:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
judging everyone doing something at the
 
01:46:59.790 --> 01:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
same time is there is there a qu is
 
01:47:01.589 --> 01:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
there a question here okay all right
 
01:47:01.599 --> 01:47:02.669 align:start position:0%
there a question here okay all right
representative

01:47:02.669 --> 01:47:02.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:47:05.189 --> 01:47:05.199 align:start position:0%
Manos thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:47:08.350 --> 01:47:08.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question um in your view are
 
01:47:11.070 --> 01:47:11.080 align:start position:0%
your members are the towns and cities
 
01:47:13.589 --> 01:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
entitled to invoke the EMB budsman and
 
01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
if so do they do that and what's your
 
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
experience with
 
01:47:20.990 --> 01:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
that so my understanding the law is
 
01:47:24.030 --> 01:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
currently written is that the cities and
 
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
towns are not able to go to the
 
01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman to ask to review a request
 
01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
that comes in now I may be speaking out
 
01:47:35.550 --> 01:47:35.560 align:start position:0%
of turn but I understand then the other
 
01:47:37.589 --> 01:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
side of the wall they may or may not be
 
01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
considering an amendment to a bill that
 
01:47:42.629 --> 01:47:42.639 align:start position:0%

draft format and that could last um
 
01:49:49.390 --> 01:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
quite a while I asked them um I it's
 
01:49:50.990 --> 01:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
worth noting that I did try to resolve
 
01:49:52.910 --> 01:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
this before coming before you um by
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
making phone calls and talking with a
 
01:49:56.310 --> 01:49:56.320 align:start position:0%
number of of entities trying to figure
 
01:49:59.669 --> 01:49:59.679 align:start position:0%
out what exactly the law was um so the
 
01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:00.719 align:start position:0%
feedback that I received from the
 
01:50:02.589 --> 01:50:02.599 align:start position:0%
families was we cannot get the draft
 
01:50:05.149 --> 01:50:05.159 align:start position:0%
documents and and these items could stay
 
01:50:09.629 --> 01:50:09.639 align:start position:0%
in draft for months maybe forever and so
 
01:50:11.470 --> 01:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
the families weren't able to obtain that
 
01:50:14.189 --> 01:50:14.199 align:start position:0%
information um when I started calling
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
around to different people including the
 
01:50:20.510 --> 01:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman I was referred to um section
 
01:50:23.189 --> 01:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
9182 which says the meeting shall not
 
01:50:25.990 --> 01:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
include circulation of draft
 
01:50:29.629 --> 01:50:29.639 align:start position:0%
documents so I think some entities and I
 
01:50:31.470 --> 01:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
also TR did try to find out whether it
 
01:50:33.950 --> 01:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
was just one agency one school that was
 
01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
had a misunderstanding of the law but it
 
01:50:36.990 --> 01:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
seemed to be sort of a pervasive
 
01:50:39.550 --> 01:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding of what documents were
 
01:50:42.669 --> 01:50:42.679 align:start position:0%
subject to the right to know then when I
 
01:50:44.790 --> 01:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
spoke with the Ombudsman he referred me
 
01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
to 91a section 5 exemptions which said
 
01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
that preliminary drafts no notes
 
01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
memoranda Etc if they have been
 
01:50:55.229 --> 01:50:55.239 align:start position:0%
circulated to a quorum that they were
 
01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
subject to the right to know law so a
 
01:51:00.350 --> 01:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
little bit of um confusion there so I
 
01:51:02.069 --> 01:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
have come before you to ask if there's
 
01:51:04.990 --> 01:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
anything that you can do to just Define
 
01:51:08.030 --> 01:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
what is subject to the 91a law are draft
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
subject to it is is there a Sunset date
 
01:51:13.229 --> 01:51:13.239 align:start position:0%
so just to clear up the confusion that
 
01:51:15.790 --> 01:51:15.800 align:start position:0%
exists from boots on the ground um I've
 
01:51:17.430 --> 01:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
had a lot of Spirited discussions over
 
01:51:19.550 --> 01:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
this issue and a lot of different
 
01:51:22.390 --> 01:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
opinions have sort of come
 
01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
forward questions for this
 
01:51:27.310 --> 01:51:27.320 align:start position:0%

Rochester New Hampshire um I do
 
01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate the comments that I just
 
01:51:59.030 --> 01:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
heard from um this fellow um Parson and
 
01:52:00.390 --> 01:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me the
 
01:52:03.270 --> 01:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak um I would just
 
01:52:05.910 --> 01:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
like a little clarification as to what a
 
01:52:08.950 --> 01:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
preliminary draft actually means um
 
01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
versus um my my world basically centered
 
01:52:14.910 --> 01:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
around planning boards and Technical
 
01:52:17.629 --> 01:52:17.639 align:start position:0%
Review Committee reports um what
 
01:52:20.229 --> 01:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
distinguishes a preliminary draft why is
 
01:52:23.390 --> 01:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
it limited to a preliminary draft versus
 
01:52:26.310 --> 01:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
something that goes beyond a preliminary
 
01:52:30.270 --> 01:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
draft and then further as I'm reading
 
01:52:33.189 --> 01:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
this um what is the difference between a
 
01:52:35.910 --> 01:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
preliminary draft in materials and then
 
01:52:39.310 --> 01:52:39.320 align:start position:0%
when it goes on further for copying um
 
01:52:42.750 --> 01:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
it gives this whole list but it doesn't
 
01:52:46.750 --> 01:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
go one step further and say that copying
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
of preliminary drafts circulated to a
 
01:52:50.350 --> 01:52:50.360 align:start position:0%
quum can be made
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
um so those were just some of my
 
01:52:54.750 --> 01:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
preliminary questions um in in reading
 
01:52:56.990 --> 01:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
this thank you for your time thank you
 
01:52:59.669 --> 01:52:59.679 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness seeing none
 
01:53:12.510 --> 01:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:15.229 --> 01:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
coko thank you um again I represent
 
01:53:16.709 --> 01:53:16.719 align:start position:0%
right to know New Hampshire um we are
 
01:53:19.390 --> 01:53:19.400 align:start position:0%
neutral on this bill I do um want to
 
01:53:21.709 --> 01:53:21.719 align:start position:0%
make a suggestion um that we did have
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
some concerns from the group about the
 
01:53:26.910 --> 01:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
um just the language that we take out
 
01:53:30.069 --> 01:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
the information that is in italics place
 
01:53:33.629 --> 01:53:33.639 align:start position:0%
it under other um after under under
 
01:53:36.669 --> 01:53:36.679 align:start position:0%
Source other sources in parentheses and
 
01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
say including preliminary drafts
 
01:53:40.669 --> 01:53:40.679 align:start position:0%
circulated to a quorum or majority of
 
01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
the public body this exemption is
 
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
already covered this is already covered
 
01:53:47.629 --> 01:53:47.639 align:start position:0%
in the exemption section of the law um
 
01:53:49.750 --> 01:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
so we support there being a clar
 
01:53:52.069 --> 01:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
verification because it is routinely a
 
01:53:54.270 --> 01:53:54.280 align:start position:0%
problem I have run into it in in my
 
01:53:56.830 --> 01:53:56.840 align:start position:0%
hometown um they were routinely
 
01:53:59.430 --> 01:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
withholding all drafts of anything until
 
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
I came along and pointed out that those
 
01:54:03.229 --> 01:54:03.239 align:start position:0%
had to be provided once they'd been
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
circulated to a quorum of the board and
 
01:54:07.109 --> 01:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
now the town has changed their policy on
 
01:54:09.629 --> 01:54:09.639 align:start position:0%
that so I appreciate personally the
 
01:54:11.390 --> 01:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
clarification that the sponsor is trying
 
01:54:13.790 --> 01:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
to get our concern was that the way it
 
01:54:16.830 --> 01:54:16.840 align:start position:0%
was worded it might look like everything
 
01:54:19.069 --> 01:54:19.079 align:start position:0%
needed to be a draft or some other thing
 
01:54:21.550 --> 01:54:21.560 align:start position:0%
that had been circulated fully if they
 
01:54:24.510 --> 01:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
were a material a tape or another source
 
01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
so we just want to make sure that's very
 
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
clear all right questions for this
 
01:54:30.750 --> 01:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative Alexander
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you for taking my
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
question did you so so from what I'm
 
01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
understanding you you didn't run into
 
01:54:37.350 --> 01:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
any problems when you brought it up to
 
01:54:41.550 --> 01:54:41.560 align:start position:0%
your town I ran into a number of um
 
01:54:44.109 --> 01:54:44.119 align:start position:0%
within the town issues I believe they
 
01:54:46.669 --> 01:54:46.679 align:start position:0%
then asked for clarification from
 
01:54:49.910 --> 01:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
nhma um and town legal council and they
 
01:54:51.189 --> 01:54:51.199 align:start position:0%
were advised that yes under the
 
01:54:52.669 --> 01:54:52.679 align:start position:0%
exemption if a material had been
 
01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
circulated to a Corum of the board they
 
01:54:56.430 --> 01:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
had to turn it over they were not doing
 
01:54:58.709 --> 01:54:58.719 align:start position:0%
that until then okay so it it was
 
01:55:01.149 --> 01:55:01.159 align:start position:0%
resolved under the current law it was
 
01:55:03.069 --> 01:55:03.079 align:start position:0%
okay thank but it had to go outside I
 
01:55:05.910 --> 01:55:05.920 align:start position:0%

01:55:07.270 --> 01:55:07.280 align:start position:0%

where there somebody will say well this
 
01:55:35.950 --> 01:55:35.960 align:start position:0%

exemption and we routinely answer that
 
01:55:40.189 --> 01:55:40.199 align:start position:0%
question with once it's been circulated
 
01:55:41.830 --> 01:55:41.840 align:start position:0%

02:04:22.709 --> 02:04:22.719 align:start position:0%
you to uh I hope you all have
 
02:04:25.470 --> 02:04:25.480 align:start position:0%
it uh
 
02:04:32.270 --> 02:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:42.390 --> 02:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
is this is a
 
02:04:46.149 --> 02:04:46.159 align:start position:0%
um Announcement by our town of New
 
02:04:49.870 --> 02:04:49.880 align:start position:0%
Durham after we had a class put on by
 
02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal
 
02:04:54.470 --> 02:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
Association and the municipal
 
02:04:56.430 --> 02:04:56.440 align:start position:0%
Association said us we were not to do
 
02:04:58.950 --> 02:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
electronic copies to anyone any longer
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
we've been doing it for some
 
02:05:04.510 --> 02:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
time um and so they put up this notice
 
02:05:07.189 --> 02:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
and I'll on October 30th I I'll read it
 
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:09.679 align:start position:0%
out it's short based on the advice of
 
02:05:12.589 --> 02:05:12.599 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal
 
02:05:15.030 --> 02:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
Association legal
 
02:05:17.629 --> 02:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
council the town of New Durham will no
 
02:05:19.470 --> 02:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
longer provide electronic copies of
 
02:05:22.750 --> 02:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
documents requested under provisions of
 
02:05:25.069 --> 02:05:25.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire RSA
 
02:05:28.910 --> 02:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
91a document uh may be reviewed at the
 
02:05:31.470 --> 02:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
Town Hall Once the request has been
 
02:05:34.750 --> 02:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
completed copies can be made and per
 
02:05:37.229 --> 02:05:37.239 align:start position:0%
page fees will be
 
02:05:40.589 --> 02:05:40.599 align:start position:0%
charged um and so that's why I brought
 
02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
this bill to you because this is going
 
02:05:45.030 --> 02:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
on as you heard recently in Rochester
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
also and a number of other communities
 
02:05:50.189 --> 02:05:50.199 align:start position:0%
have class doing electronics and it's
 
02:05:52.149 --> 02:05:52.159 align:start position:0%
ridiculous my
 
02:05:52.159 --> 02:05:55.030 align:start position:0%
ridiculous my
estimation

02:05:55.030 --> 02:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
estimation
 
02:05:57.549 --> 02:05:57.559 align:start position:0%
um I don't
 
02:06:00.149 --> 02:06:00.159 align:start position:0%
think the New Hampshire Municipal
 
02:06:04.189 --> 02:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
Association possibly saw the decision of
 
02:06:06.549 --> 02:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
green uh versus school administrative
 
02:06:08.350 --> 02:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
unit number
 
02:06:14.069 --> 02:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:18.189 --> 02:06:18.199 align:start position:0%
page six or even just seven will
 
02:06:18.199 --> 02:06:19.189 align:start position:0%
page six or even just seven will
concluded

02:06:19.189 --> 02:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
concluded
 
02:06:22.069 --> 02:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
says in some under all circumstances we
 
02:06:25.030 --> 02:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
conclude that the plaintiff is entitled
 
02:06:27.390 --> 02:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
to the requested documents in electronic
 
02:06:29.950 --> 02:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
format furthermore producing electronic
 
02:06:32.589 --> 02:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
documents is often more efficient and
 
02:06:35.390 --> 02:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
coste effective than producing them in
 
02:06:35.400 --> 02:06:36.310 align:start position:0%
coste effective than producing them in
paper

02:06:36.310 --> 02:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
paper
 
02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
form providing electronic records can be
 
02:06:42.229 --> 02:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
cheaper and easier for the public body
 
02:06:43.310 --> 02:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
than paper
 
02:06:43.320 --> 02:06:45.069 align:start position:0%
than paper
records

02:06:45.069 --> 02:06:45.079 align:start position:0%
records
 
02:06:47.830 --> 02:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
now it was interesting because you and
 
02:06:49.589 --> 02:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't have extra copies of
 
02:06:53.709 --> 02:06:53.719 align:start position:0%
this it's just seven pag time times too
 
02:06:57.870 --> 02:06:57.880 align:start position:0%
many all right uh I I one I have one
 
02:07:01.549 --> 02:07:01.559 align:start position:0%
copy here yeah and I have only one
 
02:07:05.709 --> 02:07:05.719 align:start position:0%
more oh thank you thank you
 
02:07:09.189 --> 02:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:11.950 --> 02:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
electronic uh it was interesting how
 
02:07:13.629 --> 02:07:13.639 align:start position:0%
they went back inste of the statute is
 
02:07:16.910 --> 02:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
ambiguous on both parties and said and
 
02:07:20.270 --> 02:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
uh we're both reasonable so we therefore
 
02:07:21.870 --> 02:07:21.880 align:start position:0%
look to the purpose of the right to no
 
02:07:24.629 --> 02:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
law which is to increase public access
 
02:07:27.229 --> 02:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
to all public documents and governmental
 
02:07:30.030 --> 02:07:30.040 align:start position:0%
proceedings and to provide the utmost
 
02:07:33.030 --> 02:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
information to the public about what its
 
02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
government is up to so my bill even
 
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
though I didn't actually find out about
 
02:07:41.549 --> 02:07:41.559 align:start position:0%
this until after I fil my bill is to
 
02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
codify this here and if you folks see
 
02:07:47.910 --> 02:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
anything a way to do it better um that's
 
02:07:50.189 --> 02:07:50.199 align:start position:0%
fine and the most the most important
 
02:07:51.910 --> 02:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
thing is your chairman is one of the
 
02:07:53.430 --> 02:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
signatories to this
 
02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:55.589 align:start position:0%
signatories to this
[Laughter]

02:07:55.589 --> 02:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:07:59.790 --> 02:07:59.800 align:start position:0%
decision so I thank you very much Judge
 
02:08:01.950 --> 02:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
Lynn for your good
 
02:08:04.750 --> 02:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
work and uh I don't know if I need to
 
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
say any
 
02:08:09.430 --> 02:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
more uh questions yes representative
 
02:08:11.629 --> 02:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
Perez thank you for taking my question I
 
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
have received electronic documents from
 
02:08:16.950 --> 02:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
my town but they charged me the exact
 
02:08:21.870 --> 02:08:21.880 align:start position:0%
same as if I had gotten them paper
 
02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
that's not legal that's my understanding
 
02:08:26.149 --> 02:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
to be charging you except for paper
 
02:08:28.870 --> 02:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
copies it says I have been charged and
 
02:08:31.790 --> 02:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
they quoted an RSA saying that they
 
02:08:34.470 --> 02:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
could charge me for copies and that's
 
02:08:36.589 --> 02:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
fine they can charge me for copies I
 
02:08:38.109 --> 02:08:38.119 align:start position:0%
understand that but I received them
 
02:08:40.430 --> 02:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
electronically and got Char charged I
 
02:08:42.069 --> 02:08:42.079 align:start position:0%
believe there is a bill coming forward
 
02:08:44.229 --> 02:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
that will stop that from happening but
 
02:08:45.870 --> 02:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
well if you don't you can do an
 
02:08:48.750 --> 02:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
amendment because we because is Mr
 
02:08:52.830 --> 02:08:52.840 align:start position:0%
Harrison no Thor Mr Thor had said and
 
02:08:54.510 --> 02:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
another fellow said too it's so
 
02:08:56.069 --> 02:08:56.079 align:start position:0%
important for us to get the information
 
02:08:57.830 --> 02:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
the newspapers need the information keep
 
02:09:00.350 --> 02:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
us informed that's critically important
 
02:09:02.910 --> 02:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise we lose our democracy and
 
02:09:06.510 --> 02:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
charging for electronic like paper yeah
 
02:09:07.790 --> 02:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps yeah we've always done it
 
02:09:11.149 --> 02:09:11.159 align:start position:0%
through the tax dollars and it's because
 
02:09:13.629 --> 02:09:13.639 align:start position:0%
it's about it's about government yeah
 
02:09:15.709 --> 02:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
it's about all of us and so when I read
 
02:09:17.350 --> 02:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
a news article whether it be the union
 
02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
leader or any other
 
02:09:20.350 --> 02:09:20.360 align:start position:0%
and they've gotten their information
 
02:09:23.270 --> 02:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
from the town or school district U it's
 
02:09:26.229 --> 02:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
for all of us to be informed
 
02:09:28.229 --> 02:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
about that's
 
02:09:32.589 --> 02:09:32.599 align:start position:0%
Civics 101 other qu yes represent Smith
 
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you um Mr chair for recognizing
 
02:09:40.709 --> 02:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
me um representative bigford knowing um
 
02:09:43.390 --> 02:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
that your legislative Roots Began in
 
02:09:45.990 --> 02:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
this Committee in
 
02:09:49.910 --> 02:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
1997 um your judge is important to me do
 
02:09:53.430 --> 02:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
you see any reason that the chair of
 
02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:57.599 align:start position:0%
this committee uh would have to recuse
 
02:10:00.709 --> 02:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
himself from voting on this since his
 
02:10:04.750 --> 02:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
role in the judicial branch has been
 
02:10:06.990 --> 02:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
noted I I don't see a conflict of
 
02:10:08.430 --> 02:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
interest I don't I doubt he's going to
 
02:10:09.450 --> 02:10:09.460 align:start position:0%
make any money on
 
02:10:09.460 --> 02:10:12.870 align:start position:0%
make any money on
[Laughter]

02:10:12.870 --> 02:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]

Andre thank than you Mr chair uh M
 
02:10:23.709 --> 02:10:23.719 align:start position:0%
representative bigford did you go to the
 
02:10:26.750 --> 02:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
AG's office with this and ask him if it
 
02:10:28.510 --> 02:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
a bill was
 
02:10:30.830 --> 02:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
necessary ex I didn't quite understand
 
02:10:33.310 --> 02:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
that okay did all right you there was a
 
02:10:36.189 --> 02:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
word I missed I'm sorry
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
yeah sometimes I don't word things
 
02:10:41.950 --> 02:10:41.960 align:start position:0%
correctly excuse me okay did you take
 
02:10:45.310 --> 02:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
this the bill you mean the bill to the
 
02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
AG's office and ask them if it was
 
02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:49.270 align:start position:0%
AG's office and ask them if it was
necessary

02:10:49.270 --> 02:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
02:10:52.030 --> 02:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
I mean to me the municipal Association
 
02:10:55.470 --> 02:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
just because the illegal counsel said
 
02:10:57.750 --> 02:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
something like this was necessary is it
 
02:11:00.069 --> 02:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
does it actually have to be or just is
 
02:11:01.950 --> 02:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
there a misunderstanding because I'll
 
02:11:04.310 --> 02:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
tell you my school district I send them
 
02:11:06.589 --> 02:11:06.599 align:start position:0%
an email and they just send me stuff
 
02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
electronically they've been doing it for
 
02:11:10.709 --> 02:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
years so I don't understand what the
 
02:11:13.669 --> 02:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
issue is with this I I agree with I have
 
02:11:14.990 --> 02:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
not been to the Attorney General's
 
02:11:16.350 --> 02:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
office because I just felt it was
 
02:11:18.270 --> 02:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
important to get it in the statute so
 
02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
didn't get misinterpreted because it
 
02:11:21.310 --> 02:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
looks to me like they're just looking at
 
02:11:22.990 --> 02:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
the Statue and not doing the is it
 
02:11:25.790 --> 02:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
called shepherding or in uhing shepher
 
02:11:27.430 --> 02:11:27.440 align:start position:0%

02:11:40.189 --> 02:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
then representative Perez okay thank you
 
02:11:41.669 --> 02:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:11:43.990 --> 02:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
question representative bfid yeah you
 
02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
know I'm looking at this notice that you
 
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
passed out um and it says say I don't
 
02:11:50.790 --> 02:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
want to read the whole thing to you but
 
02:11:52.350 --> 02:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
on the advice of the New Hampshire
 
02:11:55.270 --> 02:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association legal council I
 
02:11:58.669 --> 02:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
mean is that that doesn't look official
 
02:12:03.030 --> 02:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
to me why wouldn't the nhma legal
 
02:12:06.750 --> 02:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
council write the notice rather than
 
02:12:09.709 --> 02:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
have it quoted by the municipality do
 
02:12:11.229 --> 02:12:11.239 align:start position:0%
you understand what I mean you
 
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
understand what I'm saying I well kind
 
02:12:15.310 --> 02:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
of this is the selectman put this up
 
02:12:17.069 --> 02:12:17.079 align:start position:0%
they there was I think I know one
 
02:12:19.390 --> 02:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
selectman was there sitting by behind me
 
02:12:21.189 --> 02:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
and I went to the same class so I heard
 
02:12:23.830 --> 02:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
the same thing and so immediately oh my
 
02:12:26.790 --> 02:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
gosh we got to shut that down then and I
 
02:12:28.109 --> 02:12:28.119 align:start position:0%
I think the logic was well you know
 
02:12:30.270 --> 02:12:30.280 align:start position:0%
there's machines out there that create
 
02:12:33.709 --> 02:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
requests and we can't have that and so
 
02:12:36.709 --> 02:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
what my bill does it's it's just allows
 
02:12:39.390 --> 02:12:39.400 align:start position:0%
the town to do it it's it's a Meg and
 
02:12:41.910 --> 02:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
you'll see in if you get the decision
 
02:12:44.189 --> 02:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
they talk a lot about May in here but
 
02:12:44.199 --> 02:12:45.350 align:start position:0%
they talk a lot about May in here but
I'm

02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
saying the towns want to be able to just
 
02:12:50.950 --> 02:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
do this and send out information out
 
02:12:52.270 --> 02:12:52.280 align:start position:0%
they don't want to have to have somebody
 
02:12:54.350 --> 02:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
come in and then copy it and say have a
 
02:12:57.549 --> 02:12:57.559 align:start position:0%
nice day and that stuff it's just time
 
02:13:00.030 --> 02:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
consuming and awkward um now we have one
 
02:13:02.470 --> 02:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
selectman he lives half the time in
 
02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:03.350 align:start position:0%
selectman he lives half the time in
another

02:13:03.350 --> 02:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
state and he gets all his stuff
 
02:13:08.750 --> 02:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
electronically from the town but Mr
 
02:13:11.830 --> 02:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
Harrison here he wants he has to come to
 
02:13:13.950 --> 02:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
the town hall and get it that I I
 
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
consider that ridiculous the same
 
02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:18.830 align:start position:0%
consider that ridiculous the same
information

02:13:18.830 --> 02:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:13:21.990 --> 02:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
so just to follow up personally if I
 
02:13:23.990 --> 02:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
were a citizen of that town I would I
 
02:13:26.350 --> 02:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
would really U question leg the
 
02:13:30.310 --> 02:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
legitimacy of this um issue right here
 
02:13:33.310 --> 02:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
legitimacy yes I think it's very legi
 
02:13:35.549 --> 02:13:35.559 align:start position:0%
they said we have been advised okay by
 
02:13:37.390 --> 02:13:37.400 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
02:13:39.709 --> 02:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
not to I did talk to the slman
 
02:13:41.790 --> 02:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
afterwards that put it up okay and told
 
02:13:43.790 --> 02:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
him about it and I said well and and
 
02:13:45.589 --> 02:13:45.599 align:start position:0%
said that I was I say I intend to put a
 
02:13:48.589 --> 02:13:48.599 align:start position:0%
bill in to uh what I that have correct
 
02:13:51.990 --> 02:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
this okay all right well thank you all
 
02:13:54.430 --> 02:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
right representative Perez thank you
 
02:13:55.589 --> 02:13:55.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question would
 
02:14:00.109 --> 02:14:00.119 align:start position:0%
you have would you be all right with
 
02:14:03.109 --> 02:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
adding at no charge to this or putting
 
02:14:05.790 --> 02:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
in the language that they can't charge
 
02:14:07.830 --> 02:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
for electronically sending something I
 
02:14:09.109 --> 02:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
very much would like it actually but
 
02:14:11.109 --> 02:14:11.119 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of you know what you can
 
02:14:14.109 --> 02:14:14.119 align:start position:0%
pull off yeah right because you know I I
 
02:14:15.669 --> 02:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
was charged yeah yeah I think it's
 
02:14:17.470 --> 02:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
critically important to have information
 
02:14:21.390 --> 02:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
out of dips thanks representative manx
 
02:14:25.229 --> 02:14:25.239 align:start position:0%
thank you um if records if specific
 
02:14:27.149 --> 02:14:27.159 align:start position:0%
records that are requested are still in
 
02:14:30.229 --> 02:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
paper format this would not mandate or
 
02:14:32.510 --> 02:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
would it mandate that the that the town
 
02:14:34.790 --> 02:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
convert it to electronic and then send
 
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
it out or can they still choose to use
 
02:14:39.149 --> 02:14:39.159 align:start position:0%
the paper rope they can still choose to
 
02:14:42.069 --> 02:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
use the paper rope yeah with my bill
 
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
anyway but but I but I would welcome
 
02:14:49.430 --> 02:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
that all right other questions yes
 
02:14:50.950 --> 02:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you Mr
 
02:14:52.030 --> 02:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative for
 
02:14:55.470 --> 02:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm I just thought
 
02:14:57.629 --> 02:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
of like maybe an unintended consequence
 
02:14:59.830 --> 02:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
of requiring that it has to be
 
02:15:02.229 --> 02:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
electronic at all times I see like the
 
02:15:03.709 --> 02:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
future and maybe represented being or
 
02:15:05.709 --> 02:15:05.719 align:start position:0%
represent Kenny can attest to this the
 
02:15:08.109 --> 02:15:08.119 align:start position:0%
future of AI and how you can start
 
02:15:09.870 --> 02:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
creating prompts and just sending
 
02:15:12.270 --> 02:15:12.280 align:start position:0%
arbitrary right to no requests over and
 
02:15:14.189 --> 02:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
over and over again from a computer just
 
02:15:15.470 --> 02:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
sending it
 
02:15:18.030 --> 02:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
in what's what's to stop somebody from
 
02:15:20.709 --> 02:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
just sending in repeated electronic
 
02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
requests and requiring it has to be an
 
02:15:24.830 --> 02:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
electronic format well for one thing the
 
02:15:26.109 --> 02:15:26.119 align:start position:0%
Bill's not written that we just
 
02:15:28.669 --> 02:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
discussed that with representative Manis
 
02:15:32.069 --> 02:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
the bill is not okay demanding you can
 
02:15:34.390 --> 02:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
ignore them or you can say do the FED
 
02:15:36.270 --> 02:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
day thing say Well we'd like to see you
 
02:15:38.750 --> 02:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
come in we'd like to see some K you can
 
02:15:40.149 --> 02:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
do whatever you want but you're not
 
02:15:43.830 --> 02:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
required to send it out to the AI okay
 
02:15:46.109 --> 02:15:46.119 align:start position:0%
okay yeah you you'll see you'll see it's
 
02:15:47.910 --> 02:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
if you read the bill you'll see the what
 
02:15:50.310 --> 02:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about there all right thank
 
02:15:53.629 --> 02:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
you other questions for this witness you
 
02:15:57.030 --> 02:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
know one just one I just have it one
 
02:15:59.669 --> 02:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a question and a comment my
 
02:16:01.589 --> 02:16:01.599 align:start position:0%
I'm going back now it's it's hard to
 
02:16:03.310 --> 02:16:03.320 align:start position:0%
believe that it's been four years since
 
02:16:07.830 --> 02:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
I left the Judiciary but um I believe
 
02:16:12.910 --> 02:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
that there is another SAU 55 taste that
 
02:16:15.310 --> 02:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
I was the author of oh that right that
 
02:16:19.030 --> 02:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
dealt with and I and I'm I'm I'm having
 
02:16:21.149 --> 02:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
difficulty recollecting exactly but I
 
02:16:23.310 --> 02:16:23.320 align:start position:0%
thought that one I think that one of the
 
02:16:25.350 --> 02:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
issues there was
 
02:16:28.950 --> 02:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
that it was I think the court said it
 
02:16:34.669 --> 02:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
was okay for towns to use the paper
 
02:16:37.429 --> 02:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
format in in some circumstances in order
 
02:16:39.429 --> 02:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they had a proper
 
02:16:42.270 --> 02:16:42.280 align:start position:0%
record that they had
 
02:16:45.990 --> 02:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
responded um you know if and I as I say
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
I don't have a close Rec election of it
 
02:16:51.110 --> 02:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
but I will look at it you know before we
 
02:16:53.589 --> 02:16:53.599 align:start position:0%
before we EXA this bill just to to make
 
02:16:56.190 --> 02:16:56.200 align:start position:0%
because I I mean I'm very speaking
 
02:16:57.629 --> 02:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
personally I'm very much in favor of
 
02:16:58.669 --> 02:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
this and I also agree with
 
02:17:00.110 --> 02:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
representative Perez that it would be
 
02:17:02.230 --> 02:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
good to have the you know making sure
 
02:17:05.589 --> 02:17:05.599 align:start position:0%
you can't charge um but I did I I do
 
02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
have I do want to go back and look at
 
02:17:09.870 --> 02:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
that case because there was some issue
 
02:17:13.309 --> 02:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
there about towns wanting to be able to
 
02:17:14.709 --> 02:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
you know make sure that they had a
 
02:17:17.070 --> 02:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
record that they properly responded so
 
02:17:18.790 --> 02:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't be accused of not
 
02:17:20.990 --> 02:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
having responded correctly and I thought
 
02:17:22.629 --> 02:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
that there was something in that case
 
02:17:24.509 --> 02:17:24.519 align:start position:0%
dealing with it must have been when you
 
02:17:26.750 --> 02:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
were much long younger that's right
 
02:17:28.910 --> 02:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
that's right much sure I wasn't having
 
02:17:31.110 --> 02:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
the senior moments that's
 
02:17:35.110 --> 02:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
right all right uh yes represent Staples
 
02:17:36.790 --> 02:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:17:41.270 --> 02:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question um the suggestion not
 
02:17:44.070 --> 02:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
to charge for the electronic record
 
02:17:47.349 --> 02:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
pertains to copies right not necessarily
 
02:17:50.509 --> 02:17:50.519 align:start position:0%
the research or the administrative time
 
02:17:53.629 --> 02:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
to collect that information is that
 
02:17:56.030 --> 02:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
right yes thank you you do that's what
 
02:17:58.790 --> 02:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
you do now we have been doing it that
 
02:18:00.870 --> 02:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
way actually right along it's only it's
 
02:18:02.270 --> 02:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
only when they put that class on and
 
02:18:05.030 --> 02:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
insisted that we cannot be doing this
 
02:18:06.709 --> 02:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
anymore and I stopped them in the tracks
 
02:18:09.150 --> 02:18:09.160 align:start position:0%
I said what at the class and I said you
 
02:18:11.589 --> 02:18:11.599 align:start position:0%
want to repeat that for me and uh so we
 
02:18:14.469 --> 02:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
had quite a discussion on it and uh at
 
02:18:16.429 --> 02:18:16.439 align:start position:0%
that point I lost but as you can see
 
02:18:18.389 --> 02:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
because this is what came up
 
02:18:20.950 --> 02:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you all right we'll win in
 
02:18:23.150 --> 02:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
the end other questions for
 
02:18:24.389 --> 02:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford yes

computer with that what you have all

I'm going to call on representative
 
02:19:15.629 --> 02:19:15.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:18.150 --> 02:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chair members of the
 
02:19:20.549 --> 02:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
committee I said it all last bill so I
 
02:19:22.429 --> 02:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
don't have to say it again this time all
 
02:19:24.309 --> 02:19:24.319 align:start position:0%
right well that's no good we're going to
 
02:19:25.389 --> 02:19:25.399 align:start position:0%
we're going to hold you in three minutes
 
02:19:26.830 --> 02:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
it just makes
 
02:19:30.629 --> 02:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
sense to get it in electronic format why
 
02:19:35.030 --> 02:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
would you take 1,800 pages of electronic
 
02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
format and transfer it into paper to
 
02:19:40.709 --> 02:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
give it to somebody it doesn't what the
 
02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
city used to do of Rochester they would
 
02:19:45.309 --> 02:19:45.319 align:start position:0%
say do you want it on electronic format
 
02:19:47.509 --> 02:19:47.519 align:start position:0%
or do you want it in paper form if if
 
02:19:49.270 --> 02:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
you wanted in electronic format they
 
02:19:52.270 --> 02:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
said we have thumb drives at $22.50 a
 
02:19:54.910 --> 02:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
piece or you can provide a thumb drive
 
02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
as long as it's brand new so you weren't
 
02:19:59.710 --> 02:19:59.720 align:start position:0%
putting some kind of you know virus into
 
02:20:02.830 --> 02:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
their computer and this just makes sense
 
02:20:04.429 --> 02:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
the other Common Sense part is
 
02:20:06.950 --> 02:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
electronic format is so much easier to
 
02:20:09.550 --> 02:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
share if you have a group that basically
 
02:20:11.630 --> 02:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
wants the same thing everyone doesn't
 
02:20:13.950 --> 02:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
have to go down a city hall and ask for
 
02:20:16.270 --> 02:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
the same thing you can say I'll share it
 
02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
with you recently the uh County of of
 
02:20:21.910 --> 02:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
straford we're all delegate members
 
02:20:24.309 --> 02:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
we're building a new nursing home and I
 
02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
tried to get information I tried to find
 
02:20:28.469 --> 02:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
out how much have we got spent so far in
 
02:20:30.590 --> 02:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
this nursing home and I got five
 
02:20:32.910 --> 02:20:32.920 align:start position:0%
different answers and I could not get
 
02:20:35.150 --> 02:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
the right answer and finally I had to
 
02:20:37.670 --> 02:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
ask a write to no request and I asked
 
02:20:41.070 --> 02:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
for documents in electronic format and I
 
02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
got 54 documents some of them were 20 30
 
02:20:47.710 --> 02:20:47.720 align:start position:0%
pages long it was so convenient to get
 
02:20:49.790 --> 02:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
in an electronic format that you could
 
02:20:52.309 --> 02:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
read and you could put in your own
 
02:20:53.990 --> 02:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
categories instead of having to try to
 
02:20:58.030 --> 02:20:58.040 align:start position:0%
do it with paper it just makes sense and
 
02:21:00.270 --> 02:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
finally what I'll say is
 
02:21:03.030 --> 02:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh when you get in electronic format
 
02:21:05.030 --> 02:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
people like myself that need different
 
02:21:07.630 --> 02:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
glasses to read and magnifying glasses
 
02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
you can zoom The View you can make it so
 
02:21:13.030 --> 02:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
you can understand it and I'll close
 
02:21:17.790 --> 02:21:17.800 align:start position:0%
with this think green view a screen
 
02:21:21.110 --> 02:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
Save the Planet save the trees go
 
02:21:24.429 --> 02:21:24.439 align:start position:0%
electronic thank you questions for this
 
02:21:28.030 --> 02:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
wi thank you very much
 
02:21:30.429 --> 02:21:30.439 align:start position:0%
representative Harrison Thorp from the
 
02:21:31.830 --> 02:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
Rochester voice
 
02:21:31.840 --> 02:21:36.510 align:start position:0%
Rochester voice
please

02:21:36.510 --> 02:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:40.990 --> 02:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
Mr um I mean people of a certain age
 
02:21:43.070 --> 02:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
they remember back in school right
 
02:21:45.670 --> 02:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
Elementary School passing
 
02:21:48.670 --> 02:21:48.680 align:start position:0%
notes passing notes to each other do
 
02:21:54.429 --> 02:21:54.439 align:start position:0%
they do that anymore no they don't so
 
02:21:57.550 --> 02:21:57.560 align:start position:0%
Rochester supplied me with digital right
 
02:22:00.030 --> 02:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
to no request very
 
02:22:03.429 --> 02:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
quickly uh very efficiently within a
 
02:22:06.150 --> 02:22:06.160 align:start position:0%
couple of days sometimes the same day
 
02:22:08.710 --> 02:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
until April 12th when they all a sudden
 
02:22:12.670 --> 02:22:12.680 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily said no more digital uh
 
02:22:15.230 --> 02:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
delivery of right to no
 
02:22:18.870 --> 02:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
requests because you're not a citizen of
 
02:22:24.070 --> 02:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so we've got to clear that
 
02:22:26.670 --> 02:22:26.680 align:start position:0%
up I live a half a
 
02:22:29.870 --> 02:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
mile from New Hampshire predominantly
 
02:22:31.950 --> 02:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
covered 98 just so you'll know Mr Thorp
 
02:22:34.110 --> 02:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
I there I have an amendment along with
 
02:22:35.870 --> 02:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford that we're gonna
 
02:22:38.070 --> 02:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to present when the when
 
02:22:42.110 --> 02:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
the committee uh when we that that does
 
02:22:44.590 --> 02:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
away with the the citizen thing thank
 
02:22:48.190 --> 02:22:48.200 align:start position:0%
you just been I'm a proud Manor Maniac
 
02:22:54.150 --> 02:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:59.030 --> 02:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh it's green as as Cliff said and uh
 
02:22:59.040 --> 02:23:00.230 align:start position:0%
uh it's green as as Cliff said and uh
suddenly

02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
suddenly
 
02:23:03.790 --> 02:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
Rochester is now not even given a
 
02:23:05.309 --> 02:23:05.319 align:start position:0%
citizen of
 
02:23:08.150 --> 02:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
Rochester digital they have to come in
 
02:23:10.950 --> 02:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
and get it in paper form so that is
 
02:23:14.150 --> 02:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely absurd and in the ma past few
 
02:23:16.429 --> 02:23:16.439 align:start position:0%
months the New Hampshire Municipal
 
02:23:20.030 --> 02:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
Association all of a sudden organically
 
02:23:22.070 --> 02:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
started sprouting out going around from
 
02:23:25.950 --> 02:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
town to town to town to town and saying
 
02:23:28.950 --> 02:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh giving lectures giving whatever you
 
02:23:33.510 --> 02:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
call it Forums on how to start making
 
02:23:36.950 --> 02:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
private citizens come into the business
 
02:23:40.230 --> 02:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
office and ask to view during regular
 
02:23:43.510 --> 02:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
business hours which is a huge huge
 
02:23:46.389 --> 02:23:46.399 align:start position:0%
hindrance on any private citizen let
 
02:23:49.550 --> 02:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
alone a news entity like the Rochester
 
02:23:52.510 --> 02:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
voice I mean we're talking about hours
 
02:23:54.750 --> 02:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
and hours and when I did this as I told
 
02:23:58.269 --> 02:23:58.279 align:start position:0%
you before I went into the DPW like
 
02:24:00.269 --> 02:24:00.279 align:start position:0%
attorney o roor from Rochester told me
 
02:24:02.590 --> 02:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
to do I sat in the chart i' like to view
 
02:24:04.950 --> 02:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
some documents and the receptionist goes
 
02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
what what are you talking about just
 
02:24:09.309 --> 02:24:09.319 align:start position:0%
please email it so the receptionist
 
02:24:11.550 --> 02:24:11.560 align:start position:0%
asked me to go back and send in my
 
02:24:11.560 --> 02:24:12.750 align:start position:0%
asked me to go back and send in my
request

02:24:12.750 --> 02:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
request
 
02:24:15.550 --> 02:24:15.560 align:start position:0%
digitally and then the attorney gets the
 
02:24:18.190 --> 02:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
request and then they print up the stuff
 
02:24:19.910 --> 02:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
and say you can come on in and get it
 
02:24:19.920 --> 02:24:21.590 align:start position:0%
and say you can come on in and get it
for

02:24:21.590 --> 02:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:24:23.870 --> 02:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
$3 uh and I just went in there and took
 
02:24:26.309 --> 02:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
pictures of it because I know how to do
 
02:24:26.319 --> 02:24:27.269 align:start position:0%
pictures of it because I know how to do
things

02:24:27.269 --> 02:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:24:29.870 --> 02:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
digitally and I just walked away I said
 
02:24:32.429 --> 02:24:32.439 align:start position:0%
I don't want that pile of paper so
 
02:24:35.830 --> 02:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
please digital makes sense all right
 
02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness seeing none
 
02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:48.269 align:start position:0%
 
please

02:24:48.269 --> 02:24:48.279 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:24:51.550 --> 02:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
Susan Rice 15910 Rod Road Rochester New
 
02:24:56.590 --> 02:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um in the packet of stuff that
 
02:25:00.110 --> 02:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
I had just received um that actually
 
02:25:03.630 --> 02:25:03.640 align:start position:0%
that 91a request um and like most of the
 
02:25:05.710 --> 02:25:05.720 align:start position:0%
requests and I'm not an abuser of the
 
02:25:08.550 --> 02:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
91a requests it's only when I can't find
 
02:25:11.269 --> 02:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
something um that I submit one I always
 
02:25:13.790 --> 02:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
put on there that I prefer to receive it
 
02:25:15.870 --> 02:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
via email or
 
02:25:15.880 --> 02:25:17.710 align:start position:0%
via email or
electronically

02:25:17.710 --> 02:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
02:25:21.630 --> 02:25:21.640 align:start position:0%
um and up until about March or April of
 
02:25:24.309 --> 02:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
this past year um that was pretty much
 
02:25:26.309 --> 02:25:26.319 align:start position:0%
honored and very rarely did I have to go
 
02:25:28.830 --> 02:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
into City Hall to pick something
 
02:25:31.150 --> 02:25:31.160 align:start position:0%
up um and then all of a sudden it
 
02:25:35.110 --> 02:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
changed and this request going through
 
02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
it was all emails and it would have
 
02:25:39.269 --> 02:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
saved myself
 
02:25:42.429 --> 02:25:42.439 align:start position:0%
$488 had I been able to receive that
 
02:25:44.710 --> 02:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
electronically in today's society the
 
02:25:46.870 --> 02:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
ability to communicate electronically
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
and to understand and know what are what
 
02:25:51.510 --> 02:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
is occurring is critical in our
 
02:25:54.030 --> 02:25:54.040 align:start position:0%
government wasteful use of resources
 
02:25:56.670 --> 02:25:56.680 align:start position:0%
such as paper Power Fuel and most and
 
02:25:58.630 --> 02:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
the most precious commodity of all is
 
02:26:03.309 --> 02:26:03.319 align:start position:0%
our time there is also one other factor
 
02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
I may look perfectly normal to the
 
02:26:08.269 --> 02:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
average person with no physical
 
02:26:10.110 --> 02:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
impediments However
 
02:26:13.110 --> 02:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I do suffer from being a
 
02:26:17.110 --> 02:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
diabetic and I have a severe eye issue
 
02:26:19.870 --> 02:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
being able to receive communication via
 
02:26:22.389 --> 02:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
email or electronically is basically
 
02:26:25.269 --> 02:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
invaluable to me no price tag can be
 
02:26:27.510 --> 02:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
placed on a person's vision and the
 
02:26:29.950 --> 02:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
ability to enhance the script to perhaps
 
02:26:32.550 --> 02:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
change the font makes it much easier in
 
02:26:35.309 --> 02:26:35.319 align:start position:0%
my day-to-day living and it also having
 
02:26:37.349 --> 02:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
to take time out of my day I am a
 
02:26:40.110 --> 02:26:40.120 align:start position:0%
business owner in downtown Rochester it
 
02:26:42.510 --> 02:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
just adds one more thing that I have to
 
02:26:45.590 --> 02:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
go and do that I could just open up my
 
02:26:47.750 --> 02:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
email and have that there thank you for
 
02:26:50.150 --> 02:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony thank you questions
 
02:26:52.670 --> 02:26:52.680 align:start position:0%

02:27:15.720 --> 02:27:26.110 align:start position:0%
 
please

02:27:26.110 --> 02:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:28.469 --> 02:27:28.479 align:start position:0%

the New Hampshire press Association is
 
02:27:43.670 --> 02:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
in support of HB
 
02:27:47.429 --> 02:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
1696 um for the basic reason of isn't it
 
02:27:49.110 --> 02:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
obvious it's
 
02:27:51.950 --> 02:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
2024 if something can be emailed email
 
02:27:53.910 --> 02:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
it that's what we all want that's what
 
02:27:56.790 --> 02:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
we all expect and I will just add to
 
02:27:59.190 --> 02:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
everyone you know the the benefits of
 
02:28:00.790 --> 02:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
emailing in
 
02:28:03.630 --> 02:28:03.640 align:start position:0%
documents there's the benefits of of
 
02:28:05.910 --> 02:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
emailing the documents in you know being
 
02:28:08.269 --> 02:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
able to read them everything else for us
 
02:28:10.510 --> 02:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
as a newspaper and for news
 
02:28:12.590 --> 02:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
organizations when documents can be
 
02:28:14.990 --> 02:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
gotten electronically especially larger
 
02:28:16.710 --> 02:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
documents or documents that are spread
 
02:28:19.110 --> 02:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
sheets and things like that you can
 
02:28:21.030 --> 02:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
search the data you can manipulate the
 
02:28:22.710 --> 02:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
data and you can figure out what's going
 
02:28:27.070 --> 02:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
on um as someone who has had to scan in
 
02:28:28.590 --> 02:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
uh document requests that we've gotten
 
02:28:30.830 --> 02:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
in paper I can tell you it's much better
 
02:28:33.349 --> 02:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
to get them electronically so uh I hope
 
02:28:35.110 --> 02:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
you move forward with this I think it
 
02:28:37.910 --> 02:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
could be stronger and require if a
 
02:28:40.710 --> 02:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
document exists electronically that the
 
02:28:43.510 --> 02:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
document is provided electronically um
 
02:28:48.349 --> 02:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
but I uh support it as it is now
 
02:28:53.190 --> 02:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:55.469 --> 02:28:55.479 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
02:28:55.479 --> 02:28:57.269 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
Mr

02:28:57.269 --> 02:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
02:29:04.429 --> 02:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:06.990 --> 02:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chairman Jil Bonet
 
02:29:09.670 --> 02:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
legal director of the ACLU um this is a
 
02:29:12.150 --> 02:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
bill oh thank you this is a bill uh we
 
02:29:14.269 --> 02:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
support I do though think the language
 
02:29:16.269 --> 02:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
canid should be uh stronger and what
 
02:29:17.870 --> 02:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
I'll be doing uh in addition to the
 
02:29:19.030 --> 02:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
written testimony that I'll be
 
02:29:20.950 --> 02:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
submitting to the committee I'll also
 
02:29:22.910 --> 02:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
just submit several potential options
 
02:29:24.349 --> 02:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
for strengthening the language just for
 
02:29:26.429 --> 02:29:26.439 align:start position:0%
the committee's consideration but I do
 
02:29:27.750 --> 02:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
want to Echo what this committee has
 
02:29:29.750 --> 02:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
heard in prior testimony this is like a
 
02:29:32.550 --> 02:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
growing problem actually where even for
 
02:29:34.750 --> 02:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
small number of documents one two three
 
02:29:37.389 --> 02:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
pages that could just easily be emailed
 
02:29:40.750 --> 02:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
at no cost s some cities and towns are
 
02:29:43.030 --> 02:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
just making people show up to the
 
02:29:45.070 --> 02:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
physically during business hours to
 
02:29:46.550 --> 02:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
their city or town hall or to police
 
02:29:48.150 --> 02:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
station to collect documents and I've
 
02:29:49.550 --> 02:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
had this happen to me on multiple
 
02:29:52.389 --> 02:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
occasions Windam Hancock most recently
 
02:29:54.870 --> 02:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester the largest city of the state
 
02:29:56.870 --> 02:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
is requiring that or at least its Police
 
02:29:58.389 --> 02:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
Department is with respect to public
 
02:30:00.910 --> 02:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
records requests even for a two-page
 
02:30:02.630 --> 02:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
police report you need to show up
 
02:30:04.469 --> 02:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
physically and get it and you know I'm a
 
02:30:06.269 --> 02:30:06.279 align:start position:0%
person of privilege and means I can make
 
02:30:09.590 --> 02:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
that happen if you are not that can and
 
02:30:11.590 --> 02:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
becomes a problem it is a needless
 
02:30:14.309 --> 02:30:14.319 align:start position:0%
barrier to access and I don't understand
 
02:30:16.070 --> 02:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
why some cities and towns are doing it I
 
02:30:18.590 --> 02:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
just do not because all it does is
 
02:30:21.230 --> 02:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
hinder transparency and accountability
 
02:30:23.309 --> 02:30:23.319 align:start position:0%
um so I just wanted to kind of uplift
 
02:30:25.429 --> 02:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
some of those concerns um why I think
 
02:30:26.950 --> 02:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
this language could be stronger is
 
02:30:29.190 --> 02:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
because currently the law is permissive
 
02:30:30.910 --> 02:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
right like there is nothing in the law
 
02:30:33.590 --> 02:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
currently that bars a city or town for
 
02:30:36.550 --> 02:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
emailing documents they are able to not
 
02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
do it in part uh because of one reading
 
02:30:41.790 --> 02:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
of the tailor decision which was the is
 
02:30:43.630 --> 02:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
the decision that you were referencing
 
02:30:47.070 --> 02:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
before um you know and I just think uh
 
02:30:49.309 --> 02:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
you know um you know that that that is
 
02:30:51.510 --> 02:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
the state of the law but we we can do
 
02:30:53.630 --> 02:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
better we can change the law to reflect
 
02:30:55.349 --> 02:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
kind of more modern times and given the
 
02:30:58.349 --> 02:30:58.359 align:start position:0%
ease of technology and I think uh we we
 
02:31:00.630 --> 02:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
should do that but this language is just
 
02:31:02.190 --> 02:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
as permissive so it actually is not
 
02:31:03.670 --> 02:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
going I don't think it would change that
 
02:31:06.150 --> 02:31:06.160 align:start position:0%
much Manchester even if this were passed
 
02:31:08.790 --> 02:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
still could just say that's great that
 
02:31:11.550 --> 02:31:11.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not prevented from emailing
 
02:31:13.710 --> 02:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
documents but I still don't have to and
 
02:31:15.950 --> 02:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
I think that is the kind of another
 
02:31:18.030 --> 02:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
layer of concern I have that I think
 
02:31:19.469 --> 02:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
there should be some sort of mandate
 
02:31:21.510 --> 02:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
when it's very reasonable or where the
 
02:31:23.750 --> 02:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
document size is small the committee can
 
02:31:25.429 --> 02:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
consider those options and that's what
 
02:31:28.030 --> 02:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
my testimony does is present some
 
02:31:29.870 --> 02:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
potential proposals there including some
 
02:31:31.910 --> 02:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
proposals based on some other states
 
02:31:34.870 --> 02:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island in Michigan for example so
 
02:31:36.150 --> 02:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
um that would be that would be my
 
02:31:37.790 --> 02:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
feedback we support it but we do think
 
02:31:39.790 --> 02:31:39.800 align:start position:0%
it it can and should be strengthened
 
02:31:42.550 --> 02:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Smith uh thank you
 
02:31:45.790 --> 02:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um I I want to make sure you
 
02:31:48.590 --> 02:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
know that at the moment this bill is
 
02:31:51.469 --> 02:31:51.479 align:start position:0%
scheduled to be exec by this committee
 
02:31:56.150 --> 02:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
on Monday so if you have specific
 
02:32:00.469 --> 02:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
language could you get it to us today so
 
02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
that um if anyone on the committee is
 
02:32:03.840 --> 02:32:05.230 align:start position:0%
that um if anyone on the committee is
moved

02:32:05.230 --> 02:32:05.240 align:start position:0%
moved
 
02:32:07.950 --> 02:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
to prepare an amendment we would have
 
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
time to do that before bundai executive
 
02:32:13.190 --> 02:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
session I just hit sent to the committee
 
02:32:15.269 --> 02:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
so thank you did you send it
 
02:32:18.469 --> 02:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
electronically did it was very easy in
 
02:32:20.510 --> 02:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
fact I didn't have to print it out so
 
02:32:23.790 --> 02:32:23.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative Manos
 
02:32:25.269 --> 02:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:32:28.190 --> 02:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
taking my questions aren't there areas
 
02:32:30.309 --> 02:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
of the state that don't have Broadband
 
02:32:32.870 --> 02:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
access where electronic Division and
 
02:32:35.670 --> 02:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
aren't there certainly individual people
 
02:32:39.550 --> 02:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
who um have Financial barriers to um
 
02:32:41.150 --> 02:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
accessing records
 
02:32:43.950 --> 02:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
electronically yes and that that's why I
 
02:32:45.550 --> 02:32:45.560 align:start position:0%
think one of the one of the proposals
 
02:32:47.710 --> 02:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
you see in the language is that the
 
02:32:49.710 --> 02:32:49.720 align:start position:0%
requestor could actually choose if it's
 
02:32:51.790 --> 02:32:51.800 align:start position:0%
if it's a a size that's very reasonable
 
02:32:54.710 --> 02:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
they could choose it via email but if if
 
02:32:57.469 --> 02:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
not the requestor would prefer to show
 
02:32:59.429 --> 02:32:59.439 align:start position:0%
up they could do that too um and it
 
02:33:02.990 --> 02:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
allows their requestor to um kind of be
 
02:33:05.710 --> 02:33:05.720 align:start position:0%
the one whose accomodations are are met
 
02:33:08.870 --> 02:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
so long as they're reasonable of
 
02:33:11.630 --> 02:33:11.640 align:start position:0%
course questions for this witness so Mr
 
02:33:14.349 --> 02:33:14.359 align:start position:0%
B maybe you can refresh my me memory
 
02:33:16.830 --> 02:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
because I I you remember the name of
 
02:33:19.030 --> 02:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't there some discussion in that
 
02:33:19.040 --> 02:33:20.110 align:start position:0%
wasn't there some discussion in that
case

02:33:20.110 --> 02:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
about the the town having municipalities
 
02:33:26.269 --> 02:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
having some interest in making sure that
 
02:33:29.190 --> 02:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
they had a record that they've you know
 
02:33:33.150 --> 02:33:33.160 align:start position:0%
that they complied and and is is there
 
02:33:35.710 --> 02:33:35.720 align:start position:0%
something is it somehow easier to do
 
02:33:37.269 --> 02:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
that if you if you're talking about
 
02:33:38.990 --> 02:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
paper rather than electronic I just
 
02:33:40.670 --> 02:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
don't remember what yeah so the two
 
02:33:43.030 --> 02:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
cases this is going to get very lawyerly
 
02:33:46.269 --> 02:33:46.279 align:start position:0%
and nerdy I guess uh um so the two cases
 
02:33:47.870 --> 02:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
obviously the the first dealt with was
 
02:33:50.070 --> 02:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
the was the Donna uh green case that had
 
02:33:52.990 --> 02:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
to do with documents in that that were I
 
02:33:55.030 --> 02:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
think either already in electronically
 
02:33:56.830 --> 02:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
accessible form or were easily converted
 
02:33:59.750 --> 02:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
to an electronically accessible form and
 
02:34:01.710 --> 02:34:01.720 align:start position:0%
the court required that they be emailed
 
02:34:04.469 --> 02:34:04.479 align:start position:0%
in that instance with respect to the the
 
02:34:06.630 --> 02:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
tailor case which was uh the the
 
02:34:08.670 --> 02:34:08.680 align:start position:0%
decision from from your honor there was
 
02:34:12.230 --> 02:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
a question of whether documents um uh a
 
02:34:13.750 --> 02:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
similar set of documents though could
 
02:34:15.429 --> 02:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
just be put on a thumb drive or whether
 
02:34:16.950 --> 02:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
they could be email and there were some
 
02:34:20.230 --> 02:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
concerns raised um about kind of cyber
 
02:34:22.510 --> 02:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
security issues there were concerns
 
02:34:24.510 --> 02:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
raised about kind of the ability of the
 
02:34:26.670 --> 02:34:26.680 align:start position:0%
city and town to track how they comply
 
02:34:30.389 --> 02:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
via email um the I'm not going to
 
02:34:32.150 --> 02:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
dispute the validity of those things I
 
02:34:33.750 --> 02:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
think with respect to cyber security
 
02:34:34.830 --> 02:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
though we're dealing with public
 
02:34:37.750 --> 02:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
documents so I it is a concern that I I
 
02:34:39.830 --> 02:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
don't have I I'm less less concerned
 
02:34:40.750 --> 02:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
about though undoubtedly the
 
02:34:43.510 --> 02:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities did there um and and I
 
02:34:45.309 --> 02:34:45.319 align:start position:0%
would like to think that you know we're
 
02:34:47.070 --> 02:34:47.080 align:start position:0%
seven years removed from this decision
 
02:34:49.070 --> 02:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
that we that that emails can be
 
02:34:51.469 --> 02:34:51.479 align:start position:0%
documented in a sufficient way to be
 
02:34:54.030 --> 02:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
able to um enable municipalities to
 
02:34:56.070 --> 02:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
track how they respond sure no that
 
02:34:57.750 --> 02:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
seems that seems completely reasonable
 
02:34:59.429 --> 02:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
to me I'm not disputing the concerns
 
02:35:00.870 --> 02:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
that were raised and they were I'm sure
 
02:35:02.750 --> 02:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
they were developed with evidence you
 
02:35:03.950 --> 02:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
know I think maybe this could be an
 
02:35:05.910 --> 02:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to just do some further
 
02:35:07.830 --> 02:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
modernizing of the statute and I hope i'
 
02:35:10.190 --> 02:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
I've been able to provide examples great
 
02:35:11.550 --> 02:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
 
02:35:14.830 --> 02:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
witness thank you very much uh Katherine
 
02:35:25.389 --> 02:35:25.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:27.389 --> 02:35:27.399 align:start position:0%
thank you um on behalf of right too New
 
02:35:30.269 --> 02:35:30.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we do support this bill as a
 
02:35:33.190 --> 02:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
clarification um I will reiterate what
 
02:35:34.950 --> 02:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
others have said we have seen an
 
02:35:36.630 --> 02:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
increase this is a frequently Asked
 
02:35:38.750 --> 02:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
question actually we get people who ask
 
02:35:41.550 --> 02:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
us about um municipalities particularly
 
02:35:43.190 --> 02:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
Manchester not doing things
 
02:35:44.630 --> 02:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
electronically and we have seen an
 
02:35:47.309 --> 02:35:47.319 align:start position:0%
uptick since that message was relaid out
 
02:35:51.510 --> 02:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
but to nhma members about um not doing
 
02:35:54.670 --> 02:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
so um more concerned about the use of
 
02:35:57.750 --> 02:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
the term citizen in this bill uh it
 
02:35:59.750 --> 02:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
sounds like there may be an amendment
 
02:36:02.030 --> 02:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
posed but I do want to make the
 
02:36:04.630 --> 02:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
committee um aware of the language that
 
02:36:06.670 --> 02:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
is included in the memo that I
 
02:36:08.790 --> 02:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
emphasized in my previous testimony from
 
02:36:12.510 --> 02:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
the AG's office where the AG's memo says
 
02:36:14.790 --> 02:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
that it this um language refers to
 
02:36:16.469 --> 02:36:16.479 align:start position:0%
Citizens but the right to no law does
 
02:36:18.510 --> 02:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
not define this term and uses it nowhere
 
02:36:20.670 --> 02:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
else the statute emphasizes
 
02:36:22.349 --> 02:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
accountability to the people
 
02:36:24.590 --> 02:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
accessibility to the public and the
 
02:36:27.429 --> 02:36:27.439 align:start position:0%
goals of a Democratic Society as an an
 
02:36:29.550 --> 02:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
agency should not therefore require
 
02:36:31.429 --> 02:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
persons requesting access to public
 
02:36:33.469 --> 02:36:33.479 align:start position:0%
documents to demonstrate that they are
 
02:36:35.349 --> 02:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire or of the
 
02:36:39.710 --> 02:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
United States the rk's decision in um
 
02:36:42.389 --> 02:36:42.399 align:start position:0%
the Rochester case also affirmed that
 
02:36:44.070 --> 02:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
there was sort of a very broad use of
 
02:36:45.950 --> 02:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
the term Citizen and we are getting
 
02:36:47.670 --> 02:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
large number of complaints from people
 
02:36:49.790 --> 02:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
saying that this standard is now being
 
02:36:53.830 --> 02:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
applied um so I would recommend changing
 
02:36:56.590 --> 02:36:56.600 align:start position:0%
that language in particular I'm very
 
02:36:58.269 --> 02:36:58.279 align:start position:0%
concerned because I had a member of the
 
02:37:00.349 --> 02:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
press tell me that one of the
 
02:37:02.030 --> 02:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
communities that was instituting this
 
02:37:04.710 --> 02:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
rule would not give them information
 
02:37:07.469 --> 02:37:07.479 align:start position:0%
until they determined where they
 
02:37:09.990 --> 02:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
lived all right thank you questions for
 
02:37:11.750 --> 02:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
this witness and that was not Rochester
 
02:37:14.030 --> 02:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
just to be clear New Hampshire press all
 
02:37:15.230 --> 02:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
right New Hampshire citizen yes
 
02:37:15.240 --> 02:37:16.389 align:start position:0%
right New Hampshire citizen yes
representative

02:37:16.389 --> 02:37:16.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:37:19.510 --> 02:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair I have a question for you
 
02:37:21.910 --> 02:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
unless I'm not looking in the right
 
02:37:25.110 --> 02:37:25.120 align:start position:0%
direction I no longer see um the
 
02:37:27.710 --> 02:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
municipal Association lobbyist in the
 
02:37:31.910 --> 02:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
room and I wonder if we could kind of
 
02:37:34.590 --> 02:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
put out a call to see if he's in the
 
02:37:34.600 --> 02:37:36.950 align:start position:0%
put out a call to see if he's in the
building

02:37:36.950 --> 02:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
building
 
02:37:39.990 --> 02:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
because he the municipal Association
 
02:37:41.830 --> 02:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
seems to be
 
02:37:46.429 --> 02:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
Central to this problem and I think out
 
02:37:48.870 --> 02:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
of respect for the municipal Association
 
02:37:53.910 --> 02:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
we owe it to them uh to listen to their
 
02:37:55.990 --> 02:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
their explanation perhaps they can teach
 
02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:57.269 align:start position:0%
their explanation perhaps they can teach
us

02:37:57.269 --> 02:37:57.279 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:38:00.230 --> 02:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
something yes representative
 
02:38:02.429 --> 02:38:02.439 align:start position:0%
kop thank you uh Mr chairman for
 
02:38:03.710 --> 02:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
recognizing me and thank you
 
02:38:05.469 --> 02:38:05.479 align:start position:0%
representative Smith for bringing that
 
02:38:07.950 --> 02:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
up I did actually text n to ask him
 
02:38:12.230 --> 02:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
about it and he stated that um he is
 
02:38:14.429 --> 02:38:14.439 align:start position:0%
following up to clarify on it he knows
 
02:38:17.110 --> 02:38:17.120 align:start position:0%
that there have been past issues with
 
02:38:19.269 --> 02:38:19.279 align:start position:0%
advice being interpreted incorrectly so
 
02:38:21.389 --> 02:38:21.399 align:start position:0%
he's seeking to clarify and and we'll
 
02:38:23.030 --> 02:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
get back to us once he finds out what
 
02:38:27.389 --> 02:38:27.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:30.990 --> 02:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
given what does that mean I mean I mean
 
02:38:33.150 --> 02:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
is it that
 
02:38:36.590 --> 02:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
he it doesn't help us I think in that it
 
02:38:38.710 --> 02:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
might mean that yes this is exactly what
 
02:38:40.990 --> 02:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
he said but he'd give a better
 
02:38:43.630 --> 02:38:43.640 align:start position:0%
explanation or it might be that this was
 
02:38:47.510 --> 02:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
misunderstood so I think we need to hear
 
02:38:52.750 --> 02:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
and I mean we listen to him a lot and I
 
02:38:55.309 --> 02:38:55.319 align:start position:0%
think we do him a disservice if we're
 
02:38:58.469 --> 02:38:58.479 align:start position:0%
not listening to him on
 
02:39:00.590 --> 02:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
this so what I meant was he said he was
 
02:39:02.349 --> 02:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
going to follow back up on it he wasn't
 
02:39:03.830 --> 02:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
sure which it meant he was going to
 
02:39:05.790 --> 02:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
follow back up sorry I is he still in
 
02:39:09.230 --> 02:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
the building yeah he was following up
 
02:39:13.630 --> 02:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
though um I wonder if we could if we uh
 
02:39:18.150 --> 02:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:24.910 --> 02:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:29.230 --> 02:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
Graves we would I have yes so uh while
 
02:39:32.429 --> 02:39:32.439 align:start position:0%
you're U let me let me
 
02:39:35.670 --> 02:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
call well you're up let me let me call
 
02:39:42.389 --> 02:39:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:47.469 --> 02:39:47.479 align:start position:0%
here okay all right
 
02:39:49.110 --> 02:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
02:39:51.910 --> 02:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Dana Al Nashua
 
02:39:55.750 --> 02:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire just very briefly I uh am
 
02:39:57.910 --> 02:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a frequent flyer on right to
 
02:39:57.920 --> 02:39:58.830 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a frequent flyer on right to
know

02:39:58.830 --> 02:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:40:02.030 --> 02:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
requests uh my typical requests tend to
 
02:40:04.630 --> 02:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
be narrow in scope on average where the
 
02:40:06.590 --> 02:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
responsive documents are only a few
 
02:40:09.309 --> 02:40:09.319 align:start position:0%
pages long again typical some
 
02:40:11.950 --> 02:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
exceptions uh whenever I file one I
 
02:40:16.670 --> 02:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
actually do site uh green vs Au number
 
02:40:20.670 --> 02:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
55 and that's it 168 NH
 
02:40:20.680 --> 02:40:22.429 align:start position:0%
55 and that's it 168 NH
796

02:40:22.429 --> 02:40:22.439 align:start position:0%
796
 
02:40:25.190 --> 02:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
2016 and ask if you've got them in
 
02:40:27.389 --> 02:40:27.399 align:start position:0%
electronic form please give them to me
 
02:40:28.910 --> 02:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
in electronic
 
02:40:28.920 --> 02:40:30.469 align:start position:0%
in electronic
form

02:40:30.469 --> 02:40:30.479 align:start position:0%
form
 
02:40:34.030 --> 02:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
um and people typically reply but I'm
 
02:40:35.790 --> 02:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
guessing the average requestor doesn't
 
02:40:37.670 --> 02:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
do that and I'm hearing there's a
 
02:40:40.790 --> 02:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
problem and I'd anticipate you know if
 
02:40:42.710 --> 02:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
somebody was anxious enough the remedy
 
02:40:45.510 --> 02:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
is they could run down to Superior Court
 
02:40:46.910 --> 02:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
you know complain we're not in
 
02:40:50.110 --> 02:40:50.120 align:start position:0%
compliance with the decision and do a
 
02:40:53.550 --> 02:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
whole lawsuit but that's stupid time is
 
02:40:56.510 --> 02:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
a precious commodity if we can just kind
 
02:40:58.990 --> 02:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
of help everybody out and clarify this
 
02:41:02.750 --> 02:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
in statute and just make it uh sort of
 
02:41:05.230 --> 02:41:05.240 align:start position:0%
more obvious to everyone involved how
 
02:41:07.309 --> 02:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
we'd like this to work that's a good
 
02:41:09.790 --> 02:41:09.800 align:start position:0%
thing so I support this great thank you
 
02:41:12.550 --> 02:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness seeing none
 
02:41:14.510 --> 02:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir thank you Mr
 
02:41:14.520 --> 02:41:17.510 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir thank you Mr
Grace

02:41:17.510 --> 02:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:19.510 --> 02:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh the walls here
 
02:41:22.950 --> 02:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
have ears um Nate Nate gr for the
 
02:41:26.230 --> 02:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
municipal Association um
 
02:41:29.030 --> 02:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
I don't have any opinion on the bill as
 
02:41:31.150 --> 02:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
written um we're neutral on it but I'm
 
02:41:34.830 --> 02:41:34.840 align:start position:0%
happy to Supreme Court president that um
 
02:41:39.590 --> 02:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
if a records request comes in for
 
02:41:39.600 --> 02:41:40.750 align:start position:0%
if a records request comes in for
electronic

02:41:40.750 --> 02:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
electronic
 
02:41:42.950 --> 02:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
materials those materials have to be
 
02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:44.230 align:start position:0%
materials those materials have to be
provided

02:41:44.230 --> 02:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
provided
 
02:41:46.790 --> 02:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
electronically um
 
02:41:49.429 --> 02:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
as far
 
02:41:52.550 --> 02:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
as how those are provided whether via
 
02:41:54.830 --> 02:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
email whether via flash
 
02:41:58.910 --> 02:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
drive um the Supreme Court has at
 
02:42:03.469 --> 02:42:03.479 align:start position:0%
present left that up to Municipal
 
02:42:06.670 --> 02:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
discretion uh
 
02:42:11.469 --> 02:42:11.479 align:start position:0%
so there was a case involving SAU 55 and
 
02:42:13.750 --> 02:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
I don't towns have a policy as to
 
02:42:15.750 --> 02:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
whether those are going to be provide
 
02:42:16.870 --> 02:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
electronically whether they're going to
 
02:42:18.990 --> 02:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
be via flash drive and obviously that
 
02:42:22.150 --> 02:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
has to be applied equally to all
 
02:42:25.309 --> 02:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
requesters as you've heard from other
 
02:42:29.309 --> 02:42:29.319 align:start position:0%
hearings today um there are out of state
 
02:42:32.030 --> 02:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
request stores companies that make
 
02:42:35.670 --> 02:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
requests and it is advisable for our
 
02:42:38.429 --> 02:42:38.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities to consider what their
 
02:42:42.510 --> 02:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
policy is in in relationship to the type
 
02:42:45.670 --> 02:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
of requests they actually receive um
 
02:42:49.710 --> 02:42:49.720 align:start position:0%
most companies in Florida or California
 
02:42:51.630 --> 02:42:51.640 align:start position:0%
are not going to send a representative
 
02:42:54.990 --> 02:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
to the Town Hall in smalltown New
 
02:42:58.309 --> 02:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to go pick up a flash
 
02:43:01.309 --> 02:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
drive but you can't discriminate against
 
02:43:04.110 --> 02:43:04.120 align:start position:0%
out of state versus inst State and then
 
02:43:06.349 --> 02:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
you come up with the citizen debate and
 
02:43:08.990 --> 02:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
what that means
 
02:43:11.309 --> 02:43:11.319 align:start position:0%
but so
 
02:43:15.030 --> 02:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
so let me ask you if the if the if this
 
02:43:17.389 --> 02:43:17.399 align:start position:0%
bill were
 
02:43:20.910 --> 02:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
rewarded um in in the way that I believe
 
02:43:23.030 --> 02:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh Mr bisonet from the ACL suggested
 
02:43:25.870 --> 02:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
that would say that the the requester
 
02:43:28.110 --> 02:43:28.120 align:start position:0%
can kind of request the format that they
 
02:43:31.150 --> 02:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
want the records in um would you have
 
02:43:34.710 --> 02:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:34.720 --> 02:43:37.309 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:43:37.309 --> 02:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:43:41.510 --> 02:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
so yes generally because that means that
 
02:43:43.670 --> 02:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
the government is going to have
 
02:43:48.309 --> 02:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to set up its system
 
02:43:50.990 --> 02:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
in whatever manner the requestor
 
02:43:54.230 --> 02:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
requests if there's some parameters
 
02:43:57.309 --> 02:43:57.319 align:start position:0%
where oh okay but no no I see you're
 
02:43:58.790 --> 02:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
saying but I mean suppose it said that
 
02:44:01.429 --> 02:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
the the the requestor can
 
02:44:04.750 --> 02:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
request that the the format that the
 
02:44:06.670 --> 02:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
records be provided
 
02:44:10.190 --> 02:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
in and the and the municipality must
 
02:44:13.070 --> 02:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
must comply assuming that they have the
 
02:44:15.910 --> 02:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
record stored in the in the format
 
02:44:17.870 --> 02:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
that's requested so they don't in other
 
02:44:19.790 --> 02:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
words you don't have to if if you don't
 
02:44:21.710 --> 02:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
have the records in electronic form you
 
02:44:23.910 --> 02:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
don't have to put them in electronic
 
02:44:27.349 --> 02:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
form but if you do so if I understand
 
02:44:29.510 --> 02:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
correctly what the proposal is is the
 
02:44:32.830 --> 02:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
requestor can say um you know let's say
 
02:44:34.190 --> 02:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
the records are electronically the
 
02:44:35.389 --> 02:44:35.399 align:start position:0%
requestor can say I want them in
 
02:44:38.429 --> 02:44:38.439 align:start position:0%
electronic form don't print them out
 
02:44:41.349 --> 02:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
right right
 
02:44:46.150 --> 02:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
um a as I said um
 
02:44:50.269 --> 02:44:50.279 align:start position:0%
I think the Supreme Court um has
 
02:44:52.790 --> 02:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
been somewhat clear on this and that if
 
02:44:55.190 --> 02:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's Aran electronic record that's the
 
02:44:56.990 --> 02:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
format you're supposed to provide them
 
02:45:01.429 --> 02:45:01.439 align:start position:0%
in the I think one of the open questions
 
02:45:03.830 --> 02:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
is let's say you have a record that
 
02:45:05.309 --> 02:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
needs some sort of
 
02:45:08.830 --> 02:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
redaction um what's the proper way to do
 
02:45:11.510 --> 02:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
that and I assume that where people are
 
02:45:13.150 --> 02:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
getting hard copies instead of
 
02:45:15.389 --> 02:45:15.399 align:start position:0%
electronic copies you have that sit
 
02:45:18.070 --> 02:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
situation where there a redaction needs
 
02:45:22.510 --> 02:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
to be made and for whatever reason um
 
02:45:24.349 --> 02:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
the municipality doesn't have the
 
02:45:27.269 --> 02:45:27.279 align:start position:0%
ability to do that electronically I
 
02:45:28.950 --> 02:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
assume that's the
 
02:45:34.030 --> 02:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:35.910 --> 02:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:45:38.910 --> 02:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:45:42.750 --> 02:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
if the person can State how the format
 
02:45:44.190 --> 02:45:44.200 align:start position:0%
that they're receiving it and I
 
02:45:45.950 --> 02:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
understand electronic vers vers hard
 
02:45:48.070 --> 02:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
carpy that's fine but do you perceive
 
02:45:49.750 --> 02:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
that there may be a potential problem if
 
02:45:51.710 --> 02:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
they could also determine the delivery
 
02:45:54.830 --> 02:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
method such as if it would be sent via
 
02:45:56.950 --> 02:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
email or picked up on a thumb drive the
 
02:45:59.710 --> 02:45:59.720 align:start position:0%
reason why I'm asking that is would some
 
02:46:02.110 --> 02:46:02.120 align:start position:0%
towns potentially not have the ability
 
02:46:04.630 --> 02:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
to email a
 
02:46:07.990 --> 02:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
large sized file that they would need
 
02:46:10.750 --> 02:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
some they would need to give on a on a
 
02:46:13.830 --> 02:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
would that potentially have um
 
02:46:15.590 --> 02:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
electronic consequences that they may
 
02:46:18.190 --> 02:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
may not have ability to do that yes I
 
02:46:20.670 --> 02:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
think so and I email a lot of people and
 
02:46:23.030 --> 02:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
frequently their mailboxes are set at 25
 
02:46:25.590 --> 02:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
megabytes so anything over 25 megabytes
 
02:46:28.590 --> 02:46:28.600 align:start position:0%
is going to kick back so the problem
 
02:46:31.510 --> 02:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
that you end up with is you send the
 
02:46:35.230 --> 02:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
email it goes to the recipient's mailbox
 
02:46:36.349 --> 02:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
quote unquote and then gets
 
02:46:40.030 --> 02:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
automatically rejected um what exactly
 
02:46:42.670 --> 02:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
is the municipality supposed to do after
 
02:46:47.950 --> 02:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
that um one of the one of the issues too
 
02:46:52.990 --> 02:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
is um we want to make sure that the
 
02:46:54.309 --> 02:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
records actually get to who they're
 
02:46:58.309 --> 02:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
supposed to be getting to um so whether
 
02:47:01.630 --> 02:47:01.640 align:start position:0%
that's a read receipt or dep figuring
 
02:47:04.070 --> 02:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
out what's appropriate is a problem as
 
02:47:05.269 --> 02:47:05.279 align:start position:0%
well because we want to make sure that
 
02:47:08.110 --> 02:47:08.120 align:start position:0%
people actually receive those records um
 
02:47:10.670 --> 02:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
so if you do something simple like
 
02:47:13.230 --> 02:47:13.240 align:start position:0%
upload the records to um you know a
 
02:47:16.269 --> 02:47:16.279 align:start position:0%
Google drive or a box or some a Dropbox
 
02:47:18.670 --> 02:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
or something like that um there are
 
02:47:20.990 --> 02:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
settings you can do that tell you you
 
02:47:23.230 --> 02:47:23.240 align:start position:0%
know who downloads them and when or who
 
02:47:26.070 --> 02:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
accesses them and when um but that is
 
02:47:27.790 --> 02:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
all highly dependent on what software is
 
02:47:30.990 --> 02:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
available and what you're using um and
 
02:47:32.469 --> 02:47:32.479 align:start position:0%
people may or may not be willing to
 
02:47:33.910 --> 02:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
click the link that you emailed them
 
02:47:36.150 --> 02:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
that say go to this website to download
 
02:47:39.910 --> 02:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
what your records are um so that's there
 
02:47:42.710 --> 02:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
are a lot of sophisticated technological
 
02:47:45.070 --> 02:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
hurdles that I am not the person to ask
 
02:47:46.550 --> 02:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
about because I just don't know that
 
02:47:47.950 --> 02:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
that background as well right
 
02:47:51.190 --> 02:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you again
 
02:47:53.230 --> 02:47:53.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for having good ears and
 
02:47:57.349 --> 02:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
coming back um can I conclude
 
02:47:59.790 --> 02:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
appropriately that this page that you
 
02:48:00.990 --> 02:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
were just
 
02:48:04.990 --> 02:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
shown um that was posted um in New
 
02:48:08.630 --> 02:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
Durham is not accurate and that in fact
 
02:48:11.550 --> 02:48:11.560 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association has
 
02:48:11.560 --> 02:48:13.150 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association has
not

02:48:13.150 --> 02:48:13.160 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:48:16.110 --> 02:48:16.120 align:start position:0%
said that um
 
02:48:18.710 --> 02:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
um that the town should no longer
 
02:48:23.230 --> 02:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
provide electronic copies of
 
02:48:26.110 --> 02:48:26.120 align:start position:0%
documents I would prefer not to provide
 
02:48:28.190 --> 02:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
comment on anything my members may have
 
02:48:30.750 --> 02:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
posted on their website thank you very
 
02:48:32.389 --> 02:48:32.399 align:start position:0%
much and thank you for letting me ask
 
02:48:33.830 --> 02:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
the question even though I thought I
 
02:48:36.670 --> 02:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
knew what the answer would be thank you
 
02:48:37.990 --> 02:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
all right other questions yes
 
02:48:40.429 --> 02:48:40.439 align:start position:0%
representative CH just just want to
 
02:48:41.870 --> 02:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
follow up on the point you made
 
02:48:43.990 --> 02:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
previously do you feel that the way this
 
02:48:45.469 --> 02:48:45.479 align:start position:0%
is written
 
02:48:48.590 --> 02:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
um it would there there's a reason to
 
02:48:51.389 --> 02:48:51.399 align:start position:0%
specify that the town can respond
 
02:48:54.670 --> 02:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
electronically provided that the person
 
02:48:57.349 --> 02:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
um receiving the information is able to
 
02:48:59.630 --> 02:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
make use of that format or or do you
 
02:49:02.429 --> 02:49:02.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:02.439 --> 02:49:04.550 align:start position:0%
 
covered

02:49:04.550 --> 02:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
covered
 
02:49:09.110 --> 02:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
um so I believe the bill is drafted May
 
02:49:09.120 --> 02:49:10.389 align:start position:0%
um so I believe the bill is drafted May
provide

02:49:10.389 --> 02:49:10.399 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:49:13.389 --> 02:49:13.399 align:start position:0%
some greater specificity to what is
 
02:49:16.910 --> 02:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
already allowed um
 
02:49:20.349 --> 02:49:20.359 align:start position:0%
and I so I think it's it's perfectly
 
02:49:22.830 --> 02:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
permissible for a town to send out
 
02:49:25.910 --> 02:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
records via email not all of them do
 
02:49:29.229 --> 02:49:29.239 align:start position:0%
that obviously but um it's possible if
 
02:49:30.630 --> 02:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
that's within their their policy
 
02:49:33.790 --> 02:49:33.800 align:start position:0%
guidelines so just quick followup so
 
02:49:35.510 --> 02:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
this it would the onus would be on the
 
02:49:37.229 --> 02:49:37.239 align:start position:0%
requester if they're not able to make
 
02:49:40.150 --> 02:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
use of the that format to to follow up
 
02:49:42.429 --> 02:49:42.439 align:start position:0%
is that your
 
02:49:45.389 --> 02:49:45.399 align:start position:0%
thought again I think that it comes down
 
02:49:48.269 --> 02:49:48.279 align:start position:0%
to the question of delivery of Records
 
02:49:51.870 --> 02:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
um you know obviously if it's possible
 
02:49:53.670 --> 02:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
because the person has an email address
 
02:49:56.750 --> 02:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
they can receive it that would be
 
02:50:00.269 --> 02:50:00.279 align:start position:0%
helpful I assume that most people act in
 
02:50:02.510 --> 02:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
a reasonable fashion and if they get an
 
02:50:04.349 --> 02:50:04.359 align:start position:0%
email kicked back that says this was
 
02:50:05.990 --> 02:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
denied because it was over the 25
 
02:50:07.950 --> 02:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
megabyte limit or whatever that someone
 
02:50:09.830 --> 02:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
would follow up with a subsequent email
 
02:50:11.510 --> 02:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
or subsequent contact and say hey we
 
02:50:13.710 --> 02:50:13.720 align:start position:0%
tried to send this to you and you don't
 
02:50:15.150 --> 02:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
seem to have gotten it how would you
 
02:50:19.269 --> 02:50:19.279 align:start position:0%
like it um but that's just my
 
02:50:21.309 --> 02:50:21.319 align:start position:0%
assumption other questions for this
 
02:50:23.510 --> 02:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
witness thank you very much Mr Graves
 
02:50:26.670 --> 02:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um is there anyone else who
 
02:50:30.950 --> 02:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify on House Bill
 
02:50:33.550 --> 02:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
1696 seeing none I'm going to close the
 
02:50:36.070 --> 02:50:36.080 align:start position:0%

1696 and open the hearing on House Bill
 
02:50:45.309 --> 02:50:45.319 align:start position:0%
103 um and um I'll recognize ize

02:51:05.550 --> 02:51:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:09.429 --> 02:51:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:21.870 --> 02:51:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:24.670 --> 02:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
yeah all right uh representative
 
02:51:27.389 --> 02:51:27.399 align:start position:0%
K thank you Mr chairman and honorable
 
02:51:29.190 --> 02:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
members of the Judiciary Committee for
 
02:51:30.990 --> 02:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
the record I'm representative kitlin
 
02:51:34.429 --> 02:51:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:38.110 --> 02:51:38.120 align:start position:0%
Windam this bill seeks to require that
 
02:51:41.670 --> 02:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
if a person is convicted of a violent
 
02:51:45.309 --> 02:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
felony or a crime against a child
 
02:51:46.910 --> 02:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
that the initial Prosecuting
 
02:51:48.990 --> 02:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction would need to be notified
 
02:51:52.349 --> 02:51:52.359 align:start position:0%
if they were requesting a name
 
02:51:55.150 --> 02:51:55.160 align:start position:0%
change the reason behind the bill was if
 
02:51:58.510 --> 02:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
you recall a new story this summer there
 
02:52:00.710 --> 02:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
was a gentleman who was
 
02:52:04.309 --> 02:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for murdering his
 
02:52:04.319 --> 02:52:06.110 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for murdering his
girlfriend

02:52:06.110 --> 02:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
girlfriend
 
02:52:10.030 --> 02:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
and he wanted to change his name from
 
02:52:12.510 --> 02:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
James Covington to Jamari Covington
 
02:52:15.030 --> 02:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
because he wanted to come out of isn't a
 
02:52:15.040 --> 02:52:17.070 align:start position:0%
because he wanted to come out of isn't a
new

02:52:17.070 --> 02:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
new
 
02:52:17.080 --> 02:52:19.590 align:start position:0%
new
man

02:52:19.590 --> 02:52:19.600 align:start position:0%
man
 
02:52:22.269 --> 02:52:22.279 align:start position:0%
and I have a few issues with that one
 
02:52:25.790 --> 02:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
being that his victim doesn't get to
 
02:52:27.309 --> 02:52:27.319 align:start position:0%
ever come out a new person she never
 
02:52:30.590 --> 02:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
gets to go anywhere ever again but I
 
02:52:34.469 --> 02:52:34.479 align:start position:0%
think with that being said
 
02:52:37.070 --> 02:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
we as people in this day and age that
 
02:52:40.110 --> 02:52:40.120 align:start position:0%
have access to electronic things perhaps
 
02:52:42.790 --> 02:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
we we we look into things if we know
 
02:52:44.510 --> 02:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
that our child is asking to go to
 
02:52:46.550 --> 02:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
somebody's house and we aren't familiar
 
02:52:49.590 --> 02:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
with that family we may Google them if
 
02:52:51.070 --> 02:52:51.080 align:start position:0%
somebody's changed their name
 
02:52:52.950 --> 02:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
effectively you might not be able to
 
02:52:57.190 --> 02:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
find their past and if the person is is
 
02:52:57.200 --> 02:52:59.110 align:start position:0%
find their past and if the person is is
seeking

02:52:59.110 --> 02:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
seeking
 
02:53:02.070 --> 02:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
to remove this off of their record in
 
02:53:04.429 --> 02:53:04.439 align:start position:0%
Statue right
 
02:53:06.790 --> 02:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
now the victim would be notified and
 
02:53:09.590 --> 02:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
they'd have an opportunity to to speak
 
02:53:12.790 --> 02:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
to that so I think that we should
 
02:53:16.229 --> 02:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
have some sort of a way for that to
 
02:53:18.670 --> 02:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
happen if the person
 
02:53:21.269 --> 02:53:21.279 align:start position:0%
is seeking to change their name which is
 
02:53:23.309 --> 02:53:23.319 align:start position:0%
effectively kind of clearing clearing
 
02:53:27.710 --> 02:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
their record so this is meant
 
02:53:30.750 --> 02:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we're protecting the
 
02:53:33.830 --> 02:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
public really I'm happy to take any
 
02:53:36.110 --> 02:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
questions questions yes representative
 
02:53:38.550 --> 02:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
Perez thank you for this bill what
 
02:53:41.910 --> 02:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
concerns me would this
 
02:53:44.590 --> 02:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
cover someone changing their name
 
02:53:46.510 --> 02:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
because of marriage it would Co cover
 
02:53:48.550 --> 02:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
that as well if a woman got married and
 
02:53:51.670 --> 02:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
who was a felon of one of these crimes
 
02:53:54.150 --> 02:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
that it would cover that as
 
02:53:56.389 --> 02:53:56.399 align:start position:0%
well yes it
 
02:53:59.429 --> 02:53:59.439 align:start position:0%
would my only concern
 
02:54:04.870 --> 02:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
is that can we definitely count on the
 
02:54:07.670 --> 02:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
Juris Prosecuting
 
02:54:10.389 --> 02:54:10.399 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction getting in touch with the
 
02:54:12.590 --> 02:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
victim if the victim's still alive
 
02:54:16.630 --> 02:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
that's my concern do we want to put in
 
02:54:19.590 --> 02:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
here victim's family or the victim or
 
02:54:22.349 --> 02:54:22.359 align:start position:0%
whatever needs to be notified because I
 
02:54:25.110 --> 02:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
don't think that happens all the time I
 
02:54:27.950 --> 02:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
think things go through the slip through
 
02:54:30.510 --> 02:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
the cracks and maybe it's because I
 
02:54:33.510 --> 02:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
watch too much online TV but I think it
 
02:54:36.790 --> 02:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
happens in real life too so thoughts
 
02:54:38.790 --> 02:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
yeah so that was actually a suggested
 
02:54:42.229 --> 02:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment from the Coalition of domestic
 
02:54:44.309 --> 02:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
violence and sexual assault so I think
 
02:54:45.990 --> 02:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
think that that is definitely something
 
02:54:49.510 --> 02:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
for us to consider and it also included
 
02:54:52.790 --> 02:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
adding in a couple of other crimes um
 
02:54:54.150 --> 02:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
and I
 
02:54:56.710 --> 02:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
think that is another thing to consider
 
02:54:56.720 --> 02:54:58.550 align:start position:0%
think that is another thing to consider
as

02:54:58.550 --> 02:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:55:02.110 --> 02:55:02.120 align:start position:0%
well other questions for this witness
 
02:55:05.950 --> 02:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you Mr chairman um just a
 
02:55:07.830 --> 02:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
quick question do any other states have
 
02:55:12.429 --> 02:55:12.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:15.349 --> 02:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
of I Haven an expl that but like I said
 
02:55:17.510 --> 02:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
we do have a statue in process if you
 
02:55:19.550 --> 02:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
want to clear your your record that you
 
02:55:21.229 --> 02:55:21.239 align:start position:0%
you have to go through a process so I do
 
02:55:22.830 --> 02:55:22.840 align:start position:0%
think you know this is kind of similar
 
02:55:27.309 --> 02:55:27.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:27.319 --> 02:55:29.070 align:start position:0%
 
a

02:55:29.070 --> 02:55:29.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:55:32.870 --> 02:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'm not sure thank you other
 
02:55:34.950 --> 02:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
question yes representative Manos thank
 
02:55:36.910 --> 02:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
02:55:40.229 --> 02:55:40.239 align:start position:0%
question um on line
 
02:55:44.830 --> 02:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
five um says person convicted of a vient
 
02:55:46.950 --> 02:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
violent felony or a crime against a
 
02:55:51.070 --> 02:55:51.080 align:start position:0%
child and then line 12 is more
 
02:55:54.030 --> 02:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
specific and I was wondering about the
 
02:55:57.510 --> 02:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
discrepancy between that between the
 
02:56:00.190 --> 02:56:00.200 align:start position:0%
specification on line 12 and the lack of
 
02:56:03.429 --> 02:56:03.439 align:start position:0%
specification on line
 
02:56:05.990 --> 02:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
five so I was trying not to be
 
02:56:08.990 --> 02:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
duplicative in nature by just listing
 
02:56:11.389 --> 02:56:11.399 align:start position:0%
the offenses here because we don't have
 
02:56:14.590 --> 02:56:14.600 align:start position:0%
a definition currently in statue of
 
02:56:16.349 --> 02:56:16.359 align:start position:0%
these crimes I was trying to list out
 
02:56:21.550 --> 02:56:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:21.560 --> 02:56:24.670 align:start position:0%
 
be

02:56:24.670 --> 02:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:29.750 --> 02:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
yes it seems to me that line five would
 
02:56:31.590 --> 02:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
that there could be a discrepancy
 
02:56:34.469 --> 02:56:34.479 align:start position:0%
because line five does is not specific
 
02:56:37.670 --> 02:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
and so it could include violent felonies
 
02:56:41.550 --> 02:56:41.560 align:start position:0%
or crimes against a child that are not
 
02:56:46.510 --> 02:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:50.710 --> 02:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
I would be amable to a amending the bill
 
02:56:54.070 --> 02:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
to add this in as a definition instead
 
02:56:57.070 --> 02:56:57.080 align:start position:0%
and then you know at I guess at the top
 
02:56:58.910 --> 02:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
as as a definition of what it is and
 
02:57:00.790 --> 02:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
then just using that terminology if you
 
02:57:03.030 --> 02:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
feel that that would clarify it better
 
02:57:03.040 --> 02:57:07.349 align:start position:0%
feel that that would clarify it better
thank

02:57:07.349 --> 02:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:10.550 --> 02:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
you representative Waltz thank you for
 
02:57:12.630 --> 02:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question um looks like maybe
 
02:57:14.950 --> 02:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
an oversight but on line six
 
02:57:16.550 --> 02:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh it says the petitioner shall make a
 
02:57:18.590 --> 02:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
compelling showing I mean do we need
 
02:57:20.630 --> 02:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
another word in like
 
02:57:23.550 --> 02:57:23.560 align:start position:0%
statement so this was this statue was
 
02:57:26.150 --> 02:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
already in place but it was only in
 
02:57:29.550 --> 02:57:29.560 align:start position:0%
place to notify the department of safety
 
02:57:31.269 --> 02:57:31.279 align:start position:0%
so that wasn't terminology that I
 
02:57:32.870 --> 02:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
already had in here the Bold is the part
 
02:57:34.950 --> 02:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
that I've added so this currently if
 
02:57:36.870 --> 02:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
somebody was currently incarcerated then
 
02:57:38.349 --> 02:57:38.359 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections would have
 
02:57:40.590 --> 02:57:40.600 align:start position:0%
to be notified but then there's nothing
 
02:57:43.990 --> 02:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
requiring once the person leaves prison
 
02:57:47.190 --> 02:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
for anybody to be notified and further I
 
02:57:48.510 --> 02:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
there was a case that slipped through
 
02:57:50.429 --> 02:57:50.439 align:start position:0%
the cracks because the Department of
 
02:57:51.950 --> 02:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
Corrections was notified but it was the
 
02:57:53.990 --> 02:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
inproper person that was notified or the
 
02:57:57.630 --> 02:57:57.640 align:start position:0%
improper department and not the
 
02:57:59.030 --> 02:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
prosecuting District they they were
 
02:58:00.710 --> 02:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
never notified so that's just seeking to
 
02:58:04.670 --> 02:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
clarify that but uh if you think that
 
02:58:07.030 --> 02:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
what's currently in statute
 
02:58:09.469 --> 02:58:09.479 align:start position:0%
is just awkward to
 
02:58:12.429 --> 02:58:12.439 align:start position:0%
read I'm amable to to changing it thank
 
02:58:14.750 --> 02:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
you other question questions for this
 
02:58:17.870 --> 02:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you next I'm
 
02:58:23.349 --> 02:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
going to call on um hamela uh Kelly or

Pamela kyg and I'm the public policy
 
02:58:44.389 --> 02:58:44.399 align:start position:0%
specialist at the new Hampshire
 
02:58:46.630 --> 02:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
Coalition against Domestic and Sexual
 
02:58:48.710 --> 02:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
Violence as you might know the Coalition
 
02:58:50.389 --> 02:58:50.399 align:start position:0%
is the umbrella Organization for our
 
02:58:52.190 --> 02:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
state's 12 community- based crisis
 
02:58:55.790 --> 02:58:55.800 align:start position:0%
centers that serve uh nearly 14,000
 
02:58:57.550 --> 02:58:57.560 align:start position:0%
victims and survivors of Domestic and
 
02:59:00.030 --> 02:59:00.040 align:start position:0%
Sexual Violence each year um today I am
 
02:59:03.790 --> 02:59:03.800 align:start position:0%
here in support um of HB 13 which is an
 
02:59:05.070 --> 02:59:05.080 align:start position:0%
important Public Safety and
 
02:59:06.790 --> 02:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
accountability measure when it comes to
 
02:59:09.070 --> 02:59:09.080 align:start position:0%
addressing violent crimes in our state
 
02:59:11.790 --> 02:59:11.800 align:start position:0%
um as uh the representative uh sponsor
 
02:59:14.309 --> 02:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned I do have a couple of proposed
 
02:59:15.990 --> 02:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
amendments that I think could strengthen
 
02:59:19.389 --> 02:59:19.399 align:start position:0%
or lend to the spirit of the bill um and
 
02:59:21.510 --> 02:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to walk through U my testimony
 
02:59:25.910 --> 02:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
now um so as you heard hb13 will require
 
02:59:27.790 --> 02:59:27.800 align:start position:0%
offenders who have committed certain
 
02:59:29.750 --> 02:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
violent crimes to demonstrate a
 
02:59:31.670 --> 02:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
compelling reason for changing their
 
02:59:34.830 --> 02:59:34.840 align:start position:0%
name before it can be granted by a court
 
02:59:37.269 --> 02:59:37.279 align:start position:0%
under current law right now you can
 
02:59:40.030 --> 02:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
murder someone and change your name why
 
02:59:42.670 --> 02:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
is that acceptable this means that a
 
02:59:44.830 --> 02:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
name change is essentially equivalent to
 
02:59:46.750 --> 02:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
a clean slate for someone who does not
 
02:59:50.190 --> 02:59:50.200 align:start position:0%
want to be discoverable as a criminal
 
02:59:53.229 --> 02:59:53.239 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we are aware of many um
 
02:59:54.790 --> 02:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
cases where offenders have changed their
 
02:59:57.510 --> 02:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
names for the exact reason to further
 
03:00:00.070 --> 03:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
victimization to conceal and hide their
 
03:00:02.309 --> 03:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
identity this is especially true in
 
03:00:04.110 --> 03:00:04.120 align:start position:0%
cases of Domestic and Sexual Violence
 
03:00:06.229 --> 03:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
where an abuser often has multiple
 
03:00:09.229 --> 03:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
victims true accountability cannot exist
 
03:00:11.510 --> 03:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
without an honest recognition of the
 
03:00:13.190 --> 03:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
harm caused and the impact that the
 
03:00:15.150 --> 03:00:15.160 align:start position:0%
crime had on a victim in the community
 
03:00:17.830 --> 03:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
at large uh we should all have a vested
 
03:00:19.670 --> 03:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
interest in policy initiatives that will
 
03:00:22.630 --> 03:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
help prevent further harm we know that
 
03:00:25.030 --> 03:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
being able to vet an individual's past
 
03:00:27.429 --> 03:00:27.439 align:start position:0%
offenses is a critical step to assessing
 
03:00:29.349 --> 03:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
the level of danger someone may pose to
 
03:00:31.150 --> 03:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
victims in their communities and we
 
03:00:33.309 --> 03:00:33.319 align:start position:0%
cannot adequately respond to violence if
 
03:00:35.710 --> 03:00:35.720 align:start position:0%
we pretend that it never occurred this
 
03:00:38.630 --> 03:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
change to our state law is long overdue
 
03:00:40.950 --> 03:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
um often after a violent crime occurs
 
03:00:42.790 --> 03:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
such as domestic violence homicide or
 
03:00:44.750 --> 03:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
sexual assault people say I can't
 
03:00:47.269 --> 03:00:47.279 align:start position:0%
believe this happened in my community
 
03:00:48.830 --> 03:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
when violent offenders change their
 
03:00:51.269 --> 03:00:51.279 align:start position:0%
names both victims and communities face
 
03:00:53.510 --> 03:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
an added barrier to being informed about
 
03:00:55.630 --> 03:00:55.640 align:start position:0%
an offender's whereabouts this
 
03:00:57.990 --> 03:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
experience is stressful for victims and
 
03:01:00.030 --> 03:01:00.040 align:start position:0%
dangerous for communities people who
 
03:01:01.670 --> 03:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
have committed violent crimes shouldn't
 
03:01:03.429 --> 03:01:03.439 align:start position:0%
be allowed to change their name simply
 
03:01:05.630 --> 03:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
because they want to reinvent themselves
 
03:01:07.389 --> 03:01:07.399 align:start position:0%
our communities are at risk when violent
 
03:01:10.150 --> 03:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
histories are erased from public memory
 
03:01:12.309 --> 03:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
nobody knows more about the level of
 
03:01:13.950 --> 03:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
dangerousness than the person who has
 
03:01:16.070 --> 03:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
been harmed by the offender yet victim's
 
03:01:17.950 --> 03:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
experiences are rarely considered
 
03:01:19.710 --> 03:01:19.720 align:start position:0%
credible assessments of an offender's
 
03:01:21.990 --> 03:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
behavior and their input is often not
 
03:01:23.870 --> 03:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
treated as valuable and essential
 
03:01:25.389 --> 03:01:25.399 align:start position:0%
component to their Criminal Justice
 
03:01:27.790 --> 03:01:27.800 align:start position:0%
System um I really appreciate
 
03:01:29.830 --> 03:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
representative Perez's question because
 
03:01:31.910 --> 03:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
we agree that we think um a provision
 
03:01:34.670 --> 03:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
should be included in this to include uh
 
03:01:37.510 --> 03:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
victim input um because victim input is
 
03:01:39.630 --> 03:01:39.640 align:start position:0%
critical throughout the criminal justice
 
03:01:42.910 --> 03:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
process not just uh prior to sentencing
 
03:01:45.469 --> 03:01:45.479 align:start position:0%
um and there are a few um examples of
 
03:01:48.630 --> 03:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
where um in statute the there already is
 
03:01:50.910 --> 03:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
a place for victims to provide input um
 
03:01:52.670 --> 03:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
and I have an amendment and some
 
03:01:54.870 --> 03:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
examples that I can pass around to the
 
03:01:57.910 --> 03:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
committee um judges cannot appropriately
 
03:02:00.309 --> 03:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
issue a decision that impacts the victim
 
03:02:02.309 --> 03:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
in broader Public Safety without hearing
 
03:02:03.910 --> 03:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
from the people who have been most
 
03:02:06.510 --> 03:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
impacted by the crimes committed um and
 
03:02:09.150 --> 03:02:09.160 align:start position:0%
as also uh addressed we think that it
 
03:02:11.830 --> 03:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
would be beneficial that the definitions
 
03:02:14.030 --> 03:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
of violent crimes in the statute align
 
03:02:16.150 --> 03:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
with the annulment statute um because
 
03:02:18.790 --> 03:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
that is a great standard uh for the list
 
03:02:21.349 --> 03:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
of violent offenses and would be allow
 
03:02:23.469 --> 03:02:23.479 align:start position:0%
these two um statutes to really
 
03:02:26.269 --> 03:02:26.279 align:start position:0%
complement each other um so I think just
 
03:02:28.510 --> 03:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
to wrap up my testimony we have an opp
 
03:02:30.670 --> 03:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity here to take the steps
 
03:02:32.389 --> 03:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
necessary to improve our state's
 
03:02:34.429 --> 03:02:34.439 align:start position:0%
response to the devastating impact that
 
03:02:35.950 --> 03:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
these violent crimes have in our
 
03:02:38.150 --> 03:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
communities um and this bill will serve
 
03:02:39.790 --> 03:02:39.800 align:start position:0%
as an important tool to prevent
 
03:02:41.590 --> 03:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
dangerous people from hiding in plain
 
03:02:43.550 --> 03:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
sight we need to take the safety
 
03:02:45.070 --> 03:02:45.080 align:start position:0%
concerns of victims and their families
 
03:02:47.469 --> 03:02:47.479 align:start position:0%
seriously um and this cannot be achieved
 
03:02:49.630 --> 03:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
when people who harmed them can erase
 
03:02:51.870 --> 03:02:51.880 align:start position:0%
their identity uh I really appreciate
 
03:02:53.229 --> 03:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
your time here today and thank you and
 
03:02:55.349 --> 03:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any questions
 
03:02:57.870 --> 03:02:57.880 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
03:03:01.550 --> 03:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
witness I don't see any so can you send
 
03:03:03.830 --> 03:03:03.840 align:start position:0%

amendments can you send them oh or I'm

03:03:39.830 --> 03:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
please good
 
03:03:42.190 --> 03:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
morning um I'm very nervous I've never
 
03:03:46.990 --> 03:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:51.349 --> 03:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
um my name is Bonnie Sider and I wanted
 
03:03:53.429 --> 03:03:53.439 align:start position:0%
to tell you about my personal experience
 
03:03:57.710 --> 03:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:00.670 --> 03:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
hb13 um a few years ago I sought the
 
03:04:03.110 --> 03:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
support of a licensed counselor I wanted
 
03:04:05.110 --> 03:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure that I identified someone
 
03:04:07.229 --> 03:04:07.239 align:start position:0%
who seemed trustworthy so I spent time
 
03:04:09.389 --> 03:04:09.399 align:start position:0%
carefully researching the backgrounds of
 
03:04:12.349 --> 03:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
different counselors in my area no raed
 
03:04:14.510 --> 03:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
flages appeared and everything seemed
 
03:04:16.309 --> 03:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
fine so I moved forward with scheduling
 
03:04:19.070 --> 03:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
an appointment I would later learn that
 
03:04:20.990 --> 03:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
my counselor was involved in three fatal
 
03:04:23.670 --> 03:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
car crashes due to drunk driving and had
 
03:04:25.550 --> 03:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
a history of drunk and driving
 
03:04:27.590 --> 03:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
convictions he was later the first
 
03:04:29.550 --> 03:04:29.560 align:start position:0%
person in New Hampshire to be convicted
 
03:04:31.950 --> 03:04:31.960 align:start position:0%
of manslaughter for a drunk and driving
 
03:04:33.830 --> 03:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
fatality I never would have moved
 
03:04:35.349 --> 03:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
forward with scheduling to see this
 
03:04:37.229 --> 03:04:37.239 align:start position:0%
counselor had I known about his
 
03:04:40.790 --> 03:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
extensive criminal history and
 
03:04:42.950 --> 03:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
incarceration this lack of information
 
03:04:45.110 --> 03:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately Ely led me to be alone in a
 
03:04:46.830 --> 03:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
room with a man who was very
 
03:04:49.429 --> 03:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
manipulative and unsafe he sexually
 
03:04:51.750 --> 03:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
assaulted me on multiple occasions and
 
03:04:53.550 --> 03:04:53.560 align:start position:0%
to this day the criminal case against
 
03:04:56.150 --> 03:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
him is ongoing I had done my due
 
03:04:58.590 --> 03:04:58.600 align:start position:0%
diligence but I had researched the wrong
 
03:05:00.990 --> 03:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
man the state allowed him to change his
 
03:05:03.670 --> 03:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
name while incarcerated he hadn't even
 
03:05:05.469 --> 03:05:05.479 align:start position:0%
been released before working on his
 
03:05:05.479 --> 03:05:06.830 align:start position:0%
been released before working on his
Clean

03:05:06.830 --> 03:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
Clean
 
03:05:09.469 --> 03:05:09.479 align:start position:0%
Slate because he was able to erase his
 
03:05:11.309 --> 03:05:11.319 align:start position:0%
pass through a name change I was
 
03:05:13.389 --> 03:05:13.399 align:start position:0%
prevented from truly being able to make
 
03:05:16.349 --> 03:05:16.359 align:start position:0%
decisions that were best for my safety
 
03:05:17.790 --> 03:05:17.800 align:start position:0%
it never occurred to me that my
 
03:05:20.110 --> 03:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
counselor would have changed his name
 
03:05:22.229 --> 03:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
and that that name change was preventing
 
03:05:24.510 --> 03:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
me from learning that he was a dangerous
 
03:05:27.190 --> 03:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
person after learning the truth I felt
 
03:05:30.389 --> 03:05:30.399 align:start position:0%
so angry and betrayed one of the victims
 
03:05:32.469 --> 03:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
killed by my counselor was a little girl
 
03:05:35.030 --> 03:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
who was hit on the side of the road just
 
03:05:36.950 --> 03:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
after attending a fundraiser with her
 
03:05:39.469 --> 03:05:39.479 align:start position:0%
father I became even angrier when I
 
03:05:41.110 --> 03:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
found out that the parents of that
 
03:05:43.309 --> 03:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
little girl would have opposed his name
 
03:05:45.030 --> 03:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
change but were not given the
 
03:05:47.349 --> 03:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to weigh in they were only
 
03:05:49.870 --> 03:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
notified by prosecutors after the change
 
03:05:52.469 --> 03:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
had been granted not only were the
 
03:05:54.630 --> 03:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
parents unable to provide a statement on
 
03:05:57.590 --> 03:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
the serious harm and pain this this man
 
03:06:00.150 --> 03:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
had caused them but Public Safety was
 
03:06:01.950 --> 03:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
jeopardized as he was allowed to
 
03:06:05.429 --> 03:06:05.439 align:start position:0%
victimize other people victims of crime
 
03:06:07.309 --> 03:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
and their family members should be part
 
03:06:09.510 --> 03:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
of the process it's not enough for
 
03:06:11.150 --> 03:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
notification to be made to the
 
03:06:13.750 --> 03:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
prosecuting agency they need to be
 
03:06:16.750 --> 03:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
directly looped in their experiences and
 
03:06:19.429 --> 03:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
what they know about an offender matter
 
03:06:21.830 --> 03:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
I know this from my own experiences as
 
03:06:24.510 --> 03:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
my sexual assault case is still pending
 
03:06:27.269 --> 03:06:27.279 align:start position:0%
going into year four and scheduled
 
03:06:30.630 --> 03:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
hearing number 25 with zero progress in
 
03:06:33.630 --> 03:06:33.640 align:start position:0%
the case I have been repeatedly kept out
 
03:06:35.630 --> 03:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
of the loop by the prosecutor's office
 
03:06:37.389 --> 03:06:37.399 align:start position:0%
and not informed of my rights as a
 
03:06:39.510 --> 03:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
victim of crime to weigh in and be in
 
03:06:41.550 --> 03:06:41.560 align:start position:0%
court had the parents of that little
 
03:06:43.469 --> 03:06:43.479 align:start position:0%
girl been given the chance to speak at
 
03:06:45.190 --> 03:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
the hearing where my counselor was
 
03:06:47.469 --> 03:06:47.479 align:start position:0%
granted a name change the judge might
 
03:06:49.830 --> 03:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
have had more information to consider
 
03:06:51.510 --> 03:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
and I would have had the opportunity to
 
03:06:53.150 --> 03:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
know the truth and make an informed
 
03:06:56.070 --> 03:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
decision about my counselor thank you
 
03:06:57.349 --> 03:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
and I would be happy to take any
 
03:07:00.150 --> 03:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this
 
03:07:03.510 --> 03:07:03.520 align:start position:0%

please

03:07:18.830 --> 03:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:21.309 --> 03:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
thank you good afternoon thank you Mr
 
03:07:23.229 --> 03:07:23.239 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee my
 
03:07:25.349 --> 03:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
name is Mary benia I'm a lieutenant with
 
03:07:27.710 --> 03:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
the state police um I oversee the
 
03:07:30.269 --> 03:07:30.279 align:start position:0%
records information services for state
 
03:07:33.070 --> 03:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
police and I've been on for 20 years now
 
03:07:35.190 --> 03:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
um State Police is in support of this
 
03:07:37.429 --> 03:07:37.439 align:start position:0%
bill and for a few reasons and a lot
 
03:07:39.790 --> 03:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
have already been mentioned um this
 
03:07:41.349 --> 03:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
allows violent criminals for for
 
03:07:43.510 --> 03:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
concealing themselves if not pass and
 
03:07:44.830 --> 03:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
having the opportunity to commit
 
03:07:49.190 --> 03:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
additional um crimes it also allows this
 
03:07:51.950 --> 03:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
bill will allow victims that ability to
 
03:07:54.110 --> 03:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
um oversee the identity of that person
 
03:07:55.510 --> 03:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
because there are victims out there that
 
03:07:57.349 --> 03:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
may follow their offenders to make sure
 
03:07:59.590 --> 03:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
they're in a good safe place from where
 
03:08:02.190 --> 03:08:02.200 align:start position:0%
they're located it's also good for the
 
03:08:03.870 --> 03:08:03.880 align:start position:0%
public um as mentioned earlier with
 
03:08:05.590 --> 03:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
Google and different open sources you're
 
03:08:07.349 --> 03:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
allowed to use in order to track
 
03:08:09.030 --> 03:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
individuals and look them up and see if
 
03:08:10.389 --> 03:08:10.399 align:start position:0%
it's somebody you want your family
 
03:08:12.190 --> 03:08:12.200 align:start position:0%
around or your neighbors around and
 
03:08:13.790 --> 03:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
where they're living along with
 
03:08:15.750 --> 03:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
employers and communities there is some
 
03:08:17.349 --> 03:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
employment around here that does require
 
03:08:19.469 --> 03:08:19.479 align:start position:0%
fingerprint checks and those kind of
 
03:08:20.790 --> 03:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
different situations but there's a lot
 
03:08:22.990 --> 03:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
of Employments that don't require that
 
03:08:24.750 --> 03:08:24.760 align:start position:0%
kind of information to be done before
 
03:08:27.150 --> 03:08:27.160 align:start position:0%
they're um employed somewhere and being
 
03:08:29.070 --> 03:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
able to Google someone or look up their
 
03:08:30.630 --> 03:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
history or do some sort of background
 
03:08:32.269 --> 03:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
check that they do through their own
 
03:08:34.030 --> 03:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
they can do it that way it also with the
 
03:08:35.389 --> 03:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
criminal records division needs to
 
03:08:37.710 --> 03:08:37.720 align:start position:0%
connect those um records with the master
 
03:08:39.469 --> 03:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
name to the Alias name that now they are
 
03:08:41.710 --> 03:08:41.720 align:start position:0%
changing their name to because their um
 
03:08:43.309 --> 03:08:43.319 align:start position:0%
birth name will always be their Master
 
03:08:45.349 --> 03:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
name in that kind of situation so it
 
03:08:47.309 --> 03:08:47.319 align:start position:0%
gives a little bit of it could take a
 
03:08:48.790 --> 03:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
little of a delay and in that small
 
03:08:50.550 --> 03:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
delay something could happen if that is
 
03:08:53.110 --> 03:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
not taken care of so State Police is in
 
03:08:55.670 --> 03:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
support of this Bill thank you questions
 
03:08:57.429 --> 03:08:57.439 align:start position:0%
for this
 
03:09:00.190 --> 03:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
witness Mr chair oh yes representative
 
03:09:01.910 --> 03:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
Loreno thank you for taking my question
 
03:09:04.190 --> 03:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chair um so I'm
 
03:09:06.469 --> 03:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
thinking about um the sexual offender
 
03:09:09.710 --> 03:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
registry let's say that we have um a
 
03:09:13.309 --> 03:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
person um who serve time and um now
 
03:09:14.870 --> 03:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
they're listed on a sexual offender
 
03:09:17.910 --> 03:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
registry so if they happen to change
 
03:09:21.710 --> 03:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
their name um is that reflected on the
 
03:09:25.030 --> 03:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
registry at all it would be reflected
 
03:09:27.349 --> 03:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
when um the sex offender registry re
 
03:09:29.030 --> 03:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
receives name changes because they are
 
03:09:30.790 --> 03:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
required right now in this law to be
 
03:09:32.429 --> 03:09:32.439 align:start position:0%
served if they are registering as a sex
 
03:09:35.070 --> 03:09:35.080 align:start position:0%
offender the department of safety um we
 
03:09:37.110 --> 03:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
do oppose those name changes due do the
 
03:09:39.030 --> 03:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
consequences that some may face down the
 
03:09:42.150 --> 03:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
line um and most of the time they are
 
03:09:43.910 --> 03:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
they're not granted a name change but if
 
03:09:46.790 --> 03:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
it is reflected then it would be in
 
03:09:50.750 --> 03:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
there and um yeah please go ahead may I
 
03:09:53.349 --> 03:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
follow up so um if this bill were to
 
03:09:56.750 --> 03:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
pass how would it affect um people from
 
03:09:59.349 --> 03:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:03.510 --> 03:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:08.030 --> 03:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes so if they came um I think
 
03:10:09.389 --> 03:10:09.399 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to do a name
 
03:10:11.110 --> 03:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
change if their state requires it if
 
03:10:13.269 --> 03:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
they're in a different state I don't I'm
 
03:10:15.190 --> 03:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
not aware if New Hampshire gets notified
 
03:10:16.630 --> 03:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
if there's something that happens in New
 
03:10:18.269 --> 03:10:18.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of that name change because
 
03:10:20.309 --> 03:10:20.319 align:start position:0%
now they're in another state so like a
 
03:10:21.870 --> 03:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
sex offender when they leave New
 
03:10:23.469 --> 03:10:23.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they register out of the city
 
03:10:25.229 --> 03:10:25.239 align:start position:0%
or town they're registered in and then
 
03:10:26.710 --> 03:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
they have to register as to where they
 
03:10:28.590 --> 03:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
go so that should
 
03:10:31.870 --> 03:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
be done in their state thank you thank
 
03:10:35.070 --> 03:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
you other questions for this witness
 
03:10:36.670 --> 03:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
03:10:38.429 --> 03:10:38.439 align:start position:0%
you next I'm going to call on Steve
 
03:10:38.439 --> 03:10:41.830 align:start position:0%
you next I'm going to call on Steve
Anders

03:10:41.830 --> 03:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:41.840 --> 03:10:53.309 align:start position:0%
 
please

03:10:53.309 --> 03:10:53.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:54.670 --> 03:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman members of the
 
03:10:56.229 --> 03:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Stephen andris I'm
 
03:10:59.309 --> 03:10:59.319 align:start position:0%
an assistant County attorney in Marram
 
03:11:03.550 --> 03:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
County I've been a prosecutor now for um
 
03:11:07.269 --> 03:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
about 23 years maybe a little over that
 
03:11:10.070 --> 03:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh we are in support of of this bill in
 
03:11:10.080 --> 03:11:11.469 align:start position:0%
uh we are in support of of this bill in
the

03:11:11.469 --> 03:11:11.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:11:14.630 --> 03:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
language with regard to the uh the two
 
03:11:16.710 --> 03:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
potential amendments the first one being
 
03:11:18.229 --> 03:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
mandatory victim
 
03:11:21.070 --> 03:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
notification I I think notifying the
 
03:11:23.590 --> 03:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
prosecutor's office is is adequate I
 
03:11:25.070 --> 03:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
don't know that you want to put language
 
03:11:28.309 --> 03:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
in about mandatory victim notification
 
03:11:30.190 --> 03:11:30.200 align:start position:0%
the reason I say that is we have cases
 
03:11:31.630 --> 03:11:31.640 align:start position:0%
where we have victims who essentially
 
03:11:33.830 --> 03:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
tell us I don't ever want to hear from
 
03:11:36.550 --> 03:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
you again the case is closed I'm moving
 
03:11:39.030 --> 03:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
on with my life and every time I get a
 
03:11:40.550 --> 03:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
call from the county attorney's office
 
03:11:43.229 --> 03:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
or with reference to what happened in my
 
03:11:44.990 --> 03:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
case it brings back a lot of trauma so
 
03:11:46.910 --> 03:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
we've certainly had victims indicate
 
03:11:48.429 --> 03:11:48.439 align:start position:0%
please don't call me in the future and I
 
03:11:50.550 --> 03:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
think that that that should be
 
03:11:53.190 --> 03:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
respected with reference to amending
 
03:11:53.200 --> 03:11:54.550 align:start position:0%
respected with reference to amending
this

03:11:54.550 --> 03:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:11:57.590 --> 03:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
to um reflect the enement statute I
 
03:11:59.070 --> 03:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
think that's a great idea in New
 
03:12:00.790 --> 03:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have an annulment Statute
 
03:12:02.309 --> 03:12:02.319 align:start position:0%
in RSA
 
03:12:04.830 --> 03:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
6515 which allows people to enol their
 
03:12:07.469 --> 03:12:07.479 align:start position:0%
criminal records in certain
 
03:12:10.070 --> 03:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
circumstances there are certain crimes
 
03:12:11.670 --> 03:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
listed in
 
03:12:17.030 --> 03:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
6515 subsection uh 13 and 14 for which a
 
03:12:20.150 --> 03:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
person cannot get an anold an analment
 
03:12:22.790 --> 03:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
those are violent crimes as well as
 
03:12:25.150 --> 03:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
crimes of obstruction of
 
03:12:28.670 --> 03:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
justice that list is more inclusive uh
 
03:12:30.070 --> 03:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
than the list that's contained within
 
03:12:32.630 --> 03:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
the current bill I would note that the
 
03:12:35.030 --> 03:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
current bill has second degree assault
 
03:12:37.389 --> 03:12:37.399 align:start position:0%
and trafficking in persons listed in it
 
03:12:39.190 --> 03:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
which is not listed in the analment
 
03:12:41.830 --> 03:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
statute so if a person was convicted of
 
03:12:43.030 --> 03:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
second degree assault they could
 
03:12:45.349 --> 03:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
potentially anull that conviction
 
03:12:47.670 --> 03:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
whereas the annulment statute does list
 
03:12:50.550 --> 03:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
a number of additional crimes including
 
03:12:54.030 --> 03:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
um manslaughter for DWI which as a
 
03:12:55.990 --> 03:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
previous witness spoke about this
 
03:12:57.750 --> 03:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
individual would not be allowed to anull
 
03:12:59.389 --> 03:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
their record but under the current bill
 
03:13:01.229 --> 03:13:01.239 align:start position:0%
I think they'd still be allowed to to
 
03:13:02.750 --> 03:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
change their name without notifying
 
03:13:04.510 --> 03:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
anyone because manslaughter is not
 
03:13:07.309 --> 03:13:07.319 align:start position:0%
listed so I do think it it would make
 
03:13:11.070 --> 03:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
sense to um harmonize this with the the
 
03:13:12.830 --> 03:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
current enement statute and I'd be have
 
03:13:13.870 --> 03:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
to take
 
03:13:16.670 --> 03:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this
 
03:13:19.030 --> 03:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
03:13:23.630 --> 03:13:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:26.510 --> 03:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
you all right um I don't have any other
 
03:13:28.429 --> 03:13:28.439 align:start position:0%
cards is there anyone else who wishes to
 
03:13:32.950 --> 03:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
be heard on House Bill
 
03:13:35.710 --> 03:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
103 seeing none I'm going to close the
 
03:13:39.190 --> 03:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:43.110 --> 03:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
that in recess until one o'clock
 
03:13:43.120 --> 03:14:11.469 align:start position:0%
that in recess until one o'clock
thank

03:14:11.469 --> 03:14:11.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:11.479 --> 04:06:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:08.070 --> 04:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
all right um I'm now uh going to call
 
04:06:11.070 --> 04:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary Committee back to order
 
04:06:16.550 --> 04:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:20.229 --> 04:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
one4 uh relative to repealing the
 
04:06:22.229 --> 04:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct commission and I'm
 
04:06:23.670 --> 04:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
going to
 
04:06:26.070 --> 04:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
recognize representative uh Caitlyn
 
04:06:36.590 --> 04:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:39.269 --> 04:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
Bill thank thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:06:41.590 --> 04:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the Judiciary
 
04:06:46.189 --> 04:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
Committee this bill simply seeks to
 
04:06:49.229 --> 04:06:49.239 align:start position:0%
repeal the judicial conduct commission
 
04:06:49.239 --> 04:06:51.429 align:start position:0%
repeal the judicial conduct commission
statute

04:06:51.429 --> 04:06:51.439 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:06:55.149 --> 04:06:55.159 align:start position:0%
494a it was deemed unconstitutional in
 
04:06:58.309 --> 04:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
2004 and it was it's been left on the
 
04:07:01.910 --> 04:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
books it's not used it's confusing to
 
04:07:06.469 --> 04:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
prosay parties who perhaps have a
 
04:07:08.670 --> 04:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
conduct complaint and they go Googling
 
04:07:11.590 --> 04:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
to see what process to use the process
 
04:07:13.429 --> 04:07:13.439 align:start position:0%
that is actually used it has a very
 
04:07:16.550 --> 04:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
similar name it's also abbreviated JCC
 
04:07:19.389 --> 04:07:19.399 align:start position:0%
it's the judicial conduct committee and
 
04:07:23.910 --> 04:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
that is done uh by the court it was it
 
04:07:26.550 --> 04:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
was just deemed that we're separate
 
04:07:29.189 --> 04:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
legislative branches we don't get to
 
04:07:31.830 --> 04:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
have oversight onto them except for the
 
04:07:33.950 --> 04:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Prov provision where if
 
04:07:35.950 --> 04:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
they're behaving poorly and we're going
 
04:07:39.510 --> 04:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
to seek to impeach them essentially so
 
04:07:40.950 --> 04:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
this is cleaning up the books of a
 
04:07:40.960 --> 04:07:42.389 align:start position:0%
this is cleaning up the books of a
statue

04:07:42.389 --> 04:07:42.399 align:start position:0%
statue
 
04:07:45.670 --> 04:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
that is unconstitutional not used and
 
04:07:47.870 --> 04:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
has been sitting on there confusing
 
04:07:51.550 --> 04:07:51.560 align:start position:0%
people for more than 20 years now so
 
04:07:53.189 --> 04:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
04:07:55.550 --> 04:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
questions questions for representative
 
04:07:58.149 --> 04:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
cutab yes representative Alexander thank
 
04:08:02.429 --> 04:08:02.439 align:start position:0%
you um Mr chair please help educate me
 
04:08:03.950 --> 04:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
why was this
 
04:08:06.309 --> 04:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
commission implemented is that for
 
04:08:08.630 --> 04:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight on the
 
04:08:11.229 --> 04:08:11.239 align:start position:0%
Judiciary it was it was it was
 
04:08:15.510 --> 04:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
implemented uh former uh representative
 
04:08:17.349 --> 04:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
and Senator I believe Ned Gordon who was
 
04:08:20.870 --> 04:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
also a retired judge he had done a lot
 
04:08:24.429 --> 04:08:24.439 align:start position:0%
of work on this um and we argued for it
 
04:08:26.870 --> 04:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
because we wanted to have some oversight
 
04:08:29.510 --> 04:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
and uh if it was for if there was
 
04:08:31.189 --> 04:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
complaints about not only judges but
 
04:08:34.750 --> 04:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
also clerks um or or other court staff
 
04:08:36.309 --> 04:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
were included in there and it was just
 
04:08:39.109 --> 04:08:39.119 align:start position:0%
deemed that the the chief Supreme Court
 
04:08:41.710 --> 04:08:41.720 align:start position:0%
Justice is who gets to oversee the
 
04:08:44.790 --> 04:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
judicial branch and we can't mandate
 
04:08:47.109 --> 04:08:47.119 align:start position:0%
things on them
 
04:08:50.269 --> 04:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
otherwise just follow up I'm confused
 
04:08:51.670 --> 04:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
because I thought the
 
04:08:55.349 --> 04:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
legislature is allowed to kind of guide
 
04:08:58.269 --> 04:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary and determine whether
 
04:09:00.950 --> 04:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
they're making decisions that follows
 
04:09:02.550 --> 04:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
legislative intent and things like that
 
04:09:06.510 --> 04:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
so that's what's confusing to me
 
04:09:06.520 --> 04:09:08.070 align:start position:0%
so that's what's confusing to me
is

04:09:08.070 --> 04:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:09:09.870 --> 04:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
that that was that was always my
 
04:09:11.109 --> 04:09:11.119 align:start position:0%
impression of the three branches of
 
04:09:13.030 --> 04:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
government so I guess I'm confused yeah
 
04:09:15.670 --> 04:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
so we while we set policy we don't set
 
04:09:17.830 --> 04:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
we don't we're not supposed to tell them
 
04:09:19.550 --> 04:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
how to run their house just like they
 
04:09:21.830 --> 04:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
can't tell us how to run ours they get
 
04:09:24.590 --> 04:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
to make their own rules and chairman
 
04:09:27.309 --> 04:09:27.319 align:start position:0%
Lynn might be able to explain it a
 
04:09:28.710 --> 04:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
little bit better than I am I'm trying
 
04:09:32.550 --> 04:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
to pull up pull up the case here um and
 
04:09:35.269 --> 04:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry one more didn't we just set up
 
04:09:38.630 --> 04:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
a committee to study the family court so
 
04:09:41.750 --> 04:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
isn't this like a situation where like
 
04:09:44.030 --> 04:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature has commissioned
 
04:09:45.950 --> 04:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
oversight on the Judiciary to look into
 
04:09:48.229 --> 04:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
some of these misconduct and provide
 
04:09:50.349 --> 04:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
suggestions because if they don't if we
 
04:09:52.990 --> 04:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
don't provide suggestions we would just
 
04:09:55.309 --> 04:09:55.319 align:start position:0%
tell them right like is I I don't know
 
04:09:56.790 --> 04:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
I'm confused so I'll I'll leave it at
 
04:09:59.309 --> 04:09:59.319 align:start position:0%
that yeah so that was supposed to be
 
04:10:02.870 --> 04:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
looking into irregularities and times
 
04:10:05.990 --> 04:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
when perhaps policies or that we had set
 
04:10:09.030 --> 04:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
were not were not being used or if there
 
04:10:13.149 --> 04:10:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:15.630 --> 04:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
legislatively implement a new policy to
 
04:10:17.750 --> 04:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
correct but that wasn't for us to be
 
04:10:20.510 --> 04:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
looking into specific cases or for us to
 
04:10:22.550 --> 04:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
be looking at specific judges that's why
 
04:10:25.189 --> 04:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
it was you know done in a way that it
 
04:10:29.550 --> 04:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
was you know not supposed to be case
 
04:10:32.469 --> 04:10:32.479 align:start position:0%
specific other other
 
04:10:34.790 --> 04:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
questions yeah I you know my my
 
04:10:36.550 --> 04:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
recollection it's been a while ago I was
 
04:10:38.670 --> 04:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
that this case was was decided be before
 
04:10:41.870 --> 04:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
I was on the Supreme Court but my
 
04:10:44.309 --> 04:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
recollection is that what the the
 
04:10:46.429 --> 04:10:46.439 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct
 
04:10:46.439 --> 04:10:48.070 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct
commission

04:10:48.070 --> 04:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:10:50.950 --> 04:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
was essentially created and it was it
 
04:10:53.269 --> 04:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
was similar but but in some ways
 
04:10:55.349 --> 04:10:55.359 align:start position:0%
different than the judicial conduct
 
04:10:57.710 --> 04:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
committee but it was established by the
 
04:11:00.550 --> 04:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
legislature and it would have
 
04:11:04.149 --> 04:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
given this commission the author
 
04:11:05.910 --> 04:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
basically the authority to discipline
 
04:11:08.309 --> 04:11:08.319 align:start position:0%
judges in other words to you know to
 
04:11:12.269 --> 04:11:12.279 align:start position:0%
reprimand or or censure or uh even
 
04:11:16.030 --> 04:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
suspend a judge and if I recall
 
04:11:18.910 --> 04:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
correctly um I think it was Judge Neto
 
04:11:21.309 --> 04:11:21.319 align:start position:0%
uh Joe Joe Netto um who wrote the
 
04:11:23.750 --> 04:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
decision I think and I think what they
 
04:11:27.070 --> 04:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
said was that the legis the legislator's
 
04:11:27.080 --> 04:11:28.309 align:start position:0%
said was that the legis the legislator's
role

04:11:28.309 --> 04:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
role
 
04:11:31.590 --> 04:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
in in disciplining judges is impeachment
 
04:11:33.550 --> 04:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
if the in other words if a judge if you
 
04:11:35.149 --> 04:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
if the legislature wants to impeach a
 
04:11:36.830 --> 04:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
judge they can you know the house can
 
04:11:41.030 --> 04:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
impeach and the Senate would try but
 
04:11:44.870 --> 04:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
for lesser kinds of things lesser kinds
 
04:11:48.870 --> 04:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
of violations the the Judiciary gets to
 
04:11:51.189 --> 04:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
discipline its own basically just like
 
04:11:53.189 --> 04:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
the legislature gets to discipline its
 
04:11:56.910 --> 04:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
own that that's I'm I'm I'm I'm probably
 
04:11:58.510 --> 04:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
oversimplifying because I don't have it
 
04:12:00.229 --> 04:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
right in front of me but basically that
 
04:12:03.109 --> 04:12:03.119 align:start position:0%
was the that was what uh the court said
 
04:12:06.269 --> 04:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
in that case yeah
 
04:12:09.389 --> 04:12:09.399 align:start position:0%
so I think the last paragraph gives a a
 
04:12:11.189 --> 04:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
big summary and it it basically just
 
04:12:13.469 --> 04:12:13.479 align:start position:0%
says that most of the committee's
 
04:12:15.469 --> 04:12:15.479 align:start position:0%
functions deal with determining whether
 
04:12:17.550 --> 04:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
it has whether the Judicial Code of
 
04:12:19.990 --> 04:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
Conduct has been violated and imposing
 
04:12:22.109 --> 04:12:22.119 align:start position:0%
disciplinary actions by reprimand or
 
04:12:24.429 --> 04:12:24.439 align:start position:0%
censor nowhere does the text of our
 
04:12:26.429 --> 04:12:26.439 align:start position:0%
state constitution demonstratively
 
04:12:27.630 --> 04:12:27.640 align:start position:0%
commit these functions to the
 
04:12:30.469 --> 04:12:30.479 align:start position:0%
legislature Accord
 
04:12:30.479 --> 04:12:32.389 align:start position:0%
legislature Accord
accordingly

04:12:32.389 --> 04:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
04:12:36.229 --> 04:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:36.239 --> 04:12:37.950 align:start position:0%
 
unconstitutional

04:12:37.950 --> 04:12:37.960 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
04:12:40.950 --> 04:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry represent ter did you have a
 
04:12:43.790 --> 04:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
question I I I think I got thank by the
 
04:12:45.189 --> 04:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
way for your testimony because it
 
04:12:47.710 --> 04:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
cleared up my confusion about why this
 
04:12:50.030 --> 04:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
was proposed and and I didn't realize
 
04:12:51.630 --> 04:12:51.640 align:start position:0%
they were two separate is the is the
 
04:12:54.750 --> 04:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct committee established
 
04:12:56.590 --> 04:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
in statute or that's just established
 
04:12:58.429 --> 04:12:58.439 align:start position:0%
completely by the Judiciary that's
 
04:13:01.830 --> 04:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:05.429 --> 04:13:05.439 align:start position:0%
rule other other questions for this
 
04:13:07.710 --> 04:13:07.720 align:start position:0%
witness right thank you very much thank
 
04:13:10.830 --> 04:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
you uh next I'm going to call on uh
 
04:13:33.469 --> 04:13:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:35.590 --> 04:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
please good afternoon members my name is
 
04:13:37.269 --> 04:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
Randall CER I'm here to oppose the the
 
04:13:39.870 --> 04:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
bill um and I want to talk briefly about
 
04:13:41.429 --> 04:13:41.439 align:start position:0%
what she just spoke to about the
 
04:13:42.590 --> 04:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct committee and the
 
04:13:44.790 --> 04:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
reference of the commission uh we have
 
04:13:46.429 --> 04:13:46.439 align:start position:0%
three branches of government uh for
 
04:13:47.990 --> 04:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
checks and balances which is correct but
 
04:13:49.710 --> 04:13:49.720 align:start position:0%
let's review the opposing reasons why
 
04:13:51.710 --> 04:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
it's deemed unconstitutional by the
 
04:13:51.720 --> 04:13:52.950 align:start position:0%
it's deemed unconstitutional by the
Supreme

04:13:52.950 --> 04:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
Supreme
 
04:13:55.269 --> 04:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
Court my objections are as follows the
 
04:13:56.590 --> 04:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled the
 
04:13:58.550 --> 04:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
commission is unconstitutional the
 
04:13:59.990 --> 04:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
current judicial conduct committee is
 
04:14:01.429 --> 04:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
composed of the judges in the New
 
04:14:03.229 --> 04:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court New Hampshire
 
04:14:04.990 --> 04:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court police themselves through
 
04:14:06.550 --> 04:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
current legislation this needs to be
 
04:14:08.790 --> 04:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
changed the new judicial conduct
 
04:14:10.269 --> 04:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
committee is ruled unconstitutional
 
04:14:11.870 --> 04:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
because of Judges Who police themselves
 
04:14:13.550 --> 04:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
and rule that private rules supersede
 
04:14:17.870 --> 04:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
the federal law um keeping with the
 
04:14:19.229 --> 04:14:19.239 align:start position:0%
keeping the conduct committee and not
 
04:14:20.750 --> 04:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
the commission would be protecting the
 
04:14:23.469 --> 04:14:23.479 align:start position:0%
judges of wrongdoing I filed three
 
04:14:25.590 --> 04:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
judicial committee complaints all were
 
04:14:27.229 --> 04:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
dismissed it says a judge can ignore the
 
04:14:28.990 --> 04:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
facts of the case it's not grounds from
 
04:14:31.429 --> 04:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
misconduct but if you IGN if you ignore
 
04:14:33.469 --> 04:14:33.479 align:start position:0%
the facts in the law you certainly can't
 
04:14:35.269 --> 04:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
have Fair findings of lawful orders if
 
04:14:36.590 --> 04:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
you don't apply all the facts and the
 
04:14:39.429 --> 04:14:39.439 align:start position:0%
evidence to make independent judicial
 
04:14:39.439 --> 04:14:45.710 align:start position:0%
evidence to make independent judicial
findings

04:14:45.710 --> 04:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:49.349 --> 04:14:49.359 align:start position:0%
um so in Family Court uh New Hampshire
 
04:14:51.349 --> 04:14:51.359 align:start position:0%
Family Court rule 2.2 says Rules of
 
04:14:52.710 --> 04:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
Evidence don't apply in domestic
 
04:14:55.189 --> 04:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
violence or family cases hence why my
 
04:14:58.590 --> 04:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
son was stolen by the court 10 years ago
 
04:15:02.070 --> 04:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
um and they the Supreme Court denied my
 
04:15:05.429 --> 04:15:05.439 align:start position:0%
appeals um and New Hampshire Supreme
 
04:15:15.269 --> 04:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:18.149 --> 04:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire Supreme Court rule 2.2
 
04:15:20.309 --> 04:15:20.319 align:start position:0%
says the court shall uphold the law and
 
04:15:22.229 --> 04:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
perform all duties fairly and partially
 
04:15:24.510 --> 04:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
be objective and open-minded they must
 
04:15:26.670 --> 04:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
interpret and apply the law if they
 
04:15:28.870 --> 04:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
approve if they approve or disapprove of
 
04:15:31.830 --> 04:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
the law good faith heirs a factor law
 
04:15:33.469 --> 04:15:33.479 align:start position:0%
does not violate this
 
04:15:35.990 --> 04:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
rule so here's a
 
04:15:38.070 --> 04:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
problem New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
04:15:42.030 --> 04:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
police themselves I'm a military
 
04:15:44.670 --> 04:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
veteran their own rules that says that
 
04:15:47.189 --> 04:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
rules of Rules of Evidence don't apply
 
04:15:49.189 --> 04:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
in domestic violence or family
 
04:15:51.910 --> 04:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
cases um violate the rule of law the
 
04:15:54.229 --> 04:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
rule of evidence uh the definition of
 
04:15:55.790 --> 04:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
the independent Judiciary of which
 
04:15:57.790 --> 04:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to follow more
 
04:16:00.070 --> 04:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
importantly Michael Gardner's testimony
 
04:16:01.389 --> 04:16:01.399 align:start position:0%
In This Very Room to the select
 
04:16:02.950 --> 04:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
committee that we were talking about
 
04:16:06.070 --> 04:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
earlier um says that the Rules of
 
04:16:07.349 --> 04:16:07.359 align:start position:0%
Evidence don't apply cu they want to be
 
04:16:08.670 --> 04:16:08.680 align:start position:0%
Gatekeepers for what they hope is
 
04:16:08.680 --> 04:16:09.950 align:start position:0%
Gatekeepers for what they hope is
reliable

04:16:09.950 --> 04:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
reliable
 
04:16:09.960 --> 04:16:11.830 align:start position:0%
reliable
information

04:16:11.830 --> 04:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:16:14.630 --> 04:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
um so without actually access to
 
04:16:16.389 --> 04:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
evidence to defend per the New Hampshire
 
04:16:17.590 --> 04:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
Court or the New Hampshire mission
 
04:16:19.070 --> 04:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
statement to follow New Hampshire
 
04:16:20.349 --> 04:16:20.359 align:start position:0%
Constitution as well as the United
 
04:16:22.550 --> 04:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
States Constitution there's a there's a
 
04:16:24.349 --> 04:16:24.359 align:start position:0%
portion in there called Article 15
 
04:16:25.429 --> 04:16:25.439 align:start position:0%
rights of the
 
04:16:27.830 --> 04:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
accused if the judge denies the access
 
04:16:30.389 --> 04:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
to evidence in my case four times in
 
04:16:32.229 --> 04:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
Family Court which is a non-criminal
 
04:16:35.189 --> 04:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
court but then they use criminal
 
04:16:38.149 --> 04:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
statutes to
 
04:16:40.750 --> 04:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
um basically violate my parental rights
 
04:16:44.229 --> 04:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
so I can't see my kid and the committee
 
04:16:46.189 --> 04:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
denies all
 
04:16:49.750 --> 04:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
three um
 
04:16:52.670 --> 04:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
complaints nowhere anywhere does it say
 
04:16:54.710 --> 04:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
in 10 years that I found anything about
 
04:16:57.550 --> 04:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
this commission um or the executive
 
04:17:00.510 --> 04:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
director director or um the the current
 
04:17:03.750 --> 04:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
chain of command so if we get rid of the
 
04:17:06.189 --> 04:17:06.199 align:start position:0%
commission we actually need this so we
 
04:17:07.630 --> 04:17:07.640 align:start position:0%
can have
 
04:17:10.349 --> 04:17:10.359 align:start position:0%
an independent review of what the courts
 
04:17:13.030 --> 04:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
are doing um however there is there is a
 
04:17:14.590 --> 04:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
problem with it with a commission where
 
04:17:17.630 --> 04:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
it says three judges two lawyers and six
 
04:17:19.950 --> 04:17:19.960 align:start position:0%
Independents but they have to be
 
04:17:21.510 --> 04:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
independent of the court system so I'm
 
04:17:23.990 --> 04:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
not sure how judges and lawyers can be a
 
04:17:25.429 --> 04:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
part of the commission
 
04:17:27.429 --> 04:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
if uh they're not supposed to be part of
 
04:17:29.189 --> 04:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
the court system so that has to be
 
04:17:31.830 --> 04:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
addressed as well um but I just wanted
 
04:17:34.990 --> 04:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
to to uh oppose the bill and make sure
 
04:17:37.910 --> 04:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
that we actually have a way um to
 
04:17:39.910 --> 04:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
redress our grievances as a redress
 
04:17:43.630 --> 04:17:43.640 align:start position:0%
grievance has been disbanded as well um
 
04:17:45.389 --> 04:17:45.399 align:start position:0%
but literally we can't find any reason
 
04:17:46.510 --> 04:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
why it's
 
04:17:49.030 --> 04:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um if they police
 
04:17:50.630 --> 04:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
themselves and private rues supersedes
 
04:17:52.510 --> 04:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
the Constitution we have all the judges
 
04:17:54.750 --> 04:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire committing treason and
 
04:17:56.550 --> 04:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
they need to be moved for impeachment
 
04:17:58.630 --> 04:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
effective today I have the evidence in
 
04:18:00.070 --> 04:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
my federal court case I have the
 
04:18:02.910 --> 04:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
evidence in my Supreme Court case um
 
04:18:04.149 --> 04:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
where the Attorney General pleaded
 
04:18:05.630 --> 04:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
immunity to Federal Court to
 
04:18:07.389 --> 04:18:07.399 align:start position:0%
constitutional violation
 
04:18:09.070 --> 04:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
and then it was denied in Supreme Court
 
04:18:11.590 --> 04:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
so we need checks and balances we're
 
04:18:13.910 --> 04:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
here to fight for our kids that's what
 
04:18:15.469 --> 04:18:15.479 align:start position:0%
we're doing we're trying to make sure
 
04:18:17.750 --> 04:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
everything's right and there's no
 
04:18:19.590 --> 04:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
possible way that the legislator can
 
04:18:22.229 --> 04:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
write statute that violates the
 
04:18:24.510 --> 04:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution and allow this the Supreme
 
04:18:27.630 --> 04:18:27.640 align:start position:0%
Court to police themselves how does rule
 
04:18:30.149 --> 04:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
supersede the Constitution I'll take any
 
04:18:32.910 --> 04:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
questions all right questions for this
 
04:18:35.149 --> 04:18:35.159 align:start position:0%

Carol County I'll stand if I may good
 
04:18:54.670 --> 04:18:54.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon everybody sure so for decades
 
04:18:57.030 --> 04:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
children had been reporting major abuse
 
04:19:00.710 --> 04:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
acts against them for decades no one
 
04:19:03.870 --> 04:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
listened now 2024 we have another
 
04:19:06.189 --> 04:19:06.199 align:start position:0%
problem in New Hampshire that is also
 
04:19:08.750 --> 04:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
involved Children and Families where no
 
04:19:10.070 --> 04:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
one is
 
04:19:12.469 --> 04:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
listening if we don't have checks and
 
04:19:14.710 --> 04:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
balances to watch out for these judges
 
04:19:17.710 --> 04:19:17.720 align:start position:0%
what's not to say that they will operate
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
in a RICO
 
04:19:23.030 --> 04:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
manner uh in a racketeering situation
 
04:19:24.870 --> 04:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
where they allow judge where they allow
 
04:19:27.630 --> 04:19:27.640 align:start position:0%
lawyers to come in and manifest a case
 
04:19:30.149 --> 04:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
just to push these cases along that's
 
04:19:32.830 --> 04:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
happening now people are
 
04:19:35.630 --> 04:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
telling our Representatives that this is
 
04:19:39.630 --> 04:19:39.640 align:start position:0%
happening and no one is listening I've
 
04:19:42.550 --> 04:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
myself watched over a thousand cases
 
04:19:46.510 --> 04:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
where lawyers have gone in and
 
04:19:49.550 --> 04:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
manifested uh their stories which
 
04:19:52.030 --> 04:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
controls the narrative so you could
 
04:19:54.590 --> 04:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
never go and appeal these cases because
 
04:19:56.070 --> 04:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
all they do is read The Narrative they
 
04:19:59.269 --> 04:19:59.279 align:start position:0%
don't even bring evidence up so
 
04:20:02.710 --> 04:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
for 10 years you might not be able to
 
04:20:04.910 --> 04:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
have a relationship with your children
 
04:20:08.269 --> 04:20:08.279 align:start position:0%
some some with younger children could go
 
04:20:10.710 --> 04:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
18 years with not having a relationship
 
04:20:13.229 --> 04:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:16.269 --> 04:20:16.279 align:start position:0%
children the problem now is lawyers and
 
04:20:18.389 --> 04:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
judges abusing privilege and Power in
 
04:20:19.510 --> 04:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
the family
 
04:20:22.510 --> 04:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
courts the guardianship
 
04:20:25.189 --> 04:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
courts and the juvenile
 
04:20:28.109 --> 04:20:28.119 align:start position:0%
courts this has led to Monumental crimes
 
04:20:30.349 --> 04:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
against the public at
 
04:20:33.269 --> 04:20:33.279 align:start position:0%
large will we wait for decades before
 
04:20:35.510 --> 04:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
someone of authority actually
 
04:20:35.520 --> 04:20:37.349 align:start position:0%
someone of authority actually
listens

04:20:37.349 --> 04:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
listens
 
04:20:40.070 --> 04:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
will it cost the taxpayers hundred
 
04:20:40.080 --> 04:20:41.309 align:start position:0%
will it cost the taxpayers hundred
million

04:20:41.309 --> 04:20:41.319 align:start position:0%
million
 
04:20:44.429 --> 04:20:44.439 align:start position:0%
lawsuits in the future if nobody
 
04:20:46.750 --> 04:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
listens I have said it before and I'll
 
04:20:49.030 --> 04:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
say it again we are no longer following
 
04:20:51.710 --> 04:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
the laws of the land we under we are
 
04:20:53.790 --> 04:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
under a rule of a small committee
 
04:20:55.349 --> 04:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
abusing the public
 
04:20:58.590 --> 04:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
record fraud on a level never seen
 
04:21:00.830 --> 04:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
before in the realm of the best interest
 
04:21:03.309 --> 04:21:03.319 align:start position:0%
of a single child these lawyers are
 
04:21:06.670 --> 04:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
making millions of dollars a year off of
 
04:21:08.830 --> 04:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
the abuse of
 
04:21:11.469 --> 04:21:11.479 align:start position:0%
children um we all witnessed what
 
04:21:14.149 --> 04:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
happened with the cunu center children
 
04:21:16.830 --> 04:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
were telling the parents and adults they
 
04:21:20.550 --> 04:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
were being abused and no one was
 
04:21:23.189 --> 04:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
listening again you have fathers and
 
04:21:27.429 --> 04:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
mothers coming in here and again they're
 
04:21:31.229 --> 04:21:31.239 align:start position:0%
saying there's a problem there's abuse
 
04:21:33.429 --> 04:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
and no one is listening and nothing is
 
04:21:35.630 --> 04:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
changed we don't have a redress
 
04:21:35.640 --> 04:21:37.349 align:start position:0%
changed we don't have a redress
committee

04:21:37.349 --> 04:21:37.359 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:21:39.710 --> 04:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
um what I just found out today is when
 
04:21:42.870 --> 04:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
you send a complaint over to the
 
04:21:45.429 --> 04:21:45.439 align:start position:0%
JCC they were supposed to send it over
 
04:21:48.309 --> 04:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
to this this other branch that we're
 
04:21:51.070 --> 04:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
talking about today and that never
 
04:21:52.630 --> 04:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
happened those people weren't even put
 
04:21:54.950 --> 04:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
in place they're they're literally
 
04:21:58.429 --> 04:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
policing themselves and at the end of
 
04:22:02.269 --> 04:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
the day 40 years from now it's these
 
04:22:04.109 --> 04:22:04.119 align:start position:0%
names right
 
04:22:07.189 --> 04:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
here that ignored this
 
04:22:10.469 --> 04:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
and now you have a a100 million lawsuit
 
04:22:13.149 --> 04:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
because we're able to prove Rico you can
 
04:22:15.429 --> 04:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
literally go into on your computers
 
04:22:17.990 --> 04:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
right now and there are multiple states
 
04:22:22.590 --> 04:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
that are F filing Rico charges against
 
04:22:22.600 --> 04:22:24.149 align:start position:0%
that are F filing Rico charges against
judges

04:22:24.149 --> 04:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
judges
 
04:22:28.550 --> 04:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
lawyers State officials sheriffs so it's
 
04:22:33.189 --> 04:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
starting now call it a movement uh call
 
04:22:36.429 --> 04:22:36.439 align:start position:0%
it justice but it's happening that's why
 
04:22:38.269 --> 04:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
why we had the special house committee
 
04:22:39.590 --> 04:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
for the family
 
04:22:39.600 --> 04:22:41.149 align:start position:0%
for the family
courts

04:22:41.149 --> 04:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
courts
 
04:22:47.349 --> 04:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
um I myself have not had I filed one JCC
 
04:22:50.149 --> 04:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
complaint uh as a
 
04:22:52.389 --> 04:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
witness to some
 
04:22:54.830 --> 04:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing in a different family court
 
04:22:57.109 --> 04:22:57.119 align:start position:0%
case and mine I'm holding mine back
 
04:23:00.349 --> 04:23:00.359 align:start position:0%
until 2027 because I'm still in the
 
04:23:04.309 --> 04:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
courts my child doesn't age out until
 
04:23:07.389 --> 04:23:07.399 align:start position:0%
2027 and I'm afraid
 
04:23:09.469 --> 04:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
that if I do file a
 
04:23:13.229 --> 04:23:13.239 align:start position:0%
complaint it can come back to to haunt
 
04:23:16.670 --> 04:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
me uh once the judge finds out so I'm
 
04:23:19.590 --> 04:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
deathly afraid of that affecting my
 
04:23:22.830 --> 04:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
children uh so I reserve my right to
 
04:23:24.910 --> 04:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
hold that complaint back when it should
 
04:23:27.429 --> 04:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
be uh brought to life
 
04:23:30.429 --> 04:23:30.439 align:start position:0%
immediately again these cases that can
 
04:23:34.309 --> 04:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
be disposed of uh they go 10 years and
 
04:23:38.070 --> 04:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
and people are being affected Ed by that
 
04:23:41.510 --> 04:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
and what we are actually doing is we are
 
04:23:44.389 --> 04:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
corrupting the future of our children
 
04:23:45.910 --> 04:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
when you don't have a mother and a
 
04:23:48.710 --> 04:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
father raising the
 
04:23:51.269 --> 04:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
children you can only imagine what it's
 
04:23:55.269 --> 04:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
going to be like 40 years from now so
 
04:23:57.510 --> 04:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
all right questions for this
 
04:23:59.790 --> 04:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
04:24:05.189 --> 04:24:05.199 align:start position:0%

please

04:24:13.030 --> 04:24:13.040 align:start position:0%

thing we can agree on here there's been
 
04:24:25.870 --> 04:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
some confusion surrounding this and I
 
04:24:27.830 --> 04:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
think the other thing I would propose is
 
04:24:31.349 --> 04:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
that a lot of people feel unheard on
 
04:24:33.870 --> 04:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
this and I would just recount the
 
04:24:37.030 --> 04:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
legislative history of this in
 
04:24:42.630 --> 04:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
2001 the legislature passed uh SB
 
04:24:46.389 --> 04:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
197 uh it both houses it was signed into
 
04:24:48.870 --> 04:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
law it created this
 
04:24:52.429 --> 04:24:52.439 align:start position:0%
clearly at that time in 2001 people
 
04:24:55.550 --> 04:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
wanted this the people wanted
 
04:24:59.710 --> 04:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
this and uh in 2003 there were some very
 
04:25:02.229 --> 04:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
minor revisions made that was House Bill
 
04:25:06.670 --> 04:25:06.680 align:start position:0%
4 and then when you move forward to 2004
 
04:25:11.109 --> 04:25:11.119 align:start position:0%
or uh you have the Supreme Court saying
 
04:25:14.389 --> 04:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
this is uh unconstitutional based on
 
04:25:16.349 --> 04:25:16.359 align:start position:0%
separation of
 
04:25:20.389 --> 04:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
powers uh respectfully I think there's a
 
04:25:23.510 --> 04:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
lot of people out there on the street
 
04:25:26.830 --> 04:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
who disagree with that maybe they're
 
04:25:28.910 --> 04:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
wrong if we have
 
04:25:31.950 --> 04:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
a you know another case where the people
 
04:25:33.389 --> 04:25:33.399 align:start position:0%
in the Supreme Court have kind of been
 
04:25:35.790 --> 04:25:35.800 align:start position:0%
at odds has been taxpayer standing you
 
04:25:37.349 --> 04:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
amend the
 
04:25:39.910 --> 04:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution um but I would really urge
 
04:25:41.910 --> 04:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
you all rather than just sort of throw
 
04:25:45.109 --> 04:25:45.119 align:start position:0%
this out is to maybe go back to the
 
04:25:48.109 --> 04:25:48.119 align:start position:0%
record of what happened in
 
04:25:51.469 --> 04:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
2001 what the people actually
 
04:25:55.710 --> 04:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
wanted and um what the best way is to
 
04:25:59.189 --> 04:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
move forward in
 
04:26:02.870 --> 04:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
providing the oversight to the Judiciary
 
04:26:06.790 --> 04:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
that I think a very large number of New
 
04:26:09.030 --> 04:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire voters
 
04:26:12.950 --> 04:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
are looking to have happen all right
 
04:26:15.070 --> 04:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this
 
04:26:17.349 --> 04:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
04:26:20.269 --> 04:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
sir thank you thank you I don't have any
 
04:26:21.830 --> 04:26:21.840 align:start position:0%

04:26:31.269 --> 04:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
104 seeing none I'm going to close the
 
04:26:34.910 --> 04:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 104 and since we
 
04:26:36.990 --> 04:26:37.000 align:start position:0%

04:26:39.870 --> 04:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
next bill until 145 U we'll take a short
 
04:27:04.910 --> 04:27:04.920 align:start position:0%

and I'll recognize uh representative uh
 
04:41:53.070 --> 04:41:53.080 align:start position:0%
cable kab the prime sponsor of the Bill
 
04:41:54.590 --> 04:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and honorable
 
04:41:56.310 --> 04:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
members of the ju area committee again
 
04:41:57.910 --> 04:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is representative
 
04:42:02.868 --> 04:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:05.948 --> 04:42:05.958 align:start position:0%
wam this bill seeks to
 
04:42:07.750 --> 04:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
establish a
 
04:42:11.628 --> 04:42:11.638 align:start position:0%
Judicial training requirement for judges
 
04:42:14.030 --> 04:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
both new judges that are coming in and
 
04:42:15.868 --> 04:42:15.878 align:start position:0%
then continuing ed for our current
 
04:42:19.150 --> 04:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
judges it also seeks to establish a
 
04:42:22.190 --> 04:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
Judicial training coordinator
 
04:42:25.070 --> 04:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
position currently many states have a
 
04:42:26.590 --> 04:42:26.600 align:start position:0%
Judicial training coordinator that does
 
04:42:30.030 --> 04:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
this for the judges our state doesn't so
 
04:42:32.310 --> 04:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
we have an administrative attorney
 
04:42:33.708 --> 04:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
trying to wear multiple different hats
 
04:42:36.190 --> 04:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
and do the best that they can to try
 
04:42:39.070 --> 04:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
and train our judges in the in the best
 
04:42:41.390 --> 04:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
way that they can however it would be
 
04:42:44.470 --> 04:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
better as a as a dedicated position in
 
04:42:49.070 --> 04:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:52.628 --> 04:42:52.638 align:start position:0%
committee there were many
 
04:42:56.628 --> 04:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
concerns from people regarding their
 
04:42:58.670 --> 04:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
experiences in court and feeling as
 
04:43:00.948 --> 04:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
though things were not necessarily
 
04:43:06.190 --> 04:43:06.200 align:start position:0%
uniform between judges that
 
04:43:08.150 --> 04:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes one judge would would apply
 
04:43:09.708 --> 04:43:09.718 align:start position:0%
something a different way another judge
 
04:43:11.470 --> 04:43:11.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't apply it that way and and some
 
04:43:13.628 --> 04:43:13.638 align:start position:0%
of it really seemed to come down to
 
04:43:15.868 --> 04:43:15.878 align:start position:0%
training but it became really clear that
 
04:43:18.830 --> 04:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
it wasn't really just family court that
 
04:43:20.670 --> 04:43:20.680 align:start position:0%
was a problem it was it was really all
 
04:43:22.030 --> 04:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
the courts because what ends up
 
04:43:23.670 --> 04:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
happening is is when a when a judge is
 
04:43:25.948 --> 04:43:25.958 align:start position:0%
appointed typically they've previously
 
04:43:28.590 --> 04:43:28.600 align:start position:0%
specialized in a particular area of Law
 
04:43:29.990 --> 04:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
and then they'll be assigned to work on
 
04:43:31.750 --> 04:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
something else and it may not be an area
 
04:43:33.310 --> 04:43:33.320 align:start position:0%
of law that they're particularly
 
04:43:35.070 --> 04:43:35.080 align:start position:0%
familiar with maybe they were a
 
04:43:36.708 --> 04:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
prosecutor and they're being assigned to
 
04:43:39.390 --> 04:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
work in family court maybe they were a a
 
04:43:41.470 --> 04:43:41.480 align:start position:0%
criminal defense attorney and now
 
04:43:42.830 --> 04:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
they're being assigned to work in
 
04:43:45.350 --> 04:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
Probate and we want to make sure that
 
04:43:48.788 --> 04:43:48.798 align:start position:0%
our judges are up to speed and
 
04:43:52.270 --> 04:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
and equipped to make the best decisions
 
04:43:55.868 --> 04:43:55.878 align:start position:0%
and and fair decisions and and applying
 
04:43:58.590 --> 04:43:58.600 align:start position:0%
the law in the correct way so this is is
 
04:44:01.230 --> 04:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
seeking to to provide that that training
 
04:44:04.550 --> 04:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
to them and I'm happy to take any
 
04:44:07.750 --> 04:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
questions on the bill so I guess one
 
04:44:10.510 --> 04:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
question I have uh representative kab is
 
04:44:11.830 --> 04:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
well first I should say is anybody else
 
04:44:17.030 --> 04:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:20.070 --> 04:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
testman I realize there's not a there is
 
04:44:22.070 --> 04:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
apparently not a clerk or somebody to
 
04:44:25.590 --> 04:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
take care of the the training and so on
 
04:44:27.750 --> 04:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
but could isn't this something that
 
04:44:30.550 --> 04:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
should be handled by the judges outside
 
04:44:33.070 --> 04:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
the legislative
 
04:44:35.430 --> 04:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
oversight there's there's more than
 
04:44:35.440 --> 04:44:36.948 align:start position:0%
oversight there's there's more than
enough

04:44:36.948 --> 04:44:36.958 align:start position:0%
enough
 
04:44:40.150 --> 04:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
people in the system already
 
04:44:43.510 --> 04:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
probably that they could Tas one or two
 
04:44:47.550 --> 04:44:47.560 align:start position:0%
people to do this why is this a special
 
04:44:50.190 --> 04:44:50.200 align:start position:0%
law you why is that
 
04:44:52.510 --> 04:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
required thank you for the
 
04:44:52.520 --> 04:44:54.788 align:start position:0%
required thank you for the
question

04:44:54.788 --> 04:44:54.798 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:44:57.590 --> 04:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
so some of it comes down to cost so sure
 
04:44:59.910 --> 04:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
you could just say the judges can can go
 
04:45:02.350 --> 04:45:02.360 align:start position:0%
and and and go to a training as they see
 
04:45:04.830 --> 04:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
fit and there are lots of conferences
 
04:45:06.788 --> 04:45:06.798 align:start position:0%
that maybe apply these things but then
 
04:45:09.350 --> 04:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
ultimately if you have judges flying out
 
04:45:10.830 --> 04:45:10.840 align:start position:0%
to several different conferences in
 
04:45:12.350 --> 04:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
different states that that is going to
 
04:45:14.190 --> 04:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
cost much more money than the cost of a
 
04:45:16.628 --> 04:45:16.638 align:start position:0%
training coordinator but also you don't
 
04:45:19.628 --> 04:45:19.638 align:start position:0%
have somebody that is kind of kind of
 
04:45:22.030 --> 04:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
trying to plan hey these trainings might
 
04:45:23.628 --> 04:45:23.638 align:start position:0%
be available on this dates and maybe
 
04:45:25.230 --> 04:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
it's possible to bring the trainer here
 
04:45:27.070 --> 04:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
to our judges so that they can all get
 
04:45:28.830 --> 04:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
the training together collectively at
 
04:45:31.350 --> 04:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
the same time um and and to really look
 
04:45:32.628 --> 04:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
ahead and do these things because it
 
04:45:34.788 --> 04:45:34.798 align:start position:0%
does become difficult once you have
 
04:45:36.510 --> 04:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
judges that are assigned to cases and
 
04:45:38.070 --> 04:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
they may be booked months and months and
 
04:45:40.550 --> 04:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
months out to give them that time off to
 
04:45:43.270 --> 04:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
even go to a training at all and
 
04:45:46.990 --> 04:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
so presently there
 
04:45:49.670 --> 04:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
is a complaint from the public that
 
04:45:52.510 --> 04:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps there is a lack of training with
 
04:45:56.350 --> 04:45:56.360 align:start position:0%
with the judges and I don't think we're
 
04:45:59.070 --> 04:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
giving them the tools necessarily to be
 
04:46:00.910 --> 04:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
able to do that because they are very
 
04:46:03.788 --> 04:46:03.798 align:start position:0%
understaffed as it is so to ask them to
 
04:46:05.590 --> 04:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
do all of this additional planning when
 
04:46:07.430 --> 04:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
we've already got judges that
 
04:46:10.270 --> 04:46:10.280 align:start position:0%
are writing decisions literally at home
 
04:46:11.990 --> 04:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
because there's no time during the day
 
04:46:14.470 --> 04:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
for them to possibly do that work and
 
04:46:16.590 --> 04:46:16.600 align:start position:0%
they're working through lunches so I
 
04:46:19.310 --> 04:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
think it's another task to put on them
 
04:46:23.230 --> 04:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
when they're already very underst
 
04:46:25.750 --> 04:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
staffed yes representative
 
04:46:28.990 --> 04:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
tur y uh thanks and thanks for taking
 
04:46:31.708 --> 04:46:31.718 align:start position:0%
the question um I was just curious about
 
04:46:33.788 --> 04:46:33.798 align:start position:0%
the different hour requirements that are
 
04:46:36.270 --> 04:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
in the proposed Bill and and where they
 
04:46:38.948 --> 04:46:38.958 align:start position:0%
came from I thought is is this based on
 
04:46:41.070 --> 04:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
something from another state or some
 
04:46:44.948 --> 04:46:44.958 align:start position:0%
sort of known number or how were those
 
04:46:49.430 --> 04:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
determined um it came from another state
 
04:46:53.190 --> 04:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
yes um and I would just note that I I do
 
04:46:54.868 --> 04:46:54.878 align:start position:0%
think that the number of continuing
 
04:46:58.070 --> 04:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
hours are
 
04:47:00.470 --> 04:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
pretty mod like they're they're pretty
 
04:47:02.830 --> 04:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty modest number uh when you
 
04:47:04.708 --> 04:47:04.718 align:start position:0%
look at
 
04:47:06.110 --> 04:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
as you know for doctors when they're
 
04:47:08.430 --> 04:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
doing their CME they've got to complete
 
04:47:10.470 --> 04:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
40 hours every year I think it's 80
 
04:47:13.150 --> 04:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
hours every bium so we're only asking
 
04:47:15.948 --> 04:47:15.958 align:start position:0%
for 24 hours here so I think it's a very
 
04:47:18.910 --> 04:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount for the judges to
 
04:47:22.190 --> 04:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
complete yes representative gon thank
 
04:47:23.070 --> 04:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:47:26.548 --> 04:47:26.558 align:start position:0%
representative uh who
 
04:47:30.590 --> 04:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
determines what courses would count as
 
04:47:33.390 --> 04:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
continuing education what is the
 
04:47:36.510 --> 04:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
accrediting agency what where's the list
 
04:47:39.430 --> 04:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
of classes that would be
 
04:47:41.670 --> 04:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
allowable so that's the purpose thank
 
04:47:43.150 --> 04:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
you for the question that's the purpose
 
04:47:45.030 --> 04:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
of of having the training coordinator to
 
04:47:46.990 --> 04:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
kind of see what areas may be may be
 
04:47:48.788 --> 04:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
needed what programs are best because
 
04:47:49.750 --> 04:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
there have
 
04:47:52.510 --> 04:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
been there have been remarks regarding
 
04:47:54.990 --> 04:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
you know hey this training put on really
 
04:47:56.750 --> 04:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't very beneficial it was kind of a
 
04:47:58.470 --> 04:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
waste of time and so we want to make
 
04:47:59.990 --> 04:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
sure that we are if we're going to have
 
04:48:01.510 --> 04:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
the the judges take the time to go to
 
04:48:03.030 --> 04:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
these trainings that they are actually
 
04:48:05.708 --> 04:48:05.718 align:start position:0%
beneficial to them and so that's that's
 
04:48:07.150 --> 04:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
why having the training coordinator
 
04:48:09.590 --> 04:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
would really be beneficial to to be on
 
04:48:11.708 --> 04:48:11.718 align:start position:0%
top of evaluating and knowing what would
 
04:48:15.230 --> 04:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
or wouldn't be wouldn't be
 
04:48:19.470 --> 04:48:19.480 align:start position:0%
helpful other other questions so uh oh
 
04:48:22.070 --> 04:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sorry representative uh tur
 
04:48:23.628 --> 04:48:23.638 align:start position:0%
please yeah sorry one one other thing
 
04:48:26.230 --> 04:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
that I I was looking at is that that the
 
04:48:31.110 --> 04:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
the language on uh 24 line 24 seems to S
 
04:48:34.948 --> 04:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
of page one suggests or well uh suggests
 
04:48:38.310 --> 04:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
that it says um officers shall be
 
04:48:40.030 --> 04:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
required to complete continuing
 
04:48:41.948 --> 04:48:41.958 align:start position:0%
education and then all the stuff below
 
04:48:43.990 --> 04:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
it sort of talks in terms of
 
04:48:47.190 --> 04:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
maze um so I wasn't sure if there's
 
04:48:48.868 --> 04:48:48.878 align:start position:0%
consistency between those and how do
 
04:48:52.270 --> 04:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
those reconcile with each other so that
 
04:48:54.948 --> 04:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
was guidance that I got back technical
 
04:48:58.230 --> 04:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
guidance that I got back from the court
 
04:49:00.670 --> 04:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
that they felt
 
04:49:03.070 --> 04:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
that it needed to be done under the
 
04:49:04.990 --> 04:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
direction of the Chief Justice of the
 
04:49:06.788 --> 04:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court to
 
04:49:09.230 --> 04:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
be other they questioned if it was
 
04:49:11.788 --> 04:49:11.798 align:start position:0%
constitutional for us to mandate without
 
04:49:14.990 --> 04:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
it going through the Chief Justice or
 
04:49:17.830 --> 04:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
that and I would I if I may I would
 
04:49:20.910 --> 04:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
respond to that I with great respect to
 
04:49:22.548 --> 04:49:22.558 align:start position:0%
the court have the utmost respect for
 
04:49:24.990 --> 04:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
the court but frankly I think that
 
04:49:29.190 --> 04:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
concern excuse my language is BS um it's
 
04:49:34.830 --> 04:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
um the um the there is I see absolutely
 
04:49:38.510 --> 04:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
no reason why the legislature couldn't
 
04:49:40.910 --> 04:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
mandate that there be that there be
 
04:49:43.470 --> 04:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
training I mean that seems to me and you
 
04:49:45.470 --> 04:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
know the argu I've I've heard this
 
04:49:49.350 --> 04:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
argument before um even when I was on
 
04:49:50.788 --> 04:49:50.798 align:start position:0%
the when I was on the court some people
 
04:49:52.670 --> 04:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
had it saying well wait a minute how can
 
04:49:52.680 --> 04:49:53.390 align:start position:0%
had it saying well wait a minute how can
the

04:49:53.390 --> 04:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:49:55.548 --> 04:49:55.558 align:start position:0%
legislature mandate something for
 
04:49:57.868 --> 04:49:57.878 align:start position:0%
another branch of government well if
 
04:50:00.590 --> 04:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
that we're TR try to follow that through
 
04:50:03.910 --> 04:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
if we can't mandate training with
 
04:50:05.788 --> 04:50:05.798 align:start position:0%
requirements for the for the court
 
04:50:06.990 --> 04:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
because it's another branch of
 
04:50:09.150 --> 04:50:09.160 align:start position:0%
government how can we mandate training
 
04:50:11.150 --> 04:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
requirements for any any of the
 
04:50:13.030 --> 04:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
executive branch agencies that's another
 
04:50:15.110 --> 04:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
branch of government too but we have
 
04:50:17.670 --> 04:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
there's all kinds of laws that have you
 
04:50:20.110 --> 04:50:20.120 align:start position:0%
know that mandate various things that
 
04:50:22.390 --> 04:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
agencies of the executive must do and
 
04:50:24.190 --> 04:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
those are not uh those are not
 
04:50:26.270 --> 04:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional I certainly agree that
 
04:50:28.390 --> 04:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
there would be a you know that there
 
04:50:30.628 --> 04:50:30.638 align:start position:0%
would be a point at which the Judiciary
 
04:50:33.190 --> 04:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
which we couldn't go we couldn't go you
 
04:50:36.628 --> 04:50:36.638 align:start position:0%
know um we probably couldn't tell them
 
04:50:39.470 --> 04:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
for example you will you have to hire Mr
 
04:50:42.070 --> 04:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
Smith to be the training person or Miss
 
04:50:43.830 --> 04:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
Jones to be the training person or
 
04:50:45.830 --> 04:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
whatever that uh that would seem to me
 
04:50:48.948 --> 04:50:48.958 align:start position:0%
to go much too far but to Simply mandate
 
04:50:50.708 --> 04:50:50.718 align:start position:0%
um that there be training I don't see
 
04:50:53.110 --> 04:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
any any reason why we couldn't do that
 
04:50:55.230 --> 04:50:55.240 align:start position:0%
and frankly I think the point you rais
 
04:50:57.150 --> 04:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
representative tus is really a good one
 
04:50:59.788 --> 04:50:59.798 align:start position:0%
to you know that all these all these
 
04:51:01.628 --> 04:51:01.638 align:start position:0%
statements like the the you know the
 
04:51:04.150 --> 04:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
court or the judges made you what why
 
04:51:05.830 --> 04:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
are we passing a law that says they may
 
04:51:08.230 --> 04:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
do something I mean if they they may do
 
04:51:11.150 --> 04:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
something right now as uh we without any
 
04:51:15.390 --> 04:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
law at all so I I think that to me if we
 
04:51:17.270 --> 04:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
think that it training is important and
 
04:51:19.350 --> 04:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you know it sounds like
 
04:51:22.110 --> 04:51:22.120 align:start position:0%
we do and I I I certainly share that
 
04:51:24.270 --> 04:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
view then I don't think that there's a
 
04:51:26.910 --> 04:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
problem with with doing what this does
 
04:51:28.708 --> 04:51:28.718 align:start position:0%
simply saying that there shall be
 
04:51:32.110 --> 04:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
training it's obviously up to the court
 
04:51:35.070 --> 04:51:35.080 align:start position:0%
um to determine what that what the what
 
04:51:36.990 --> 04:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
the uh training component shall consist
 
04:51:39.590 --> 04:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
of who shall do the training that that
 
04:51:40.910 --> 04:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
kind of thing I think that should be
 
04:51:43.628 --> 04:51:43.638 align:start position:0%
left to them uh but anyway I'm sorry
 
04:51:46.390 --> 04:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you excuse me
 
04:51:48.788 --> 04:51:48.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I do want to note
 
04:51:52.430 --> 04:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
that um serving on the special committee
 
04:51:56.030 --> 04:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
on the Family Court I am chair of the
 
04:52:00.270 --> 04:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on education training and
 
04:52:02.470 --> 04:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
accountability and for those of you who
 
04:52:06.070 --> 04:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
don't feel you spent enough time here
 
04:52:09.390 --> 04:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
tomorrow um after we quickly go through
 
04:52:12.270 --> 04:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
our very important executive session if
 
04:52:15.070 --> 04:52:15.080 align:start position:0%
you walk down the hall I hope at 10
 
04:52:18.708 --> 04:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
o'clock um that subcommittee is meeting
 
04:52:22.270 --> 04:52:22.280 align:start position:0%
and the court will be present so I am
 
04:52:27.708 --> 04:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
told so it's based on my experience on
 
04:52:29.910 --> 04:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
that matter I do want to object to the
 
04:52:33.310 --> 04:52:33.320 align:start position:0%
fact that the chair said that we
 
04:52:37.990 --> 04:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't say that Mr Smith could be
 
04:52:40.990 --> 04:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
hired I wondered about Mrs
 
04:52:45.430 --> 04:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
Smith moving past that point however um
 
04:52:47.470 --> 04:52:47.480 align:start position:0%
I uh
 
04:52:52.110 --> 04:52:52.120 align:start position:0%
seriously uh have concerns
 
04:52:52.120 --> 04:52:53.948 align:start position:0%
seriously uh have concerns
about

04:52:53.948 --> 04:52:53.958 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:52:58.590 --> 04:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
um the the language that directs the
 
04:52:58.600 --> 04:53:00.110 align:start position:0%
um the the language that directs the
responsibility

04:53:00.110 --> 04:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
04:53:02.390 --> 04:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
exclusively to the Chief
 
04:53:07.430 --> 04:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
Justice um um I just as I respect the
 
04:53:10.190 --> 04:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
governor just as I respect the speaker
 
04:53:11.948 --> 04:53:11.958 align:start position:0%
of the house and the president of the
 
04:53:15.990 --> 04:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
Senate I respect the Chief Justice in
 
04:53:18.910 --> 04:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
the old days we used to stand up when
 
04:53:20.708 --> 04:53:20.718 align:start position:0%
the Chief Justice came into a
 
04:53:23.110 --> 04:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
legislative committee but nowadays we
 
04:53:25.350 --> 04:53:25.360 align:start position:0%
don't seem to have respect for anybody I
 
04:53:27.670 --> 04:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
have respect for the chief justice but I
 
04:53:30.868 --> 04:53:30.878 align:start position:0%
also know that for example the Chief
 
04:53:34.150 --> 04:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
Justice himself the current chief really
 
04:53:37.030 --> 04:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
never tried a case never had experience
 
04:53:39.230 --> 04:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
in a
 
04:53:44.910 --> 04:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
dozen areas Central to the work of um of
 
04:53:48.830 --> 04:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
the courts and I don't think he has ever
 
04:53:52.110 --> 04:53:52.120 align:start position:0%
had experience on either the superior
 
04:53:55.868 --> 04:53:55.878 align:start position:0%
court or the circuit court and uh the
 
04:53:59.310 --> 04:53:59.320 align:start position:0%
chief justice has lots of AIDS and
 
04:54:02.868 --> 04:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
assistance the um judges in the family
 
04:54:04.990 --> 04:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
court for example example have no AIDS
 
04:54:08.670 --> 04:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
they have to write literally write their
 
04:54:11.910 --> 04:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
decisions themselves by hand and I have
 
04:54:13.230 --> 04:54:13.240 align:start position:0%
no problem with their working through
 
04:54:15.230 --> 04:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
lunch or working they're not they're not
 
04:54:17.470 --> 04:54:17.480 align:start position:0%
hired to work a 40h hour week I don't
 
04:54:18.788 --> 04:54:18.798 align:start position:0%
have any problem with them having to
 
04:54:20.708 --> 04:54:20.718 align:start position:0%
work all week and I work all weekend and
 
04:54:24.868 --> 04:54:24.878 align:start position:0%
so do you but what I do think they need
 
04:54:28.708 --> 04:54:28.718 align:start position:0%
is help and assistance so when they
 
04:54:31.070 --> 04:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
just I'm making a speech and I know I'm
 
04:54:33.110 --> 04:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
supposed to ask a question and this the
 
04:54:36.948 --> 04:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
chair has very kindly not stopped me so
 
04:54:40.110 --> 04:54:40.120 align:start position:0%
I'm going to stop myself except to say
 
04:54:40.120 --> 04:54:41.628 align:start position:0%
I'm going to stop myself except to say
that

04:54:41.628 --> 04:54:41.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:54:45.310 --> 04:54:45.320 align:start position:0%
I I have problems
 
04:54:47.948 --> 04:54:47.958 align:start position:0%
about the Chief Justice having the
 
04:54:51.470 --> 04:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
authority and this bill saying May
 
04:54:55.628 --> 04:54:55.638 align:start position:0%
instead of shall because they should
 
04:54:59.110 --> 04:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
have been doing this for years and they
 
04:55:02.230 --> 04:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
haven't and we and we see again and
 
04:55:04.548 --> 04:55:04.558 align:start position:0%
again well meaning people appointed to
 
04:55:07.628 --> 04:55:07.638 align:start position:0%
the bench wanting to do the right thing
 
04:55:11.190 --> 04:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
but don't necessarily have the skills
 
04:55:13.190 --> 04:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
and we should
 
04:55:15.628 --> 04:55:15.638 align:start position:0%
require as we represent the people of
 
04:55:15.638 --> 04:55:17.990 align:start position:0%
require as we represent the people of
the

04:55:17.990 --> 04:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:23.190 --> 04:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
state that so could I ask you what you
 
04:55:25.190 --> 04:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
would feel see I have a question in here
 
04:55:27.788 --> 04:55:27.798 align:start position:0%
someplace what you would feel if we got
 
04:55:31.230 --> 04:55:31.240 align:start position:0%
rid of May and put shall in there even
 
04:55:34.788 --> 04:55:34.798 align:start position:0%
though the court might not be happy I
 
04:55:36.628 --> 04:55:36.638 align:start position:0%
think that that's a wonderful suggestion
 
04:55:38.150 --> 04:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
and I would be happy to put in that
 
04:55:40.628 --> 04:55:40.638 align:start position:0%
amendment to OS this afternoon so that
 
04:55:43.470 --> 04:55:43.480 align:start position:0%

amendment yes are you going to take care
 
04:55:57.030 --> 04:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
of this with OS I'm happy to if you if

04:56:02.310 --> 04:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
always happy to have other people do the
 
04:56:02.320 --> 04:56:04.830 align:start position:0%
always happy to have other people do the
work

04:56:04.830 --> 04:56:04.840 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:56:07.470 --> 04:56:07.480 align:start position:0%
oh yeah I'm sorry representative lza
 
04:56:11.150 --> 04:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
please um also in saying that
 
04:56:13.830 --> 04:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
um in regards to being on that special
 
04:56:16.070 --> 04:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
committee the other thing is to keep in
 
04:56:19.110 --> 04:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
mind that we have uh nine judges that
 
04:56:21.990 --> 04:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
they're looking to for the budget and
 
04:56:25.990 --> 04:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
that with this training um why we heard
 
04:56:29.670 --> 04:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
that many not everybody is um was let
 
04:56:32.510 --> 04:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
you say goes from one Court to another
 
04:56:35.670 --> 04:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
so um um especially to be able to be
 
04:56:37.990 --> 04:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
flexible and to hear the education that
 
04:56:40.750 --> 04:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
they can um would get with their
 
04:56:44.788 --> 04:56:44.798 align:start position:0%
training is is really invaluable because
 
04:56:47.628 --> 04:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
they need to be able to be more flexible
 
04:56:50.150 --> 04:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
to go from one Court to another when
 
04:56:53.910 --> 04:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
there is an um an absentee or something
 
04:56:56.070 --> 04:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
that's going on that to be able to go
 
04:56:59.708 --> 04:56:59.718 align:start position:0%
from one Court to another um and so to
 
04:57:02.868 --> 04:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
have that training is really valuable we
 
04:57:05.590 --> 04:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
really need that to be
 
04:57:08.708 --> 04:57:08.718 align:start position:0%
done yes representative Stapleton thank
 
04:57:10.270 --> 04:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
04:57:13.788 --> 04:57:13.798 align:start position:0%
question um assuming that these judges
 
04:57:16.190 --> 04:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
and justices are
 
04:57:19.830 --> 04:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
lawyers with a law license doesn't their
 
04:57:22.990 --> 04:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
license require continuing education as
 
04:57:24.310 --> 04:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
a part of that
 
04:57:27.270 --> 04:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
lure I believe that the required
 
04:57:29.910 --> 04:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
continuing education was eight
 
04:57:34.190 --> 04:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
hours but I what I don't know is if
 
04:57:36.670 --> 04:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
you're currently a judge if you have to
 
04:57:39.070 --> 04:57:39.080 align:start position:0%
have a law license
 
04:57:42.990 --> 04:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
uh well you know this is an well first
 
04:57:44.670 --> 04:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
of just to answer your specific question
 
04:57:48.788 --> 04:57:48.798 align:start position:0%
there is actually um if you are a
 
04:57:51.510 --> 04:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
judge at least a full-time judge and
 
04:57:53.750 --> 04:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's Mo that's most of them now you
 
04:57:56.628 --> 04:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
are exempt from the continuing legal
 
04:57:58.670 --> 04:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
education requirements of the bar
 
04:58:01.590 --> 04:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
association because the theory being
 
04:58:03.430 --> 04:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
that you're supposed to comply with with
 
04:58:05.548 --> 04:58:05.558 align:start position:0%
the continuing legal education
 
04:58:07.670 --> 04:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
requirements of the judicial branch so
 
04:58:10.948 --> 04:58:10.958 align:start position:0%
it's that they so that's uh but on the
 
04:58:13.990 --> 04:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
the other question about whether you
 
04:58:17.230 --> 04:58:17.240 align:start position:0%
interestingly I believe that there is a
 
04:58:19.350 --> 04:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
that there is a
 
04:58:22.628 --> 04:58:22.638 align:start position:0%
statute that requires Circuit Court
 
04:58:23.948 --> 04:58:23.958 align:start position:0%
judges or what used to be called the
 
04:58:26.430 --> 04:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
District Court but Circuit Court judges
 
04:58:28.470 --> 04:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
to be lawyers but that's in the statute
 
04:58:30.910 --> 04:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
that's not in the Constitution there's
 
04:58:33.230 --> 04:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
nothing as I as far as I'm aware there's
 
04:58:36.310 --> 04:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
nothing in the Constitution or in
 
04:58:40.110 --> 04:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
statutes that requires a judge of the
 
04:58:42.190 --> 04:58:42.200 align:start position:0%
superior court or the Supreme Court to
 
04:58:45.590 --> 04:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
be a lawyer I think that's right um
 
04:58:47.590 --> 04:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
obviously you know there hasn't been a
 
04:58:50.350 --> 04:58:50.360 align:start position:0%
judge that hasn't been a lawyer uh on
 
04:58:52.590 --> 04:58:52.600 align:start position:0%
the superior court or the Supreme Court
 
04:58:54.910 --> 04:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
as far as I can remember ever when I
 
04:58:56.548 --> 04:58:56.558 align:start position:0%
first started practicing in New
 
04:59:00.670 --> 04:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the late 1970s there were a
 
04:59:03.070 --> 04:59:03.080 align:start position:0%
few uh what used to be called municip
 
04:59:06.150 --> 04:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
mulle Court judges who were uh who were
 
04:59:08.548 --> 04:59:08.558 align:start position:0%
non- lawyers but were judges and and I
 
04:59:10.948 --> 04:59:10.958 align:start position:0%
have to say some of them were very good
 
04:59:12.430 --> 04:59:12.440 align:start position:0%
I mean they were you know they were they
 
04:59:14.750 --> 04:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
were you know respected members of their
 
04:59:16.310 --> 04:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
local community and they were they were
 
04:59:18.670 --> 04:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
very good but they did not have uh they
 
04:59:20.670 --> 04:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
did not have legal training uh but I
 
04:59:23.030 --> 04:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
think that I think we you know with the
 
04:59:28.350 --> 04:59:28.360 align:start position:0%
last non lawyer judge uh retired or
 
04:59:30.350 --> 04:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
resigned or whatever you know probably
 
04:59:32.750 --> 04:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
more than 25 years ago 30 maybe 30 years
 
04:59:32.760 --> 04:59:33.708 align:start position:0%
more than 25 years ago 30 maybe 30 years
ago

04:59:33.708 --> 04:59:33.718 align:start position:0%
ago
 
04:59:33.718 --> 04:59:34.430 align:start position:0%
ago
thank

04:59:34.430 --> 04:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:59:39.590 --> 04:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
you question yes representative test the
 
04:59:42.270 --> 04:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
if I remember right and I'm an engineer
 
04:59:46.070 --> 04:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
so I can be wrong uh
 
04:59:50.470 --> 04:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
the the court or the actually the people
 
04:59:54.708 --> 04:59:54.718 align:start position:0%
put in a constitutional amendment 76a or
 
04:59:58.788 --> 04:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
B or something like that uh that
 
05:00:01.990 --> 05:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
said the court can can make all the sort
 
05:00:04.030 --> 05:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
of administrative laws and rules and
 
05:00:06.230 --> 05:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
everything else about their people but
 
05:00:09.150 --> 05:00:09.160 align:start position:0%
then they added and this was not part of
 
05:00:11.590 --> 05:00:11.600 align:start position:0%
what the vote was voted on and it will
 
05:00:14.190 --> 05:00:14.200 align:start position:0%
have the force of law so effectively
 
05:00:15.628 --> 05:00:15.638 align:start position:0%
they became
 
05:00:18.590 --> 05:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
legislators although not part of what
 
05:00:21.670 --> 05:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
they vot what they put up for voting so
 
05:00:25.230 --> 05:00:25.240 align:start position:0%
you I think this is quite quite makes a
 
05:00:28.230 --> 05:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
lot of sense to give the chief of the
 
05:00:31.150 --> 05:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
chief of the Court you know this kind of
 
05:00:35.470 --> 05:00:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:39.310 --> 05:00:39.320 align:start position:0%
other other questions yes representative
 
05:00:41.190 --> 05:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
Dorena uh thank you for taking my
 
05:00:41.200 --> 05:00:42.670 align:start position:0%
Dorena uh thank you for taking my
question

05:00:42.670 --> 05:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:00:47.190 --> 05:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
um so for um continuing education for
 
05:00:49.670 --> 05:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
judges in New Hampshire what would the
 
05:00:52.590 --> 05:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
curriculum be would it be specific to
 
05:00:56.430 --> 05:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law or could you go out to
 
05:01:00.190 --> 05:01:00.200 align:start position:0%
a a vendor that does judicial training
 
05:01:03.270 --> 05:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so in my
 
05:01:05.788 --> 05:01:05.798 align:start position:0%
conversations with the court regarding
 
05:01:08.150 --> 05:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
training it could be some it could be
 
05:01:10.030 --> 05:01:10.040 align:start position:0%
best practice thing so some of the
 
05:01:11.310 --> 05:01:11.320 align:start position:0%
topics that they're trained on for
 
05:01:12.868 --> 05:01:12.878 align:start position:0%
example are domestic violence they're
 
05:01:15.670 --> 05:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
not necessarily law specific so some of
 
05:01:18.190 --> 05:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
the training pieces may not be specific
 
05:01:20.470 --> 05:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
to to New Hampshire
 
05:01:24.548 --> 05:01:24.558 align:start position:0%
law and I think the the committee that
 
05:01:27.830 --> 05:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
rep Smith is is chairing is going to be
 
05:01:30.390 --> 05:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
further exploring which topics make
 
05:01:33.510 --> 05:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
sense for family law perhaps
 
05:01:37.310 --> 05:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
may I follow up of course so seeing that
 
05:01:40.430 --> 05:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
um since there are caned programs um
 
05:01:43.310 --> 05:01:43.320 align:start position:0%
nationally maybe locally does it really
 
05:01:46.470 --> 05:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
make sense to have a um a coordinator of
 
05:01:50.230 --> 05:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
judicial training when it could be when
 
05:01:53.230 --> 05:01:53.240 align:start position:0%
the training piece could be part of HR
 
05:01:58.470 --> 05:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
or part of um the chief Justice's
 
05:01:58.480 --> 05:02:00.310 align:start position:0%
or part of um the chief Justice's
um

05:02:00.310 --> 05:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:03.670 --> 05:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
duties so as I thank you for the
 
05:02:06.590 --> 05:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
question so as I as I have mentioned to
 
05:02:09.390 --> 05:02:09.400 align:start position:0%
rep testerman before I I really believe
 
05:02:12.628 --> 05:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
that in order to do it efficiently and
 
05:02:14.110 --> 05:02:14.120 align:start position:0%
effectively we really do need the
 
05:02:16.070 --> 05:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
position most other states have this
 
05:02:18.868 --> 05:02:18.878 align:start position:0%
position um and I think it needs to be
 
05:02:21.670 --> 05:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
planned because we do have our our
 
05:02:25.430 --> 05:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
judges assigned to cases much in advance
 
05:02:27.310 --> 05:02:27.320 align:start position:0%
and particularly in in family law we
 
05:02:30.030 --> 05:02:30.040 align:start position:0%
were trying to go by the principle of
 
05:02:33.948 --> 05:02:33.958 align:start position:0%
one family one judge although it's
 
05:02:36.190 --> 05:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
broken quite a bit we shouldn't be
 
05:02:37.670 --> 05:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
striving for that and so we want to make
 
05:02:39.310 --> 05:02:39.320 align:start position:0%
sure that if judges are booked out for
 
05:02:41.110 --> 05:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
cases that they're able to be on those
 
05:02:42.590 --> 05:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
cases so we need somebody to do a little
 
05:02:43.990 --> 05:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
bit of planning to make sure that when
 
05:02:45.788 --> 05:02:45.798 align:start position:0%
these trainings are happening you know
 
05:02:46.830 --> 05:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
they're they're scheduled in an
 
05:02:48.150 --> 05:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate way and we're making sure
 
05:02:49.910 --> 05:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
that we're not disrupting cases to do
 
05:02:51.670 --> 05:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
them either but we certainly do need to
 
05:02:54.310 --> 05:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
make training be a priority I think that
 
05:02:56.470 --> 05:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
what's currently happening isn't working
 
05:02:57.990 --> 05:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
and we need to change something to make
 
05:03:00.310 --> 05:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
it work because I think this could be
 
05:03:01.670 --> 05:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
happening now but it's not so I think
 
05:03:03.430 --> 05:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
we've got to take a step to fix the
 
05:03:04.990 --> 05:03:05.000 align:start position:0%
problems that are
 
05:03:07.190 --> 05:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
happening representative
 
05:03:09.990 --> 05:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
gson thank you Mr chair
 
05:03:12.788 --> 05:03:12.798 align:start position:0%
um you're establishing a position of a
 
05:03:12.798 --> 05:03:14.030 align:start position:0%
um you're establishing a position of a
training

05:03:14.030 --> 05:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
training
 
05:03:17.030 --> 05:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
coordinator but you do not
 
05:03:20.750 --> 05:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
detail what the responsibilities are
 
05:03:24.470 --> 05:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
going to be for said person and then
 
05:03:25.868 --> 05:03:25.878 align:start position:0%
also any
 
05:03:27.910 --> 05:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
consequences for how how does that
 
05:03:30.868 --> 05:03:30.878 align:start position:0%
coordinator hold these judges and clerks
 
05:03:33.110 --> 05:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
accountable what are the consequ quences
 
05:03:35.510 --> 05:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
if they don't complete the the requisite
 
05:03:38.470 --> 05:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
number of hours uh
 
05:03:41.830 --> 05:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
so it it's it's important that training
 
05:03:44.270 --> 05:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
gets done but what happens if it doesn't
 
05:03:46.788 --> 05:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
get done thank you for the question so
 
05:03:48.190 --> 05:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
that the training coordinator it is
 
05:03:49.830 --> 05:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
defined actually in the the first
 
05:03:50.990 --> 05:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph it says the training
 
05:03:52.590 --> 05:03:52.600 align:start position:0%
coordinator shall develop highquality
 
05:03:54.270 --> 05:03:54.280 align:start position:0%
judicial training Branch training and
 
05:03:55.990 --> 05:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
continuing education programs and work
 
05:03:57.548 --> 05:03:57.558 align:start position:0%
to provide judges administrators and
 
05:03:59.310 --> 05:03:59.320 align:start position:0%
Court staff with reasonable opportunity
 
05:04:01.948 --> 05:04:01.958 align:start position:0%
to fulfill any mandatory orientation and
 
05:04:04.910 --> 05:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
initial training as well as continual
 
05:04:07.670 --> 05:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
education requirements in terms of what
 
05:04:10.030 --> 05:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
happens if they don't complete them the
 
05:04:11.590 --> 05:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
reason that that piece isn't in there is
 
05:04:13.110 --> 05:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
similar to what we talked about with the
 
05:04:15.830 --> 05:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
JCC before where the disciplinary
 
05:04:17.948 --> 05:04:17.958 align:start position:0%
actions are supposed to be left with the
 
05:04:19.990 --> 05:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
the chief justice so if if they're not
 
05:04:21.788 --> 05:04:21.798 align:start position:0%
complying with it that part would be up
 
05:04:25.868 --> 05:04:25.878 align:start position:0%
to the Chief Justice to to do what he
 
05:04:25.878 --> 05:04:28.230 align:start position:0%
to the Chief Justice to to do what he
saw

05:04:28.230 --> 05:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:31.548 --> 05:04:31.558 align:start position:0%
fit uh represent Smith did you have a
 
05:04:31.558 --> 05:04:36.628 align:start position:0%
fit uh represent Smith did you have a
question

05:04:36.628 --> 05:04:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:40.708 --> 05:04:40.718 align:start position:0%
no um all right uh thank you very much
 
05:04:43.150 --> 05:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
thank you next I'm going to call on Dana
 
05:04:43.160 --> 05:04:54.868 align:start position:0%
thank you next I'm going to call on Dana
alre

05:04:54.868 --> 05:04:54.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:57.590 --> 05:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chairman and members
 
05:05:00.470 --> 05:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
of the committee again Dana alre
 
05:05:03.190 --> 05:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
nashille and New Hampshire um uh first
 
05:05:06.470 --> 05:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
let me say I support the bill second let
 
05:05:09.190 --> 05:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
me say I support some of the ideas I
 
05:05:12.868 --> 05:05:12.878 align:start position:0%
just heard to strengthen it and third
 
05:05:16.310 --> 05:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
I'd like to offer uh some additional
 
05:05:19.628 --> 05:05:19.638 align:start position:0%
suggestions uh to strengthen this and
 
05:05:22.390 --> 05:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
make it uh even better than it already
 
05:05:28.030 --> 05:05:28.040 align:start position:0%
is uh to that end uh I'm going to
 
05:05:31.350 --> 05:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
seemingly briefly drag back to a couple
 
05:05:33.350 --> 05:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
points you heard this morning on right
 
05:05:34.510 --> 05:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
to no
 
05:05:36.948 --> 05:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
bills uh and just everything you heard
 
05:05:40.350 --> 05:05:40.360 align:start position:0%
on the importance of open transparent
 
05:05:42.190 --> 05:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
government uh while there may have been
 
05:05:44.110 --> 05:05:44.120 align:start position:0%
differences of opinion I don't think
 
05:05:46.350 --> 05:05:46.360 align:start position:0%
anybody this morning thought that
 
05:05:49.190 --> 05:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
government shouldn't be open transparent
 
05:05:49.200 --> 05:05:50.628 align:start position:0%
government shouldn't be open transparent
or

05:05:50.628 --> 05:05:50.638 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:05:50.638 --> 05:05:52.470 align:start position:0%
or
accountable

05:05:52.470 --> 05:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
05:05:57.788 --> 05:05:57.798 align:start position:0%
um and so uh sort of along with that I
 
05:06:01.150 --> 05:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
heard questions from rep gon about you
 
05:06:02.548 --> 05:06:02.558 align:start position:0%
know what does this training look like
 
05:06:05.830 --> 05:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
like who's accrediting it uh can we find
 
05:06:08.750 --> 05:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
out more about the training and also
 
05:06:11.470 --> 05:06:11.480 align:start position:0%
questions about what do we do for
 
05:06:13.788 --> 05:06:13.798 align:start position:0%
accountability and you know if something
 
05:06:18.110 --> 05:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
goes wrong and to sort of follow up on
 
05:06:21.270 --> 05:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
that I would bring us back to article 8
 
05:06:22.910 --> 05:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
of our state
 
05:06:26.030 --> 05:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
constitution that uh says magistrates
 
05:06:28.110 --> 05:06:28.120 align:start position:0%
and officers of government are supposed
 
05:06:30.350 --> 05:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
to be accountable I think that certainly
 
05:06:36.030 --> 05:06:36.040 align:start position:0%
includes the Judiciary and also that uh
 
05:06:38.390 --> 05:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
access to governmental proceedings and
 
05:06:41.708 --> 05:06:41.718 align:start position:0%
Records should not be unreasonably
 
05:06:44.390 --> 05:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
restricted uh per the
 
05:06:47.628 --> 05:06:47.638 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh so with that background
 
05:06:50.510 --> 05:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment I would suggest to this
 
05:06:52.868 --> 05:06:52.878 align:start position:0%
and what I think the missing piece
 
05:06:57.350 --> 05:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
is uh is the ability for what all of
 
05:06:59.948 --> 05:06:59.958 align:start position:0%
this training is to be visible to the
 
05:07:04.948 --> 05:07:04.958 align:start position:0%
public for the public to ask just you
 
05:07:07.708 --> 05:07:07.718 align:start position:0%
know as you have what training materials
 
05:07:10.430 --> 05:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
are we using we can leave it up to the
 
05:07:13.110 --> 05:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
Judiciary to decide that but I think
 
05:07:14.830 --> 05:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
we'd kind of like to have some
 
05:07:14.840 --> 05:07:16.590 align:start position:0%
we'd kind of like to have some
visibility

05:07:16.590 --> 05:07:16.600 align:start position:0%
visibility
 
05:07:19.948 --> 05:07:19.958 align:start position:0%
into you know if this is implemented uh
 
05:07:21.910 --> 05:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
how's it going what are you guys you
 
05:07:24.350 --> 05:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
what are the Judiciary using and so
 
05:07:28.948 --> 05:07:28.958 align:start position:0%
on and so I would suggest uh adding a
 
05:07:31.470 --> 05:07:31.480 align:start position:0%
provision in here maybe section seven or
 
05:07:34.110 --> 05:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
whatever to
 
05:07:37.470 --> 05:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
specifically uh make it explicit that
 
05:07:40.670 --> 05:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
these judicial uh training materials are
 
05:07:43.230 --> 05:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
governmental records uh excuse me
 
05:07:45.910 --> 05:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
governmental proceedings and Records
 
05:07:48.030 --> 05:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
within the meaning of article
 
05:07:53.150 --> 05:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
8 uh so that um reasonable right to know
 
05:07:56.548 --> 05:07:56.558 align:start position:0%
requests can be fulfilled on those and
 
05:07:58.788 --> 05:07:58.798 align:start position:0%
sort of the basis for that
 
05:08:03.310 --> 05:08:03.320 align:start position:0%
suggestion uh I passed out two handouts
 
05:08:06.510 --> 05:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
uh everybody here should have one that
 
05:08:09.390 --> 05:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
looks pretty thick but it's really just
 
05:08:12.510 --> 05:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
uh Supreme Court decision uh Petition of
 
05:08:17.190 --> 05:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
Union Leader Corp uh 147 NH
 
05:08:20.548 --> 05:08:20.558 align:start position:0%
603 uh decided
 
05:08:23.110 --> 05:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
2002 and if you want to do a deep dive
 
05:08:25.590 --> 05:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
into that uh there's even the complete
 
05:08:27.510 --> 05:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
transcript of oral Arguments for that
 
05:08:29.390 --> 05:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
but sheds a little more light on the
 
05:08:29.400 --> 05:08:31.070 align:start position:0%
but sheds a little more light on the
Court's

05:08:31.070 --> 05:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
Court's
 
05:08:33.910 --> 05:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
reasoning uh but my position would be
 
05:08:35.948 --> 05:08:35.958 align:start position:0%
these training materials definitely
 
05:08:38.390 --> 05:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
would pertain to the a judicary function
 
05:08:40.390 --> 05:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
of the courts if it pertains to the
 
05:08:42.590 --> 05:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory functions people should
 
05:08:46.628 --> 05:08:46.638 align:start position:0%
have access to that uh and that's how
 
05:08:49.628 --> 05:08:49.638 align:start position:0%
I'd read Petition of union leader but uh
 
05:08:51.788 --> 05:08:51.798 align:start position:0%
I can be wrong I've been wrong many
 
05:08:54.430 --> 05:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
times in my life and apparently right
 
05:08:56.548 --> 05:08:56.558 align:start position:0%
now my understanding is the judicial
 
05:08:59.390 --> 05:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
branch doesn't agree with that uh
 
05:09:02.470 --> 05:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
because the second thing I passed around
 
05:09:04.948 --> 05:09:04.958 align:start position:0%
uh is a response I received essentially
 
05:09:06.670 --> 05:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
to a right to no
 
05:09:09.390 --> 05:09:09.400 align:start position:0%
request uh asking what the the current
 
05:09:11.430 --> 05:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
training materials are and can I please
 
05:09:14.670 --> 05:09:14.680 align:start position:0%
see them and the answer to that was
 
05:09:17.310 --> 05:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
no uh
 
05:09:19.590 --> 05:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
and uh so that's why I think this is
 
05:09:22.708 --> 05:09:22.718 align:start position:0%
needed is sort of the second piece so we
 
05:09:26.628 --> 05:09:26.638 align:start position:0%
all the public has a just a good idea of
 
05:09:28.390 --> 05:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
what they've chosen and we have
 
05:09:30.788 --> 05:09:30.798 align:start position:0%
visibility into this process and with
 
05:09:32.230 --> 05:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
that I'll take any questions if
 
05:09:33.910 --> 05:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
05:09:36.788 --> 05:09:36.798 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
05:09:38.708 --> 05:09:38.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr next I'm going to call
 
05:09:45.708 --> 05:09:45.718 align:start position:0%
Randall uh uh Salis caller Coler sorry R
 
05:09:45.718 --> 05:09:54.430 align:start position:0%
Randall uh uh Salis caller Coler sorry R
caller

05:09:54.430 --> 05:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:56.430 --> 05:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
caller thank you for committing for
 
05:09:58.230 --> 05:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
letting me ask some questions regarding
 
05:10:01.788 --> 05:10:01.798 align:start position:0%
this training um in regards to Michael
 
05:10:04.390 --> 05:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
guard 323 testimony here in the same
 
05:10:06.910 --> 05:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
room regarding the judges not getting
 
05:10:07.948 --> 05:10:07.958 align:start position:0%
the proper
 
05:10:10.430 --> 05:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
training um I have a medical license for
 
05:10:11.948 --> 05:10:11.958 align:start position:0%
over 20 years and I understand
 
05:10:13.750 --> 05:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
continuing education and every two years
 
05:10:15.868 --> 05:10:15.878 align:start position:0%
we have to do 60 hours of continuing
 
05:10:18.548 --> 05:10:18.558 align:start position:0%
education it's not necessarily to train
 
05:10:20.868 --> 05:10:20.878 align:start position:0%
us to do different things it's so that
 
05:10:23.110 --> 05:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
we understand that we know what we're
 
05:10:27.070 --> 05:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
doing um and I I kind of want to bring
 
05:10:29.190 --> 05:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
the training back to the legislative
 
05:10:33.830 --> 05:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
body um you know right ing statutes that
 
05:10:36.548 --> 05:10:36.558 align:start position:0%
that clearly violate law as a Madbury
 
05:10:38.990 --> 05:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
verse Madison 1803 any law repu to the
 
05:10:42.270 --> 05:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution must be anul and and and
 
05:10:42.280 --> 05:10:43.788 align:start position:0%
Constitution must be anul and and and
repealed

05:10:43.788 --> 05:10:43.798 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
05:10:47.788 --> 05:10:47.798 align:start position:0%
um is it the training of the Judiciary
 
05:10:49.070 --> 05:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
or or the
 
05:10:51.910 --> 05:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
courts um or their understanding that
 
05:10:55.270 --> 05:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
that rules do supersede the Constitution
 
05:10:58.030 --> 05:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
and and how is that training um being
 
05:11:00.628 --> 05:11:00.638 align:start position:0%
implemented on the legislative side to
 
05:11:02.990 --> 05:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
the people actually writing the statutes
 
05:11:06.030 --> 05:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
and allowing this to happen um I'm not
 
05:11:09.230 --> 05:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
sure it's any training is needed uh for
 
05:11:09.240 --> 05:11:10.430 align:start position:0%
sure it's any training is needed uh for
the

05:11:10.430 --> 05:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:11:13.350 --> 05:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
judges because if the rules if their
 
05:11:15.230 --> 05:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
private rules supersede the Constitution
 
05:11:16.910 --> 05:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
when you go to law school I assume
 
05:11:19.310 --> 05:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
you're taught that you take an all to
 
05:11:21.350 --> 05:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
defend the Constitution as of military
 
05:11:23.788 --> 05:11:23.798 align:start position:0%
veterans to defend against this country
 
05:11:26.390 --> 05:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
against enemies foreign and domestic
 
05:11:27.708 --> 05:11:27.718 align:start position:0%
obviously the judges are domestic
 
05:11:29.868 --> 05:11:29.878 align:start position:0%
enemies because rules supersede the
 
05:11:31.990 --> 05:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution um so again I have
 
05:11:33.830 --> 05:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
questions regarding the training as well
 
05:11:36.708 --> 05:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
but uh is the
 
05:11:38.750 --> 05:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
training going to be able to
 
05:11:41.990 --> 05:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
differentiate how their rules supersede
 
05:11:45.070 --> 05:11:45.080 align:start position:0%
the Constitution and laws um I'm just
 
05:11:46.868 --> 05:11:46.878 align:start position:0%
curious to that as well and I'll take
 
05:11:49.548 --> 05:11:49.558 align:start position:0%
any questions questions for this
 
05:11:52.628 --> 05:11:52.638 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you sir uh
 
05:12:00.868 --> 05:12:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:03.788 --> 05:12:03.798 align:start position:0%
ronaldi it's clear and convincing that
 
05:12:06.990 --> 05:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
we have three people here today that uh
 
05:12:09.190 --> 05:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
have have done with this and have a lot
 
05:12:09.200 --> 05:12:10.270 align:start position:0%
have have done with this and have a lot
of

05:12:10.270 --> 05:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:12:13.470 --> 05:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
experience um I would I only want to
 
05:12:14.470 --> 05:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
make a
 
05:12:16.470 --> 05:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh to cover the checks
 
05:12:19.510 --> 05:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
and balances to make sure that and to
 
05:12:24.590 --> 05:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
give the the trainer the authority to
 
05:12:29.110 --> 05:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
implement uh dummy cases going in front
 
05:12:32.030 --> 05:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
of these judges so that you have the the
 
05:12:34.470 --> 05:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
ability to see if their training is
 
05:12:37.390 --> 05:12:37.400 align:start position:0%
working uh that can be established other
 
05:12:40.310 --> 05:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
states are doing it uh the judges shall
 
05:12:43.470 --> 05:12:43.480 align:start position:0%
not be aware of it uh and we put these
 
05:12:44.788 --> 05:12:44.798 align:start position:0%
people to the
 
05:12:48.350 --> 05:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
test and I think by doing that not only
 
05:12:50.150 --> 05:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
will you solve a lot of your problems
 
05:12:52.390 --> 05:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
but you'll find a lot of the wrongdoers
 
05:12:55.910 --> 05:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
as well so uh I think that should be
 
05:12:59.750 --> 05:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
implemented in what is allowed with the
 
05:13:03.230 --> 05:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
the the trainer uh through facilitating
 
05:13:06.070 --> 05:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
education to these judges uh that I
 
05:13:09.150 --> 05:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
believe is needed
 
05:13:11.948 --> 05:13:11.958 align:start position:0%
um I believe also that a lot of these
 
05:13:13.590 --> 05:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
judges don't want to deal with the
 
05:13:16.030 --> 05:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
family court because of the problems
 
05:13:20.750 --> 05:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
within Family Court nobody likes to
 
05:13:23.510 --> 05:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh how how do you say deal with other
 
05:13:27.310 --> 05:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
people's problems uh so so it is a it is
 
05:13:29.150 --> 05:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
a situation where
 
05:13:31.868 --> 05:13:31.878 align:start position:0%
finding uh proper judges to deal with
 
05:13:34.868 --> 05:13:34.878 align:start position:0%
with these these cases on an individual
 
05:13:38.070 --> 05:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
basis through that training and that the
 
05:13:40.030 --> 05:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
authority should be given to the trainer
 
05:13:42.070 --> 05:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
to know who those people are as well
 
05:13:45.390 --> 05:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
because like Mrs Smith said some people
 
05:13:48.030 --> 05:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
just don't have the skills and when you
 
05:13:49.510 --> 05:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
run into that
 
05:13:53.230 --> 05:13:53.240 align:start position:0%
situation uh it can make a cloudy day uh
 
05:13:57.470 --> 05:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
very quickly so again uh with a trainer
 
05:14:00.310 --> 05:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea uh but having those
 
05:14:02.230 --> 05:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
checks and balances
 
05:14:04.230 --> 05:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
in place to know that the training is
 
05:14:07.070 --> 05:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
working has to be established because
 
05:14:09.350 --> 05:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
anybody can go sit in school and you
 
05:14:11.150 --> 05:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
know I put my glasses on and you don't
 
05:14:14.390 --> 05:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
know if I'm paying attention or not I
 
05:14:16.670 --> 05:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
so that's where that's where I think
 
05:14:21.470 --> 05:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
we're at and to break the I'm sorry but
 
05:14:25.190 --> 05:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
it's the good old boy routine uh that
 
05:14:27.708 --> 05:14:27.718 align:start position:0%
should also be in training as well
 
05:14:30.270 --> 05:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
because they take full advantage of that
 
05:14:33.990 --> 05:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
privilege uh when and uh these
 
05:14:36.190 --> 05:14:36.200 align:start position:0%
individuals get comfortable with each
 
05:14:41.548 --> 05:14:41.558 align:start position:0%
other they tend to pass over uh
 
05:14:45.548 --> 05:14:45.558 align:start position:0%
crucial uh things that uh could help a
 
05:14:49.310 --> 05:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
lot of situations so uh through training
 
05:14:52.270 --> 05:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
they should be trained not to do that so
 
05:14:55.070 --> 05:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
training should be working both ways on
 
05:14:57.990 --> 05:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
things that uh should happen and things
 
05:15:00.430 --> 05:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't happen and and that all
 
05:15:03.270 --> 05:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
should be clear to the public so we know
 
05:15:06.310 --> 05:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
what our our our judges are being
 
05:15:11.070 --> 05:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
trained in um again it's transparency is
 
05:15:13.788 --> 05:15:13.798 align:start position:0%
probably key here so all right questions
 
05:15:16.868 --> 05:15:16.878 align:start position:0%
for this witness seeing none thank you
 
05:15:19.590 --> 05:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
sir uh is there anyone else who wishes
 
05:15:23.230 --> 05:15:23.240 align:start position:0%
to uh testify on
 
05:15:26.150 --> 05:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
hb15 relative to judicial
 
05:15:30.548 --> 05:15:30.558 align:start position:0%
training oh yes come on
 
05:15:30.558 --> 05:15:37.628 align:start position:0%
training oh yes come on
up

05:15:37.628 --> 05:15:37.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:39.270 --> 05:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Representatives my name
 
05:15:40.990 --> 05:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
is Aron krian I'm the general counsel
 
05:15:43.990 --> 05:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
for the judicial branch um and I've I've
 
05:15:45.830 --> 05:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
come to try to answer any questions I
 
05:15:47.390 --> 05:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
know I've I've seen some discussion so
 
05:15:49.830 --> 05:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make myself available to do
 
05:15:53.110 --> 05:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
so and I suppose I will have to engage
 
05:15:55.590 --> 05:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
in the Fool's errand of discussing with
 
05:15:58.030 --> 05:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
a former Chief Justice and the current
 
05:16:01.030 --> 05:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
head of the house Judiciary Committee uh
 
05:16:02.910 --> 05:16:02.920 align:start position:0%
the ex act parameters of what
 
05:16:04.990 --> 05:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
constitutes an administrative
 
05:16:08.788 --> 05:16:08.798 align:start position:0%
responsibility under uh article 73a and
 
05:16:10.270 --> 05:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
and some of the technical advice that I
 
05:16:12.510 --> 05:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
may have given and I'm happy to do
 
05:16:16.910 --> 05:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
that um I'm I don't I I don't have any
 
05:16:18.990 --> 05:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
questions right now but if I mean if
 
05:16:20.628 --> 05:16:20.638 align:start position:0%
there if there's something that you
 
05:16:23.390 --> 05:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
think we um you know we should know
 
05:16:26.190 --> 05:16:26.200 align:start position:0%
about uh please tell it tell us I may
 
05:16:28.548 --> 05:16:28.558 align:start position:0%
have in particular with regard to the
 
05:16:30.868 --> 05:16:30.878 align:start position:0%
next bill I may have there may be some
 
05:16:32.390 --> 05:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
some questions but does anybody have
 
05:16:34.830 --> 05:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
05:16:38.590 --> 05:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative Staples yes I
 
05:16:40.548 --> 05:16:40.558 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know what you have in mind
 
05:16:43.510 --> 05:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
relative to this bill if it's useful
 
05:16:45.990 --> 05:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
compliant with what you're already doing
 
05:16:48.590 --> 05:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
um different what whatever the substance
 
05:16:51.590 --> 05:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
of your anticipation of this bill's
 
05:16:55.430 --> 05:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
value thank you for that question um
 
05:16:57.310 --> 05:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
there is no doubt that we would benefit
 
05:16:59.110 --> 05:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
from more training uh it is something
 
05:17:00.670 --> 05:17:00.680 align:start position:0%
that we're very supportive of and that
 
05:17:02.230 --> 05:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
the ways that that can accomplished are
 
05:17:04.470 --> 05:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
many um appointing a Judicial training
 
05:17:06.150 --> 05:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
coordinator is something that other
 
05:17:08.350 --> 05:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
states do we do not have a dedicated
 
05:17:11.070 --> 05:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
judicial training coordinator currently
 
05:17:13.150 --> 05:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
um a lot of our training is done either
 
05:17:14.708 --> 05:17:14.718 align:start position:0%
by the training staff that we have in
 
05:17:17.470 --> 05:17:17.480 align:start position:0%
our HR department um or by the circuit
 
05:17:19.430 --> 05:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
court or a superior court administrator
 
05:17:21.788 --> 05:17:21.798 align:start position:0%
who have many other duties and make make
 
05:17:24.470 --> 05:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
the time to do this um so it is it is
 
05:17:25.830 --> 05:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
one of many ideas to improve our
 
05:17:27.628 --> 05:17:27.638 align:start position:0%
training but it is it is one that we
 
05:17:30.110 --> 05:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
would certainly adopt and utilize if if
 
05:17:32.350 --> 05:17:32.360 align:start position:0%
the position were created and funded
 
05:17:34.030 --> 05:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
uh I I say that without any Prejudice
 
05:17:36.190 --> 05:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
any other ideas uh the legislature may
 
05:17:38.948 --> 05:17:38.958 align:start position:0%
have about improving training but we can
 
05:17:42.070 --> 05:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
always do better a major limitation for
 
05:17:45.230 --> 05:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
our Circuit Court judges is workload um
 
05:17:47.990 --> 05:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
even when we have training and funds
 
05:17:50.548 --> 05:17:50.558 align:start position:0%
available we are simply not able to get
 
05:17:52.390 --> 05:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
them off the bench uh and I know that
 
05:17:53.830 --> 05:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
that's something many representatives
 
05:17:55.708 --> 05:17:55.718 align:start position:0%
have been very dedicated toward working
 
05:17:57.548 --> 05:17:57.558 align:start position:0%
on and ensuring that we can get more
 
05:17:59.990 --> 05:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
judges so that we can free them up uh to
 
05:18:01.670 --> 05:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
to even receive the training opposed to
 
05:18:04.030 --> 05:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
being on the bench so many days but it
 
05:18:06.190 --> 05:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
is something that we would like to do
 
05:18:07.670 --> 05:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
more of we're absolutely happy to do
 
05:18:07.680 --> 05:18:09.350 align:start position:0%
more of we're absolutely happy to do
more

05:18:09.350 --> 05:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:18:12.510 --> 05:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
training yes so I would take that you're
 
05:18:15.470 --> 05:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill even in a general
 
05:18:17.548 --> 05:18:17.558 align:start position:0%
sense the only thing I would say is
 
05:18:19.070 --> 05:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
representing the judiciaries we always
 
05:18:20.708 --> 05:18:20.718 align:start position:0%
defer to the legislature on policy
 
05:18:22.070 --> 05:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
matters and there are many ways to
 
05:18:23.708 --> 05:18:23.718 align:start position:0%
improve training and so I I would not
 
05:18:25.070 --> 05:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
want to interfere with the debate that
 
05:18:26.788 --> 05:18:26.798 align:start position:0%
you have about the ways to accomplish
 
05:18:28.830 --> 05:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
that but we would certainly if at this
 
05:18:29.948 --> 05:18:29.958 align:start position:0%
position were created and fund it
 
05:18:33.948 --> 05:18:33.958 align:start position:0%
utilize it oh is there any idea of how
 
05:18:37.750 --> 05:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
this might be better made any particular
 
05:18:42.510 --> 05:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
items well I uh I had uh given uh rad
 
05:18:44.430 --> 05:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
the advice that uh if it were structured
 
05:18:46.910 --> 05:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
in such a way that it uh complied with
 
05:18:48.510 --> 05:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
the chief Justice's administrative
 
05:18:50.510 --> 05:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
Authority that that is why I believe she
 
05:18:52.110 --> 05:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
added some of the language on the Chief
 
05:18:54.230 --> 05:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
Justice being the person to administer
 
05:18:57.270 --> 05:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
it that that uh may make the the statute
 
05:18:59.070 --> 05:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
more durable so for example in the most
 
05:19:00.708 --> 05:19:00.718 align:start position:0%
recent Bill we were discussing which was
 
05:19:03.110 --> 05:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
relating to the legislatively created uh
 
05:19:05.750 --> 05:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
disciplinary committee for judges was
 
05:19:07.350 --> 05:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
ultimately ruled to be unconstitutional
 
05:19:08.948 --> 05:19:08.958 align:start position:0%
on the basis that discipline had to was
 
05:19:10.390 --> 05:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
an administrative function one that the
 
05:19:13.670 --> 05:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice held and I I don't think
 
05:19:15.270 --> 05:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
there's definitive law on this issue but
 
05:19:17.628 --> 05:19:17.638 align:start position:0%
if if one can't discipline members of
 
05:19:19.948 --> 05:19:19.958 align:start position:0%
another Branch the M may not be able to
 
05:19:21.510 --> 05:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
set a training requirement either that
 
05:19:24.310 --> 05:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
seems to be substantially a Personnel
 
05:19:26.390 --> 05:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
related issue that I I did want to
 
05:19:28.110 --> 05:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
advise the rep I think there there could
 
05:19:29.390 --> 05:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
be some risk there but that's not an
 
05:19:30.750 --> 05:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
advanced opinion it would it would have
 
05:19:33.310 --> 05:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
to be litigated and another judge may
 
05:19:35.750 --> 05:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
come out another way on that issue but I
 
05:19:37.750 --> 05:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
certainly try when uh I I receive
 
05:19:39.310 --> 05:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
questions to flag that there could be an
 
05:19:40.548 --> 05:19:40.558 align:start position:0%
issue there and that I'm happy to work
 
05:19:41.910 --> 05:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
with folks to try to structure things in
 
05:19:43.990 --> 05:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
a way where we can work cooperatively
 
05:19:45.788 --> 05:19:45.798 align:start position:0%
with the legislature to implement your
 
05:19:48.150 --> 05:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
policy intention uh without potentially
 
05:19:50.190 --> 05:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
creating for example a legal challenge
 
05:19:52.150 --> 05:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
but there's not an overstep problem at
 
05:19:53.910 --> 05:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
this point with the way this is written
 
05:19:55.830 --> 05:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
at this point as you see it that's the
 
05:19:57.948 --> 05:19:57.958 align:start position:0%
advice that i' I'd given to the rep okay
 
05:20:00.150 --> 05:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:20:04.830 --> 05:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you um does the legislature
 
05:20:06.150 --> 05:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
have the
 
05:20:10.470 --> 05:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:17.390 --> 05:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:20.548 --> 05:20:20.558 align:start position:0%
judgeships yes ma'am I believe you do
 
05:20:23.628 --> 05:20:23.638 align:start position:0%
and could you tell me how that differs
 
05:20:26.708 --> 05:20:26.718 align:start position:0%
from an authority to create an
 
05:20:30.110 --> 05:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
additional staff position I think that
 
05:20:32.150 --> 05:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
you can create additional staff
 
05:20:34.110 --> 05:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
positions uh and that's something that
 
05:20:36.590 --> 05:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
you you have done historically I think
 
05:20:37.990 --> 05:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
that when sometimes when something gets
 
05:20:40.190 --> 05:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
into the day-to-day administration of
 
05:20:42.310 --> 05:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
the Personnel that comes more within
 
05:20:43.590 --> 05:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
what one might consider to be
 
05:20:45.628 --> 05:20:45.638 align:start position:0%
administrative in nature but certainly
 
05:20:46.868 --> 05:20:46.878 align:start position:0%
that term as it exists in the
 
05:20:49.070 --> 05:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution has has been litigated will
 
05:20:51.548 --> 05:20:51.558 align:start position:0%
be litigated exactly what it covers is
 
05:20:57.270 --> 05:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
Administrative versus not well um Am I
 
05:21:00.548 --> 05:21:00.558 align:start position:0%
Wrong is is the Supreme Court the only
 
05:21:03.270 --> 05:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
Court that's actually specified in the
 
05:21:05.548 --> 05:21:05.558 align:start position:0%
state constitution is I know it is in
 
05:21:06.990 --> 05:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
the Federal Constitution but in the
 
05:21:08.910 --> 05:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
State Constitution are the other courts
 
05:21:10.110 --> 05:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
the superior court is also a
 
05:21:12.628 --> 05:21:12.638 align:start position:0%
constitutionally created Court okay but
 
05:21:14.708 --> 05:21:14.718 align:start position:0%
not not the Circuit Court no ma'am that
 
05:21:16.070 --> 05:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
is by
 
05:21:19.708 --> 05:21:19.718 align:start position:0%
Statute thank you thank you very much
 
05:21:23.310 --> 05:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
you know just question my my impression
 
05:21:25.830 --> 05:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
and again it's the firstand experience
 
05:21:27.510 --> 05:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
is four years old now more than four
 
05:21:30.868 --> 05:21:30.878 align:start position:0%
years old but my my experience uh from
 
05:21:32.350 --> 05:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
when when I was in the judicial branch
 
05:21:36.948 --> 05:21:36.958 align:start position:0%
was that often training matters uh
 
05:21:40.910 --> 05:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
particularly for judges was sort of um
 
05:21:43.230 --> 05:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
was kind of an add-on Duty so to speak
 
05:21:45.150 --> 05:21:45.160 align:start position:0%
of whoever either the Chief Justice of
 
05:21:46.470 --> 05:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court or the Chief Justice
 
05:21:48.150 --> 05:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
of super court or the administrative
 
05:21:51.150 --> 05:21:51.160 align:start position:0%
judge of the circuit court
 
05:21:53.910 --> 05:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
and depending on all the other things
 
05:21:57.390 --> 05:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
that whoever that judge was uh had to be
 
05:22:00.628 --> 05:22:00.638 align:start position:0%
done it got more or less attention and
 
05:22:00.638 --> 05:22:01.830 align:start position:0%
done it got more or less attention and
so

05:22:01.830 --> 05:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:22:03.708 --> 05:22:03.718 align:start position:0%
if we created this training coordinator
 
05:22:05.788 --> 05:22:05.798 align:start position:0%
position that would that would be the
 
05:22:08.990 --> 05:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
job of that person and I take it that's
 
05:22:10.470 --> 05:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things you were sort of
 
05:22:13.310 --> 05:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
getting at before yes sir that is
 
05:22:15.628 --> 05:22:15.638 align:start position:0%
correct it is an ancillary Duty for most
 
05:22:16.990 --> 05:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
people who work in this area and that
 
05:22:18.788 --> 05:22:18.798 align:start position:0%
means if they have something that is
 
05:22:21.548 --> 05:22:21.558 align:start position:0%
either more urgent or more important uh
 
05:22:23.510 --> 05:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
then that whatever is more urgent or
 
05:22:25.868 --> 05:22:25.878 align:start position:0%
more important may get more attention uh
 
05:22:27.948 --> 05:22:27.958 align:start position:0%
if if you give someone a first priority
 
05:22:29.390 --> 05:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
of being training there should not be
 
05:22:31.670 --> 05:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
something that comes before that prior
 
05:22:34.948 --> 05:22:34.958 align:start position:0%
priority other questions yes
 
05:22:38.628 --> 05:22:38.638 align:start position:0%
repres do you read this legislation to
 
05:22:41.430 --> 05:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
indicate that the training coordinator
 
05:22:44.510 --> 05:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
would be responsible directly to the
 
05:22:44.520 --> 05:22:45.708 align:start position:0%
would be responsible directly to the
Chief

05:22:45.708 --> 05:22:45.718 align:start position:0%
Chief
 
05:22:48.788 --> 05:22:48.798 align:start position:0%
Justice I don't ma'am although I I would
 
05:22:50.628 --> 05:22:50.638 align:start position:0%
not want to ever represent that I am
 
05:22:52.708 --> 05:22:52.718 align:start position:0%
making a definitive assessment of it but
 
05:22:54.270 --> 05:22:54.280 align:start position:0%
the way that I read it it's at the
 
05:22:55.590 --> 05:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
direction of the chief justice that
 
05:22:58.150 --> 05:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
could also be a delegated responsibility
 
05:23:00.190 --> 05:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much my particular
 
05:23:00.200 --> 05:23:01.390 align:start position:0%
thank you very much my particular
concern

05:23:01.390 --> 05:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
concern
 
05:23:05.948 --> 05:23:05.958 align:start position:0%
Mr chair is that the demands of judges
 
05:23:09.948 --> 05:23:09.958 align:start position:0%
in the Circuit Court differ dramatically
 
05:23:13.430 --> 05:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
from the demands on the Superior Court
 
05:23:16.670 --> 05:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
judges and on the Supreme Court judges I
 
05:23:18.830 --> 05:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
I agree completely and so I think it's
 
05:23:22.750 --> 05:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
important to be able to have depth and
 
05:23:26.510 --> 05:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
breadth in handling that I I agree I
 
05:23:29.110 --> 05:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
agree completely with that thank you all
 
05:23:31.708 --> 05:23:31.718 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much thank you
 
05:23:31.718 --> 05:23:59.788 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much thank you
you

05:23:59.788 --> 05:23:59.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:59.798 --> 05:24:16.110 align:start position:0%
 
certainly

05:24:16.110 --> 05:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:18.070 --> 05:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
okay being that's 2:30 we'll now open
 
05:24:20.190 --> 05:24:20.200 align:start position:0%
the hearing on house build
 
05:24:23.708 --> 05:24:23.718 align:start position:0%
1274 and representative Lynn the floor
 
05:24:23.718 --> 05:24:24.510 align:start position:0%
1274 and representative Lynn the floor
is

05:24:24.510 --> 05:24:24.520 align:start position:0%

yours thank you Mr chair members of the
 
05:24:31.948 --> 05:24:31.958 align:start position:0%
committee um I I have uh uh referred to
 
05:24:33.670 --> 05:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
this bill as sort of the judicial
 
05:24:36.030 --> 05:24:36.040 align:start position:0%
cleanup bill and I did that because uh
 
05:24:38.830 --> 05:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
in speaking with uh members of the
 
05:24:42.948 --> 05:24:42.958 align:start position:0%
judicial councel who are here uh in the
 
05:24:44.868 --> 05:24:44.878 align:start position:0%
event that you have any detailed
 
05:24:46.868 --> 05:24:46.878 align:start position:0%
questions about the problems I will try
 
05:24:51.070 --> 05:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
to address as we go through this um the
 
05:24:53.230 --> 05:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
uh what the the various things that the
 
05:24:56.350 --> 05:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to accomplish and why uh
 
05:24:59.868 --> 05:24:59.878 align:start position:0%
but if my uh if if I if you have
 
05:25:01.628 --> 05:25:01.638 align:start position:0%
questions that I don't the detailed
 
05:25:03.350 --> 05:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
answers to I'm going to I'm going to
 
05:25:05.990 --> 05:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
defer to the people who are the experts
 
05:25:08.708 --> 05:25:08.718 align:start position:0%
um but basically this bill was designed
 
05:25:14.670 --> 05:25:14.680 align:start position:0%
to um uh correct a number of things in
 
05:25:16.708 --> 05:25:16.718 align:start position:0%
current law that for one reason or
 
05:25:20.628 --> 05:25:20.638 align:start position:0%
another um uh are not in accordance with
 
05:25:21.830 --> 05:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh kind of
 
05:25:24.990 --> 05:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
what current practice so to speak and so
 
05:25:29.390 --> 05:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
for example in the um in the first
 
05:25:34.230 --> 05:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
section um you'll notice that the uh on
 
05:25:38.030 --> 05:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
line four it changes from four to five
 
05:25:39.910 --> 05:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
the number of uh the members of the
 
05:25:42.310 --> 05:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
judicial branch administrative Council
 
05:25:44.070 --> 05:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
because in fact there are five members
 
05:25:47.948 --> 05:25:47.958 align:start position:0%
now and not four as there used to be um
 
05:25:54.470 --> 05:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh the uh on line seven um they uh in
 
05:25:59.390 --> 05:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
terms of um of uh the composition of the
 
05:26:01.230 --> 05:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
judicial Council
 
05:26:04.030 --> 05:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
uh the the words the word or
 
05:26:06.590 --> 05:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
administrator um is added to clerk
 
05:26:10.190 --> 05:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
because over time you it used to be in
 
05:26:14.310 --> 05:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch that um the the
 
05:26:16.948 --> 05:26:16.958 align:start position:0%
clerks of the various courts were sort
 
05:26:18.510 --> 05:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:26:21.190 --> 05:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
administrators um and there was less for
 
05:26:22.628 --> 05:26:22.638 align:start position:0%
lack of a better term
 
05:26:24.788 --> 05:26:24.798 align:start position:0%
centralization over time that has
 
05:26:27.270 --> 05:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
changed quite a bit and so admin there
 
05:26:29.110 --> 05:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
are now many administrators in the
 
05:26:31.750 --> 05:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
judicial branch and so this is designed
 
05:26:33.948 --> 05:26:33.958 align:start position:0%
just to ensure that that those people
 
05:26:37.990 --> 05:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
may be uh um may be covered in terms of
 
05:26:40.310 --> 05:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
being eligible to be members of the
 
05:26:45.990 --> 05:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
judicial council with regard um to uh to
 
05:26:46.000 --> 05:26:47.788 align:start position:0%
judicial council with regard um to uh to
line

05:26:47.788 --> 05:26:47.798 align:start position:0%
line
 
05:26:52.190 --> 05:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
16 uh for the par the sections 8 Roman
 
05:26:56.390 --> 05:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
numeral 8 and and Roman numeral 9 um
 
05:27:01.548 --> 05:27:01.558 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that um it is uh it is
 
05:27:04.470 --> 05:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
changed the the language is changed to
 
05:27:09.750 --> 05:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
propose that um there'll uh there shall
 
05:27:12.708 --> 05:27:12.718 align:start position:0%
be uh eight me eight other members
 
05:27:14.310 --> 05:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor and Council
 
05:27:16.670 --> 05:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
three of whom shall be lawyers of white
 
05:27:18.750 --> 05:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
experience and at least two of whom
 
05:27:20.548 --> 05:27:20.558 align:start position:0%
shall be members of New Hampshire bar
 
05:27:22.430 --> 05:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
and basically what that was as you'll
 
05:27:25.948 --> 05:27:25.958 align:start position:0%
see the change basically says that not
 
05:27:29.190 --> 05:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
every um member has to be a member of
 
05:27:31.868 --> 05:27:31.878 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire bar uh there can be
 
05:27:34.150 --> 05:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
there can be some that might be a member
 
05:27:36.190 --> 05:27:36.200 align:start position:0%
of that might be lawyers but not members
 
05:27:38.590 --> 05:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire bar and and I will
 
05:27:41.030 --> 05:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
tell you and I will ask uh my my
 
05:27:42.990 --> 05:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
colleagues who who may come to testify
 
05:27:45.948 --> 05:27:45.958 align:start position:0%
after me um that that I think one of the
 
05:27:48.470 --> 05:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
reasons for this was that there was
 
05:27:51.830 --> 05:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
there was uh uh uh Mr shil for example
 
05:27:53.670 --> 05:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned to me that there was that
 
05:27:55.628 --> 05:27:55.638 align:start position:0%
there was a person who would be a a
 
05:27:58.430 --> 05:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
really who who was in New Hampshire now
 
05:28:00.070 --> 05:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
had been in New Hampshire for a while
 
05:28:01.628 --> 05:28:01.638 align:start position:0%
would would appear to be someone who
 
05:28:03.548 --> 05:28:03.558 align:start position:0%
would be a really excellent person to
 
05:28:05.310 --> 05:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
serve on the judicial Council but was
 
05:28:07.030 --> 05:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
not a member of the New Hampshire bar
 
05:28:09.430 --> 05:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
and should that person um be
 
05:28:12.910 --> 05:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
automatically not not eligible to serve
 
05:28:16.390 --> 05:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
um while at the same time he recognized
 
05:28:18.190 --> 05:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
that there we we we want to make sure
 
05:28:20.270 --> 05:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
that we have ample representation of
 
05:28:21.670 --> 05:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
people who are members of the New
 
05:28:23.590 --> 05:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire bar so that's why the wording
 
05:28:25.910 --> 05:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
was changed um in that regard and I'm
 
05:28:27.230 --> 05:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
hoping that he would be able to speak
 
05:28:28.830 --> 05:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
more you know if you have questions he
 
05:28:31.070 --> 05:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
would be able to address that uh in more
 
05:28:33.628 --> 05:28:33.638 align:start position:0%
detail um and the same is true in
 
05:28:37.030 --> 05:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
paragraph nine
 
05:28:41.190 --> 05:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
um with regard to moving on to page two
 
05:28:44.788 --> 05:28:44.798 align:start position:0%
uh in section three of the bill uh the
 
05:28:47.708 --> 05:28:47.718 align:start position:0%
the changes made there are
 
05:28:51.430 --> 05:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
designed basically to make to bring the
 
05:28:57.110 --> 05:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
law uh back uh to to be consistent with
 
05:28:59.310 --> 05:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
the fact that the felony
 
05:29:04.070 --> 05:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
first program has been is ending um
 
05:29:06.868 --> 05:29:06.878 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll see the language that um
 
05:29:09.830 --> 05:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
online on page two line 8 which is where
 
05:29:12.868 --> 05:29:12.878 align:start position:0%
where it says the person uh this is an
 
05:29:14.708 --> 05:29:14.718 align:start position:0%
arrested person shall be taken to appear
 
05:29:19.270 --> 05:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
before a circuit court um or uh a
 
05:29:21.510 --> 05:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
superior court whereas the old language
 
05:29:24.190 --> 05:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
said taken before a circuit court or in
 
05:29:26.110 --> 05:29:26.120 align:start position:0%
the case of a felony complaint and
 
05:29:29.430 --> 05:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors and violation level charges
 
05:29:31.270 --> 05:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
that are related directly to those
 
05:29:33.548 --> 05:29:33.558 align:start position:0%
felonies that that was the language that
 
05:29:37.310 --> 05:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
was in effect when the felony's first uh
 
05:29:39.670 --> 05:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh system was in in a in place and now
 
05:29:41.830 --> 05:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
that since that's been repealed that
 
05:29:43.270 --> 05:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
language really doesn't make sense
 
05:29:47.310 --> 05:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
anymore so that's the reason for that
 
05:29:50.110 --> 05:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
um lastly in section
 
05:29:50.120 --> 05:29:51.670 align:start position:0%
um lastly in section
four

05:29:51.670 --> 05:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
four
 
05:29:56.110 --> 05:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
um this uh is designed that this is
 
05:30:01.190 --> 05:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
designed to add a new to add to RSA 604
 
05:30:04.230 --> 05:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
A2 uh a new paragraph
 
05:30:10.510 --> 05:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
2A that um basically says that there
 
05:30:14.510 --> 05:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
um uh that the court May uh appoint a
 
05:30:14.520 --> 05:30:15.670 align:start position:0%
um uh that the court May uh appoint a
contract

05:30:15.670 --> 05:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
contract
 
05:30:18.470 --> 05:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
attorney uh or other qualified attorney
 
05:30:21.310 --> 05:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
in the first instance um if it is in the
 
05:30:23.390 --> 05:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
interest of Justice to do so and let me
 
05:30:28.350 --> 05:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
give you the example of um of uh where
 
05:30:31.470 --> 05:30:31.480 align:start position:0%
of where this might come into play
 
05:30:33.750 --> 05:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
normally as you probably know some of
 
05:30:35.470 --> 05:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
you who've been at least some of you
 
05:30:37.830 --> 05:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
have been around for a while the
 
05:30:41.190 --> 05:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
the the way the Indigent defense system
 
05:30:44.350 --> 05:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
works is that the first if if somebody
 
05:30:46.190 --> 05:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
is Indigent and need is charged with a
 
05:30:49.910 --> 05:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
crime or needs representation the first
 
05:30:52.788 --> 05:30:52.798 align:start position:0%
place that that per that that the person
 
05:30:55.910 --> 05:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
goes or that the court appoints uh an
 
05:30:57.670 --> 05:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
attorney to represent the person is the
 
05:31:00.670 --> 05:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
public defender if the public Defender
 
05:31:03.510 --> 05:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
is not available or has a and often it's
 
05:31:04.948 --> 05:31:04.958 align:start position:0%
the public defender is not available
 
05:31:06.910 --> 05:31:06.920 align:start position:0%
because there's a conflict of interest
 
05:31:09.030 --> 05:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
if the public defender is not available
 
05:31:11.708 --> 05:31:11.718 align:start position:0%
then it would go to a contract attorney
 
05:31:13.708 --> 05:31:13.718 align:start position:0%
attorneys who have contracts with the
 
05:31:15.670 --> 05:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
with the court system to provide
 
05:31:18.110 --> 05:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
representation and then if that if there
 
05:31:20.590 --> 05:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
was no contract attorney available then
 
05:31:23.110 --> 05:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
it would go to to another attorney who
 
05:31:26.948 --> 05:31:26.958 align:start position:0%
would you know be willing to to serve um
 
05:31:29.150 --> 05:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh as attorney for the
 
05:31:29.160 --> 05:31:31.310 align:start position:0%
uh as attorney for the
individual

05:31:31.310 --> 05:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
individual
 
05:31:35.708 --> 05:31:35.718 align:start position:0%
sometimes what what may happen is there
 
05:31:38.150 --> 05:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
may I give you this example and I think
 
05:31:41.070 --> 05:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
Mr sril uh or Mr Bucky may be able to
 
05:31:43.910 --> 05:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
articulate on this better but as I
 
05:31:45.350 --> 05:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
understand it you may have you may have
 
05:31:45.360 --> 05:31:46.270 align:start position:0%
understand it you may have you may have
a

05:31:46.270 --> 05:31:46.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:31:48.868 --> 05:31:48.878 align:start position:0%
circumstance where the public defender's
 
05:31:52.270 --> 05:31:52.280 align:start position:0%
office has a conflict in a particular
 
05:31:54.910 --> 05:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
case they can't represent Mr Smith let's
 
05:31:59.470 --> 05:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
say I I let me Mr X let me change that
 
05:32:02.750 --> 05:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
to Mr X the public defender office can't
 
05:32:07.150 --> 05:32:07.160 align:start position:0%
represent Mr X uh in a particular case
 
05:32:11.030 --> 05:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
so a the um uh and let's assume that
 
05:32:12.270 --> 05:32:12.280 align:start position:0%
there's not a contract attorney
 
05:32:15.110 --> 05:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
available but so you go down to the
 
05:32:18.430 --> 05:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
third level so the court appoints
 
05:32:22.708 --> 05:32:22.718 align:start position:0%
attorney Jones to represent Mr
 
05:32:28.670 --> 05:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
X now Mr X as not infrequently turns out
 
05:32:31.910 --> 05:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
to be the case now Mr X is charged with
 
05:32:34.910 --> 05:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
another crime and the public defender
 
05:32:37.430 --> 05:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
office doesn't have a conflict in the
 
05:32:40.868 --> 05:32:40.878 align:start position:0%
other case the way the law work works
 
05:32:43.510 --> 05:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
now the public defender office would be
 
05:32:47.030 --> 05:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
appointed in that second case and what
 
05:32:49.390 --> 05:32:49.400 align:start position:0%
the judicial Council reports to me and
 
05:32:52.430 --> 05:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
it seems to me to make some sense is
 
05:32:55.590 --> 05:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes that doesn't make it it it
 
05:32:58.190 --> 05:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
just doesn't make sense to have the one
 
05:33:00.788 --> 05:33:00.798 align:start position:0%
defendant have two lawyers it might make
 
05:33:04.590 --> 05:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
more sense if there's a if if another
 
05:33:07.350 --> 05:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
lawyer has been if a non-public Defender
 
05:33:08.948 --> 05:33:08.958 align:start position:0%
has been appointed to represent the
 
05:33:11.350 --> 05:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
person in the first case it would just
 
05:33:14.750 --> 05:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
make more sense for that per that lawyer
 
05:33:17.548 --> 05:33:17.558 align:start position:0%
to continue to represent the the person
 
05:33:20.030 --> 05:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
in the second case for continuity
 
05:33:23.548 --> 05:33:23.558 align:start position:0%
purposes and that kind of thing um
 
05:33:26.948 --> 05:33:26.958 align:start position:0%
now I'm told and I the judicial Council
 
05:33:29.030 --> 05:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
I believe believes that that it's the
 
05:33:32.190 --> 05:33:32.200 align:start position:0%
case that this doesn't happen all that
 
05:33:35.070 --> 05:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
often uh because there is a cost
 
05:33:36.670 --> 05:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
consequence to that to it when it
 
05:33:40.390 --> 05:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
happens um but the judicial Council
 
05:33:42.910 --> 05:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
believes I think that that for the rare
 
05:33:45.110 --> 05:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
case where that does where that does
 
05:33:47.948 --> 05:33:47.958 align:start position:0%
make sense to to allow the the uh
 
05:33:49.910 --> 05:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
non-public Defender to represent the
 
05:33:52.548 --> 05:33:52.558 align:start position:0%
person in a case even though the public
 
05:33:54.350 --> 05:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
defender might not have a conflict in
 
05:33:58.230 --> 05:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
that case it's worth doing um we put in
 
05:34:00.310 --> 05:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
some language in here as you'll see that
 
05:34:03.470 --> 05:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
requires a sort of an accounting by the
 
05:34:05.590 --> 05:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
court system of exactly how often does
 
05:34:07.910 --> 05:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
this happen how much money is it really
 
05:34:09.910 --> 05:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
costing if it you know if it turned out
 
05:34:12.350 --> 05:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
that it was not really pretty rare and
 
05:34:14.510 --> 05:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
that it was costing a lot of money U we
 
05:34:16.708 --> 05:34:16.718 align:start position:0%
might want to rethink that but it's but
 
05:34:18.868 --> 05:34:18.878 align:start position:0%
I think for a it does it seemed to me to
 
05:34:21.350 --> 05:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
make sense to do that at least on an
 
05:34:22.910 --> 05:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
experimental basis let's see how it
 
05:34:27.230 --> 05:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
works out it does seem like um uh if
 
05:34:29.230 --> 05:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
there are not significant cost
 
05:34:31.708 --> 05:34:31.718 align:start position:0%
implications that it that what the what
 
05:34:34.230 --> 05:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
the judicial Council Rec uh suggested
 
05:34:36.548 --> 05:34:36.558 align:start position:0%
makes sense and that's why I put it uh
 
05:34:39.990 --> 05:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
put it in there so I think
 
05:34:42.190 --> 05:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
um I think I've kind of covered I'm
 
05:34:45.590 --> 05:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions uh uh and and
 
05:34:48.270 --> 05:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
as I say I may defer to uh to the to the
 
05:34:52.230 --> 05:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:55.070 --> 05:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:34:59.990 --> 05:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you very much um because in
 
05:35:02.510 --> 05:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have what I think is
 
05:35:06.150 --> 05:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
politely referred to as a unified bar
 
05:35:10.030 --> 05:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
and what I refer to is the fact that the
 
05:35:12.110 --> 05:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
bar association is a wholly own
 
05:35:15.628 --> 05:35:15.638 align:start position:0%
subsidiary of the Supreme Court um and
 
05:35:18.510 --> 05:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
that I was under the impression that in
 
05:35:23.670 --> 05:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
order to practice law and be called a
 
05:35:27.430 --> 05:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
lawyer in New Hampshire you had to be a
 
05:35:31.150 --> 05:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
member of the bar so the first example
 
05:35:33.470 --> 05:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
that you gave where there might be
 
05:35:36.750 --> 05:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
someone who is
 
05:35:40.390 --> 05:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
not licensed as an attorney in New
 
05:35:44.190 --> 05:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but has great skills does that
 
05:35:47.070 --> 05:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
person have the right to be referred to
 
05:35:50.510 --> 05:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
as a lawyer rather than as a citizen in
 
05:35:50.520 --> 05:35:51.948 align:start position:0%
as a lawyer rather than as a citizen in
the

05:35:51.948 --> 05:35:51.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:35:55.270 --> 05:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire my I think my answer would be
 
05:35:56.590 --> 05:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
the person does have a right to be
 
05:35:58.470 --> 05:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
referred to as a lawyer although they
 
05:36:00.350 --> 05:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
are not allowed if they're not a member
 
05:36:01.590 --> 05:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
of the bar they're not allowed to
 
05:36:03.910 --> 05:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
practice law in New Hampshire but I I
 
05:36:05.990 --> 05:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
don't I I would think that being a
 
05:36:07.548 --> 05:36:07.558 align:start position:0%
member for example of the judicial
 
05:36:10.030 --> 05:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
counil would not constitute practicing
 
05:36:13.628 --> 05:36:13.638 align:start position:0%
law that would be my you know if I could
 
05:36:16.868 --> 05:36:16.878 align:start position:0%
except that they would be
 
05:36:20.910 --> 05:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
appointed I think and tell me I'm wrong
 
05:36:22.070 --> 05:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
as a
 
05:36:25.670 --> 05:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
lawyer that's kind of what it
 
05:36:30.230 --> 05:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
says um lawyers of wide experience at
 
05:36:32.750 --> 05:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
least two of whom are members of the New
 
05:36:36.628 --> 05:36:36.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire bar which would mean that the
 
05:36:40.190 --> 05:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
other one is also a lawyer of wide
 
05:36:42.910 --> 05:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
experience and that's why he's he or she
 
05:36:45.390 --> 05:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
is being appointed right but I guess I
 
05:36:47.110 --> 05:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
would say I don't think that that would
 
05:36:51.030 --> 05:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
I mean we you know there are there are
 
05:36:53.350 --> 05:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
various circumstances in which people
 
05:36:57.390 --> 05:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
that are not um uh new are not members
 
05:37:00.868 --> 05:37:00.878 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire bar uh are are even
 
05:37:03.510 --> 05:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
permitted to pra to actually appear in a
 
05:37:05.750 --> 05:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
case that you know they appear prohack
 
05:37:08.190 --> 05:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
what's called prohack vichi from another
 
05:37:11.190 --> 05:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
from another state um so there are those
 
05:37:13.310 --> 05:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
circumstances but I guess what I would
 
05:37:17.390 --> 05:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
say here is that it's because the person
 
05:37:18.628 --> 05:37:18.638 align:start position:0%
by being a member of the judicial
 
05:37:20.990 --> 05:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
Council would not be practicing law that
 
05:37:22.948 --> 05:37:22.958 align:start position:0%
would not be that would not be a
 
05:37:24.868 --> 05:37:24.878 align:start position:0%
violation of you know they they would be
 
05:37:26.430 --> 05:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
not they would not be engaging in the
 
05:37:28.708 --> 05:37:28.718 align:start position:0%
unauthorized practice of law thank you
 
05:37:31.230 --> 05:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
very much
 
05:37:33.868 --> 05:37:33.878 align:start position:0%
representative tur thank you thanks for
 
05:37:37.270 --> 05:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
taking the question um my questions on
 
05:37:40.628 --> 05:37:40.638 align:start position:0%
this bill mostly pertain to um section
 
05:37:44.350 --> 05:37:44.360 align:start position:0%
two I guess it is which starts on line
 
05:37:46.948 --> 05:37:46.958 align:start position:0%
26 um and before I asked those specific
 
05:37:48.510 --> 05:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
ones I'm not sure I heard you address
 
05:37:50.708 --> 05:37:50.718 align:start position:0%
that section when you were presenting so
 
05:37:52.948 --> 05:37:52.958 align:start position:0%
I thought maybe I I'll first hear what
 
05:37:55.030 --> 05:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
the the thinking behind yes no I'm sorry
 
05:37:59.750 --> 05:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
you're right um my understanding here is
 
05:38:04.230 --> 05:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:07.390 --> 05:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
was somewhere along the way before this
 
05:38:11.270 --> 05:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
there was some change in law that
 
05:38:14.350 --> 05:38:14.360 align:start position:0%
inadvertently removed
 
05:38:17.590 --> 05:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
the uh fees for
 
05:38:20.628 --> 05:38:20.638 align:start position:0%
Witnesses um and that this is basically
 
05:38:26.230 --> 05:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
intended to put it back um again I um
 
05:38:28.990 --> 05:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to defer to the uh people who
 
05:38:31.708 --> 05:38:31.718 align:start position:0%
actually are are responsible for paying
 
05:38:34.390 --> 05:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
these kind of things um who who may be
 
05:38:36.270 --> 05:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
able to give more information on this
 
05:38:37.830 --> 05:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
but that's my that's my understanding is
 
05:38:39.590 --> 05:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
that we were just there was a there was
 
05:38:41.990 --> 05:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
a change an inadvertent change that
 
05:38:44.390 --> 05:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
eliminated this requirement and that we
 
05:38:46.708 --> 05:38:46.718 align:start position:0%
were just putting this back okay can I
 
05:38:47.990 --> 05:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
can I ask
 
05:38:51.310 --> 05:38:51.320 align:start position:0%
follow um so uh and again maybe it's for
 
05:38:53.548 --> 05:38:53.558 align:start position:0%
someone else to answer my two specific
 
05:38:55.430 --> 05:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
questions I'll start with one which is I
 
05:38:59.110 --> 05:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
noticed it says 17 cents per mile when
 
05:39:00.948 --> 05:39:00.958 align:start position:0%
um I wasn't sure how that was
 
05:39:02.868 --> 05:39:02.878 align:start position:0%
established given the fact that that we
 
05:39:06.830 --> 05:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
get the the grandio fee of 65.5 cents
 
05:39:11.030 --> 05:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
per mile for for our travel that again
 
05:39:14.468 --> 05:39:14.478 align:start position:0%
what what I do remember this that it
 
05:39:17.350 --> 05:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
was you know even going back years it
 
05:39:22.548 --> 05:39:22.558 align:start position:0%
was always the case that uh uh Witnesses
 
05:39:24.510 --> 05:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
and I think maybe it's even
 
05:39:28.190 --> 05:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
jurors um are the the the rate at which
 
05:39:30.430 --> 05:39:30.440 align:start position:0%
they're compensated for mileage was
 
05:39:33.390 --> 05:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
significantly below the IRS rate I think
 
05:39:35.868 --> 05:39:35.878 align:start position:0%
that had that had sort of historically
 
05:39:37.628 --> 05:39:37.638 align:start position:0%
been the case and
 
05:39:41.310 --> 05:39:41.320 align:start position:0%
so my my in my understanding is that
 
05:39:43.430 --> 05:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
that you know that's why this number was
 
05:39:47.070 --> 05:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
put in it um because that was sort of
 
05:39:49.390 --> 05:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
consistent with what had been the case
 
05:39:50.468 --> 05:39:50.478 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:39:53.510 --> 05:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
past okay yeah it just felt a little in
 
05:39:56.070 --> 05:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
you're right mean congruent for us to to
 
05:39:58.190 --> 05:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
have a much lower rate in the
 
05:40:00.030 --> 05:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
05:40:02.070 --> 05:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
can I ask one more followup follow up
 
05:40:04.468 --> 05:40:04.478 align:start position:0%
yes um also in that section on line one
 
05:40:08.350 --> 05:40:08.360 align:start position:0%
of page two um it's it says where the
 
05:40:10.990 --> 05:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
witness is required to leave the city or
 
05:40:13.548 --> 05:40:13.558 align:start position:0%
town or city in which the witness
 
05:40:16.750 --> 05:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
resides um I guess representing a town
 
05:40:19.430 --> 05:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
that has a major Court in the in the
 
05:40:21.788 --> 05:40:21.798 align:start position:0%
state in Brentwood
 
05:40:25.070 --> 05:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering whether that Clause is
 
05:40:28.750 --> 05:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
really why that Clause is necessary um
 
05:40:31.150 --> 05:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
because our our court is you know at
 
05:40:32.390 --> 05:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
least at the moment right on the border
 
05:40:34.708 --> 05:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
of the next town There's a lot you know
 
05:40:36.430 --> 05:40:36.440 align:start position:0%
it's not a great amount of travel that
 
05:40:38.230 --> 05:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
anyone would be involved in from our
 
05:40:40.548 --> 05:40:40.558 align:start position:0%
different towns but I'm wondering why it
 
05:40:41.990 --> 05:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
specifically means you have to leave
 
05:40:44.030 --> 05:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
your town or if there's a scenario that
 
05:40:46.510 --> 05:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
that has to be there to cover yeah I
 
05:40:48.788 --> 05:40:48.798 align:start position:0%
again I think that this is the way it's
 
05:40:52.150 --> 05:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
it's worded this way because of of sort
 
05:40:55.030 --> 05:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
of historically in other words this this
 
05:40:57.110 --> 05:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
whole section was
 
05:40:59.990 --> 05:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
basically reinserting
 
05:41:02.350 --> 05:41:02.360 align:start position:0%
something that had been as I understand
 
05:41:05.230 --> 05:41:05.240 align:start position:0%
inadvertently taken out of Law and uh
 
05:41:07.590 --> 05:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
with with as as a result of some other
 
05:41:09.868 --> 05:41:09.878 align:start position:0%
change to the law and this was kind of
 
05:41:14.948 --> 05:41:14.958 align:start position:0%
putting it back in so um you know I if
 
05:41:18.430 --> 05:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
we were writing on a clean slate um you
 
05:41:19.830 --> 05:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
know the various things that you've
 
05:41:21.948 --> 05:41:21.958 align:start position:0%
raised I think are valid very valid
 
05:41:23.070 --> 05:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
points that if we were writing on a
 
05:41:24.788 --> 05:41:24.798 align:start position:0%
clean slate we might want to say well
 
05:41:27.030 --> 05:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
wait a minute why are we paying less
 
05:41:28.910 --> 05:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
mileage or why do you have to go out of
 
05:41:32.030 --> 05:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
your town town when you know um but I
 
05:41:32.040 --> 05:41:33.270 align:start position:0%
your town town when you know um but I
think

05:41:33.270 --> 05:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:41:36.628 --> 05:41:36.638 align:start position:0%
this the the impetus for this was to
 
05:41:40.110 --> 05:41:40.120 align:start position:0%
make the correction to uh you know to
 
05:41:42.750 --> 05:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
reinstate in the law what had been and
 
05:41:45.830 --> 05:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
what was thought to be necessary um
 
05:41:48.310 --> 05:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
without sort of would make while making
 
05:41:50.350 --> 05:41:50.360 align:start position:0%
the the least amount of
 
05:41:54.708 --> 05:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
change uh uh that you know that that was
 
05:41:55.750 --> 05:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
thought to be
 
05:41:58.670 --> 05:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
necessary if if you know I but I I guess
 
05:42:00.948 --> 05:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
I would say I
 
05:42:03.788 --> 05:42:03.798 align:start position:0%
don't if if we wanted to make a greater
 
05:42:07.350 --> 05:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
change um I certainly would be open to
 
05:42:10.390 --> 05:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
to doing that so so to correct or to
 
05:42:12.670 --> 05:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
adjust those two parameters possibly
 
05:42:14.390 --> 05:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
sure okay sure that might make that
 
05:42:16.590 --> 05:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
might very well make sense
 
05:42:19.390 --> 05:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
great representative D Lorenzo uh thank
 
05:42:21.230 --> 05:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:42:21.240 --> 05:42:22.830 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
question

05:42:22.830 --> 05:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:42:27.190 --> 05:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair um I'm looking at the
 
05:42:29.990 --> 05:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
members of the judicial Council IL
 
05:42:33.670 --> 05:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
please say that um at least two do not
 
05:42:35.030 --> 05:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
have to be members of the New Hampshire
 
05:42:35.040 --> 05:42:36.750 align:start position:0%
have to be members of the New Hampshire
Bar

05:42:36.750 --> 05:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
Bar
 
05:42:39.548 --> 05:42:39.558 align:start position:0%
Association uh no I think it I think no
 
05:42:44.350 --> 05:42:44.360 align:start position:0%
two uh five there uh says three of whom
 
05:42:46.468 --> 05:42:46.478 align:start position:0%
shall be lawyers of wi experience and
 
05:42:48.910 --> 05:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
two of whom so two of the three lawyers
 
05:42:50.230 --> 05:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
have to be members of the New Hampshire
 
05:42:52.628 --> 05:42:52.638 align:start position:0%
Bar Association one would be allowed not
 
05:42:56.628 --> 05:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
to be um under that paragraph and then
 
05:42:59.990 --> 05:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh the same uh under under uh Roman
 
05:43:03.910 --> 05:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
numeral 9 which are the appointees of
 
05:43:06.070 --> 05:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
 
05:43:09.030 --> 05:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
again three would be lawyers two of
 
05:43:10.510 --> 05:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
those three would have to be members of
 
05:43:14.110 --> 05:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire bar so may I follow up
 
05:43:16.670 --> 05:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
so for the person um who is not a member
 
05:43:18.750 --> 05:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire bar would they be
 
05:43:22.150 --> 05:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
required to be a member of another bar
 
05:43:24.910 --> 05:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
association maybe ABA or well interest
 
05:43:27.390 --> 05:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
no that's that's a that's a good point
 
05:43:29.830 --> 05:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh it doesn't specifically say this and
 
05:43:32.868 --> 05:43:32.878 align:start position:0%
here um we could change it to say that
 
05:43:34.548 --> 05:43:34.558 align:start position:0%
they should be a member of you know some
 
05:43:36.510 --> 05:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
other bar other otherwise it would
 
05:43:38.590 --> 05:43:38.600 align:start position:0%
basically otherwise it would basically
 
05:43:41.070 --> 05:43:41.080 align:start position:0%
mean you know a law school graduate who
 
05:43:42.788 --> 05:43:42.798 align:start position:0%
may never have become a member of any
 
05:43:46.910 --> 05:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
bar and I'm uh you could have that too
 
05:43:49.150 --> 05:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
but I think it might it might make sense
 
05:43:51.910 --> 05:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
to say to change that language to say a
 
05:43:52.910 --> 05:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
member of
 
05:43:56.070 --> 05:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
SAR okay may I follow up Okay the reason
 
05:43:59.030 --> 05:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
that I'm asking is that um your um
 
05:44:00.510 --> 05:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
members that would be members of the New
 
05:44:02.548 --> 05:44:02.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Bar Association would need to
 
05:44:04.590 --> 05:44:04.600 align:start position:0%
conform to the rules of professional
 
05:44:08.230 --> 05:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
conduct um as lawyers but if the person
 
05:44:10.868 --> 05:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
is not a member of a bar association
 
05:44:13.070 --> 05:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement of them to follow
 
05:44:15.350 --> 05:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
a professional contact that's an
 
05:44:16.750 --> 05:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
excellent point that's a good point and
 
05:44:19.510 --> 05:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
I mean that might be a reason to say for
 
05:44:22.390 --> 05:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
example to change to say
 
05:44:25.510 --> 05:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
um uh three of whom shall be lawyers
 
05:44:28.310 --> 05:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
admitted to the bar of some state in the
 
05:44:31.430 --> 05:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
Union two of whom shall be members of
 
05:44:32.390 --> 05:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire by that's that's an
 
05:44:34.628 --> 05:44:34.638 align:start position:0%
excellent point very very good point
 
05:44:38.110 --> 05:44:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:42.150 --> 05:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
CH representative BOS thank you um thank
 
05:44:44.430 --> 05:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question the house
 
05:44:47.750 --> 05:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
just passed a package of bail reforms
 
05:44:51.590 --> 05:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering whether on page two
 
05:44:55.910 --> 05:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
um Line 6 through
 
05:44:58.590 --> 05:44:58.600 align:start position:0%
17 whether this is consistent with the
 
05:45:01.788 --> 05:45:01.798 align:start position:0%
pack that the house just passed in terms
 
05:45:06.310 --> 05:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:08.910 --> 05:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
reform this is General enough that I
 
05:45:11.830 --> 05:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
think it is
 
05:45:15.548 --> 05:45:15.558 align:start position:0%
um but I I I have you know I have not
 
05:45:17.270 --> 05:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
honestly looked at this
 
05:45:20.190 --> 05:45:20.200 align:start position:0%
and to be to be completely candid out
 
05:45:23.910 --> 05:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
the um the whole baale reform thing went
 
05:45:26.670 --> 05:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
through so many different uh changes I'm
 
05:45:27.868 --> 05:45:27.878 align:start position:0%
just not
 
05:45:27.878 --> 05:45:30.110 align:start position:0%
just not
sure

05:45:30.110 --> 05:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:45:32.430 --> 05:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
um that wasn't meant in any way as a
 
05:45:34.270 --> 05:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
gotcha question no no no no I understand
 
05:45:37.548 --> 05:45:37.558 align:start position:0%
I completely understand I I I looked at
 
05:45:39.510 --> 05:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
this last night and I didn't have the
 
05:45:41.150 --> 05:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
time either to go back and forth and
 
05:45:43.030 --> 05:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
look between the two but I think we
 
05:45:45.030 --> 05:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
should just make sure as a committee
 
05:45:46.270 --> 05:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
that this is
 
05:45:50.150 --> 05:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
consistent sure no that's a good good
 
05:45:52.708 --> 05:45:52.718 align:start position:0%
point any other
 
05:45:55.190 --> 05:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
05:45:55.200 --> 05:45:57.788 align:start position:0%

05:46:42.190 --> 05:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
agency so for those of you who have not
 
05:46:46.190 --> 05:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
met him um here he
 
05:46:46.200 --> 05:46:48.070 align:start position:0%
met him um here he
is

05:46:48.070 --> 05:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:46:51.270 --> 05:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
um I think most of the people here
 
05:46:53.230 --> 05:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
understand sort of the way in which the
 
05:46:55.788 --> 05:46:55.798 align:start position:0%
judicial Council functions but just by
 
05:46:58.350 --> 05:46:58.360 align:start position:0%
way of background the judicial council
 
05:47:01.190 --> 05:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
is a executive branch agency that is
 
05:47:04.430 --> 05:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
responsible for uh the delivery of legal
 
05:47:07.110 --> 05:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
services in indent cases the great
 
05:47:08.948 --> 05:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
majority of those cases being criminal
 
05:47:12.990 --> 05:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
cases it is overseen and directed by uh
 
05:47:15.030 --> 05:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
essentially a board of directors the
 
05:47:17.708 --> 05:47:17.718 align:start position:0%
board of directors has the same name
 
05:47:20.788 --> 05:47:20.798 align:start position:0%
judicial counsel and some of the changes
 
05:47:23.230 --> 05:47:23.240 align:start position:0%
that are before you in the statute uh in
 
05:47:25.590 --> 05:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
the bill today uh pertain to that
 
05:47:29.548 --> 05:47:29.558 align:start position:0%
membership of the board of directors um
 
05:47:33.510 --> 05:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
I can uh certainly address uh these
 
05:47:36.110 --> 05:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
lines uh similar to the way
 
05:47:37.708 --> 05:47:37.718 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn did if you would
 
05:47:39.990 --> 05:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
like but I'm also happy to to take
 
05:47:43.070 --> 05:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
questions from uh the chair or the
 
05:47:51.270 --> 05:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:53.548 --> 05:47:53.558 align:start position:0%
committee that as a sponsor of the bill
 
05:47:56.310 --> 05:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
I uh I uh testified and I'm not supposed
 
05:47:58.948 --> 05:47:58.958 align:start position:0%
to ask questions so maybe I won't ask a
 
05:48:01.270 --> 05:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
question but let me say this if there's
 
05:48:05.230 --> 05:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
anything that I said that was inaccurate
 
05:48:07.150 --> 05:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of the justification for some
 
05:48:09.910 --> 05:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
of these things could you please correct
 
05:48:09.920 --> 05:48:10.708 align:start position:0%
of these things could you please correct
my

05:48:10.708 --> 05:48:10.718 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:48:12.910 --> 05:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
inaccuracies um I don't think there was
 
05:48:15.390 --> 05:48:15.400 align:start position:0%
anything that was inac inaccurate um but
 
05:48:16.910 --> 05:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
maybe just to supplement some
 
05:48:19.548 --> 05:48:19.558 align:start position:0%
information uh there was some questions
 
05:48:23.590 --> 05:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
about uh for example the payment of fees
 
05:48:26.390 --> 05:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
to Witnesses uh and I think those are
 
05:48:29.990 --> 05:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
very good questions uh just so you know
 
05:48:32.510 --> 05:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh the language that appears before you
 
05:48:34.708 --> 05:48:34.718 align:start position:0%
is really it's not originally crafted
 
05:48:36.910 --> 05:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
language in any way it was lifted from
 
05:48:42.310 --> 05:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
the prior statute um and the reason for
 
05:48:46.150 --> 05:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
the $12 a day or half day fee is merely
 
05:48:48.190 --> 05:48:48.200 align:start position:0%
because that's what it used to be and
 
05:48:51.430 --> 05:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
has been uh at the time uh I was
 
05:48:55.190 --> 05:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
considering um you know this statute and
 
05:48:57.708 --> 05:48:57.718 align:start position:0%
uh asking representative Lynn to
 
05:49:00.628 --> 05:49:00.638 align:start position:0%
consider some legis ation uh I did look
 
05:49:02.628 --> 05:49:02.638 align:start position:0%
and Survey other states and what they
 
05:49:05.670 --> 05:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
pay there's a huge range of what states
 
05:49:08.670 --> 05:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
pay Witnesses for witness fees and for
 
05:49:11.830 --> 05:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
travel I I don't uh pretend to
 
05:49:14.110 --> 05:49:14.120 align:start position:0%
understand any uh that there's any
 
05:49:17.510 --> 05:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
singular logic that applies there and so
 
05:49:19.590 --> 05:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
I think the simplest thing really was to
 
05:49:22.628 --> 05:49:22.638 align:start position:0%
look to the prior uh statute that was
 
05:49:25.708 --> 05:49:25.718 align:start position:0%
repealed and to just use that same
 
05:49:28.670 --> 05:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
language as a practical matter because
 
05:49:31.190 --> 05:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
there is no current statute that applies
 
05:49:33.270 --> 05:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
to witness fees when the judicial
 
05:49:36.310 --> 05:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
Council receives a request for payment
 
05:49:39.468 --> 05:49:39.478 align:start position:0%
now for witness fees and
 
05:49:42.708 --> 05:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
mileage the judicial council is paying
 
05:49:45.430 --> 05:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
this amount merely because that's the
 
05:49:47.190 --> 05:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
last amount that we were authorized to
 
05:49:50.628 --> 05:49:50.638 align:start position:0%
pay so uh certainly if the committee
 
05:49:52.270 --> 05:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
wants to make changes to those amounts
 
05:49:54.670 --> 05:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the judicial Council would be
 
05:49:57.350 --> 05:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
happy to follow those changes but that's
 
05:50:00.590 --> 05:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
the reasoning by behind that uh with
 
05:50:05.468 --> 05:50:05.478 align:start position:0%
respect to uh the language about the
 
05:50:07.910 --> 05:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
replacement of three lawyers with two
 
05:50:12.150 --> 05:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
lawyers admitted in New Hampshire and um
 
05:50:15.868 --> 05:50:15.878 align:start position:0%
sort of a a gap as to that third person
 
05:50:18.070 --> 05:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh the reason uh as representative Lynn
 
05:50:19.628 --> 05:50:19.638 align:start position:0%
was saying is there was someone we
 
05:50:21.510 --> 05:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
believed would really be good to serve
 
05:50:23.868 --> 05:50:23.878 align:start position:0%
on the council uh a person who was an
 
05:50:26.590 --> 05:50:26.600 align:start position:0%
admitted lawyer in the state of Michigan
 
05:50:29.548 --> 05:50:29.558 align:start position:0%
I believe uh just not admitted in New
 
05:50:31.868 --> 05:50:31.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because of the nature of that
 
05:50:34.510 --> 05:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
person's work and it got us to thinking
 
05:50:38.270 --> 05:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
that that person could not be um placed
 
05:50:40.868 --> 05:50:40.878 align:start position:0%
or nominated to to be serving on the
 
05:50:42.670 --> 05:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
judicial Council because they're not a
 
05:50:44.948 --> 05:50:44.958 align:start position:0%
lawyer in New Hampshire but also they
 
05:50:46.750 --> 05:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't be on the judicial Council
 
05:50:49.708 --> 05:50:49.718 align:start position:0%
because they were not a non-lawyer so be
 
05:50:51.750 --> 05:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
by virtue of the fact that this person
 
05:50:54.190 --> 05:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
was a lawyer in another state they
 
05:50:57.548 --> 05:50:57.558 align:start position:0%
couldn't serve in either capacity and so
 
05:50:59.788 --> 05:50:59.798 align:start position:0%
the language Chang here is merely to
 
05:51:02.910 --> 05:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
create an opportunity for experienced
 
05:51:04.990 --> 05:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
invaluable lawyers like that that may
 
05:51:07.708 --> 05:51:07.718 align:start position:0%
not practice in New Hampshire or maybe
 
05:51:10.150 --> 05:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
who at one point practiced in New
 
05:51:11.830 --> 05:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but are now
 
05:51:15.270 --> 05:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
retired or say a college professor a
 
05:51:17.190 --> 05:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
university of uh the law school
 
05:51:20.390 --> 05:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
Professor who for reasons that they
 
05:51:22.510 --> 05:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
they're not actively practicing are not
 
05:51:24.590 --> 05:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
admitted to the bar that any one of
 
05:51:27.510 --> 05:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
those types of people could serve on the
 
05:51:30.110 --> 05:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
judicial Council because there's uh some
 
05:51:34.150 --> 05:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
real value and experience maybe to their
 
05:51:37.788 --> 05:51:37.798 align:start position:0%
background um the one other category
 
05:51:40.510 --> 05:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
that maybe is is worth me addressing
 
05:51:44.628 --> 05:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
just briefly is the uh assignment of
 
05:51:48.468 --> 05:51:48.478 align:start position:0%
council request to the change here uh as
 
05:51:50.708 --> 05:51:50.718 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn was saying we don't
 
05:51:53.150 --> 05:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
believe that the circumstance arises
 
05:51:57.190 --> 05:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
very often where uh we would not follow
 
05:51:58.948 --> 05:51:58.958 align:start position:0%
the traditional
 
05:52:02.510 --> 05:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh appointment of first the public
 
05:52:04.910 --> 05:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
defender second contract Council and
 
05:52:08.468 --> 05:52:08.478 align:start position:0%
third an assigned Council lawyer um but
 
05:52:10.548 --> 05:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
there are rare circumstances where it
 
05:52:12.110 --> 05:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
might be in the interest of Justice in
 
05:52:15.030 --> 05:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
the continuity of councel to be able to
 
05:52:17.788 --> 05:52:17.798 align:start position:0%
go directly to the second or third tier
 
05:52:19.750 --> 05:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
of that representation the public
 
05:52:23.270 --> 05:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
defender in New Hampshire represents 85%
 
05:52:25.548 --> 05:52:25.558 align:start position:0%
of the criminal defendants uh who
 
05:52:27.830 --> 05:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
qualify for courta appointed Council but
 
05:52:30.230 --> 05:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
there are occasions where other council
 
05:52:34.510 --> 05:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
is appointed um sometimes um as
 
05:52:36.070 --> 05:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn was saying people
 
05:52:39.430 --> 05:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
get into further complications and F
 
05:52:41.390 --> 05:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
receive further charges and it would
 
05:52:44.190 --> 05:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
make sense to just have one lawyer who
 
05:52:46.548 --> 05:52:46.558 align:start position:0%
can negotiate maybe all of their cases
 
05:52:49.070 --> 05:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
or represent that client as a rapport
 
05:52:51.510 --> 05:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
with that client to continue to do so
 
05:52:53.468 --> 05:52:53.478 align:start position:0%
without starting the whole process over
 
05:52:55.548 --> 05:52:55.558 align:start position:0%
so uh we don't believe that those will
 
05:52:57.350 --> 05:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
be frequent circumstances we don't
 
05:53:00.510 --> 05:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
believe it'll result in any major cost
 
05:53:03.788 --> 05:53:03.798 align:start position:0%
um but uh it would be nice to have the
 
05:53:06.510 --> 05:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to assign Council in a way
 
05:53:09.030 --> 05:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
that not only best serves the defendant
 
05:53:11.910 --> 05:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
but maybe best serves uh the judicial
 
05:53:14.788 --> 05:53:14.798 align:start position:0%
process the Justice process
 
05:53:23.150 --> 05:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:27.468 --> 05:53:27.478 align:start position:0%
Smith hope we don't scare you off um I
 
05:53:30.750 --> 05:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
noticed that this no fiscal note
 
05:53:36.468 --> 05:53:36.478 align:start position:0%
and if we were to follow the line that
 
05:53:40.390 --> 05:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
my colleague representative TR raised as
 
05:53:43.390 --> 05:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
to do we really want to give 17 cents a
 
05:53:46.548 --> 05:53:46.558 align:start position:0%
mile I mean is that
 
05:53:46.558 --> 05:53:49.708 align:start position:0%
mile I mean is that
fair

05:53:49.708 --> 05:53:49.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:56.070 --> 05:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
um what would happen if we were to bring
 
05:53:59.230 --> 05:53:59.240 align:start position:0%
those figures up to
 
05:54:02.548 --> 05:54:02.558 align:start position:0%
Uh current usage maybe for example
 
05:54:04.670 --> 05:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
saying current you you know the current
 
05:54:10.830 --> 05:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
rate for reimbursement I know that the
 
05:54:16.270 --> 05:54:16.280 align:start position:0%
judicial um Council can go before fiscal
 
05:54:19.430 --> 05:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
to get more money I know that Nina
 
05:54:22.270 --> 05:54:22.280 align:start position:0%
Gardner did that with great regularity
 
05:54:26.430 --> 05:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
but with great difficulty um can you
 
05:54:29.430 --> 05:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
give us an idea of what would happen if
 
05:54:32.270 --> 05:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
we changed some of those numbers would
 
05:54:34.830 --> 05:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
they be so
 
05:54:37.190 --> 05:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
significant that it might create
 
05:54:38.868 --> 05:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
problems for
 
05:54:43.070 --> 05:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
you um so I can tell you in the 11
 
05:54:45.070 --> 05:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
months that I was at the judicial
 
05:54:49.350 --> 05:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:52.910 --> 05:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
approved I would say less than 30 um
 
05:54:56.350 --> 05:54:56.360 align:start position:0%
witness fees requests the witness fees
 
05:54:59.230 --> 05:54:59.240 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here in this Bill
 
05:55:02.350 --> 05:55:02.360 align:start position:0%
are only those Witnesses who are
 
05:55:05.030 --> 05:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
subpoena by the defense in Indigent
 
05:55:07.910 --> 05:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
defense cases so uh when the prosecution
 
05:55:10.230 --> 05:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
subpoena is a witness it comes from
 
05:55:13.708 --> 05:55:13.718 align:start position:0%
their pool of funds so I think an answer
 
05:55:17.030 --> 05:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
to your question the change or the
 
05:55:21.948 --> 05:55:21.958 align:start position:0%
additional cost uh would likely be very
 
05:55:25.830 --> 05:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
minimal uh even if you were to change
 
05:55:29.070 --> 05:55:29.080 align:start position:0%
the mileage rate from 17 cents per mile
 
05:55:32.510 --> 05:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
to you know the federal rate I I really
 
05:55:35.948 --> 05:55:35.958 align:start position:0%
think that the change would be um
 
05:55:37.948 --> 05:55:37.958 align:start position:0%
negligible not negligible but it would
 
05:55:40.868 --> 05:55:40.878 align:start position:0%
be not anything significant that would
 
05:55:42.830 --> 05:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
require returning to the legislature and
 
05:55:46.030 --> 05:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
asking for additional funds so acting in
 
05:55:49.270 --> 05:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
in good faith and trying to be fair we
 
05:55:51.548 --> 05:55:51.558 align:start position:0%
would not be creating an untenable
 
05:55:54.910 --> 05:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
position for you if we were to do so if
 
05:55:58.468 --> 05:55:58.478 align:start position:0%
we were to do so I don't think so at all
 
05:56:01.030 --> 05:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
05:56:03.350 --> 05:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
much yes representative
 
05:56:06.430 --> 05:56:06.440 align:start position:0%
ch um thank you um for taking the
 
05:56:09.628 --> 05:56:09.638 align:start position:0%
question I maybe ask that same question
 
05:56:12.350 --> 05:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
that representative Smith asked in in in
 
05:56:15.270 --> 05:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
in the inverse um my understanding from
 
05:56:18.110 --> 05:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
what you said a minute ago is that your
 
05:56:20.990 --> 05:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
judicial council is still sort of able
 
05:56:23.190 --> 05:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
to take these requests in and still able
 
05:56:25.868 --> 05:56:25.878 align:start position:0%
to to make payments to to folks that
 
05:56:28.350 --> 05:56:28.360 align:start position:0%
make those requests is that is that but
 
05:56:31.390 --> 05:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
um is that what you said I I guess what
 
05:56:33.070 --> 05:56:33.080 align:start position:0%
I'm what I'm wondering and maybe it'll
 
05:56:35.510 --> 05:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
help is given that this is sort of a
 
05:56:37.910 --> 05:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
laundry list Bill and this one sort of
 
05:56:39.750 --> 05:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
might require some tinkering in terms of
 
05:56:42.948 --> 05:56:42.958 align:start position:0%
what the right numbers would be
 
05:56:45.270 --> 05:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
um is is there anything that's
 
05:56:47.270 --> 05:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
preventing the operations that this is
 
05:56:50.030 --> 05:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
trying to do by not doing by not having
 
05:56:52.750 --> 05:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
this clause and sort of punting it to a
 
05:56:55.830 --> 05:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
future perhaps legis legislative action
 
05:56:57.990 --> 05:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
to to take care of that um thank thank
 
05:57:00.390 --> 05:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
you for that question um there is a
 
05:57:02.708 --> 05:57:02.718 align:start position:0%
statute and I I don't have it in front
 
05:57:06.628 --> 05:57:06.638 align:start position:0%
of me that um requires that the
 
05:57:09.390 --> 05:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
witnesses be paid but there is currently
 
05:57:11.990 --> 05:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
no statute that specifies what they're
 
05:57:15.990 --> 05:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
to be paid or be compensated at so I
 
05:57:18.990 --> 05:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
don't think it would prevent the
 
05:57:21.510 --> 05:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
functioning uh of the judicial Council
 
05:57:23.590 --> 05:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
in any different way than it is now
 
05:57:25.750 --> 05:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
which is we're just paying at the old
 
05:57:27.990 --> 05:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
rate but there's really no statutory the
 
05:57:31.270 --> 05:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
authority to do that um and so you know
 
05:57:33.990 --> 05:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
if you were to remove that section and
 
05:57:37.230 --> 05:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
do a separate bill I I don't I don't
 
05:57:39.070 --> 05:57:39.080 align:start position:0%
think it's easy for me to say I don't
 
05:57:41.750 --> 05:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
think it will affect this man's job but
 
05:57:45.868 --> 05:57:45.878 align:start position:0%
um uh but I you know I think giving some
 
05:57:47.948 --> 05:57:47.958 align:start position:0%
additional thought to that is is
 
05:57:49.830 --> 05:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
probably not a bad
 
05:57:51.788 --> 05:57:51.798 align:start position:0%
idea other
 
05:57:56.708 --> 05:57:56.718 align:start position:0%
questions Mr Bucky oh representative k
 
05:57:59.070 --> 05:57:59.080 align:start position:0%
please thank thank you Mr chairman
 
05:58:00.708 --> 05:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
thankk you for taking my question I was
 
05:58:02.190 --> 05:58:02.200 align:start position:0%
trying to Quick quickly look it up and I
 
05:58:03.628 --> 05:58:03.638 align:start position:0%
couldn't find it and I will look more if
 
05:58:04.670 --> 05:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
you don't know the answer to the
 
05:58:06.590 --> 05:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
question but you mentioned that
 
05:58:08.990 --> 05:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
currently prosecutors would pay out of
 
05:58:12.788 --> 05:58:12.798 align:start position:0%
their budget for a witness that was
 
05:58:14.230 --> 05:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
their witness that
 
05:58:17.350 --> 05:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't as part of the Indigent defense
 
05:58:20.310 --> 05:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
um do you know if their witness rate is
 
05:58:22.270 --> 05:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
currently statutorily set because I just
 
05:58:24.110 --> 05:58:24.120 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we wouldn't be if
 
05:58:25.830 --> 05:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
we changed this to be the current
 
05:58:28.270 --> 05:58:28.280 align:start position:0%
mileage that we wouldn't be in conflict
 
05:58:30.070 --> 05:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
with you know not that it's the same
 
05:58:31.390 --> 05:58:31.400 align:start position:0%
thing but I don't think it makes sense
 
05:58:33.990 --> 05:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
that you know a defense witness is
 
05:58:37.310 --> 05:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
getting paid more than a prosecutor's
 
05:58:39.548 --> 05:58:39.558 align:start position:0%
witness yeah um thank you for that
 
05:58:41.070 --> 05:58:41.080 align:start position:0%
question that's a it's an excellent
 
05:58:44.670 --> 05:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
question my understanding of the law is
 
05:58:48.030 --> 05:58:48.040 align:start position:0%
that it's the same statutes that apply
 
05:58:51.750 --> 05:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh to everyone that the same statute
 
05:58:54.468 --> 05:58:54.478 align:start position:0%
that authorizes payment applies to both
 
05:58:57.350 --> 05:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
prosecution and defense or in any other
 
05:58:57.360 --> 05:58:58.548 align:start position:0%
prosecution and defense or in any other
case

05:58:58.548 --> 05:58:58.558 align:start position:0%
case
 
05:59:02.110 --> 05:59:02.120 align:start position:0%
and uh nobody has a statute that
 
05:59:07.390 --> 05:59:07.400 align:start position:0%
authorizes the amount of payment so um
 
05:59:10.910 --> 05:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
the I I I think enacting uh this
 
05:59:14.430 --> 05:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
legislation would have the same impact
 
05:59:18.190 --> 05:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
on uh prosecution as it would on defense
 
05:59:20.628 --> 05:59:20.638 align:start position:0%
it would also apply I mean to other
 
05:59:24.270 --> 05:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
Indigent cases um that are not criminal
 
05:59:26.708 --> 05:59:26.718 align:start position:0%
cases but I think it would have a
 
05:59:30.910 --> 05:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:34.830 --> 05:59:34.840 align:start position:0%
impact other questions Mr Bucky uh
 
05:59:37.708 --> 05:59:37.718 align:start position:0%
welcome if there to one to I'm sure what
 
05:59:39.230 --> 05:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sure what will be one of many
 
05:59:41.030 --> 05:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
appearances before the this committee
 
05:59:43.990 --> 05:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
and others in the legislature
 
05:59:47.310 --> 05:59:47.320 align:start position:0%
um many happy that's right many happy
 
05:59:49.430 --> 05:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
appearances U is there anything you'd
 
05:59:51.590 --> 05:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
like to say we're happy to hear from you
 
05:59:53.190 --> 05:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
I don't have anything to add at this
 
05:59:54.468 --> 05:59:54.478 align:start position:0%
time I I agree with everything that's
 
05:59:57.750 --> 05:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
been said um by my predecessor so thank
 
05:59:58.868 --> 05:59:58.878 align:start position:0%
you very much for having me here and let
 
06:00:02.830 --> 06:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
me participate great thank you all right
 
06:00:08.868 --> 06:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:11.628 --> 06:00:11.638 align:start position:0%
uh and Miss krian I realized that I did
 
06:00:15.310 --> 06:00:15.320 align:start position:0%
not cover one section that um was the
 
06:00:17.150 --> 06:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
subject of an amendment we had discussed
 
06:00:19.590 --> 06:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
and I hope that you will discuss it uh
 
06:00:23.990 --> 06:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
because of my uh failure to discuss
 
06:00:26.430 --> 06:00:26.440 align:start position:0%
it well I have uh I have brought
 
06:00:29.030 --> 06:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
director Martin to do just that but I I
 
06:00:31.190 --> 06:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
think I will just briefly before speak
 
06:00:33.190 --> 06:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
about um the changes that you were
 
06:00:36.990 --> 06:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
making to 59420 a um I think when
 
06:00:38.948 --> 06:00:38.958 align:start position:0%
felonies first was rewound this was
 
06:00:40.948 --> 06:00:40.958 align:start position:0%
rewound this was simply an oversight so
 
06:00:43.990 --> 06:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
it it currently has a small passage that
 
06:00:47.310 --> 06:00:47.320 align:start position:0%
would still have uh felonies going to
 
06:00:48.708 --> 06:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court when that doesn't
 
06:00:50.590 --> 06:00:50.600 align:start position:0%
occur we currently have some
 
06:00:52.868 --> 06:00:52.878 align:start position:0%
administrative guidance that we view
 
06:00:55.628 --> 06:00:55.638 align:start position:0%
this conflict of laws as uh resolvable
 
06:00:57.030 --> 06:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
by we're going to follow the legislator
 
06:00:59.350 --> 06:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
later enactment of of the rewind but it
 
06:01:01.110 --> 06:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
is confusing when people see this in the
 
06:01:03.548 --> 06:01:03.558 align:start position:0%
statute and uh R Manos you had an
 
06:01:04.788 --> 06:01:04.798 align:start position:0%
excellent question about how it
 
06:01:06.230 --> 06:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
conflicts because the same statute is
 
06:01:09.708 --> 06:01:09.718 align:start position:0%
amended by the bail bills I this um
 
06:01:11.670 --> 06:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
phrase is not amended but I think you
 
06:01:13.670 --> 06:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
could have the problem where if one is
 
06:01:15.270 --> 06:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
printed directly before or after the
 
06:01:16.868 --> 06:01:16.878 align:start position:0%
other it's like two bills that add a
 
06:01:18.270 --> 06:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
Section 8 and then you have two section
 
06:01:21.030 --> 06:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
eights uh potentially in the law so it
 
06:01:23.350 --> 06:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
it's certainly something in the printing
 
06:01:26.270 --> 06:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh to be conscientious of um before I
 
06:01:27.510 --> 06:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
turn it over to director Martin to
 
06:01:29.030 --> 06:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
discuss uh the amendment I know you were
 
06:01:30.788 --> 06:01:30.798 align:start position:0%
considering are there any questions on
 
06:01:33.270 --> 06:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
that passage
 
06:01:39.070 --> 06:01:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:41.548 --> 06:01:41.558 align:start position:0%
Martin good afternoon everyone I am
 
06:01:43.390 --> 06:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
Diane Martin and I am the director of
 
06:01:44.910 --> 06:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
the administrative office of the courts
 
06:01:47.070 --> 06:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
it's really nice to put some faces to
 
06:01:49.350 --> 06:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
names um as I had the pleasure of
 
06:01:52.350 --> 06:01:52.360 align:start position:0%
filling in as general counsel in the end
 
06:01:54.708 --> 06:01:54.718 align:start position:0%
government Affairs coordinator earlier
 
06:01:55.830 --> 06:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
in the year when we had a bunch of
 
06:01:57.868 --> 06:01:57.878 align:start position:0%
vacancies so I did get to communicate
 
06:02:00.350 --> 06:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
with some of you um representative Lynn
 
06:02:04.430 --> 06:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
has kindly um agreed to bring an
 
06:02:07.628 --> 06:02:07.638 align:start position:0%
amendment I I believe on our behalf um
 
06:02:11.948 --> 06:02:11.958 align:start position:0%
to add to this um Bill uh the ability
 
06:02:14.788 --> 06:02:14.798 align:start position:0%
for us to transfer Appropriations
 
06:02:16.830 --> 06:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
between and among class lines and
 
06:02:19.510 --> 06:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
accounting units and it's fairly
 
06:02:21.548 --> 06:02:21.558 align:start position:0%
straightforward because it is something
 
06:02:24.750 --> 06:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
that you the legislature already did um
 
06:02:27.868 --> 06:02:27.878 align:start position:0%
as a footnote to hb2 in the past
 
06:02:30.190 --> 06:02:30.200 align:start position:0%
um and did for all executive branch
 
06:02:32.910 --> 06:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
agencies in statute and so what we're
 
06:02:35.868 --> 06:02:35.878 align:start position:0%
asking for is just to adopt in statute
 
06:02:38.430 --> 06:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
what you previously did in a footnote
 
06:02:42.948 --> 06:02:42.958 align:start position:0%
that was not included in this um bial
 
06:02:46.190 --> 06:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
hb2 and and all that it does is increase
 
06:02:50.070 --> 06:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
the language in RSA 9 col
 
06:02:52.830 --> 06:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
16d to
 
06:02:55.510 --> 06:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
$100,000 to make it consistent both with
 
06:02:57.948 --> 06:02:57.958 align:start position:0%
executive branch agency authoriz ation
 
06:03:00.628 --> 06:03:00.638 align:start position:0%
and also the judicial branch prior
 
06:03:02.910 --> 06:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
authorization and and right now it's the
 
06:03:06.110 --> 06:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
way the statute stands it's 75,000 want
 
06:03:08.190 --> 06:03:08.200 align:start position:0%
to increase it to 100 yes and I was not
 
06:03:10.510 --> 06:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
here when the change happened across the
 
06:03:12.468 --> 06:03:12.478 align:start position:0%
um State and so I don't know why the
 
06:03:15.110 --> 06:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
judicial branch was overlooked but it
 
06:03:17.670 --> 06:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
was added as a footnote to address that
 
06:03:21.708 --> 06:03:21.718 align:start position:0%
and and it got it fell out this
 
06:03:26.270 --> 06:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
year questions uh for M
 
06:03:29.990 --> 06:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
Martin that was my my question was Why
 
06:03:34.430 --> 06:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
did um it not get added uh this year was
 
06:03:36.628 --> 06:03:36.638 align:start position:0%
that a decision of the governor was that
 
06:03:39.670 --> 06:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
a decision of the finance committee in
 
06:03:42.150 --> 06:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
the house or the Senate I do not believe
 
06:03:44.910 --> 06:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
it was an INT I was involved in the
 
06:03:47.510 --> 06:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
operating budget process for the branch
 
06:03:50.110 --> 06:03:50.120 align:start position:0%
it I think it was just an oversight um I
 
06:03:51.590 --> 06:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
think it was something that we probably
 
06:03:54.230 --> 06:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
should have put called to attention and
 
06:03:57.270 --> 06:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
and did not do and therefore it did not
 
06:03:57.280 --> 06:03:58.990 align:start position:0%
and did not do and therefore it did not
get

06:03:58.990 --> 06:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
get
 
06:04:03.830 --> 06:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:03.840 --> 06:04:06.430 align:start position:0%
 
just

06:04:06.430 --> 06:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
just
 
06:04:06.440 --> 06:04:08.830 align:start position:0%
just
wondering

06:04:08.830 --> 06:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
06:04:08.840 --> 06:04:11.030 align:start position:0%
wondering
um

06:04:11.030 --> 06:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:13.670 --> 06:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
if we want
 
06:04:16.150 --> 06:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
to what is the what is the I don't have
 
06:04:17.230 --> 06:04:17.240 align:start position:0%
the bill in front of me now because I
 
06:04:20.310 --> 06:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
just turned my page what is the
 
06:04:23.750 --> 06:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:28.990 --> 06:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
bill uh upon Passage um except
 
06:04:32.110 --> 06:04:32.120 align:start position:0%
for the repeal you know so it's it's
 
06:04:34.510 --> 06:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
upon passage and I am
 
06:04:37.868 --> 06:04:37.878 align:start position:0%
just concerned about without a fiscal
 
06:04:42.110 --> 06:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
note on this bill with this that being
 
06:04:46.230 --> 06:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
added um are
 
06:04:46.240 --> 06:04:48.510 align:start position:0%
added um are
we

06:04:48.510 --> 06:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:04:52.270 --> 06:04:52.280 align:start position:0%
overstepping our Authority given that
 
06:04:53.910 --> 06:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
we're doing this without the involvement
 
06:04:56.070 --> 06:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
of the finance
 
06:04:59.948 --> 06:04:59.958 align:start position:0%
committee you know what the oh no no no
 
06:05:02.708 --> 06:05:02.718 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative
 
06:05:06.230 --> 06:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
CH this is confusing to me I it looks as
 
06:05:08.430 --> 06:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
though there is a at least the version I
 
06:05:10.270 --> 06:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
have has a fiscal note it just doesn't
 
06:05:12.990 --> 06:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
have the FN in the bill title is that am
 
06:05:15.990 --> 06:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
I reading this right I'm sorry
 
06:05:18.430 --> 06:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
but that that's what was confusing me
 
06:05:19.990 --> 06:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
sorry to jump
 
06:05:21.868 --> 06:05:21.878 align:start position:0%
in you
 
06:05:21.878 --> 06:05:23.628 align:start position:0%
in you
know

06:05:23.628 --> 06:05:23.638 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:05:26.190 --> 06:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
yeah right undetermined you know what I
 
06:05:28.190 --> 06:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
you know what I guess um representative
 
06:05:31.150 --> 06:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
Smith I'm uh I I guess I would be
 
06:05:33.510 --> 06:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
looking for your guidance on this as I
 
06:05:36.708 --> 06:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
understand it this would not in any
 
06:05:36.718 --> 06:05:38.788 align:start position:0%
understand it this would not in any
way

06:05:38.788 --> 06:05:38.798 align:start position:0%
way
 
06:05:41.190 --> 06:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
um won't change the budget it won't
 
06:05:43.430 --> 06:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
change the budget of it would just allow
 
06:05:45.468 --> 06:05:45.478 align:start position:0%
the to move from from place to place
 
06:05:48.590 --> 06:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
yeah to move money at a at $225,000
 
06:05:50.350 --> 06:05:50.360 align:start position:0%
higher rate than they could otherwise so
 
06:05:51.910 --> 06:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
I think so I think we would call that
 
06:05:54.070 --> 06:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
Dom minimist don't you think so I would
 
06:05:55.990 --> 06:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
agree take back my
 
06:05:59.670 --> 06:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
question other questions for um either
 
06:06:02.030 --> 06:06:02.040 align:start position:0%

appreciate your time here I have to
 
06:11:35.590 --> 06:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
apologize because uh I realized as I was
 
06:11:37.510 --> 06:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
sitting here the first error that I made
 
06:11:40.230 --> 06:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
was I put down this W House Bill 1484
 
06:11:43.468 --> 06:11:43.478 align:start position:0%
and it should be 1489 so I quickly made
 
06:11:43.478 --> 06:11:44.310 align:start position:0%
and it should be 1489 so I quickly made
those

06:11:44.310 --> 06:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
those
 
06:11:47.910 --> 06:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
changes um I'm here before you today to
 
06:11:50.350 --> 06:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
introduce this bill um and it's relative
 
06:11:52.510 --> 06:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
to town and school ballot recount
 
06:11:54.468 --> 06:11:54.478 align:start position:0%
appeals uh it's something that I hope
 
06:11:56.190 --> 06:11:56.200 align:start position:0%
that we can all agree on would be a
 
06:11:59.230 --> 06:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
simple and fair amendment to change to
 
06:12:03.468 --> 06:12:03.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:06.230 --> 06:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
66935 and it's regarding the the appeals
 
06:12:09.910 --> 06:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
in in the recount process um the best
 
06:12:11.830 --> 06:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
way that I can go about explaining this
 
06:12:14.590 --> 06:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
is from a a personal experience that I
 
06:12:16.390 --> 06:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
had in Hillsboro
 
06:12:19.868 --> 06:12:19.878 align:start position:0%
Dearing in March of 2022 Hillsboro
 
06:12:23.310 --> 06:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
Dearing uh had their their School Vote
 
06:12:25.590 --> 06:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro daring is a cooperative and
 
06:12:28.510 --> 06:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
we're part of 34 which includes
 
06:12:32.190 --> 06:12:32.200 align:start position:0%
Washington Windsor Hillsboro and Deering
 
06:12:33.868 --> 06:12:33.878 align:start position:0%
my recount was for both the school
 
06:12:35.788 --> 06:12:35.798 align:start position:0%
budget the School District budget and
 
06:12:37.110 --> 06:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
the SAU
 
06:12:40.548 --> 06:12:40.558 align:start position:0%
budget when I petitioned for this and we
 
06:12:43.830 --> 06:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
showed up at the um for the
 
06:12:47.030 --> 06:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
recount uh I learned that the only
 
06:12:48.510 --> 06:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
ballots that were collected to be
 
06:12:51.190 --> 06:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
recounted were Hillsboro Dearing ballots
 
06:12:53.190 --> 06:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
Washington and Windsor were not there I
 
06:12:55.150 --> 06:12:55.160 align:start position:0%
went through the entire process of the
 
06:12:58.750 --> 06:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
recount and um asked some questions and
 
06:13:00.868 --> 06:13:00.878 align:start position:0%
was told that Washington and Windsor was
 
06:13:03.030 --> 06:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
not part of the recount because I wasn't
 
06:13:04.468 --> 06:13:04.478 align:start position:0%
a member of Washington and Windsor
 
06:13:05.708 --> 06:13:05.718 align:start position:0%
School District and that I was a
 
06:13:07.510 --> 06:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
resident of
 
06:13:11.830 --> 06:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro so um so that was my first
 
06:13:14.708 --> 06:13:14.718 align:start position:0%
issue with the recount backing up on the
 
06:13:18.230 --> 06:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
SAU budget Hillsboro and Dearing when
 
06:13:21.070 --> 06:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
they voted they failed the budget when
 
06:13:23.230 --> 06:13:23.240 align:start position:0%
Washington and Windsor voted on the SAU
 
06:13:25.350 --> 06:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
budget it
 
06:13:28.788 --> 06:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
passed so as I started my investigation
 
06:13:32.350 --> 06:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
after um the recount because I planned
 
06:13:34.390 --> 06:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
on appealing it to the
 
06:13:36.910 --> 06:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
courts I did some digging and I learned
 
06:13:38.628 --> 06:13:38.638 align:start position:0%
that Windsor actually didn't have a
 
06:13:40.468 --> 06:13:40.478 align:start position:0%
paper ballot count like they're supposed
 
06:13:42.868 --> 06:13:42.878 align:start position:0%
to according to the RSA they did a hand
 
06:13:46.708 --> 06:13:46.718 align:start position:0%
count or a voice count and I got both
 
06:13:48.670 --> 06:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
answers with regards to Washington
 
06:13:50.430 --> 06:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
Washington I was told that it was a hand
 
06:13:51.948 --> 06:13:51.958 align:start position:0%
count and I was told that it was a paper
 
06:13:53.670 --> 06:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
count but at that point in time I didn't
 
06:13:55.390 --> 06:13:55.400 align:start position:0%
bother to push the issue because I knew
 
06:13:59.670 --> 06:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
it it it was done wrong to begin
 
06:14:03.230 --> 06:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
with so I had a few issues um regarding
 
06:14:05.830 --> 06:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
the recount that
 
06:14:08.430 --> 06:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
I that I told the school that I was
 
06:14:11.468 --> 06:14:11.478 align:start position:0%
going to challenge um one being that not
 
06:14:14.030 --> 06:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
all of our ballots were there the second
 
06:14:16.270 --> 06:14:16.280 align:start position:0%
being that our moderator who was in
 
06:14:18.590 --> 06:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
charge of this recount actually seemed
 
06:14:20.830 --> 06:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
ill prepared for the recount he actually
 
06:14:22.548 --> 06:14:22.558 align:start position:0%
didn't know how many ballots he was
 
06:14:24.548 --> 06:14:24.558 align:start position:0%
supposed to have to be recounted he
 
06:14:27.628 --> 06:14:27.638 align:start position:0%
didn't have the supervisor's checklist
 
06:14:29.708 --> 06:14:29.718 align:start position:0%
um he didn't have any way of verifying
 
06:14:31.708 --> 06:14:31.718 align:start position:0%
that daring and Hillsboro turned in all
 
06:14:34.070 --> 06:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
of the ballots and he had no answer when
 
06:14:36.070 --> 06:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
it came to why Washington and Windsor
 
06:14:36.080 --> 06:14:37.190 align:start position:0%
it came to why Washington and Windsor
were

06:14:37.190 --> 06:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
were
 
06:14:40.590 --> 06:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
there and then after doing the recount
 
06:14:42.310 --> 06:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
which that's a whole other story that
 
06:14:43.390 --> 06:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
probably should be addressed in a
 
06:14:45.270 --> 06:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
different bill
 
06:14:49.390 --> 06:14:49.400 align:start position:0%
um the the recount was done with my
 
06:14:51.390 --> 06:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
observers they had three tables set up
 
06:14:52.750 --> 06:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
with the school board members doing the
 
06:14:54.868 --> 06:14:54.878 align:start position:0%
recounts I had three
 
06:14:57.310 --> 06:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
observers everything went fairly well in
 
06:14:59.830 --> 06:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
that process but when it came time to
 
06:15:01.788 --> 06:15:01.798 align:start position:0%
tallying their counts of each of the
 
06:15:03.910 --> 06:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
three tables the moderator went behind a
 
06:15:06.070 --> 06:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
box and did the tally came up with his
 
06:15:07.788 --> 06:15:07.798 align:start position:0%
tally and announced it which happened to
 
06:15:09.948 --> 06:15:09.958 align:start position:0%
be the exact same as what was published
 
06:15:12.270 --> 06:15:12.280 align:start position:0%
and I asked him does anybody get to see
 
06:15:14.670 --> 06:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
your math does anybody get to check it
 
06:15:16.750 --> 06:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
and again he didn't respond and didn't
 
06:15:18.390 --> 06:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
allow me the opportunity or any of my
 
06:15:22.150 --> 06:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:24.590 --> 06:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
math so after this when I told the
 
06:15:26.830 --> 06:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
school that I was going to appeal it I
 
06:15:28.708 --> 06:15:28.718 align:start position:0%
then started the process of making some
 
06:15:30.708 --> 06:15:30.718 align:start position:0%
phone calls and really diving into this
 
06:15:32.708 --> 06:15:32.718 align:start position:0%
much deeper before I filed with the
 
06:15:34.390 --> 06:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
Superior Court in
 
06:15:37.548 --> 06:15:37.558 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro and um I got some great
 
06:15:40.070 --> 06:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
responses I I contacted the Secretary of
 
06:15:41.830 --> 06:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
State's office I contacted the Attorney
 
06:15:44.110 --> 06:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
General's office I went through the rsas
 
06:15:46.030 --> 06:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
as best as I could and as best as I
 
06:15:49.150 --> 06:15:49.160 align:start position:0%
understood and I got a very thorough and
 
06:15:51.510 --> 06:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
and uh informative response from Bud
 
06:15:53.350 --> 06:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
Fitch from the Secretary of State's
 
06:15:55.868 --> 06:15:55.878 align:start position:0%
office and I've included his email there
 
06:15:57.948 --> 06:15:57.958 align:start position:0%
as well for you guys to look at and he
 
06:15:59.788 --> 06:15:59.798 align:start position:0%
set me on the right direction and
 
06:16:01.468 --> 06:16:01.478 align:start position:0%
confirmed that what was done actually
 
06:16:05.468 --> 06:16:05.478 align:start position:0%
was not to statute um so I then
 
06:16:07.628 --> 06:16:07.638 align:start position:0%
proceeded to file my claim with the
 
06:16:09.468 --> 06:16:09.478 align:start position:0%
court and I got to the point of the
 
06:16:10.788 --> 06:16:10.798 align:start position:0%
claim with the court where it was going
 
06:16:11.948 --> 06:16:11.958 align:start position:0%
to cost me
 
06:16:15.430 --> 06:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
$280 to file this claim to petition at
 
06:16:17.548 --> 06:16:17.558 align:start position:0%
the court that this recount was not done
 
06:16:19.708 --> 06:16:19.718 align:start position:0%
properly and at that point in time I
 
06:16:22.190 --> 06:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
stopped um I I took a lot of things into
 
06:16:24.868 --> 06:16:24.878 align:start position:0%
consideration at that point in time um
 
06:16:27.708 --> 06:16:27.718 align:start position:0%
you know I really wanted to know what
 
06:16:30.070 --> 06:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
was I going to get out of my $280 right
 
06:16:31.708 --> 06:16:31.718 align:start position:0%
so you before I took that out of our
 
06:16:33.270 --> 06:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
family budget what was this going to
 
06:16:36.430 --> 06:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
give me it was going to confirm that
 
06:16:38.830 --> 06:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
what Bill Fitch said and what I knew was
 
06:16:42.350 --> 06:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
that I was right um you know it's not
 
06:16:44.548 --> 06:16:44.558 align:start position:0%
always the best thing to be right I mean
 
06:16:46.990 --> 06:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
that's not that's not the win um what I
 
06:16:49.350 --> 06:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to have fixed was the process and
 
06:16:50.868 --> 06:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
that was really my objective and this
 
06:16:53.350 --> 06:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
was fixing the process uh you know the
 
06:16:54.670 --> 06:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
courts probably would have said the
 
06:16:56.468 --> 06:16:56.478 align:start position:0%
moderator needs better training so that
 
06:16:58.868 --> 06:16:58.878 align:start position:0%
he understands how to perform a recount
 
06:17:00.350 --> 06:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
they probably would have gone to Windsor
 
06:17:02.708 --> 06:17:02.718 align:start position:0%
and said hey you guys need to follow the
 
06:17:06.270 --> 06:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
RSA and um we probably would have gone
 
06:17:08.110 --> 06:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
back to the default that the SAU
 
06:17:09.548 --> 06:17:09.558 align:start position:0%
probably may have failed because we
 
06:17:10.868 --> 06:17:10.878 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have been able to verify it
 
06:17:13.230 --> 06:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
without ballot votes from Windsor so it
 
06:17:14.390 --> 06:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
may have failed but that would have
 
06:17:16.468 --> 06:17:16.478 align:start position:0%
really only been a $9,000 change in the
 
06:17:18.830 --> 06:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
budget so at the end of the day I
 
06:17:20.110 --> 06:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
started thinking about this saying
 
06:17:21.708 --> 06:17:21.718 align:start position:0%
what's the best course of action and my
 
06:17:23.350 --> 06:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
best course of action that I felt was
 
06:17:25.990 --> 06:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
taking it to our legislative body to see
 
06:17:29.110 --> 06:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
see if we can correct this um so that if
 
06:17:31.708 --> 06:17:31.718 align:start position:0%
a person like me who wasn't a
 
06:17:34.230 --> 06:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
representative at the time um wants to
 
06:17:38.990 --> 06:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
challenge a recount that I should um one
 
06:17:41.190 --> 06:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
I have the right to do that but I should
 
06:17:42.628 --> 06:17:42.638 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of protection if the
 
06:17:45.270 --> 06:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
court does find in favor of me if the
 
06:17:46.910 --> 06:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
court found in favor of me I would have
 
06:17:49.150 --> 06:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
been out my $280 and I would have had
 
06:17:50.750 --> 06:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
the bragging rights of saying I was
 
06:17:54.190 --> 06:17:54.200 align:start position:0%
right um however you know and the school
 
06:17:55.468 --> 06:17:55.478 align:start position:0%
would have just said okay we're going to
 
06:17:56.590 --> 06:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
fix this
 
06:17:58.948 --> 06:17:58.958 align:start position:0%
so my mission was to add a little bit
 
06:18:00.788 --> 06:18:00.798 align:start position:0%
more teeth into it for the school to get
 
06:18:04.670 --> 06:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
it right so my request is just simply to
 
06:18:08.670 --> 06:18:08.680 align:start position:0%
um allow the the the grieved person the
 
06:18:11.030 --> 06:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
the grieved person to be able to collect
 
06:18:13.830 --> 06:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
any attorney fees and court cost fees if
 
06:18:15.670 --> 06:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
the court finds in their favor and if
 
06:18:17.510 --> 06:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
the court doesn't then the money comes
 
06:18:19.390 --> 06:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
out of my pocket and it was my gamble my
 
06:18:22.350 --> 06:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
loss so that's the the context of this
 
06:18:25.030 --> 06:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
bill and where I'm coming from on this
 
06:18:27.270 --> 06:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
so you know in the end you know after
 
06:18:29.830 --> 06:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
after doing all of this you know I
 
06:18:32.390 --> 06:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
experienced firsthand why people don't
 
06:18:34.030 --> 06:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
push their the challenge to our
 
06:18:35.750 --> 06:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities and schools and there
 
06:18:37.430 --> 06:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
were many people when I was going around
 
06:18:39.190 --> 06:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
asking to them for them to sign the
 
06:18:40.990 --> 06:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
petition there were many people who told
 
06:18:42.548 --> 06:18:42.558 align:start position:0%
me not to bother that it was just a
 
06:18:45.150 --> 06:18:45.160 align:start position:0%
waste of time and it was an exercise and
 
06:18:48.350 --> 06:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
futility um and I I just believed
 
06:18:51.948 --> 06:18:51.958 align:start position:0%
different and pressed on um and I just
 
06:18:53.270 --> 06:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
got to the point where I said I'm not
 
06:18:56.350 --> 06:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
spending $300 or $280 of my and I want
 
06:18:57.948 --> 06:18:57.958 align:start position:0%
to go a different route with this that
 
06:19:00.110 --> 06:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
will help people in the future who want
 
06:19:02.708 --> 06:19:02.718 align:start position:0%
to follow the same
 
06:19:05.830 --> 06:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
path so here I am in front of you with
 
06:19:07.750 --> 06:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
this bill I'm prepared to answer any
 
06:19:09.830 --> 06:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
questions um but I would like to ask the
 
06:19:12.150 --> 06:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
committee to please review the data that
 
06:19:14.628 --> 06:19:14.638 align:start position:0%
I've provided um and make a
 
06:19:17.070 --> 06:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation of ought to
 
06:19:20.070 --> 06:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
pass thank you questions for members of
 
06:19:23.230 --> 06:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
the committee you know I guess I have I
 
06:19:24.990 --> 06:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
do have one question am I understanding
 
06:19:28.548 --> 06:19:28.558 align:start position:0%
this if we were to adopt this this would
 
06:19:31.830 --> 06:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
apply to any recount is that words it
