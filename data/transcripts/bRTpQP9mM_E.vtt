00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.529 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:24:57.529 --> 00:24:57.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
starting the work session you're right
 
00:25:03.289 --> 00:25:03.299 align:start position:0%
great all right so um
 
00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:07.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
no no I I yeah
 
00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
so uh I'm gonna try to I thought might
 
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
be the easiest way to go through this
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
would go be to go through provision by
 
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.549 align:start position:0%
would go be to go through provision by
provision

00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
provision
 
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
um so what I sent you and I think this
 
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
is the easiest way to kind of track
 
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
what's going on I find it to be easier
 
00:25:30.289 --> 00:25:30.299 align:start position:0%
than with all the
 
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
in the format that they that they give
 
00:25:33.649 --> 00:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
you all the numbers and everything on
 
00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
um I thought it would be easier just to
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
go through Section by section it's a
 
00:25:39.769 --> 00:25:39.779 align:start position:0%
little easier to read on the the what I
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
sent to you which is the which has the
 
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
xB sb60
 
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
what was the passed uh by the Senate and
 
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
it also has some amendments that were in
 
00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
the letter that I had uh brought to you
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
last week so I thought that this might
 
00:25:56.029 --> 00:25:56.039 align:start position:0%
be the easiest way to go through and so
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
what I thought what I would do is kind
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
of just go Section by section
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
explain what's going on here and then we
 
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
uh if you have questions and then the
 
00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
the rules piece fortunately isn't until
 
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
the end it's the last provision so um
 
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
but I think uh representative
 
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:15.900 align:start position:0%
um mcgu brought up some really good
 
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
points about rules versus statutes and
 
00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to talk about that as we go
 
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
through because I think his point was
 
00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:24.059 align:start position:0%
that stuff that's important should be in
 
00:26:24.059 --> 00:26:25.130 align:start position:0%
that stuff that's important should be in
statute

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:25.140 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
and I wholeheartedly agree and I think
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
what you'll see here is that most of
 
00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is actually putting
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
stuff in statute that was important so
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
so I don't think that there's anything
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
else other than the last provision that
 
00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:40.620 align:start position:0%
is actually dependent on rules
 
00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
so um I I just want to but we'll go
 
00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
through that I think as we go through
 
00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
because I think that that was a it was a
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
really good point that he made and I
 
00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we we capture
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
that as we go because he's not here
 
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.149 align:start position:0%
that as we go because he's not here
today

00:26:53.149 --> 00:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:55.140 align:start position:0%
um so the first section is called
 
00:26:57.529 --> 00:26:57.539 align:start position:0%
enforcement of classification
 
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
and what this does and I I tried to
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
explain this a little bit in testimony
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
but but I'll just sort of review
 
00:27:06.409 --> 00:27:06.419 align:start position:0%
anything that's a big Federal project
 
00:27:09.169 --> 00:27:09.179 align:start position:0%
requires a big Federal permit requires
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
the state to do this fed this 401
 
00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:13.980 align:start position:0%
section 401 certification which is
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
certifying that it'll meet our state
 
00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
water quality standards so that's all
 
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
that is this is the section of law that
 
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
authorizes the department to do those
 
00:27:26.269 --> 00:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
401 certifications which are which are
 
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
part of the federal Clean Water Act so
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's what you're seeing here that's
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
section one is really that part
 
00:27:36.169 --> 00:27:36.179 align:start position:0%
the the addition here that's in sb60 is
 
00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
that it gives the department the ability
 
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
to waive a 401 certification currently
 
00:27:45.529 --> 00:27:45.539 align:start position:0%
the only thing we can do is approve it
 
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:47.220 align:start position:0%
or deny it we can approve it with
 
00:27:49.789 --> 00:27:49.799 align:start position:0%
conditions or approve it approval
 
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
conditions or deny it we don't have an
 
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to waive it the federal
 
00:27:57.649 --> 00:27:57.659 align:start position:0%
Clean Water Act has the option that the
 
00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:01.140 align:start position:0%
state can waive a 401 certification
 
00:28:03.529 --> 00:28:03.539 align:start position:0%
I think I gave the example last time of
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth where they had a water pipe a
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
replacement of a water pipe that's not
 
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:10.740 align:start position:0%
it's not really impacting anything but
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
it happens to go through that happens to
 
00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
go through tidal waters so it requires
 
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:17.820 align:start position:0%
an Army Corps of Engineers individual
 
00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:19.980 align:start position:0%
permit therefore it requires a water
 
00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:21.900 align:start position:0%
quality certification
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
it essentially has no impacts there's no
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
re other permitting required it has
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
ample public ability to to weigh in
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
because it's a federal permit that's a
 
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
project that we would waive
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
certification on saving them the city uh
 
00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:40.919 align:start position:0%
money uh in terms of getting Consultants
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
to write their applications and all that
 
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
stuff and our staff uh which we already
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
have a pile of work of trying to deal
 
00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
with that so we would be able to waive
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
that kind of certification that's the
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
kind of projects we're talking about
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
here so that's provision number one any
 
00:28:59.210 --> 00:28:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
great so that one I think is pretty
 
00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.930 align:start position:0%
great so that one I think is pretty
straightforward

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:02.940 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
00:29:06.289 --> 00:29:06.299 align:start position:0%
the second uh provision
 
00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:09.900 align:start position:0%
um is about putting into statutes some
 
00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
time limits for EPA for Des to act
 
00:29:16.669 --> 00:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
and how and and for the public to have a
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
clear expectation of the timing of doing
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
these 401 certifications
 
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
currently there is nothing in statute
 
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
about timing zero nothing not a word
 
00:29:30.289 --> 00:29:30.299 align:start position:0%
um and the problem with that is then the
 
00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:34.340 align:start position:0%
absence of us specifying in statute
 
00:29:36.889 --> 00:29:36.899 align:start position:0%
what uh
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
what the time frames are there is a
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
standard for the state that tells all
 
00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:44.820 align:start position:0%
agencies that if you have to act on
 
00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:46.740 align:start position:0%
something you have to do it in 60 days
 
00:29:48.769 --> 00:29:48.779 align:start position:0%
that's basically there's another statute
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
that says that
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
and so we would have to apply that to
 
00:29:54.649 --> 00:29:54.659 align:start position:0%
this exercise and these are
 
00:29:57.649 --> 00:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily large complex projects
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
so this basically puts together a
 
00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:04.100 align:start position:0%
process where people have some
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
understanding of what the time frames
 
00:30:09.049 --> 00:30:09.059 align:start position:0%
involved of going through this process
 
00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
with the state are
 
00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
that's all that this project that's all
 
00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:16.620 align:start position:0%
that this is doing in section two
 
00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:18.470 align:start position:0%
that this is doing in section two
and

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
section four section two and four mirror
 
00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:24.299 align:start position:0%
each other they are just two different
 
00:30:26.289 --> 00:30:26.299 align:start position:0%
parts of
 
00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
that enabling legislation that allows
 
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
Des to do these 401 certifications
 
00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
so it has to sit in both sections yes
 
00:30:36.769 --> 00:30:36.779 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:38.820 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:41.630 align:start position:0%
you have a question
oh

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
Mr dearest does uh section 401 or does
 
00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
it does the federal government establish
 
00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:49.980 align:start position:0%
any time limits yeah so let me talk
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
about that for a second because I think
 
00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:53.220 align:start position:0%
this is really important
 
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
the Clean Water Act says that all 401s
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
will be done in no more than one year
 
00:31:03.169 --> 00:31:03.179 align:start position:0%
so the federal Clean Water Act sets one
 
00:31:03.179 --> 00:31:04.490 align:start position:0%
so the federal Clean Water Act sets one
year

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
but what happens as what the federal
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
rules say is that when an application
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
comes in
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
the the federal agency who is in charge
 
00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
of that particular project
 
00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:19.559 align:start position:0%
has to set a reasonable time period that
 
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
cannot exceed one year
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
so there are some agencies that set you
 
00:31:27.169 --> 00:31:27.179 align:start position:0%
know a reasonable time period at 60 days
 
00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:29.700 align:start position:0%
there are some that put in a year
 
00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:32.220 align:start position:0%
all the ferc projects the Federal Energy
 
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Commission that's what all
 
00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:36.059 align:start position:0%
the hydro all the hydropower
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
re-licensing that's going on in the
 
00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:38.820 align:start position:0%
state if you're in the Connecticut
 
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
region all the Connecticut dams Great
 
00:31:42.769 --> 00:31:42.779 align:start position:0%
River Hydro is going through
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
re-licensing it's going on right now up
 
00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:49.140 align:start position:0%
in the Androscoggin uh below uh Arrow
 
00:31:51.769 --> 00:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
below the arrow Dam Daryl Dam included
 
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
there's re-licensing going on in the
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
baker we've called it Baker eight I love
 
00:32:00.529 --> 00:32:00.539 align:start position:0%
that it sounds like a gang uh but the uh
 
00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
the baker eight are eight Hydro
 
00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:04.980 align:start position:0%
facilities on the baker River so all of
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
these are going through these these
 
00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
Federal processes they all have a year
 
00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
that they go through uh but there are
 
00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
other agencies that set that
 
00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
so the way that this is written is sort
 
00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:17.820 align:start position:0%
of the assumption that it's kind of like
 
00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:20.700 align:start position:0%
a a year-long process
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
and the issue that came up and and there
 
00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
one there are a couple of amendments in
 
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
here to address that the issue that came
 
00:32:30.529 --> 00:32:30.539 align:start position:0%
up in testimony from Dot
 
00:32:33.169 --> 00:32:33.179 align:start position:0%
was that sometimes a federal agency will
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
set a shorter reasonable period of time
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
and if that's the case then Des will
 
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
have to act on that we don't want to to
 
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
not to deny it simply because we didn't
 
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
have enough time
 
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
so so the way there are some rule
 
00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
changes suggested
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
um in here and I'll Point those out
 
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
where they are
 
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
that will address that issue of timing
 
00:32:59.870 --> 00:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
should the federal agency set a
 
00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
different reasonable period of time than
 
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
one year
 
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
so that does happen and that's why um
 
00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
the yellow or the the highlighted parts
 
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
of your of the rules the ones that are
 
00:33:12.889 --> 00:33:12.899 align:start position:0%
great out there those are additions that
 
00:33:15.289 --> 00:33:15.299 align:start position:0%
we're suggesting to make to address that
 
00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:17.700 align:start position:0%
very issue that you just brought up
 
00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
but that's basically how this works it's
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
usually a year
 
00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:26.519 align:start position:0%
but sometimes it can happen that we have
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
to go faster than that
 
00:33:30.409 --> 00:33:30.419 align:start position:0%
that also is one of the reasons why we
 
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:32.940 align:start position:0%
wanted to put the waiver provision in is
 
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
that should there be a a reasonable time
 
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
period which in my mind once if it's 60
 
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
days it's an unreasonable period of time
 
00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
but whatever
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
um that's what they call it the federal
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
parlance is a reasonable period of time
 
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
if it was short and it looked like we
 
00:33:48.409 --> 00:33:48.419 align:start position:0%
weren't going to be able to get through
 
00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
the process we would have the ability to
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
waive the process so that that project
 
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
could move forward
 
00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:56.220 align:start position:0%
so these and again usually these
 
00:33:57.769 --> 00:33:57.779 align:start position:0%
projects have ample Federal
 
00:34:00.889 --> 00:34:00.899 align:start position:0%
opportunities for due process and for
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:10.849 --> 00:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
it wasn't Darcy
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Darcy speaker thanks for the
 
00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
question I don't know what the procedure
 
00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
is here because I have two questions but
 
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
um the first is in the proposed
 
00:34:21.649 --> 00:34:21.659 align:start position:0%
amendment the proposed amendment yeah
 
00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
you know you talk about
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
um granting and extension so they can
 
00:34:28.369 --> 00:34:28.379 align:start position:0%
say hey I'd like another 100 yeah right
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
it seems reasonable but could it's not
 
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
clear if they can keep doing that or if
 
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
that's a one-time thing
 
00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
so that's a great question I think that
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
would probably be a one-time thing
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
because we would start to run out of
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
that one year
 
00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:42.899 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if it should be more
 
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:45.300 align:start position:0%
explicit in here to say that they can
 
00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:48.659 align:start position:0%
have a one-time uh 120 day extension
 
00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
thank you that's great
 
00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
um so you mentioned the waiver part
 
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
um which is in you know uh
 
00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:04.430 align:start position:0%
um which is in you know uh
three

00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
three a c
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
e it says there's a wave waiver if the
 
00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:11.930 align:start position:0%
e it says there's a wave waiver if the
um

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
if the certification can't be completed
 
00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:16.140 align:start position:0%
in a reasonable amount of time right
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
within the applicable time where the
 
00:35:19.849 --> 00:35:19.859 align:start position:0%
applicable time is described I guess in
 
00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
A and B yep
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
and then it says the certificate shall
 
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
be considered waived so
 
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.910 align:start position:0%
be considered waived so
um

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
help me understand why I shouldn't be
 
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
concerned that let's say the Des was
 
00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:36.780 align:start position:0%
understaffed and they couldn't they get
 
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
a wave of these things in and they
 
00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
couldn't comply with all of them in this
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
time period that we'd let potentially
 
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
um dangerous
 
00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:47.220 align:start position:0%
projects go through yeah so I think that
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
that's a really good point and the the
 
00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
fact of the matter is is that if it's if
 
00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
it's a very big deal project what Des
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
does is we request the federal agency to
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
extend the reasonable period of time
 
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
and that is usually granted
 
00:36:06.609 --> 00:36:06.619 align:start position:0%
so that is certainly one aspect of it
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
the problem that we have and this I
 
00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:10.980 align:start position:0%
totally get your point and this is one
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why we put let's try to
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
put this stuff in statue
 
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
we don't want to set up it's we don't
 
00:36:23.089 --> 00:36:23.099 align:start position:0%
want to set up a system
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
that would say if we can't make the
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
reasonable period of time it has to be
 
00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:28.670 align:start position:0%
reasonable period of time it has to be
denied

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
denied
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
automatically because that makes no
 
00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
bearing on sort of how again how large
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
or how potentially impacting the project
 
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.050 align:start position:0%
or how potentially impacting the project
was

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.750 align:start position:0%
was
so

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:45.180 align:start position:0%
we would have to essentially have some
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
sort of criteria
 
00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
for determining whether or not
 
00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
we we would deny something or not and so
 
00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
it's it becomes very very problematic
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
the way that it will work though let's
 
00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
just let's just play this out a project
 
00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:03.300 align:start position:0%
comes in
 
00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
there's not enough time to do uh we're
 
00:37:08.569 --> 00:37:08.579 align:start position:0%
understaffed whatever we can't get to
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
the project
 
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
um if we don't act on it if we fail to
 
00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
act on it whatsoever it is deemed waived
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
by the federal agency
 
00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
so if we make no action whatsoever it
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
will be deemed waived and the the agency
 
00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:26.700 align:start position:0%
will will go and and do the permit in
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
what time period in the reasonable time
 
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
so if we fail to act so the only so the
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
only way that we would be able to stop
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
the project at that point would be to
 
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
deny the 401 certificate which would
 
00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
stop the federal agency from moving
 
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
um so that would become very problematic
 
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
for someone who's a proponent of that
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
project because they would essentially
 
00:37:55.849 --> 00:37:55.859 align:start position:0%
be stuck in sort of a limbo
 
00:37:59.150 --> 00:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
um until it somehow got worked out that
 
00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
I mean they can definitely Sue right
 
00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
they can say like you have to the
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
statute says you have to um you have to
 
00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
comply within this amount of time and
 
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
force a decision if they they really
 
00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:15.780 align:start position:0%
needed to it seems there would certainly
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
be provisions and there's also
 
00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:18.780 align:start position:0%
Provisions within the Clean Water Act
 
00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
for people to have lawsuits under
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
various different authorities so there's
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
there's quite a bit of due process I
 
00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
think that is available to people should
 
00:38:28.609 --> 00:38:28.619 align:start position:0%
they feel aggrieved that there's a
 
00:38:32.089 --> 00:38:32.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
to me that like you said these are
 
00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
complicated cases right
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
and your lab you're giving the submitter
 
00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:41.460 align:start position:0%
time to sort of get their stuff together
 
00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
when you ask difficult questions right
 
00:38:46.849 --> 00:38:46.859 align:start position:0%
but I don't see that the the department
 
00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
has the same flexibility
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
that's if they you know if they get back
 
00:38:53.329 --> 00:38:53.339 align:start position:0%
this massive dump of documents right
 
00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
they have you know
 
00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:56.690 align:start position:0%
they have you know
um

00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
it's not clear another 50 days maybe
 
00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:01.140 align:start position:0%
after they get that back to right to act
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:08.700 align:start position:0%
um I totally understand and appreciate
 
00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:12.180 align:start position:0%
the need to have to bound it right right
 
00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:13.740 align:start position:0%
um and to prioritize
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
but I don't see
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
in um where you said that you would ask
 
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
to ask the federal government for an
 
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
extension that that doesn't seem to be
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
codified here no in fact I mean that's
 
00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.470 align:start position:0%
codified here no in fact I mean that's
um

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:34.460 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean it it generally gets set
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
right at the beginning of the process
 
00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
it's almost before this process starts
 
00:39:41.569 --> 00:39:41.579 align:start position:0%
with that reasonable time period is set
 
00:39:44.089 --> 00:39:44.099 align:start position:0%
but but how does that align with the
 
00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
language doesn't this this language bind
 
00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
you rather than that so so what I would
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
just let me just uh what one of the
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
reasons why we're doing this I'll be
 
00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:53.700 align:start position:0%
honest with you
 
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
is to put pressure on the federal
 
00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.109 align:start position:0%
is to put pressure on the federal
agencies

00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
so that they will match their reasonable
 
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
time period to what we put in statute
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
so right now we have nothing in statute
 
00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
that says it has to be done by a certain
 
00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
the federal agency can set their
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable time we have had in the past
 
00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
hard conversations with federal agencies
 
00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
so one of the reasons why in fact we are
 
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
putting this forward is to put pressure
 
00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:23.700 align:start position:0%
on the federal agencies to match our
 
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
statutory language
 
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
and that again there's going to be some
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
Provisions in here which would allow us
 
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
to make a faster decision if we have a
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
project that has a shorter reasonable
 
00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
time period
 
00:40:41.089 --> 00:40:41.099 align:start position:0%
and the the fortunate thing is is that
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
the vast bulk of our work work the work
 
00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
you know load for 401 certifications are
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
the ferc processes so that's our vast
 
00:40:53.089 --> 00:40:53.099 align:start position:0%
vast majority of our load those are all
 
00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
one-year projects those are you know us
 
00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
those are slow burn that are coming down
 
00:40:59.089 --> 00:40:59.099 align:start position:0%
the road we know that those are going on
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
the other ones that come up we can jump
 
00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
on so it's it has not at this point
 
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
we've not had a resource issue
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
uh with trying to make sure we hit a
 
00:41:11.569 --> 00:41:11.579 align:start position:0%
reasonable period of time
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
the issue that we've run into if there
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
has been one has really been about
 
00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
making sure that
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
um that we had enough information to be
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
able to make a decision it hasn't really
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:27.599 --> 00:41:36.530 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
was there did you have another aspect of
 
00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:39.349 align:start position:0%
was there did you have another aspect of
that

00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.349 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
normally I uh you know seeing a hearing
 
00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
you you always come back and for you
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
there's no back and forth the lounge go
 
00:42:02.089 --> 00:42:02.099 align:start position:0%
through the chair each time with a work
 
00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
session you're a little more
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
loosey-goosey yeah you if you get a
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
if you got a point that you that there's
 
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
a value
 
00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:15.020 align:start position:0%
uh that you know I will allow a uh
 
00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
a back and forth a conversation until
 
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:20.460 align:start position:0%
you get as you so you can get your
 
00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:22.460 align:start position:0%
question answered to your satisfaction
 
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
uh to it to a point obviously but uh so
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
just for those of you if you see me
 
00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
letting it letting it go a little bit
 
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
longer or a little back and forth go
 
00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:35.170 align:start position:0%
longer or a little back and forth go
that's

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:35.180 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
I would normally do just because this is
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
a a work session is more
 
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
uh is not it's formal it's to get
 
00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:46.740 align:start position:0%
information that's really what we're
 
00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:49.910 align:start position:0%
information that's really what we're
doing

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:53.089 --> 00:42:53.099 align:start position:0%
okay representative harp for a question
 
00:42:55.849 --> 00:42:55.859 align:start position:0%
or a Yeah question uh thank you Mr deers
 
00:42:58.910 --> 00:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:01.380 align:start position:0%
first I notice in your highlighted
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
amendments it says shall so I wanted to
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that you wanted shall not May
 
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:09.180 align:start position:0%
to Grant an extension
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
and the other question I got is there's
 
00:43:14.809 --> 00:43:14.819 align:start position:0%
no time period for the amount of the
 
00:43:17.569 --> 00:43:17.579 align:start position:0%
extension so if I'm an applicant and I
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
apply you have to give me an extension
 
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't specifically say how long
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say up to a year it doesn't
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
say up to six months and if I'm looking
 
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:30.300 align:start position:0%
at the statute and I'm talking to your
 
00:43:32.569 --> 00:43:32.579 align:start position:0%
department you might say to me well it
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't say how long give you a week I
 
00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
give you two weeks do you think we ought
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
to codify how long the extension can be
 
00:43:41.089 --> 00:43:41.099 align:start position:0%
good for it's a great question I think
 
00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:42.900 align:start position:0%
it's a great question I think the
 
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
problem that we run into is that is is
 
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
this idea of this reasonable period of
 
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
time by the federal agency is that it
 
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
depending on where we are in the process
 
00:43:55.309 --> 00:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
we could be if we extend it if we can't
 
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
extend it Beyond when we have to make a
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
decision so there has to be some
 
00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
flexibility on how long we would extend
 
00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.050 align:start position:0%
flexibility on how long we would extend
that

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
um so I think that that's where we would
 
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
be able to say you you know somebody
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
would request a 30-day extension we give
 
00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
them a 30-day extension if somebody
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
asked for six months we wouldn't be able
 
00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:17.700 align:start position:0%
to because that would be beyond the end
 
00:44:19.609 --> 00:44:19.619 align:start position:0%
of our decision by Clean Water Act
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
standards Beyond a year so I think that
 
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
we would probably need to have some
 
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
flexibility in that I'm not sure how we
 
00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
won't ask for follow-up because he says
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
I don't need to do that so um if you say
 
00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
an extension uh for a period of time no
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
greater than the time required to decide
 
00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
a decision by the Clean Water Act or
 
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
something and then you don't put a year
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
in case they amend that as the same may
 
00:44:58.490 --> 00:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
be amended so I know you can't give me
 
00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
10 years right to finish the project
 
00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
just looking so yeah we're talking about
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
time frames and codifying it I thought
 
00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
it would be nice if we could codify the
 
00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:11.460 align:start position:0%
extension that's great let me let me let
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
me think about that if you if that's
 
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:13.849 align:start position:0%
me think about that if you if that's
okay

00:45:13.849 --> 00:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
um what I'll do is there's a couple of
 
00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
great ideas uh representative Darby had
 
00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
a good idea about this sort of one-time
 
00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:20.690 align:start position:0%
a good idea about this sort of one-time
extension

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:20.700 align:start position:0%
extension
 
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
um you know clarifying that I think this
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
is another good of like how what's that
 
00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:25.740 align:start position:0%
period of time you could extend it
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
another good question let me see if I
 
00:45:29.329 --> 00:45:29.339 align:start position:0%
can come to a conclusion on that and
 
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
we'll turn that right around
 
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:33.950 align:start position:0%
we'll turn that right around
well

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
not the contradicted representative
 
00:45:37.849 --> 00:45:37.859 align:start position:0%
Darby but
 
00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:40.140 align:start position:0%
there may be times when you grant them a
 
00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
30-day extension and he needs more time
 
00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
after that so if you put a limit sure
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
um can ask for extensions for a period
 
00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
of times no greater than then it covers
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
both representative Darby's issue just a
 
00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:57.109 align:start position:0%
both representative Darby's issue just a
suggestion

00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
00:45:59.210 --> 00:45:59.220 align:start position:0%
yeah I kind of like that maybe we just
 
00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
put a 30 day in there and then people if
 
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
they need more they can just ask for it
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
and no extensions beyond the time period
 
00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
needed to arrive at a decision
 
00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:11.450 align:start position:0%
needed to arrive at a decision
yeah

00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:11.460 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:15.290 align:start position:0%
yeah
representative

00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:46:19.609 --> 00:46:19.619 align:start position:0%
um so I'm on
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
your handout with the revised language
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
where it says to and I always we're
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
under B yes and C where it says
 
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding sub paragraphs A and B
 
00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
of this paragraph right the word
 
00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding is something I always
 
00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
struggle with and I bet you were
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
expecting me to say that but so how do
 
00:46:44.329 --> 00:46:44.339 align:start position:0%
you mean it in this case and is there
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
another word we could use absolutely so
 
00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to do
 
00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
is to the reason why that's in there and
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
the reason why section F down below are
 
00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
crossed out
 
00:46:57.650 --> 00:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
so if you see section these are these
 
00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:00.060 align:start position:0%
are related these are related issues so
 
00:47:02.569 --> 00:47:02.579 align:start position:0%
the reason why section in section c it
 
00:47:05.089 --> 00:47:05.099 align:start position:0%
says the notwithstanding part and it
 
00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
says in section and F and F is
 
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
completely can't crossed out
 
00:47:11.809 --> 00:47:11.819 align:start position:0%
is to address this very issue that was
 
00:47:13.609 --> 00:47:13.619 align:start position:0%
raised by representative wrong about
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
what happens if the federal agencies
 
00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
require a
 
00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
if they require a decision faster than
 
00:47:23.809 --> 00:47:23.819 align:start position:0%
one year or faster than the time periods
 
00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:26.700 align:start position:0%
allowable Under A and B that's what the
 
00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding means in that context is
 
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
that it's notwithstanding and what
 
00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:34.140 align:start position:0%
follows that the period of time
 
00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
specified under Section 401 of the Clean
 
00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
Water Act which gives the federal
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
agencies the ability to set a reasonable
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
period of time so in this case that's
 
00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
why that the notwithstanding was there
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
was to address the issue that was raised
 
00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:53.809 --> 00:47:53.819 align:start position:0%
thank you the second part of my question
 
00:47:56.690 --> 00:47:56.700 align:start position:0%
was is there another way to express that
 
00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
in the amendment I I don't know uh we
 
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
can certainly ponder that
 
00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
um I can take a look at that that
 
00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:05.690 align:start position:0%
um I can take a look at that that
question

00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:48:07.309 --> 00:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
um if that's something that it sounds
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
like that's not a word that uh
 
00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
it's a word that that that may not be as
 
00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
concern just that the there's ambiguity
 
00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:23.220 align:start position:0%
and in my
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
um career as a legislator and two other
 
00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
committees we've had
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
um debates about what the word actually
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
means and research in certain situations
 
00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:34.140 align:start position:0%
so I just bring that up because I think
 
00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
there's something I'm supposed to get
 
00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
this right okay I just don't okay no I
 
00:48:41.089 --> 00:48:41.099 align:start position:0%
think it's important that's an important
 
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:45.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
if I can take um try to answer your
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
question being an attorney
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
and writing and not trying to understand
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
the statutes
 
00:48:59.870 --> 00:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
I take it as a valid word because if the
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
items and subsections see
 
00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
are contrary to the items in sections A
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
and B you'd have a disconnect and say
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
what can I do so to clarify C is likely
 
00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
not equal to a and b so if I'm a judge
 
00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
and I've got to try to interpret this C
 
00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
is going to overrule a and b in these
 
00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:26.460 align:start position:0%
situations so the word notwithstanding
 
00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
is pretty commonly used in Us in the law
 
00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
he's in spite of yeah notwithstanding so
 
00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:37.380 align:start position:0%
it's not contrary so well Mr deers how
 
00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:39.780 align:start position:0%
do you do c if a and b says this oh well
 
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
I don't need to look at a and b in this
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
situation so it basically eliminates A
 
00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
and B if you're under C so to me it
 
00:49:49.849 --> 00:49:49.859 align:start position:0%
makes it pretty clear
 
00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:52.140 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that helped I'd
 
00:49:54.589 --> 00:49:54.599 align:start position:0%
thank you that that actually is helpful
 
00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:49:57.650 --> 00:49:57.660 align:start position:0%
um because I I just when you go to look
 
00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
it up in just a regular dictionary it
 
00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:02.220 align:start position:0%
can be the word but it can be the word
 
00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
in spite of
 
00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
um and I if if
 
00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
it's a if then
 
00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
logical question then I just would
 
00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
prefer that it be expressed in another
 
00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
way but I am certainly educatable and I
 
00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
think this is perfectly acceptable is it
 
00:50:23.329 --> 00:50:23.339 align:start position:0%
but it's almost dead it's always a big
 
00:50:23.339 --> 00:50:25.390 align:start position:0%
but it's almost dead it's always a big
question

00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:25.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:29.220 align:start position:0%
so um if I could move along then to
 
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
so section three is
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
um as I re as I said before we have the
 
00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:40.069 align:start position:0%
um as I re as I said before we have the
section

00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
um in section one we talked about
 
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
um this is about RSA 485 a12 3 Roman
 
00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:47.750 align:start position:0%
um this is about RSA 485 a12 3 Roman
three

00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:50.220 align:start position:0%
which is about 401 certifications for
 
00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
federal projects Roman 4 of that same
 
00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
provision which is the the what's what
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
we're talking about this enforcement of
 
00:50:59.329 --> 00:50:59.339 align:start position:0%
classification is about water
 
00:50:59.339 --> 00:51:00.950 align:start position:0%
classification is about water
withdrawals

00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
withdrawals
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
so part of the state statute we have is
 
00:51:05.569 --> 00:51:05.579 align:start position:0%
that if it's a large surface water
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
withdrawal we also do the department
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
does a certification to make sure that
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
that withdrawal will not cause a water
 
00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:16.020 align:start position:0%
quality violation
 
00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
so that's part of state law it's been
 
00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
that way since I think the 90s at some
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
point maybe the late 80s
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
and so we have done these certifications
 
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
for large withdrawals
 
00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
what is a large withdrawal a large
 
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
withdrawal is the same definition that
 
00:51:34.849 --> 00:51:34.859 align:start position:0%
is used for groundwater withdrawals
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
which is the twenty thousand gallons per
 
00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
day or 60 000 600 000 gallons over the
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
course of a of a month
 
00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.130 align:start position:0%
course of a of a month
foreign

00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:43.140 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
why this is being put direct so the
 
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
currently the statute references another
 
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
statute that is part of the drinking
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
water program
 
00:51:58.970 --> 00:51:58.980 align:start position:0%
the reason why this is being pulled out
 
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
the reason why we're pulling this out at
 
00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
this point is because for two reasons
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
one is to separate them in case future
 
00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:10.380 align:start position:0%
policy makers wanted to actually set
 
00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
different numbers for those thresholds
 
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
because that may be something that we
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
want to do in the future
 
00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:19.740 align:start position:0%
the other is to separate out the the
 
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
provision that is just about the amount
 
00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
of water that is what we would classify
 
00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
as a water withdrawal from other
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
provisions of that other statute
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
which includes things like
 
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
it includes a number of other things one
 
00:52:37.069 --> 00:52:37.079 align:start position:0%
of them is diversions I think I
 
00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
mentioned that when I testified before
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
we don't really want to have every time
 
00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
a community wants to move water from one
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
of their water supply reservoirs to
 
00:52:48.829 --> 00:52:48.839 align:start position:0%
another water supply Reservoir that
 
00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:50.460 align:start position:0%
somehow we are considering that a new
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
withdrawal that would be bad that is
 
00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
something we don't want to do so we're
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
taking that word out the diversion work
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
word out
 
00:53:01.849 --> 00:53:01.859 align:start position:0%
but this this language that that exceeds
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
20 000 gallons per day or again the
 
00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
point of that is to make it very
 
00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:09.660 align:start position:0%
specific in this statute you don't have
 
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
to go looking at at other statutes to
 
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
determine that and that it's separated
 
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:16.980 align:start position:0%
and separable from the drinking water
 
00:53:20.089 --> 00:53:20.099 align:start position:0%
program should future policy makers want
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
to have a different standard in each of
 
00:53:24.109 --> 00:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
those programs so that's a relatively
 
00:53:26.089 --> 00:53:26.099 align:start position:0%
straightforward proposition but
 
00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:28.380 align:start position:0%
certainly uh I can I can entertain any
 
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you um so Mr deers I I understand
 
00:53:41.329 --> 00:53:41.339 align:start position:0%
why you remove the word diversion in the
 
00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
first line because we're really just
 
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
talking about the withdrawal diversion
 
00:53:47.569 --> 00:53:47.579 align:start position:0%
is covered in other areas of the statute
 
00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:50.940 align:start position:0%
but it still included on
 
00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:52.030 align:start position:0%
but it still included on
um

00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
the uh two three lines at no it like in
 
00:53:58.670 --> 00:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
the middle of that paragraph where it
 
00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
says make commence Department certifies
 
00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
that the service water withdrawal or
 
00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:07.030 align:start position:0%
that the service water withdrawal or
diversion

00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
I think that that probably should be
 
00:54:14.569 --> 00:54:14.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:14.579 --> 00:54:23.030 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:26.210 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:26.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:28.140 align:start position:0%
not on groundwater groundwater has its
 
00:54:29.329 --> 00:54:29.339 align:start position:0%
own as you
 
00:54:31.549 --> 00:54:31.559 align:start position:0%
you have all had those conversations
 
00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
I think that the very the very just
 
00:54:38.809 --> 00:54:38.819 align:start position:0%
uttering the words USA Springs makes
 
00:54:49.309 --> 00:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
great okay so let's move along to
 
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
section four section four is mirror of
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
section two that we talked about before
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
again and this refers to the same
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
enforcement classifications
 
00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
this does not have the notwithstanding
 
00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:06.180 align:start position:0%
language uh you'll notice because this
 
00:55:08.089 --> 00:55:08.099 align:start position:0%
is not a federal this is purely state
 
00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
law this has no Nexus with federal law
 
00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't ha this really does set up
 
00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:15.589 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't ha this really does set up
those

00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
um it really does set up the the time
 
00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
frames for doing those surface water
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
permits the surface water withdrawal
 
00:55:25.849 --> 00:55:25.859 align:start position:0%
certifications and again I like this
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
idea of us addressing a certain you know
 
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
period of time on a Time extension that
 
00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:33.660 align:start position:0%
seems like a reasonable addition if
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's something the committee liked
 
00:55:36.589 --> 00:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
that was a good suggestion by
 
00:55:38.329 --> 00:55:38.339 align:start position:0%
representative harv and I think it meets
 
00:55:41.089 --> 00:55:41.099 align:start position:0%
representative Darby's
 
00:55:41.099 --> 00:55:43.010 align:start position:0%
representative Darby's
um suggestion

00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
um suggestion
 
00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
so we'll we'll deal with that there as
 
00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:46.970 align:start position:0%
so we'll we'll deal with that there as
well

00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:46.980 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:55:48.589 --> 00:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
so that was it that's that's the only
 
00:55:50.809 --> 00:55:50.819 align:start position:0%
piece of that's number four again is
 
00:55:53.690 --> 00:55:53.700 align:start position:0%
just setting up in statute
 
00:55:55.849 --> 00:55:55.859 align:start position:0%
what is the process what are the
 
00:55:58.790 --> 00:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
timelines so that you would be able to
 
00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
uh have an expectation of when you would
 
00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:08.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:56:10.559 --> 00:56:11.390 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
yes so this uh this section c doesn't
 
00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:17.700 align:start position:0%
include a qualification for waiving the
 
00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
certification so that's only
 
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
um it says you know approvement Denio
 
00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:24.740 align:start position:0%
extend whereas the other section had
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
approved waive or deny yep and so that's
 
00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
because you said this covers state law
 
00:56:33.049 --> 00:56:33.059 align:start position:0%
so there's not the the
 
00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
um option state law to waive uh we we it
 
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
we this is where we would go if we were
 
00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:40.140 align:start position:0%
going to do that
 
00:56:41.569 --> 00:56:41.579 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't have it in the statute
 
00:56:41.579 --> 00:56:42.710 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't have it in the statute
above

00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
above
 
00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:45.800 align:start position:0%
so this
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
yes we have not added that in the
 
00:56:49.609 --> 00:56:49.619 align:start position:0%
statute above okay so you're not looking
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
to now I think not because what we would
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
do in those cases and this is what we
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
have done in certain cases where
 
00:56:58.130 --> 00:56:58.140 align:start position:0%
um for example
 
00:56:58.140 --> 00:56:59.690 align:start position:0%
um for example
the

00:56:59.690 --> 00:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:01.609 --> 00:57:01.619 align:start position:0%
a ski area
 
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
wants to expand its snow making
 
00:57:08.589 --> 00:57:08.599 align:start position:0%
and so but it's a relatively small
 
00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
withdrawal and it's coming out of a
 
00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:13.140 align:start position:0%
relatively small water body
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
and we looked at the statistics and it
 
00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
said you know it's it's it's not likely
 
00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:21.780 align:start position:0%
to have an impact
 
00:57:23.809 --> 00:57:23.819 align:start position:0%
but because there are interests out
 
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
there in the world that have
 
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:27.710 align:start position:0%
there in the world that have
um

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:29.329 --> 00:57:29.339 align:start position:0%
you know want to make sure that the
 
00:57:31.130 --> 00:57:31.140 align:start position:0%
water resources of the state are being
 
00:57:33.410 --> 00:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
adequately addressed
 
00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:35.700 align:start position:0%
then we would write a certification but
 
00:57:37.490 --> 00:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
it would be a very simple one
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
but it allows the public it allows
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
anyone agree to be able to then enter
 
00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
into the process and that's that's why I
 
00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
think we felt it was
 
00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:47.220 align:start position:0%
um there is no other provision to do
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
that whereas in federal law there would
 
00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
be lots of other Provisions for people
 
00:57:53.690 --> 00:57:53.700 align:start position:0%
to be able to have other due process I
 
00:57:57.410 --> 00:57:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:59.690 --> 00:57:59.700 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
so section five is is actually I think
 
00:58:04.370 --> 00:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
really easy
 
00:58:08.210 --> 00:58:08.220 align:start position:0%
um we have no in the statutes there's no
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
no requirement to have public notice and
 
00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:12.660 align:start position:0%
public hearings
 
00:58:14.690 --> 00:58:14.700 align:start position:0%
so that would be something that we would
 
00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
put into rule I think it's important for
 
00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
the public to know what's going on
 
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
that's sort of transparency in
 
00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
government and we just don't have a
 
00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
provision for that so it seemed like a
 
00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
good time to add that since we had the
 
00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
hood open and we were tinkering with the
 
00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:34.190 align:start position:0%
hood open and we were tinkering with the
motor

00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:36.660 align:start position:0%
um section six
 
00:58:38.329 --> 00:58:38.339 align:start position:0%
So currently if you get a large
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
groundwater withdrawal or if you're part
 
00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
of the in-stream flow program
 
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
which many of you are familiar with
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
we've talked about that if you're in the
 
00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
in-stream flow program and we have five
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
rivers now that are are in that program
 
00:58:54.109 --> 00:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
then you are required to do water
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
conservation plans associated with your
 
00:58:57.770 --> 00:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
water withdrawal whether you're
 
00:59:00.049 --> 00:59:00.059 align:start position:0%
groundwater if you're a groundwater all
 
00:59:02.089 --> 00:59:02.099 align:start position:0%
of them do and if you're in surface
 
00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
water the ones that are in designated
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
Rivers as well as other ones that that
 
00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
have other kinds of permits have had to
 
00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
have water conservation plans
 
00:59:15.069 --> 00:59:15.079 align:start position:0%
this change in statute makes it clear
 
00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
that large surface water withdrawals new
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
ones non-existing ones new ones would
 
00:59:24.109 --> 00:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
I would have to have water conservation
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
plans so as you're probably aware if
 
00:59:29.569 --> 00:59:29.579 align:start position:0%
you've looked at these water
 
00:59:31.609 --> 00:59:31.619 align:start position:0%
conservation plans it just requires you
 
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
to know how much water you're actually
 
00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:34.309 align:start position:0%
to know how much water you're actually
using

00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
using
 
00:59:36.890 --> 00:59:36.900 align:start position:0%
we have a reporting uh there's a
 
00:59:38.329 --> 00:59:38.339 align:start position:0%
reporting mechanism which has been going
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
on for many many years it's very
 
00:59:39.839 --> 00:59:41.510 align:start position:0%
on for many many years it's very
successful

00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
successful
 
00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:42.109 align:start position:0%
successful
um

00:59:42.109 --> 00:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
and it requires you to make sure you're
 
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
not you know unduly wasting the resource
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
because you know that we we hold the
 
00:59:51.049 --> 00:59:51.059 align:start position:0%
waters in our in our in our drinking in
 
00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
our in our surface waters it's very
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
clear that we hold them in the public
 
00:59:59.870 --> 00:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
trusts it's up to you and up to me to to
 
01:00:02.809 --> 01:00:02.819 align:start position:0%
protect the public trust and so these
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
are public trust resources so there's an
 
01:00:07.609 --> 01:00:07.619 align:start position:0%
I think an inherent requirement that we
 
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
treat them well
 
01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:11.700 align:start position:0%
as well as we can so that's the nature
 
01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:13.380 align:start position:0%
of this particular requirement it makes
 
01:00:15.549 --> 01:00:15.559 align:start position:0%
it clear and it's again it applies to
 
01:00:19.069 --> 01:00:19.079 align:start position:0%
new things coming online
 
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
um and one of the things that's been I
 
01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:22.130 align:start position:0%
um and one of the things that's been I
think

01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:22.140 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:00:24.289 --> 01:00:24.299 align:start position:0%
interesting to hear from the in-stream
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
flow program is that people who you
 
01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:28.940 align:start position:0%
think might not be in favor of it are
 
01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
because it let sets a Level Playing
 
01:00:34.609 --> 01:00:34.619 align:start position:0%
Field for any new people coming into a
 
01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:36.660 align:start position:0%
system withdrawing water the least they
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
have to play by the same rules so this
 
01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:40.740 align:start position:0%
is one of those played by the same rules
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:46.569 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:00:46.569 --> 01:00:46.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
and finally section seven this is where
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
we get to um this is where we get to
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
water quality
 
01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:57.780 align:start position:0%
um 400 class
 
01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:59.329 align:start position:0%
um 400 class
so

01:00:59.329 --> 01:00:59.339 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:59.339 --> 01:01:00.170 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
the statutes 485 A8 sets into statute
 
01:01:07.069 --> 01:01:07.079 align:start position:0%
this requirement for the state to
 
01:01:09.549 --> 01:01:09.559 align:start position:0%
protect water quality under certain
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
using certain numbers and such
 
01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
we also have water quality standards
 
01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:16.740 align:start position:0%
which the other chapter that we were
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
just talking about also makes us uh has
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
us do and and is codified in state rule
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
and approved by the feds as essentially
 
01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:30.829 --> 01:01:30.839 align:start position:0%
back in 2018
 
01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
um there were some folks who were uh not
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
happy about the way EPA was doing
 
01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:38.460 align:start position:0%
certain permitting for wastewater
 
01:01:41.089 --> 01:01:41.099 align:start position:0%
treatment plants and so a couple of
 
01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
Provisions were put into state law one
 
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
of which was about dissolved oxygen and
 
01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:49.980 align:start position:0%
that was removed last session because we
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
identified some unintended consequences
 
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
of doing that provision
 
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
the other one that was put in was this
 
01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:04.609 --> 01:02:04.619 align:start position:0%
we have since discovered that that also
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
caught has some unintended consequences
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to just work through this
 
01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
really quickly
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
um and and try to be careful and with my
 
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
language so that's so it's easy to
 
01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.970 align:start position:0%
language so that's so it's easy to
understand

01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
there's a measurement a statistical
 
01:02:22.210 --> 01:02:22.220 align:start position:0%
measurement called 7q10
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
7q10 is a really simple measurement it's
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
it's simple to say it's a little bit
 
01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
harder to do the statistics on but
 
01:02:32.809 --> 01:02:32.819 align:start position:0%
basically if you look if you take all of
 
01:02:34.970 --> 01:02:34.980 align:start position:0%
the flow information at a particular
 
01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
site over all the years that we've
 
01:02:38.569 --> 01:02:38.579 align:start position:0%
accumulated that flow information so
 
01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:40.740 align:start position:0%
like a USGS gauge
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
and you look at it and you say across
 
01:02:45.289 --> 01:02:45.299 align:start position:0%
all of that time period
 
01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
what's the lowest flow
 
01:02:51.289 --> 01:02:51.299 align:start position:0%
a lowest flow of a whole week so you
 
01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
find the lowest flow of a whole week
 
01:02:55.789 --> 01:02:55.799 align:start position:0%
which week amongst history has had the
 
01:02:57.530 --> 01:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
lowest flow period
 
01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
and then you say what's the likelihood
 
01:03:03.410 --> 01:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
of that happening on a 10-year basis
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
so it's a statistic it's like a one in a
 
01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:07.559 align:start position:0%
hundred year storm this is a what's the
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
likelihood of that really low one week
 
01:03:13.549 --> 01:03:13.559 align:start position:0%
happening seven days happening in the
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
course of a year
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
so it's a statistical measure and the
 
01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
the reason why it's all it does
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
basically is says that's really low it's
 
01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
it's a way of saying boy that's a low
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
flow and and so that's what this is not
 
01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:28.740 align:start position:0%
the lowest of low flows but it's a
 
01:03:30.130 --> 01:03:30.140 align:start position:0%
pretty low flow it happens very
 
01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:32.819 align:start position:0%
occasionally and it happens under
 
01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:34.980 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances so that's what
 
01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:36.660 align:start position:0%
this statistic is
 
01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
when we do effluent Wastewater effluent
 
01:03:41.089 --> 01:03:41.099 align:start position:0%
you have this weight you have your
 
01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
Wastewater Plant it's pumping stuff out
 
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
into the river after it treats it
 
01:03:48.349 --> 01:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
and if it has toxic things in it things
 
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
like copper or aluminum or you know
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
really truly methyl ethyl offals as I
 
01:03:56.930 --> 01:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
like to call them we have numbers which
 
01:03:59.210 --> 01:03:59.220 align:start position:0%
say you can't go below that
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
and they're calculated because there's
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
dilution in the river what's coming out
 
01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
of the plant is you calculate it using
 
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
what would be a low flow period that
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
this would be a this would occur because
 
01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
then those toxics under high flow in the
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
spring who cares there's so much water
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter to the fish but under
 
01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
really low conditions you have this
 
01:04:20.569 --> 01:04:20.579 align:start position:0%
concentration of stuff coming out that
 
01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
could be toxic to fish
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
that's all well and good everybody's
 
01:04:26.089 --> 01:04:26.099 align:start position:0%
agreement yeah that's how you do it
 
01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much standard
 
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
the problem was is that we were EPA was
 
01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:34.460 align:start position:0%
using the same measurement for nutrients
 
01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
nutrients are not toxic
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
not nitrogen and phosphorus are not
 
01:04:42.829 --> 01:04:42.839 align:start position:0%
toxic because all plants need them
 
01:04:44.569 --> 01:04:44.579 align:start position:0%
but at high levels they become
 
01:04:47.089 --> 01:04:47.099 align:start position:0%
problematic as you all are aware aware
 
01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
having the conversations about
 
01:04:51.289 --> 01:04:51.299 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria too much nitrogen too much
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
phosphorus is too much of a good thing
 
01:04:55.849 --> 01:04:55.859 align:start position:0%
this is where I always make the the the
 
01:04:59.089 --> 01:04:59.099 align:start position:0%
the analogy that you're hungry you eat
 
01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
one you eat one hamburger you feel
 
01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
better you eat 10 hamburgers you feel a
 
01:05:05.930 --> 01:05:05.940 align:start position:0%
lot worse so it's that sort of too much
 
01:05:08.329 --> 01:05:08.339 align:start position:0%
of a good thing
 
01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
so as we went through and looked at how
 
01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
permitting was done on nutrients there
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
were some facilities where using a
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
statistic like the 7q10 was advantageous
 
01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:20.700 align:start position:0%
to them
 
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
and some facilities where it was
 
01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
disadvantageous to them and what we
 
01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
learned from that is that different
 
01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:30.540 align:start position:0%
Rivers have different kinds of behavior
 
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
of their flow statistics and it really
 
01:05:34.609 --> 01:05:34.619 align:start position:0%
depends on the geology and the terrain
 
01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:40.609 --> 01:05:40.619 align:start position:0%
so what we did was we worked very
 
01:05:42.589 --> 01:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
closely with the folks who were not
 
01:05:45.890 --> 01:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
happy about how EPA was doing this
 
01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:48.140 align:start position:0%
and we worked with them on the rule set
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
that I sent around that ruled that one
 
01:05:53.569 --> 01:05:53.579 align:start position:0%
page of rules
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
and I'm just going to point your
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
attention to the rule this is 170502 I
 
01:06:02.329 --> 01:06:02.339 align:start position:0%
just sent this around this is a draft
 
01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
so this is where we have in fact
 
01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:12.650 align:start position:0%
so this is where we have in fact
clarified

01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
clarified
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
that there's lots of different methods
 
01:06:18.650 --> 01:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
that can be used other than 7q10 7q10
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
could be one of them again because it
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
could be advantageous for certain
 
01:06:21.599 --> 01:06:23.390 align:start position:0%
could be advantageous for certain
communities

01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:25.859 align:start position:0%
but there are other ways of calculating
 
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
that and that's what's laid out here
 
01:06:32.569 --> 01:06:32.579 align:start position:0%
once this rule goes through and if and
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
this has been reviewed by the Rochester
 
01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:35.460 align:start position:0%
has been reviewed by the various
 
01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
Consultants that have looked at this
 
01:06:38.930 --> 01:06:38.940 align:start position:0%
this has been well vetted and will be
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
well vetted through the rulemaking
 
01:06:40.319 --> 01:06:41.630 align:start position:0%
well vetted through the rulemaking
process

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
once this goes through that it allows
 
01:06:47.809 --> 01:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
EPA to write the permits based on
 
01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
different methodologies
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
but we want to maintain the flexibility
 
01:06:57.289 --> 01:06:57.299 align:start position:0%
to use the 7q10 method of doing that for
 
01:06:59.150 --> 01:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
the communities and places where it
 
01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:01.140 align:start position:0%
makes sense to do so
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
that's what we worked through with
 
01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
Senator gray Senator gray was the
 
01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
engineer of that provision
 
01:07:09.529 --> 01:07:09.539 align:start position:0%
he now understands why this is important
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
for us to now allow for that flexibility
 
01:07:14.569 --> 01:07:14.579 align:start position:0%
and and other people have now been
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
convinced I think
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
um whether you're whether you're a
 
01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
someone who has a permit or you're
 
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
someone who's worried about the water
 
01:07:24.529 --> 01:07:24.539 align:start position:0%
flow Downstream that we have a variety
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
of methods that can be used best to be
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
able to provide communities with the
 
01:07:31.309 --> 01:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
right method to be able to judge their
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
Waters and how much effluently can come
 
01:07:33.599 --> 01:07:35.089 align:start position:0%
Waters and how much effluently can come
out

01:07:35.089 --> 01:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:07:37.849 --> 01:07:37.859 align:start position:0%
that it's it's it's it sounds very
 
01:07:40.609 --> 01:07:40.619 align:start position:0%
complicated at that but really when you
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
look at it
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
it really is a flexibility thing for
 
01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
both the river specific impacts as well
 
01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
as the the individual facilities that
 
01:07:58.670 --> 01:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair uh
 
01:08:04.849 --> 01:08:04.859 align:start position:0%
just a minor uh issue I have with this
 
01:08:06.829 --> 01:08:06.839 align:start position:0%
paragraph but I don't know if it's
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
standard practice of reporting but when
 
01:08:12.289 --> 01:08:12.299 align:start position:0%
you talk about the E coli per 100 ml
 
01:08:12.299 --> 01:08:13.309 align:start position:0%
you talk about the E coli per 100 ml
yeah

01:08:13.309 --> 01:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:08:13.319 --> 01:08:14.089 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:17.809 --> 01:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
it you know it's specifying 47 and it's
 
01:08:21.769 --> 01:08:21.779 align:start position:0%
specifying 88. is should the word cells
 
01:08:25.249 --> 01:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
be inserted there like 47 you know E
 
01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:28.140 align:start position:0%
coli cells per do we report as cells per
 
01:08:33.530 --> 01:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
100 milliliters we record as counts okay
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
the C stands for counts okay sales all
 
01:08:37.199 --> 01:08:41.510 align:start position:0%
the C stands for counts okay sales all
right

01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:44.829 --> 01:08:44.839 align:start position:0%
because I wonder if should uh
 
01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:47.460 align:start position:0%
that's why it basically is just saying
 
01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
that it's based on three samples of a
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
period of 47 uh coli per 100 milliliters
 
01:08:59.150 --> 01:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
so it is counting those per milliliters
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
yep all right so this is the parlance
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
that's generally used in okay
 
01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
they don't mention counts it just assume
 
01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
it's count it is it is the way that the
 
01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
measure is set up okay all right just
 
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
the word count isn't there right and
 
01:09:19.309 --> 01:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
um it's not a big deal I was just
 
01:09:20.329 --> 01:09:20.339 align:start position:0%
wondering if that's yes this is the
 
01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
correct I just want to make sure
 
01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
everybody said this is the current
 
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
status story language this is what's
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
this none of this is new all of this is
 
01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
what exists today okay and those numbers
 
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
in there just while we're on E coli and
 
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
bacteria those are numbers that are come
 
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
from EPA guidance okay because they also
 
01:09:38.329 --> 01:09:38.339 align:start position:0%
talk about out in any one sample unless
 
01:09:41.809 --> 01:09:41.819 align:start position:0%
naturally occurring right so
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
is that specified in rule making what
 
01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
would constitute naturally occurring
 
01:09:49.309 --> 01:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
let's say because if let's say you have
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
animals on the side of a surface water
 
01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
and they're defecating and it's going in
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
I mean that's going to occur naturally
 
01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
with let's say certain types of animals
 
01:10:03.410 --> 01:10:03.420 align:start position:0%
Wildlife that might be there but there
 
01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
may be other animals maybe domestic
 
01:10:07.729 --> 01:10:07.739 align:start position:0%
animals that that's occurring and then
 
01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
would that be considered not naturally
 
01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
occurring yeah we've gone through this a
 
01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
fair bit on various different aspects of
 
01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
this naturally occurring language shows
 
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
up a fair bit in clean water stuff
 
01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
and what we've determined is this sort
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
of if it was a beaver dam and there was
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
nothing Upstream and there was just
 
01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
beavers and their beavers doing their
 
01:10:30.169 --> 01:10:30.179 align:start position:0%
business that
 
01:10:33.709 --> 01:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
that's natural okay but say docks on a
 
01:10:33.719 --> 01:10:34.669 align:start position:0%
that's natural okay but say docks on a
beach

01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
beach
 
01:10:38.209 --> 01:10:38.219 align:start position:0%
if not for the children dropping their
 
01:10:40.450 --> 01:10:40.460 align:start position:0%
Goldfish crackers on the beach all day
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have the proliferation of
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
geese and Ducks there
 
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
we would not really we would not call
 
01:10:49.729 --> 01:10:49.739 align:start position:0%
that natural because it has that human
 
01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
influence on those Wildlife okay and
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
certainly dog walking and other things
 
01:10:59.149 --> 01:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
um you know we've done DNA ribotyping of
 
01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:00.900 align:start position:0%
of E coli
 
01:11:03.410 --> 01:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
and we can you can map that back to the
 
01:11:05.149 --> 01:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
kind of animals that actually produce it
 
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
and I will say that especially in our
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
Urban waterways dog shows up as a pretty
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
significant contributor to E coli in our
 
01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
Waters um just from from domestic pets
 
01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:18.229 align:start position:0%
Waters um just from from domestic pets
okay

01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:11:21.229 --> 01:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
is it okay if I go back um do we just
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
one other question yeah okay
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair um just regarding
 
01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
uh section six the rules for
 
01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
conservation water
 
01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
um I think I understand that that you're
 
01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:40.739 align:start position:0%
saying that you're playing you're
 
01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
applying these rules to the
 
01:11:44.810 --> 01:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
um the surface water that's what this
 
01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
does yes
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
um do you expect a change in the rules
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:56.689 --> 01:11:56.699 align:start position:0%
anything else uh on the general
 
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
representative Lamontagne
 
01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:08.689 align:start position:0%
representative Lamontagne
um

01:12:08.689 --> 01:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:11.570 --> 01:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
so I think the only language we wanted
 
01:12:13.010 --> 01:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
to change
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
was the two times where it says upon
 
01:12:17.930 --> 01:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
written request
 
01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:19.250 align:start position:0%
written request
um

01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
that we shall Grant we're going to add
 
01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
one-time extension
 
01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
or or something it sounds like maybe a
 
01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
30 days or one time or something like
 
01:12:30.649 --> 01:12:30.659 align:start position:0%
that it sounds like I'm gonna say one
 
01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
time of this okay and it says 120 dash
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
time period but we really wanted to say
 
01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
100 a day oops word missing thank you
 
01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
and that's true on both of them yeah and
 
01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
then we'd say comma not to exceed one
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
year in both instances okay I think
 
01:12:54.410 --> 01:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
that's what really it all agreed to let
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
me um Let me let me get that in in on
 
01:12:59.810 --> 01:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
electrons on paper
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
um so to speak and get that back to you
 
01:13:03.169 --> 01:13:03.179 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it sounds like that's
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
what people thought we were going to say
 
01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:18.890 --> 01:13:18.900 align:start position:0%
representative oh so Mr chairman a
 
01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
question of oh one thing um so Mr deers
 
01:13:23.689 --> 01:13:23.699 align:start position:0%
don't forget about the removing the word
 
01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:27.179 align:start position:0%
diversion yes I got that too yes and um
 
01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
so the process going forward so Mr deers
 
01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
is going to make these updated
 
01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:33.490 align:start position:0%
is going to make these updated
Corrections

01:13:33.490 --> 01:13:33.500 align:start position:0%
Corrections
 
01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
oh okay all right all right and if I
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
miss something okay yeah cause it uh
 
01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
right where do we go yeah
 
01:13:45.410 --> 01:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
are you going to be putting together a
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
sample uh Amendment
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
that was that was I think that sounded
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
like a you're going to be putting
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
I would put together some sample
 
01:14:02.090 --> 01:14:02.100 align:start position:0%
language for the committee to consider
 
01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:03.530 align:start position:0%
language for the committee to consider
yes

01:14:03.530 --> 01:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:14:08.270 --> 01:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
and well are you looking at a
 
01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:09.890 align:start position:0%
and well are you looking at a
a

01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:09.900 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
everything after the uh everything after
 
01:14:15.290 --> 01:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
the introductory uh sentence in other
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
words basically a new uh
 
01:14:21.649 --> 01:14:21.659 align:start position:0%
uh an amendment that is basically a
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
complete replacement or you're looking
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
at replacing in there I think it's just
 
01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
a few and there would be the P the
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
pieces that are highlighted okay and so
 
01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
what I will do is I'll do that so you
 
01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
anyone's name the amendment right uh
 
01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
in other words if you put something
 
01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:47.870 align:start position:0%
in other words if you put something
together

01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
you could put whoever well you put my
 
01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
name on it they'll just put our name on
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
okay sounds great thank you very much
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
right right right right
 
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
if I can make a recommendation
 
01:15:11.630 --> 01:15:11.640 align:start position:0%
um it would be great if Mr deers or the
 
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
final language that we agree upon is
 
01:15:17.209 --> 01:15:17.219 align:start position:0%
replaces everything after the enacting
 
01:15:19.010 --> 01:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
Clause because I think there's enough
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
Corrections here that OLS I don't know
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
about anybody else but I've had to go
 
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
back with them for you know a few
 
01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
Corrections on amendments when it's kind
 
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
of a long bill but there's only there's
 
01:15:35.630 --> 01:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
changes throughout it it so it may be
 
01:15:38.689 --> 01:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
easier on them and us if they just do a
 
01:15:40.130 --> 01:15:40.140 align:start position:0%
whole replacement
 
01:15:42.410 --> 01:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
rather than going through an existing
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment or an existing Bill and making
 
01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:51.780 align:start position:0%
I absolutely agree after what happened
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
to me in a bill that I had yeah this
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
year earlier around this year
 
01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.490 align:start position:0%
year earlier around this year
they

01:15:58.490 --> 01:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
OLS had a new system that they were
 
01:16:04.130 --> 01:16:04.140 align:start position:0%
rather than doing the everything after
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
the enacting Clause replacement it was
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
easier for them to just replace
 
01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
individual words and sections
 
01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:17.640 align:start position:0%
try to get try to explain those changes
 
01:16:20.090 --> 01:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
when you're sitting in that seat
 
01:16:24.169 --> 01:16:24.179 align:start position:0%
to a group of people who've never seen
 
01:16:25.729 --> 01:16:25.739 align:start position:0%
the previous
 
01:16:27.410 --> 01:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
bill before
 
01:16:30.649 --> 01:16:30.659 align:start position:0%
it's a disaster so yes you do want to
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
have it
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
a complete replacement eventually
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
eventually maybe not the one that comes
 
01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
in for for us to uh to look at first but
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
the final bill that the final Amendment
 
01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
coming in should be in every a
 
01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
um yes Mr chair I think that would work
 
01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:56.930 align:start position:0%
um yes Mr chair I think that would work
best

01:16:56.930 --> 01:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
best
 
01:16:59.810 --> 01:16:59.820 align:start position:0%
um because we are looking at an Omnibus
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
Bill and just trying to work with the
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
one piece of it and trying to get one
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
one or two pieces amended but where it's
 
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
throughout the bill I think that would
 
01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:09.709 align:start position:0%
throughout the bill I think that would
be

01:17:09.709 --> 01:17:09.719 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
absolutely circumvent the kind of
 
01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:13.910 align:start position:0%
absolutely circumvent the kind of
um

01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:16.669 --> 01:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
roadblocks we could run into great thank
 
01:17:20.450 --> 01:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
you and also looking at looking off out
 
01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:21.649 align:start position:0%
you and also looking at looking off out
also

01:17:21.649 --> 01:17:21.659 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:17:24.490 --> 01:17:24.500 align:start position:0%
person who has to
 
01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill and write the write
 
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
the committee report
 
01:17:33.169 --> 01:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
it's got to have some
 
01:17:36.050 --> 01:17:36.060 align:start position:0%
it's got to have help doing that that's
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
your explanation I mean yeah somebody
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
can go through and listen to what was
 
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
said today sure all of the reasons
 
01:17:47.570 --> 01:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
behind because the reasons are not in
 
01:17:49.010 --> 01:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
the in the bill
 
01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
so would you would you like to would you
 
01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
like me to take a first cut at a blurb
 
01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:55.610 align:start position:0%
like me to take a first cut at a blurb
if

01:17:55.610 --> 01:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:58.729 align:start position:0%
if
absolutely

01:17:58.729 --> 01:17:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
yeah you bet you bet sure sure I think
 
01:18:05.209 --> 01:18:05.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
long are your how long are your uh your
 
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
I want to they finally the the blurbs
 
01:18:20.050 --> 01:18:20.060 align:start position:0%
can be in this case I think the the
 
01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
blurb would be probably a a page page so
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
so we'll just do a quick a little thing
 
01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
on each section each one to get so that
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
people read it and say okay that's
 
01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable why you're doing it yeah why
 
01:18:38.689 --> 01:18:38.699 align:start position:0%
wins and wears right simple term yes so
 
01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
that sure because otherwise
 
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
somebody reads somebody reads the bill
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
they go
 
01:18:47.570 --> 01:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
is that right right it looks like a lot
 
01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
um it looks like a lot yeah but it
 
01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any background to it it
 
01:18:53.450 --> 01:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any explanation to the
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:59.209 --> 01:18:59.219 align:start position:0%
I want to take this opportunity to
 
01:19:01.130 --> 01:19:01.140 align:start position:0%
comment on that
 
01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
um and when we are looking at yes the
 
01:19:04.850 --> 01:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
committee report
 
01:19:07.729 --> 01:19:07.739 align:start position:0%
we want to not only
 
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
um keep it simple but we want to use the
 
01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
same terminology that we've been using
 
01:19:14.209 --> 01:19:14.219 align:start position:0%
right along where we are you know we're
 
01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
blasting science at people and we want
 
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
them to be able to understand it and not
 
01:19:20.209 --> 01:19:20.219 align:start position:0%
feel like we're losing them in the
 
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
technical jargon
 
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
so there's that part of it and then
 
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
there's keeping the facts straight what
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
I've been using with some of the writing
 
01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:30.060 align:start position:0%
that I've been doing is putting it into
 
01:19:32.689 --> 01:19:32.699 align:start position:0%
this online editor app called Hemingway
 
01:19:35.689 --> 01:19:35.699 align:start position:0%
and you can look on the sidebar it's
 
01:19:39.130 --> 01:19:39.140 align:start position:0%
just an app you just you you go to it
 
01:19:41.090 --> 01:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
and you
 
01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
select your text and you plug it into
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
this thing and it'll tell you what grade
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
level and how many
 
01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
passive verbs it doesn't want you to use
 
01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
passive verbs which is really hard to
 
01:19:55.010 --> 01:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
get around in the law but anyway it's
 
01:19:58.250 --> 01:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
very helpful to give you some feedback
 
01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:00.300 align:start position:0%
without finding another person to say
 
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
hey can you understand this
 
01:20:07.209 --> 01:20:07.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:09.290 --> 01:20:09.300 align:start position:0%
we'll be sitting here rules
 
01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:12.169 align:start position:0%
we'll be sitting here rules
classification

01:20:12.169 --> 01:20:12.179 align:start position:0%
classification
 
01:20:15.530 --> 01:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
machine and it'll be a machine so
 
01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
but we want to speak to all of the
 
01:20:19.130 --> 01:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
representatives and we want to tell them
 
01:20:20.930 --> 01:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
what we're doing without making them
 
01:20:22.850 --> 01:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
think that we just sleep in here and
 
01:20:27.050 --> 01:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
crunch up chemical names
 
01:20:31.310 --> 01:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
I will uh I'll do my best uh to uh to to
 
01:20:34.010 --> 01:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
try to capture a uh to try to capture
 
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
that voice in there
 
01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:36.709 align:start position:0%
that voice in there
um

01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
this I do we do do a we do a fair bit of
 
01:20:41.209 --> 01:20:41.219 align:start position:0%
this and I will I will make sure that
 
01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's written in language that
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:48.410 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:20:50.689 --> 01:20:50.699 align:start position:0%
other than that
 
01:20:53.090 --> 01:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
do we think we have to meet again on
 
01:20:56.810 --> 01:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:59.090 --> 01:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
just to exactly who exactly otherwise I
 
01:21:02.290 --> 01:21:02.300 align:start position:0%

yeah obviously yeah yep yep I will turn
 
01:21:08.090 --> 01:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
this right around as quickly as we can
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
this week
 
01:21:11.630 --> 01:21:11.640 align:start position:0%

01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
okay like to open the hearing well
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the

indivisible with liberty Justice for
 
01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:39.790 align:start position:0%
indivisible with liberty Justice for
Allah

01:35:39.790 --> 01:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:45.709 --> 01:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
and Senate Bill 160 and representative
 
01:35:56.810 --> 01:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:01.250 --> 01:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
you get a name and I had identity
 
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chair and members of the
 
01:36:05.390 --> 01:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
01:36:08.270 --> 01:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
Peter O'Neill I'm speaking on behalf of
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
Senator Howard Pearl I am his
 
01:36:11.930 --> 01:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
legislative aide he's currently in
 
01:36:14.390 --> 01:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
Senate Edna so this will be a very brief
 
01:36:16.610 --> 01:36:16.620 align:start position:0%
introduction introduction I won't be
 
01:36:18.010 --> 01:36:18.020 align:start position:0%
able to take questions on this bill
 
01:36:22.250 --> 01:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 160 is relative to the use
 
01:36:24.709 --> 01:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
of ohrvs on designated trails and
 
01:36:26.770 --> 01:36:26.780 align:start position:0%
requiring a permit to operate certain
 
01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
ohrvs from Before Sunrise to after
 
01:36:33.169 --> 01:36:33.179 align:start position:0%
Sunset the bill prohibits the operation
 
01:36:36.530 --> 01:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
of ohrvs for recreational purposes on
 
01:36:38.990 --> 01:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
designated trails and at designated
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
times two things to note about this bill
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
is that it was passed as introduced
 
01:36:46.669 --> 01:36:46.679 align:start position:0%
there weren't any amendments from the
 
01:36:48.890 --> 01:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
Senate and the effective date of the
 
01:36:52.430 --> 01:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
bill would be 60 days after passage like
 
01:36:53.930 --> 01:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
I said unfortunately I won't be able to
 
01:36:55.729 --> 01:36:55.739 align:start position:0%
take any questions and that is the
 
01:36:57.530 --> 01:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
introduction for the bill
 
01:36:57.540 --> 01:37:00.590 align:start position:0%
introduction for the bill
okay

01:37:00.590 --> 01:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I agree no there's
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
no need for questions we will get right
 
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
into the bill
 
01:37:14.810 --> 01:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
representing fishing game looks
 
01:37:26.209 --> 01:37:26.219 align:start position:0%
like seven minutes
 
01:37:29.629 --> 01:37:29.639 align:start position:0%
good morning you could have eight
 
01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
my name is Michael Eastman I'm a captain
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire fishing game a
 
01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
law enforcement Division I am the ohrv
 
01:37:43.970 --> 01:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
coordinator for Enforcement Education
 
01:37:47.450 --> 01:37:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
so this bill is a two-part uh or speaks
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
on two issues that we have heard from
 
01:37:55.729 --> 01:37:55.739 align:start position:0%
our constituents about
 
01:37:58.330 --> 01:37:58.340 align:start position:0%
um that is uh the first being
 
01:38:01.310 --> 01:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
prohibiting uh the use of ohrvs that are
 
01:38:03.770 --> 01:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
registered as street vehicles and what
 
01:38:06.770 --> 01:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
that is uh it speaks to an issue with
 
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
the issuance of a quad recycle plate in
 
01:38:14.570 --> 01:38:14.580 align:start position:0%
the state of Montana so what happens is
 
01:38:18.709 --> 01:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
that individuals can seek out a a
 
01:38:21.709 --> 01:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
attorney's office in Montana which
 
01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
creates a LLC on that LLC then allows
 
01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
them to register their uh UTV as a
 
01:38:33.169 --> 01:38:33.179 align:start position:0%
quadricycle in that state which then uh
 
01:38:35.570 --> 01:38:35.580 align:start position:0%
under a motor vehicle law allows
 
01:38:38.270 --> 01:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
reciprocity between states and then they
 
01:38:41.870 --> 01:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
therefore can operate it on roadways as
 
01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
a motor vehicle so
 
01:38:47.930 --> 01:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
uh it during the summer I had meetings
 
01:38:49.850 --> 01:38:49.860 align:start position:0%
with Department of Motor Vehicle about
 
01:38:52.370 --> 01:38:52.380 align:start position:0%
this issue it was uh constituents were
 
01:38:53.810 --> 01:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
coming to me and saying that this was
 
01:38:56.810 --> 01:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
really putting a black eye on the ohrv
 
01:38:59.090 --> 01:38:59.100 align:start position:0%
community whereas
 
01:39:00.770 --> 01:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
um and the and state law enforcement
 
01:39:04.850 --> 01:39:04.860 align:start position:0%
really had no way to speak to this issue
 
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
um with these vehicles that are titled
 
01:39:09.770 --> 01:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
as off Highway recreation vehicles being
 
01:39:14.209 --> 01:39:14.219 align:start position:0%
operated on roadways so what this
 
01:39:16.669 --> 01:39:16.679 align:start position:0%
portion of the bill would do is it would
 
01:39:20.050 --> 01:39:20.060 align:start position:0%
allow certainly if DMV
 
01:39:22.970 --> 01:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
wants these on the road that would be
 
01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
for them to then come up with some sort
 
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
of legislation to to prohibit that but
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
on our side of fish and game we would uh
 
01:39:33.290 --> 01:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
ask that that they if they are
 
01:39:35.229 --> 01:39:35.239 align:start position:0%
registered for the road then that's fine
 
01:39:37.970 --> 01:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
but that's where their use would be
 
01:39:40.910 --> 01:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
limited to so therefore what this would
 
01:39:42.830 --> 01:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
do is that if they are registered under
 
01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
this Montana plate or or any of
 
01:39:47.930 --> 01:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
registration outside of a special
 
01:39:50.810 --> 01:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
commercial plate which could only be
 
01:39:53.209 --> 01:39:53.219 align:start position:0%
used for agricultural or light
 
01:39:56.510 --> 01:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
Industrial in this state and that plate
 
01:39:58.450 --> 01:39:58.460 align:start position:0%
is issued by Department of Motor Vehicle
 
01:40:01.850 --> 01:40:01.860 align:start position:0%
that it could not be registered if
 
01:40:06.070 --> 01:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
outside of that for recreational use so
 
01:40:08.930 --> 01:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
if they so choose to spend the money get
 
01:40:10.729 --> 01:40:10.739 align:start position:0%
this Montana plate operated on the
 
01:40:12.890 --> 01:40:12.900 align:start position:0%
roadway they could not then use it
 
01:40:14.810 --> 01:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
recreationally on the trails so that
 
01:40:17.330 --> 01:40:17.340 align:start position:0%
would really be that portion of
 
01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
of the bill the second portion is uh the
 
01:40:25.729 --> 01:40:25.739 align:start position:0%
uh expanding our special event permit So
 
01:40:28.129 --> 01:40:28.139 align:start position:0%
currently anyone seeking to have a
 
01:40:30.530 --> 01:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
special event throughout the state uh
 
01:40:32.930 --> 01:40:32.940 align:start position:0%
relative to ohrvs and the usage of
 
01:40:35.229 --> 01:40:35.239 align:start position:0%
unregistered ohrvs
 
01:40:41.090 --> 01:40:41.100 align:start position:0%
on private lands or on public lands it
 
01:40:43.970 --> 01:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
needs to get a an event permit from Fish
 
01:40:45.010 --> 01:40:45.020 align:start position:0%
and Game
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
there's many rules that go along with
 
01:40:50.930 --> 01:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
that there's a a permit for which they
 
01:40:54.050 --> 01:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
have to fill out it's a 45-day Windows a
 
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
fifty dollar fee that goes along with
 
01:40:59.590 --> 01:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
that it's reviewed by myself
 
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
and then really vetted certainly they
 
01:41:04.250 --> 01:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
have to notify the town they have to
 
01:41:07.490 --> 01:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
notify which would in in you know within
 
01:41:09.669 --> 01:41:09.679 align:start position:0%
that notification would be a permission
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
to operate
 
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
um you know under this permit in that
 
01:41:15.649 --> 01:41:15.659 align:start position:0%
town so
 
01:41:15.659 --> 01:41:16.250 align:start position:0%
town so
um

01:41:16.250 --> 01:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:18.350 --> 01:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
they have to do all that I have to to
 
01:41:20.450 --> 01:41:20.460 align:start position:0%
vet all of that and then they are issued
 
01:41:22.189 --> 01:41:22.199 align:start position:0%
a permit like I said it's a 45-day
 
01:41:24.110 --> 01:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
window that goes along with that it's
 
01:41:26.450 --> 01:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
not um you know kind of a couple of guys
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
in the garage figure they want to have
 
01:41:30.410 --> 01:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
an event on Saturday and and then you
 
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
know submit a permit
 
01:41:33.590 --> 01:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
um there really is a lot that goes along
 
01:41:35.570 --> 01:41:35.580 align:start position:0%
with that so
 
01:41:37.370 --> 01:41:37.380 align:start position:0%
um right now the law allows for
 
01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
unregistered vehicles to operate
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
um this would then and this come once
 
01:41:43.790 --> 01:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
again comes from constituents uh asking
 
01:41:47.330 --> 01:41:47.340 align:start position:0%
for different expanding events which
 
01:41:48.649 --> 01:41:48.659 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:41:52.189 --> 01:41:52.199 align:start position:0%
um for uh just
 
01:41:54.890 --> 01:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
usage for what happens a lot of the
 
01:41:57.290 --> 01:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
times they'll say this is going to be a
 
01:41:59.750 --> 01:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
closed course competition and then we
 
01:42:01.310 --> 01:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
would like you know you may have an
 
01:42:04.250 --> 01:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
exhaust that's over 96 decibels and they
 
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
could use it within their time frame of
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
that event
 
01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
um another one is the Warren old home
 
01:42:12.950 --> 01:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
day we get a a lot of uh or actually the
 
01:42:15.290 --> 01:42:15.300 align:start position:0%
folks ask for an event permit to operate
 
01:42:17.870 --> 01:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
during the hours of Darkness so they can
 
01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
go so they can operate their utvs to the
 
01:42:23.090 --> 01:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
uh fireworks
 
01:42:25.490 --> 01:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
um so that's really the the um you know
 
01:42:28.010 --> 01:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
what we're looking to do is expand that
 
01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:29.820 align:start position:0%
um so that they would be actually able
 
01:42:31.250 --> 01:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
to use that
 
01:42:33.770 --> 01:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
um events uh once again
 
01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
um one event where um whether they need
 
01:42:38.810 --> 01:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
to get an event permit is
 
01:42:41.149 --> 01:42:41.159 align:start position:0%
um the gun stock hill climbs or the hill
 
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
climbs during bike week that occur
 
01:42:45.470 --> 01:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
um that would be one event
 
01:42:48.109 --> 01:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
um so and really like I said the town
 
01:42:50.629 --> 01:42:50.639 align:start position:0%
needs to be notified it is vetted
 
01:42:52.430 --> 01:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
through this permit so it's looking to
 
01:42:55.070 --> 01:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
really expand that to help these
 
01:42:56.689 --> 01:42:56.699 align:start position:0%
different clubs
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
um you know with uh bringing these Ohr
 
01:43:11.870 --> 01:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
the other part of the the event permit
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
the expansion that escaped me for a
 
01:43:18.530 --> 01:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
moment was Operation on uh on public
 
01:43:21.770 --> 01:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
Ways by permission of the the town
 
01:43:23.629 --> 01:43:23.639 align:start position:0%
um and we would allowed to do that
 
01:43:25.609 --> 01:43:25.619 align:start position:0%
through notification of the of the town
 
01:43:27.410 --> 01:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
as well so I just wanted to hit on that
 
01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:28.550 align:start position:0%
as well so I just wanted to hit on that
as

01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:43:30.290 --> 01:43:30.300 align:start position:0%
and I'll leave it out
 
01:43:32.629 --> 01:43:32.639 align:start position:0%
that's all I have no good questions uh
 
01:43:35.470 --> 01:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
why don't we uh any uh well first
 
01:43:38.209 --> 01:43:38.219 align:start position:0%
let me break this up because really the
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
bill bill has two
 
01:43:43.090 --> 01:43:43.100 align:start position:0%
uh important
 
01:43:47.209 --> 01:43:47.219 align:start position:0%
issues and want to put the Montana plate
 
01:43:50.169 --> 01:43:50.179 align:start position:0%
issue to bed is uh
 
01:43:54.590 --> 01:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible well there's so any
 
01:43:57.649 --> 01:43:57.659 align:start position:0%
disc is there any questions on the issue
 
01:43:59.570 --> 01:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
with the Montana plates
 
01:43:59.580 --> 01:44:01.250 align:start position:0%
with the Montana plates
they

01:44:01.250 --> 01:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:44:03.649 --> 01:44:03.659 align:start position:0%
representative LaMontagne thank you Mr
 
01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
Tara and thank you for taking my
 
01:44:07.550 --> 01:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
question I just want to clarify to see
 
01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
that I understand it what you're saying
 
01:44:12.410 --> 01:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
if they have the Montana plate
 
01:44:14.810 --> 01:44:14.820 align:start position:0%
they can use it on the road but then
 
01:44:17.930 --> 01:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
they can't use it on the trail
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's correct just not the Montana
 
01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:23.100 align:start position:0%
plate but if any any if they were to
 
01:44:26.090 --> 01:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
receive any registration uh for motor
 
01:44:29.689 --> 01:44:29.699 align:start position:0%
vehicle use on a on a public way except
 
01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:32.639 align:start position:0%
for a special commercial plate then yes
 
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
they could not register as an ohrv
 
01:44:38.090 --> 01:44:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:40.669 --> 01:44:40.679 align:start position:0%
represent representative Darby
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:44:43.250 --> 01:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:44:45.290 --> 01:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
um when when you say
 
01:44:47.450 --> 01:44:47.460 align:start position:0%
um just just to be clear they they
 
01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't use it on uh State
 
01:44:53.930 --> 01:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
um manage Trails or um or
 
01:44:56.209 --> 01:44:56.219 align:start position:0%
would it also somehow restrict them on
 
01:44:58.189 --> 01:44:58.199 align:start position:0%
private trails
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
it would restrict them on both because
 
01:45:01.970 --> 01:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
they would not be able to have an ohrv
 
01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
registration on the vehicle
 
01:45:09.890 --> 01:45:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions just be uh
 
01:45:18.709 --> 01:45:18.719 align:start position:0%
or my edification right now
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
they they can go anywhere
 
01:45:21.719 --> 01:45:23.030 align:start position:0%
they they can go anywhere
on

01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:45:26.830 --> 01:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
our our roads and our trails
 
01:45:31.310 --> 01:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
Montana plates and these are plates by
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
people not just from Montana but people
 
01:45:35.870 --> 01:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
who own these plates they could be
 
01:45:38.990 --> 01:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
actually being New Hampshire residents
 
01:45:41.629 --> 01:45:41.639 align:start position:0%
maybe there's two questions there
 
01:45:43.729 --> 01:45:43.739 align:start position:0%
I could certainly answer both thank you
 
01:45:46.189 --> 01:45:46.199 align:start position:0%
for the question yes uh they right now
 
01:45:48.890 --> 01:45:48.900 align:start position:0%
so what we are hearing is that it's
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
cheaper to get this Montana plate and
 
01:45:53.570 --> 01:45:53.580 align:start position:0%
operate the three miles from their Camp
 
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
to the trailhead than it is to put it on
 
01:45:58.010 --> 01:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
a trailer and take it down there and
 
01:45:59.629 --> 01:45:59.639 align:start position:0%
that's really what it's looking to
 
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
circumvent so
 
01:46:03.410 --> 01:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
um in the in the trail you know if the
 
01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
town does not want their roads open
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
um it's really taking that away from
 
01:46:12.530 --> 01:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
them so yes they they can currently
 
01:46:15.649 --> 01:46:15.659 align:start position:0%
operate with that Montana plate from
 
01:46:17.689 --> 01:46:17.699 align:start position:0%
wherever they come from
 
01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
um with that Montana plate to go down
 
01:46:22.010 --> 01:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
the road to get to the trail or to
 
01:46:24.169 --> 01:46:24.179 align:start position:0%
operate wherever they want on a public
 
01:46:24.179 --> 01:46:26.270 align:start position:0%
operate wherever they want on a public
way

01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:46:28.629 --> 01:46:28.639 align:start position:0%
okay and we're not affecting the Montana
 
01:46:31.129 --> 01:46:31.139 align:start position:0%
plate in any way because that's right
 
01:46:34.189 --> 01:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
that's that would have to be a different
 
01:46:37.669 --> 01:46:37.679 align:start position:0%
law actually with reciprocity I mean we
 
01:46:40.129 --> 01:46:40.139 align:start position:0%
can't drive in mantana
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
that's correct the reciprocity is the
 
01:46:46.669 --> 01:46:46.679 align:start position:0%
real issue it's um it's that this LLC is
 
01:46:49.490 --> 01:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
being created for an individual they get
 
01:46:51.470 --> 01:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
the Montana plate they put it on their
 
01:46:53.209 --> 01:46:53.219 align:start position:0%
UTV which
 
01:46:54.590 --> 01:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
um like I said his title is an off
 
01:46:57.169 --> 01:46:57.179 align:start position:0%
Highway Recreation vehicle and they can
 
01:46:59.209 --> 01:46:59.219 align:start position:0%
under reciprocity operate on the roads
 
01:46:59.219 --> 01:47:00.050 align:start position:0%
under reciprocity operate on the roads
so

01:47:00.050 --> 01:47:00.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
um that to me uh was a Department of
 
01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicle issue and I've had those
 
01:47:05.810 --> 01:47:05.820 align:start position:0%
discussions with them
 
01:47:07.370 --> 01:47:07.380 align:start position:0%
um as of late I'm not sure that there's
 
01:47:10.850 --> 01:47:10.860 align:start position:0%
a resolution to that but as far as you
 
01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
know to help my my constituents and our
 
01:47:14.570 --> 01:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
constituents out there this was really
 
01:47:19.070 --> 01:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:21.890 --> 01:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
01:47:27.229 --> 01:47:27.239 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions on plates okay
 
01:47:29.570 --> 01:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly
 
01:47:31.250 --> 01:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Captain Eastman um just to
 
01:47:32.990 --> 01:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
talk about enforcement for a second so
 
01:47:34.850 --> 01:47:34.860 align:start position:0%
someone We're not gonna be able to stop
 
01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
anybody from having a Montana plate and
 
01:47:40.010 --> 01:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
then going to the trailhead and taking
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
the plate off and and but so I guess the
 
01:47:44.750 --> 01:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
point where he most likely to to catch
 
01:47:46.990 --> 01:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
someone with this is if they had a ohrv
 
01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
registration tag and it played driving
 
01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
down the road so uh or do we have a way
 
01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
to get this out to towns and cities so
 
01:47:58.910 --> 01:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
that they uh are aware to look for dual
 
01:48:00.649 --> 01:48:00.659 align:start position:0%
registration or
 
01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:05.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
we would certainly look to educate
 
01:48:10.370 --> 01:48:10.380 align:start position:0%
um you know the towns you know for for
 
01:48:13.250 --> 01:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
this law um whether you know I I can't
 
01:48:15.169 --> 01:48:15.179 align:start position:0%
really say if the town obviously or that
 
01:48:17.450 --> 01:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement's up to them to to
 
01:48:20.330 --> 01:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
do that um that enforcement
 
01:48:21.649 --> 01:48:21.659 align:start position:0%
um has been an issue with the special
 
01:48:24.290 --> 01:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
commercial plate as far as you know some
 
01:48:26.209 --> 01:48:26.219 align:start position:0%
departments don't know what to do with
 
01:48:27.770 --> 01:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
it so that really would come in
 
01:48:29.149 --> 01:48:29.159 align:start position:0%
education and we're continuing to
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
educate on the special commercial plate
 
01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
but we would certainly look to educate
 
01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:34.070 align:start position:0%
but we would certainly look to educate
everyone

01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
01:48:36.290 --> 01:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
um to speak about the to taking off of
 
01:48:40.010 --> 01:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
the plate uh not uh really the the plate
 
01:48:41.149 --> 01:48:41.159 align:start position:0%
that I see
 
01:48:43.129 --> 01:48:43.139 align:start position:0%
um it's almost more like a sticker than
 
01:48:46.609 --> 01:48:46.619 align:start position:0%
a than a plate so and the ohrv
 
01:48:49.129 --> 01:48:49.139 align:start position:0%
registration says it has to be affixed
 
01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%
to the machine it can't be on a you know
 
01:48:53.330 --> 01:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
a piece of Plexiglas that comes on and
 
01:48:55.669 --> 01:48:55.679 align:start position:0%
off so it would be problematic for
 
01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions on
 
01:49:09.770 --> 01:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
seeing then let's go into the other
 
01:49:15.770 --> 01:49:15.780 align:start position:0%
issue the uh issue on the uh
 
01:49:19.250 --> 01:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
the up the off off Highway recreational
 
01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:30.229 --> 01:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
representative Darby
 
01:49:31.729 --> 01:49:31.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:49:33.470 --> 01:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
my question so this is really a
 
01:49:34.729 --> 01:49:34.739 align:start position:0%
follow-up to my
 
01:49:37.070 --> 01:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
earlier question about
 
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
um about access if I understand the
 
01:49:42.830 --> 01:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
these events um the vehicles don't have
 
01:49:44.689 --> 01:49:44.699 align:start position:0%
to be registered in the state
 
01:49:47.450 --> 01:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
so they could potentially it seems to me
 
01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:49.010 align:start position:0%
so they could potentially it seems to me
have

01:49:49.010 --> 01:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:49:50.890 --> 01:49:50.900 align:start position:0%
um this Montana plate because they don't
 
01:49:52.729 --> 01:49:52.739 align:start position:0%
participate in this event they don't
 
01:49:54.410 --> 01:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
need to be registered in New Hampshire
 
01:49:56.149 --> 01:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
and then they're allowed to go on the
 
01:49:58.910 --> 01:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
roads potentially with exhaust louder
 
01:50:04.910 --> 01:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:07.790 --> 01:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
the so the Montana plate would be I mean
 
01:50:09.890 --> 01:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
certainly there could be a Montana plate
 
01:50:13.010 --> 01:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
in the in the event
 
01:50:13.020 --> 01:50:14.990 align:start position:0%
in the in the event
um

01:50:14.990 --> 01:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:18.290 --> 01:50:18.300 align:start position:0%
but it's really a separate issue
 
01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
um the the event permit
 
01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:22.310 align:start position:0%
um the the event permit
um

01:50:22.310 --> 01:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:24.410 --> 01:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
you know for instance I've seen the
 
01:50:26.810 --> 01:50:26.820 align:start position:0%
Montana plate out on the trail you know
 
01:50:29.209 --> 01:50:29.219 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with a with a ohrv
 
01:50:31.669 --> 01:50:31.679 align:start position:0%
registration the event
 
01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
um really it's excludes the taking out
 
01:50:37.970 --> 01:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
the Montana plate component is really
 
01:50:40.189 --> 01:50:40.199 align:start position:0%
um more like a
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
you know it would be like a a water
 
01:50:46.609 --> 01:50:46.619 align:start position:0%
Cross or like a mud another instance
 
01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
would be like a Jericho during ATV Fest
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
in Berlin that would be an event where
 
01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh you know those ATVs
 
01:50:59.390 --> 01:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
um or our utvs are designed for just you
 
01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
know doing mud events they're not going
 
01:51:03.470 --> 01:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
to be driving down the road or you know
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
to get to the Irving station in Berlin
 
01:51:07.790 --> 01:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
or anything like that it's more
 
01:51:09.290 --> 01:51:09.300 align:start position:0%
um you know they're brought on a trailer
 
01:51:11.930 --> 01:51:11.940 align:start position:0%
for that special event they are not
 
01:51:13.490 --> 01:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
registered they're not ever going to be
 
01:51:16.490 --> 01:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
operated you know on in that capacity on
 
01:51:18.290 --> 01:51:18.300 align:start position:0%
the trail so therefore they need to get
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
an event permit to exclude that
 
01:51:20.159 --> 01:51:21.649 align:start position:0%
an event permit to exclude that
registration

01:51:21.649 --> 01:51:21.659 align:start position:0%
registration
 
01:51:23.570 --> 01:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with that they may also
 
01:51:25.609 --> 01:51:25.619 align:start position:0%
have an exhaust
 
01:51:29.930 --> 01:51:29.940 align:start position:0%
louder than 96 decibels so therefore it
 
01:51:32.570 --> 01:51:32.580 align:start position:0%
it would be allow them to operate with
 
01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
that as well so really the registration
 
01:51:39.410 --> 01:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
um component of it and it's also goes to
 
01:51:40.910 --> 01:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
the snowmobile side of it not that this
 
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
speaks to that but you know for instance
 
01:51:44.450 --> 01:51:44.460 align:start position:0%
we get vintage
 
01:51:46.609 --> 01:51:46.619 align:start position:0%
um on the snowmobile side events where
 
01:51:48.109 --> 01:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
you know someone doesn't want to
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
register their snowmobile as an antique
 
01:51:52.970 --> 01:51:52.980 align:start position:0%
so they they'll get an event permit and
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
be able to operate the trail system you
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
know and it's all and they'll show us a
 
01:51:58.370 --> 01:51:58.380 align:start position:0%
map and things of that nature where
 
01:52:00.050 --> 01:52:00.060 align:start position:0%
they're going to be so if you kind of
 
01:52:02.450 --> 01:52:02.460 align:start position:0%
put that to the ATV side of it it could
 
01:52:05.570 --> 01:52:05.580 align:start position:0%
be an antique ATV event where they you
 
01:52:07.729 --> 01:52:07.739 align:start position:0%
know they just bring in their antique
 
01:52:10.609 --> 01:52:10.619 align:start position:0%
you know the ATV three-wheeler whatever
 
01:52:13.010 --> 01:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
the case may be and and want to do a
 
01:52:14.990 --> 01:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
trail ride and then that's that's the
 
01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.030 align:start position:0%
trail ride and then that's that's the
event

01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
event
 
01:52:21.470 --> 01:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah I think I understand that
 
01:52:27.530 --> 01:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
uh the Montana plates do not all uh
 
01:52:30.970 --> 01:52:30.980 align:start position:0%
allow the the
 
01:52:34.030 --> 01:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
machined on the road
 
01:52:37.850 --> 01:52:37.860 align:start position:0%
in violation of any of our of our uh
 
01:52:39.530 --> 01:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
road laws
 
01:52:41.570 --> 01:52:41.580 align:start position:0%
correct I mean French for instance
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
Montana plate doesn't allow to mean that
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
they can drive on the road on our
 
01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:48.470 align:start position:0%
they can drive on the road on our
highways

01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
highways
 
01:52:52.850 --> 01:52:52.860 align:start position:0%
with the 96. decibel plate or that 90s
 
01:52:55.129 --> 01:52:55.139 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
01:52:58.010 --> 01:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
remember the Montana plate and it can go
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
more than 90s I have more than 96
 
01:53:00.719 --> 01:53:03.109 align:start position:0%
more than 90s I have more than 96
decibels

01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
decibels
 
01:53:05.629 --> 01:53:05.639 align:start position:0%
because that's a that's our road laws
 
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
right so they can't violate the road
 
01:53:09.530 --> 01:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
loss they would have to adhere to the
 
01:53:12.169 --> 01:53:12.179 align:start position:0%
road laws that's correct yes once it's
 
01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0%
once it's operating on the roadway as a
 
01:53:16.189 --> 01:53:16.199 align:start position:0%
as a motor vehicle it would have to
 
01:53:22.010 --> 01:53:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:22.020 --> 01:53:23.390 align:start position:0%
 
huh

01:53:23.390 --> 01:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
huh
 
01:53:25.729 --> 01:53:25.739 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly
 
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so I just think it's
 
01:53:30.010 --> 01:53:30.020 align:start position:0%
important to reiterate um
 
01:53:34.010 --> 01:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
that Japanese have you seen a a large
 
01:53:36.169 --> 01:53:36.179 align:start position:0%
number of these Montana plates
 
01:53:37.850 --> 01:53:37.860 align:start position:0%
um at this point in time or is this more
 
01:53:40.609 --> 01:53:40.619 align:start position:0%
because we're starting to see this
 
01:53:42.109 --> 01:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
activity now or we're starting to see
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
this Behavior now and we're trying to
 
01:53:46.970 --> 01:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
get ahead of ahead of a wave or a
 
01:53:50.149 --> 01:53:50.159 align:start position:0%
growing issue
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
so it's definitely growing
 
01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
um the the first year uh I received
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
information that there was a group that
 
01:54:03.410 --> 01:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
had traveled from Montana and were
 
01:54:05.570 --> 01:54:05.580 align:start position:0%
actually stopped um and I believe it was
 
01:54:07.550 --> 01:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
just outside of Colebrook
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
um by state trooper that saw these
 
01:54:13.609 --> 01:54:13.619 align:start position:0%
vehicles that were on a portion of
 
01:54:16.910 --> 01:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
roadway that was not open to ATV use and
 
01:54:18.350 --> 01:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where we saw this Montana
 
01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
plate and things started to
 
01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
um where we first saw it I guess is the
 
01:54:25.850 --> 01:54:25.860 align:start position:0%
best way to put it last year I started
 
01:54:28.010 --> 01:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
having the groups from you know some of
 
01:54:29.930 --> 01:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
the some of the towns up north saying
 
01:54:31.970 --> 01:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
hey we're seeing more and more of this
 
01:54:33.709 --> 01:54:33.719 align:start position:0%
um you know we're getting calls from
 
01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
people saying why is this UTV operating
 
01:54:38.629 --> 01:54:38.639 align:start position:0%
on a piece of roadway we haven't opened
 
01:54:40.490 --> 01:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
it's on a state way they're not supposed
 
01:54:42.890 --> 01:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
to be there and come to find out they're
 
01:54:44.750 --> 01:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
operating under the Montana plate so
 
01:54:47.330 --> 01:54:47.340 align:start position:0%
this is definitely a growing issue
 
01:54:48.770 --> 01:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
um like I said all you have to do is go
 
01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:50.030 align:start position:0%
um like I said all you have to do is go
online

01:54:50.030 --> 01:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
online
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
um and register and register yourself or
 
01:54:55.250 --> 01:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
get this LLC you pay your thousand
 
01:54:57.050 --> 01:54:57.060 align:start position:0%
dollars or whatever it is and then
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
you're able to go and register this so
 
01:55:01.810 --> 01:55:01.820 align:start position:0%
certainly like I said it's it's it's
 
01:55:04.609 --> 01:55:04.619 align:start position:0%
I've seen one operating right here in in
 
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
Main Street
 
01:55:07.250 --> 01:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
um in Concord and there's really nothing
 
01:55:09.169 --> 01:55:09.179 align:start position:0%
you can do about it
 
01:55:12.229 --> 01:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
um it's but yeah I think next year if
 
01:55:13.970 --> 01:55:13.980 align:start position:0%
this doesn't pass we're gonna definitely
 
01:55:18.850 --> 01:55:18.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:20.990 --> 01:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up
 
01:55:23.689 --> 01:55:23.699 align:start position:0%
yeah so just to read so right now we're
 
01:55:25.790 --> 01:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
seeing just isolated incidents but we
 
01:55:27.290 --> 01:55:27.300 align:start position:0%
are seeing growing Behavior so we're
 
01:55:29.450 --> 01:55:29.460 align:start position:0%
trying to get ahead of ahead of the the
 
01:55:31.129 --> 01:55:31.139 align:start position:0%
growing issue
 
01:55:35.629 --> 01:55:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:55:39.050 --> 01:55:39.060 align:start position:0%
representative power is there someone
 
01:55:41.510 --> 01:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
else also
 
01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:42.890 align:start position:0%
else also
okay

01:55:42.890 --> 01:55:42.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
Captain for taking my question I read
 
01:55:48.590 --> 01:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
your testimony before the Senate and I
 
01:55:51.109 --> 01:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
have some concerns about the waiver of
 
01:55:53.810 --> 01:55:53.820 align:start position:0%
the 96 decibels can you speak to that
 
01:55:55.970 --> 01:55:55.980 align:start position:0%
noise amount
 
01:55:57.470 --> 01:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
um and what the position of the
 
01:56:03.050 --> 01:56:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:06.649 --> 01:56:06.659 align:start position:0%
really uh so 96 decibels is the is the
 
01:56:10.609 --> 01:56:10.619 align:start position:0%
maximum decibel for a standard
 
01:56:10.619 --> 01:56:11.530 align:start position:0%
maximum decibel for a standard
um

01:56:11.530 --> 01:56:11.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:17.689 --> 01:56:17.699 align:start position:0%
ohrv exhaust to noise for to emit noise
 
01:56:22.030 --> 01:56:22.040 align:start position:0%
while in operation in the state so
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
really what we were finding is that you
 
01:56:27.169 --> 01:56:27.179 align:start position:0%
know folks were coming in and saying I
 
01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
wanna I wanna apply for this
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
permit which is going to allow me to
 
01:56:34.729 --> 01:56:34.739 align:start position:0%
operate unregistered and oh just because
 
01:56:36.530 --> 01:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
I'm an honest person
 
01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
probably this is like a 100 decibels
 
01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's you know so can I get a waiver for
 
01:56:44.689 --> 01:56:44.699 align:start position:0%
that and we would say no you we can't
 
01:56:46.850 --> 01:56:46.860 align:start position:0%
because it only says in the law
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
unregistered we can't give you a waiver
 
01:56:51.410 --> 01:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
for other things within the law
 
01:56:53.689 --> 01:56:53.699 align:start position:0%
um so really that's what we're looking
 
01:56:55.970 --> 01:56:55.980 align:start position:0%
that that's the instance that we were
 
01:56:57.229 --> 01:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
finding is that people were coming in
 
01:56:59.390 --> 01:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
and just being honest if they just came
 
01:57:00.890 --> 01:57:00.900 align:start position:0%
in and said I want to be unregistered
 
01:57:03.470 --> 01:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
they'd still be out there operating over
 
01:57:05.570 --> 01:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
96 decibels
 
01:57:07.370 --> 01:57:07.380 align:start position:0%
um you know at an event
 
01:57:08.990 --> 01:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
um certainly if if they're operating on
 
01:57:11.390 --> 01:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
a trail as a recreational vehicle and
 
01:57:14.689 --> 01:57:14.699 align:start position:0%
you know and it's been modified or a lot
 
01:57:16.850 --> 01:57:16.860 align:start position:0%
of the 96 we would certainly you know
 
01:57:19.370 --> 01:57:19.380 align:start position:0%
take enforcement action on that but this
 
01:57:20.930 --> 01:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
is really you know people were being
 
01:57:23.209 --> 01:57:23.219 align:start position:0%
honest and and so that
 
01:57:25.790 --> 01:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
they can continue to be honest we would
 
01:57:29.870 --> 01:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:32.229 --> 01:57:32.239 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:57:34.430 --> 01:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
representative veiled and represent then
 
01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:38.330 align:start position:0%
representative veiled and represent then
representative

01:57:38.330 --> 01:57:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:39.770 --> 01:57:39.780 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair representative
 
01:57:41.390 --> 01:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
harb asked the question I was going to
 
01:57:48.109 --> 01:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh how does uh ohrv if it has the
 
01:57:54.770 --> 01:57:54.780 align:start position:0%
hundred decibels or higher
 
01:57:58.189 --> 01:57:58.199 align:start position:0%
go back to 96 when they're just having
 
01:58:03.290 --> 01:58:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:03.300 --> 01:58:05.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:58:05.030 --> 01:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:07.370 --> 01:58:07.380 align:start position:0%
it's a couple it all depends on the ohrv
 
01:58:11.689 --> 01:58:11.699 align:start position:0%
I guess some easier than others with
 
01:58:14.209 --> 01:58:14.219 align:start position:0%
with dirt bikes for instance there's
 
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
spark arrested requirements um if they
 
01:58:20.450 --> 01:58:20.460 align:start position:0%
remove spark arrestors which
 
01:58:22.970 --> 01:58:22.980 align:start position:0%
gives some sort of more RPMs or
 
01:58:24.530 --> 01:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
something like that I can't really speak
 
01:58:27.229 --> 01:58:27.239 align:start position:0%
to it but there is a reasoning behind it
 
01:58:27.239 --> 01:58:28.129 align:start position:0%
to it but there is a reasoning behind it
um

01:58:28.129 --> 01:58:28.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:30.169 --> 01:58:30.179 align:start position:0%
removing that would make the the machine
 
01:58:32.750 --> 01:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
louder so that's an instance where they
 
01:58:35.810 --> 01:58:35.820 align:start position:0%
could remove that operate in this permit
 
01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
and then put it back on again we haven't
 
01:58:42.410 --> 01:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
seen in the ohrv realm where there's
 
01:58:44.810 --> 01:58:44.820 align:start position:0%
interchangeable exhausts certainly they
 
01:58:46.609 --> 01:58:46.619 align:start position:0%
can you know remove them and it is
 
01:58:48.169 --> 01:58:48.179 align:start position:0%
illegal to have a closed competition
 
01:58:50.810 --> 01:58:50.820 align:start position:0%
exhaust which is used for closed
 
01:58:50.820 --> 01:58:52.430 align:start position:0%
exhaust which is used for closed
competition

01:58:52.430 --> 01:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
competition
 
01:58:54.890 --> 01:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
um in the state period and we're not
 
01:58:56.750 --> 01:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
looking to change that at all here or
 
01:58:59.390 --> 01:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
give an exemption for that because it is
 
01:59:01.250 --> 01:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
very very loud
 
01:59:01.260 --> 01:59:02.330 align:start position:0%
very very loud
um

01:59:02.330 --> 01:59:02.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
in the snow machine world there's
 
01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:05.689 align:start position:0%
in the snow machine world there's
definitely

01:59:05.689 --> 01:59:05.699 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
01:59:08.030 --> 01:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
um ways to where
 
01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
um they've modified exhaust where
 
01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
um all you have to do is pull two pins
 
01:59:15.770 --> 01:59:15.780 align:start position:0%
on the exhaust and and your Trail
 
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
exhaust comes right out you put in your
 
01:59:21.290 --> 01:59:21.300 align:start position:0%
little soda can exhaust that gives you a
 
01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
few more RPM and and you're good to go
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
and and I've seen that in the field
 
01:59:25.679 --> 01:59:27.050 align:start position:0%
and and I've seen that in the field
where

01:59:27.050 --> 01:59:27.060 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
um you know where people will say oh
 
01:59:30.890 --> 01:59:30.900 align:start position:0%
yeah I didn't I forgot to put in my
 
01:59:32.570 --> 01:59:32.580 align:start position:0%
trail exhaust that type of thing and
 
01:59:34.129 --> 01:59:34.139 align:start position:0%
then they get a ticket for operating
 
01:59:36.410 --> 01:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
with a loud machine so I haven't seen
 
01:59:38.209 --> 01:59:38.219 align:start position:0%
that in the ohrv world it certainly
 
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
exists in the snow machine world I mean
 
01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's probably only a matter of time
 
01:59:44.450 --> 01:59:44.460 align:start position:0%
before that that is you know comes down
 
01:59:47.450 --> 01:59:47.460 align:start position:0%
the pike but um you know really once
 
01:59:50.390 --> 01:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
again this is this is just looking at
 
01:59:54.050 --> 01:59:54.060 align:start position:0%
I'm not looking to expand 96 decibels on
 
01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
the trails or anything of that nature
 
01:59:58.729 --> 01:59:58.739 align:start position:0%
um you know or or any trails that are on
 
02:00:01.609 --> 02:00:01.619 align:start position:0%
in in the towns that are open to ohrv
 
02:00:04.370 --> 02:00:04.380 align:start position:0%
use this is really for those closed
 
02:00:07.850 --> 02:00:07.860 align:start position:0%
competitions uh or closed events
 
02:00:11.330 --> 02:00:11.340 align:start position:0%
um and and and for the town to say in
 
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
that notification process no we don't
 
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
want anything louder than 96 which would
 
02:00:18.770 --> 02:00:18.780 align:start position:0%
be completely fine so if they said that
 
02:00:20.709 --> 02:00:20.719 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't issue them a permit for it
 
02:00:20.719 --> 02:00:22.750 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't issue them a permit for it
so

02:00:22.750 --> 02:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:25.609 --> 02:00:25.619 align:start position:0%
I I guess if that's a kind of rambled on
 
02:00:27.229 --> 02:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
but I hope that that answers the
 
02:00:32.089 --> 02:00:32.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:36.830 --> 02:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:38.750 --> 02:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
just a small clarifying question thank
 
02:00:40.490 --> 02:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
02:00:44.390 --> 02:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's just for events so if um these
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
events come into town they are louder
 
02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
usually than 96. this isn't for making
 
02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:52.189 align:start position:0%
usually than 96. this isn't for making
all

02:00:52.189 --> 02:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:00:55.609 --> 02:00:55.619 align:start position:0%
any h-o-r-v
 
02:00:58.430 --> 02:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
this is just for them to participate in
 
02:01:02.089 --> 02:01:02.099 align:start position:0%
the event or in the competition for that
 
02:01:02.099 --> 02:01:04.129 align:start position:0%
the event or in the competition for that
one-time

02:01:04.129 --> 02:01:04.139 align:start position:0%
one-time
 
02:01:04.139 --> 02:01:05.450 align:start position:0%
one-time
um

02:01:05.450 --> 02:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:05.460 --> 02:01:07.310 align:start position:0%
um
event

02:01:07.310 --> 02:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
event
 
02:01:08.990 --> 02:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
that's correct we're not looking to
 
02:01:11.450 --> 02:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
expand any decibel levels or any of that
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
nature when when someone comes to us
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
with an event permit whether snowmobile
 
02:01:19.070 --> 02:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
ohrv that they have to go through that
 
02:01:21.770 --> 02:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
complete notification process of the the
 
02:01:24.709 --> 02:01:24.719 align:start position:0%
town law enforcement whomever else the
 
02:01:27.169 --> 02:01:27.179 align:start position:0%
butters that they need to contact
 
02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
um you know I use the example of the the
 
02:01:32.510 --> 02:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
hill climbs for bike week it only occurs
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
on bike week it's in gun stock and
 
02:01:36.890 --> 02:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
certainly there are different events but
 
02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's I think that's the best example
 
02:01:44.330 --> 02:01:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative LaMontagne thank you
 
02:01:50.030 --> 02:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:51.890 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
um

02:01:51.890 --> 02:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:54.649 --> 02:01:54.659 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand so these
 
02:01:57.530 --> 02:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
were the events they're most likely to
 
02:02:00.229 --> 02:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
be unregistered because they wouldn't
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
normally pass registration for use in
 
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
the trails because they're louder and
 
02:02:07.310 --> 02:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
they pollute more
 
02:02:09.229 --> 02:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
is that correct I mean that's why the
 
02:02:12.169 --> 02:02:12.179 align:start position:0%
language is in here to allow the use
 
02:02:14.709 --> 02:02:14.719 align:start position:0%
of unregistered
 
02:02:19.850 --> 02:02:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:23.629 --> 02:02:23.639 align:start position:0%
I not necessarily because they're
 
02:02:27.530 --> 02:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
by Design to pollute more or to be
 
02:02:30.169 --> 02:02:30.179 align:start position:0%
louder that's that's kind of a only one
 
02:02:32.689 --> 02:02:32.699 align:start position:0%
of many instances where somebody wants
 
02:02:34.570 --> 02:02:34.580 align:start position:0%
an event permit
 
02:02:37.729 --> 02:02:37.739 align:start position:0%
some of these
 
02:02:40.310 --> 02:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
once again I'll use the the hill climbs
 
02:02:41.589 --> 02:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
for gun stock
 
02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
some of these machines they are not they
 
02:02:46.490 --> 02:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
these people these folks don't would
 
02:02:48.050 --> 02:02:48.060 align:start position:0%
never want to operate them on a trail
 
02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:50.639 align:start position:0%
that they these are specific
 
02:02:52.850 --> 02:02:52.860 align:start position:0%
you know machines for this specific
 
02:02:52.860 --> 02:02:54.410 align:start position:0%
you know machines for this specific
event

02:02:54.410 --> 02:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
event
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
um you know in the instance of the
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
snowmobile side of it where they have an
 
02:02:57.599 --> 02:02:58.910 align:start position:0%
snowmobile side of it where they have an
antique

02:02:58.910 --> 02:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
antique
 
02:03:03.490 --> 02:03:03.500 align:start position:0%
um trail ride this is where they they
 
02:03:05.629 --> 02:03:05.639 align:start position:0%
they've really kind of cleaned up this
 
02:03:07.370 --> 02:03:07.380 align:start position:0%
machine and it's there it's a vintage
 
02:03:10.790 --> 02:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
machine and and they they have no desire
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
to kind of pound it across the trail
 
02:03:15.709 --> 02:03:15.719 align:start position:0%
every weekend they just want to kind of
 
02:03:17.930 --> 02:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
bring up these events it's like a
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
it would kind of be likened to uh a
 
02:03:23.570 --> 02:03:23.580 align:start position:0%
classic car event where you know at some
 
02:03:25.250 --> 02:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
of these they they they're not going to
 
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
drive them you know back and forth to
 
02:03:29.030 --> 02:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
work every day they they want to polish
 
02:03:31.070 --> 02:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
them up and show them off and and go for
 
02:03:32.689 --> 02:03:32.699 align:start position:0%
a little ride and that that's about it
 
02:03:35.530 --> 02:03:35.540 align:start position:0%
in the instance of the hill climbs
 
02:03:37.729 --> 02:03:37.739 align:start position:0%
these bikes they don't look like
 
02:03:40.010 --> 02:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
anything out there on the trail that we
 
02:03:41.750 --> 02:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
would see they're they're made for going
 
02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:45.060 align:start position:0%
up a mountain so
 
02:03:47.810 --> 02:03:47.820 align:start position:0%
I have a follow-up question
 
02:03:51.410 --> 02:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
but these events will be held on trails
 
02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
and possibly
 
02:03:55.370 --> 02:03:55.380 align:start position:0%
public roadways
 
02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
designated during the event that's what
 
02:03:59.750 --> 02:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
it looks like
 
02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
this is saying
 
02:04:05.689 --> 02:04:05.699 align:start position:0%
um I mean where would these events be
 
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
held if not on Trails or
 
02:04:12.830 --> 02:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:15.350 --> 02:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
that would really be up to the I mean
 
02:04:17.089 --> 02:04:17.099 align:start position:0%
the event planner
 
02:04:18.709 --> 02:04:18.719 align:start position:0%
um would come to us with the event
 
02:04:21.410 --> 02:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
permit and say Obviously with prior to
 
02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
getting notification to the town law
 
02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:25.310 align:start position:0%
getting notification to the town law
enforcement

02:04:25.310 --> 02:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
02:04:27.169 --> 02:04:27.179 align:start position:0%
um and you know for instance let's say
 
02:04:29.089 --> 02:04:29.099 align:start position:0%
that the city of Concord wanted to have
 
02:04:32.589 --> 02:04:32.599 align:start position:0%
a UTV parade on Main Street on Saturday
 
02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
in July they would then the town would
 
02:04:38.990 --> 02:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
say that that's okay we're gonna you
 
02:04:40.550 --> 02:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
know we're gonna take we're gonna allow
 
02:04:43.010 --> 02:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
that to happen they would have to take
 
02:04:45.109 --> 02:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
all those steps or you know to make sure
 
02:04:47.209 --> 02:04:47.219 align:start position:0%
it happened and then they would have to
 
02:04:48.890 --> 02:04:48.900 align:start position:0%
come to us and say we're going to have
 
02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
these this event on this road so
 
02:04:54.470 --> 02:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
um you know that that would be a
 
02:04:55.850 --> 02:04:55.860 align:start position:0%
possibility and that's why the public
 
02:04:58.310 --> 02:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
way is in there you know if it and let's
 
02:05:00.770 --> 02:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
you know it could be any Town saying yes
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
this could this could occur but it
 
02:05:05.390 --> 02:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
really it's not just them coming to me
 
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:06.719 align:start position:0%
and asking for permission there's
 
02:05:08.810 --> 02:05:08.820 align:start position:0%
there's really they need to notify and
 
02:05:10.790 --> 02:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
and the permissions would start with
 
02:05:19.330 --> 02:05:19.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:24.530 --> 02:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um thank you Captain
 
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
Eastman I'm trying to um just get a
 
02:05:33.530 --> 02:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
idea about how many of these events
 
02:05:36.109 --> 02:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
You're Expecting like just for this year
 
02:05:37.729 --> 02:05:37.739 align:start position:0%
so when you're we're talking about
 
02:05:40.070 --> 02:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
waving for events how many events are we
 
02:05:47.570 --> 02:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:49.430 --> 02:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
I thought I had the number of events
 
02:05:52.189 --> 02:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
here and I don't see that I do
 
02:05:55.310 --> 02:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
we do currently with snowmobile no HRV
 
02:05:56.990 --> 02:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
it's less than
 
02:06:00.129 --> 02:06:00.139 align:start position:0%
70 events a year
 
02:06:04.609 --> 02:06:04.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
it really depends upon especially the
 
02:06:07.729 --> 02:06:07.739 align:start position:0%
the winter events the snow machine
 
02:06:11.450 --> 02:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
events on weather some of these events
 
02:06:12.709 --> 02:06:12.719 align:start position:0%
especially in the last couple years
 
02:06:14.450 --> 02:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
they'll certainly put an event permit
 
02:06:16.970 --> 02:06:16.980 align:start position:0%
but they don't even occur because of ice
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
conditions aren't you know adequate or
 
02:06:21.770 --> 02:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
or whatever the case may be I could even
 
02:06:25.070 --> 02:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
see where you know there was excessive
 
02:06:27.470 --> 02:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
rain and and you know an event gets shut
 
02:06:30.229 --> 02:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
down on the ohrv side of things
 
02:06:32.870 --> 02:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
um you know so
 
02:06:35.689 --> 02:06:35.699 align:start position:0%
it's not thousands by any means it's
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
it's and I don't foresee that that
 
02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:41.030 align:start position:0%
it's and I don't foresee that that
happening

02:06:41.030 --> 02:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly and representative
 
02:06:42.960 --> 02:06:44.810 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly and representative
Gould

02:06:44.810 --> 02:06:44.820 align:start position:0%
Gould
 
02:06:46.669 --> 02:06:46.679 align:start position:0%
representative Vale asked my first half
 
02:06:48.770 --> 02:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
of my questions the second half is is do
 
02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
you know how many so these are recur
 
02:06:52.070 --> 02:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
these permits are good for 12 months
 
02:06:54.050 --> 02:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
like some of them are recurring events
 
02:06:55.850 --> 02:06:55.860 align:start position:0%
how many do you know how many of these
 
02:06:58.370 --> 02:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
are recurring like what happened in 2021
 
02:07:01.189 --> 02:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
also applied in 2022 versus new permit
 
02:07:02.689 --> 02:07:02.699 align:start position:0%
applications in 2022 because I'm
 
02:07:04.669 --> 02:07:04.679 align:start position:0%
guessing that for your department the
 
02:07:07.070 --> 02:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
the recurring applications are easier to
 
02:07:08.450 --> 02:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
deal with than the new set of
 
02:07:09.589 --> 02:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
applications I'm just wondering if you
 
02:07:12.050 --> 02:07:12.060 align:start position:0%
know how many like the growing you know
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:20.089 --> 02:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
we're not seeing a lot of growth it is a
 
02:07:21.709 --> 02:07:21.719 align:start position:0%
lot of the same
 
02:07:22.669 --> 02:07:22.679 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
02:07:25.850 --> 02:07:25.860 align:start position:0%
berry pond has in moultonborough uh
 
02:07:28.129 --> 02:07:28.139 align:start position:0%
Milford three ponds they always have
 
02:07:28.139 --> 02:07:29.330 align:start position:0%
Milford three ponds they always have
events

02:07:29.330 --> 02:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
events
 
02:07:32.810 --> 02:07:32.820 align:start position:0%
um and there's events all over the state
 
02:07:35.629 --> 02:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
problematic events they don't stay
 
02:07:37.310 --> 02:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
around very long
 
02:07:40.609 --> 02:07:40.619 align:start position:0%
um like there was one in Derry where a
 
02:07:43.129 --> 02:07:43.139 align:start position:0%
gentlemen wanted to have a almost a
 
02:07:47.149 --> 02:07:47.159 align:start position:0%
private event on on the pond and it it
 
02:07:49.250 --> 02:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement had an issue with
 
02:07:51.290 --> 02:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
parking and things of that nature so it
 
02:07:54.350 --> 02:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
it petered out very very quickly I don't
 
02:07:56.930 --> 02:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
I don't foresee a lot of growth in this
 
02:07:59.930 --> 02:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
it's just you know certainly the folks
 
02:08:02.450 --> 02:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
in Warren that want to operate you know
 
02:08:04.729 --> 02:08:04.739 align:start position:0%
after hours to go see the fireworks that
 
02:08:06.609 --> 02:08:06.619 align:start position:0%
would certainly be growth in an event
 
02:08:11.390 --> 02:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
this permit it's July 1 to June 30th and
 
02:08:15.709 --> 02:08:15.719 align:start position:0%
they pay 50 they list the dates and you
 
02:08:15.719 --> 02:08:16.490 align:start position:0%
they pay 50 they list the dates and you
know

02:08:16.490 --> 02:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:08:18.350 --> 02:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
they could say well if it rains this
 
02:08:19.729 --> 02:08:19.739 align:start position:0%
weekend we're going to have it on us all
 
02:08:20.810 --> 02:08:20.820 align:start position:0%
in a date
 
02:08:23.149 --> 02:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
so it's not like every weekend or
 
02:08:25.189 --> 02:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
anything of that nature
 
02:08:28.370 --> 02:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Gould
 
02:08:30.770 --> 02:08:30.780 align:start position:0%
okay well sort of in relation to these
 
02:08:32.570 --> 02:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
questions uh
 
02:08:35.330 --> 02:08:35.340 align:start position:0%
the events that are being held are they
 
02:08:40.970 --> 02:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
so the com the only one that I can think
 
02:08:45.169 --> 02:08:45.179 align:start position:0%
of that had a complaint um was the one
 
02:08:48.530 --> 02:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
in Dairy and what the issue was there is
 
02:08:51.229 --> 02:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
this that was a snow machine event
 
02:08:53.750 --> 02:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
um it was Big Island Pond it would spend
 
02:08:56.990 --> 02:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
three years two three years ago now and
 
02:08:59.689 --> 02:08:59.699 align:start position:0%
what happened was is that
 
02:08:59.699 --> 02:09:00.430 align:start position:0%
what happened was is that
um

02:09:00.430 --> 02:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:03.589 --> 02:09:03.599 align:start position:0%
they the individual had submitted a
 
02:09:04.970 --> 02:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
permit well the year before he didn't
 
02:09:06.709 --> 02:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
have a permit
 
02:09:08.810 --> 02:09:08.820 align:start position:0%
um so then we had an officer go down and
 
02:09:10.490 --> 02:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
issue him a ticket for not having an
 
02:09:12.410 --> 02:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
event permit he then went through the
 
02:09:14.750 --> 02:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
event permit process lied on the event
 
02:09:17.209 --> 02:09:17.219 align:start position:0%
permit Dairy Police Department called
 
02:09:19.010 --> 02:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
and said hey why did you get this guy a
 
02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
permit and then we had to go to him and
 
02:09:23.930 --> 02:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
say listen you signed this under unsworn
 
02:09:26.149 --> 02:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
falsification saying that you had
 
02:09:28.609 --> 02:09:28.619 align:start position:0%
notified all of these people that didn't
 
02:09:33.530 --> 02:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
occur the permit was withdrawn and
 
02:09:37.129 --> 02:09:37.139 align:start position:0%
the event did not occur so that's an
 
02:09:40.070 --> 02:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
instance where you know we we had to go
 
02:09:41.870 --> 02:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
back and and certainly vet some of this
 
02:09:44.450 --> 02:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
stuff and and then you know remove the
 
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
permit so but that's the only instance
 
02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
where I've had you know I've never had a
 
02:09:50.510 --> 02:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
complaint from
 
02:09:52.430 --> 02:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
you know Guilford residents about gun
 
02:09:55.430 --> 02:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
stock kill climbs I've I've not had that
 
02:09:57.050 --> 02:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
you know generally
 
02:09:59.330 --> 02:09:59.340 align:start position:0%
um you know it like back Lake
 
02:10:01.729 --> 02:10:01.739 align:start position:0%
um has had a couple of events in
 
02:10:04.129 --> 02:10:04.139 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh and we don't get complaints
 
02:10:06.229 --> 02:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
about that the complaint I will take
 
02:10:09.410 --> 02:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
that back the the and sorry it's a lot
 
02:10:11.030 --> 02:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
more of the snow machine side than it is
 
02:10:14.149 --> 02:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
the the ATV Side at this point
 
02:10:14.159 --> 02:10:15.589 align:start position:0%
the the ATV Side at this point
um

02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:19.790 --> 02:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
the the only complaint was on the back
 
02:10:22.609 --> 02:10:22.619 align:start position:0%
leg in Pittsburgh was that the
 
02:10:26.450 --> 02:10:26.460 align:start position:0%
individual had plowed a road which in
 
02:10:28.790 --> 02:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
the area where the trail comes where the
 
02:10:31.370 --> 02:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
Legal Trail comes out onto the lake and
 
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
that that the complaint was that could
 
02:10:36.830 --> 02:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
have caused a potential uh issue with
 
02:10:39.530 --> 02:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
nighttime operation so
 
02:10:42.229 --> 02:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
what we did is that in the future events
 
02:10:44.209 --> 02:10:44.219 align:start position:0%
we said you can have this permit but
 
02:10:45.890 --> 02:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
there will be no plowing so if you're
 
02:10:48.229 --> 02:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
going to have a you know a you know
 
02:10:49.970 --> 02:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
basically a Raceway here it's going to
 
02:10:53.209 --> 02:10:53.219 align:start position:0%
be whatever you know any disturbance to
 
02:10:55.070 --> 02:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
the top of the of the lake is going to
 
02:10:57.169 --> 02:10:57.179 align:start position:0%
be no plowing it's just going to be what
 
02:10:59.750 --> 02:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
the snow machine occurs would naturally
 
02:11:02.390 --> 02:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
occur so that's those are really the the
 
02:11:04.250 --> 02:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
two complaints that come to mind and and
 
02:11:10.129 --> 02:11:10.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:12.109 --> 02:11:12.119 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly
 
02:11:14.209 --> 02:11:14.219 align:start position:0%
and to follow up on that so it doesn't
 
02:11:16.070 --> 02:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
happen often but you do have a process
 
02:11:18.109 --> 02:11:18.119 align:start position:0%
for so if someone had a recurring event
 
02:11:20.330 --> 02:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
permit you do have a process for
 
02:11:22.490 --> 02:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
withdrawing the permit if there are so
 
02:11:24.050 --> 02:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
someone had a nighttime monthly
 
02:11:26.270 --> 02:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
nighttime riding permit and the first
 
02:11:28.070 --> 02:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
one goes along and they have four times
 
02:11:29.330 --> 02:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
as many people as they were expecting
 
02:11:31.310 --> 02:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
and the town says no more we don't want
 
02:11:33.050 --> 02:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
it anymore you do have a process for
 
02:11:35.689 --> 02:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
removing that permit
 
02:11:35.699 --> 02:11:36.290 align:start position:0%
removing that permit
um

02:11:36.290 --> 02:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:38.990 --> 02:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
if there was a if the town withdrew
 
02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.030 align:start position:0%
if there was a if the town withdrew
consent

02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
consent
 
02:11:42.890 --> 02:11:42.900 align:start position:0%
if we received a complaint from the town
 
02:11:44.870 --> 02:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
we we would honor the town
 
02:11:46.490 --> 02:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
um and say well we thought this was a
 
02:11:48.649 --> 02:11:48.659 align:start position:0%
good idea but now it's not we don't want
 
02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
this we can certainly we have the
 
02:11:52.490 --> 02:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
ability to withdraw that permit
 
02:11:54.890 --> 02:11:54.900 align:start position:0%
um and even if we we have not but if we
 
02:11:56.750 --> 02:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
received complaints from a Butters or
 
02:11:59.390 --> 02:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
something of that nature which we did in
 
02:12:01.669 --> 02:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
this Dairy event so that's one of the
 
02:12:03.290 --> 02:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
reasons why
 
02:12:05.209 --> 02:12:05.219 align:start position:0%
um you know it was withdrawn and parking
 
02:12:06.709 --> 02:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
issues and things of that nature and
 
02:12:08.450 --> 02:12:08.460 align:start position:0%
that was the initial complaint the year
 
02:12:09.950 --> 02:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
prior so
 
02:12:12.290 --> 02:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
um yes we this is not you know set in
 
02:12:14.089 --> 02:12:14.099 align:start position:0%
stone once it's signed by me it
 
02:12:16.729 --> 02:12:16.739 align:start position:0%
certainly can be withdrawn
 
02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
any other question representative Darby
 
02:12:23.209 --> 02:12:23.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks again for
 
02:12:25.070 --> 02:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question captain
 
02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
um just following up on this theme about
 
02:12:28.430 --> 02:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
the number of events and the recurring
 
02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:29.689 align:start position:0%
the number of events and the recurring
events

02:12:29.689 --> 02:12:29.699 align:start position:0%
events
 
02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
um can you qualify the number of events
 
02:12:35.149 --> 02:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
where it's these these vintage cases you
 
02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
know um maybe that you know the the
 
02:12:39.830 --> 02:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
older machines that might be not have
 
02:12:43.490 --> 02:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
the this same decibel ratings versus the
 
02:12:46.250 --> 02:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
the larger events and also can you as
 
02:12:49.010 --> 02:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
related to this how many events are
 
02:12:51.050 --> 02:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
recurring events and and what's the
 
02:12:52.910 --> 02:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
average duration of those recurrent
 
02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:55.810 align:start position:0%
average duration of those recurrent
events

02:12:55.810 --> 02:12:55.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:58.310 --> 02:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
as I testified before a lot of these
 
02:13:01.129 --> 02:13:01.139 align:start position:0%
events are are snow events
 
02:13:03.530 --> 02:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
um so you know for instance
 
02:13:03.540 --> 02:13:05.089 align:start position:0%
um so you know for instance
um

02:13:05.089 --> 02:13:05.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:08.450 --> 02:13:08.460 align:start position:0%
it's very predicated upon what the
 
02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
conditions are so
 
02:13:11.930 --> 02:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
um some of these events um over the
 
02:13:13.310 --> 02:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
years they've
 
02:13:15.890 --> 02:13:15.900 align:start position:0%
not occurred because we you know they
 
02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
put it in July and maybe August hoping
 
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
that you know once December comes around
 
02:13:22.069 --> 02:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
there'll be some good ice that doesn't
 
02:13:24.790 --> 02:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
happen they might get off one event
 
02:13:27.350 --> 02:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
throughout the whole season
 
02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
um you know and that's December to you
 
02:13:31.189 --> 02:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
know maybe the end of February possibly
 
02:13:33.770 --> 02:13:33.780 align:start position:0%
into March but not really
 
02:13:37.609 --> 02:13:37.619 align:start position:0%
um so it it's not like they're out there
 
02:13:39.530 --> 02:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
every weekend it's really it's heavily
 
02:13:42.350 --> 02:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
predicated upon the weather and so
 
02:13:43.970 --> 02:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
um you know they can put in a lot of
 
02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
days they do alternate dates just
 
02:13:47.209 --> 02:13:47.219 align:start position:0%
because they they are working within
 
02:13:51.109 --> 02:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:53.629 --> 02:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up thank you um the part
 
02:13:55.490 --> 02:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
about the the Vintage Vehicles versus
 
02:13:59.209 --> 02:13:59.219 align:start position:0%
the um the sort of larger events do you
 
02:14:01.189 --> 02:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
have a percentage of each
 
02:14:03.709 --> 02:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
so we just made a change uh two years
 
02:14:06.589 --> 02:14:06.599 align:start position:0%
ago as far as antique plates especially
 
02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
on the snow side it used to be that only
 
02:14:11.030 --> 02:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
residents could
 
02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:12.189 align:start position:0%
residents could
could

02:14:12.189 --> 02:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:14:16.970 --> 02:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
register a vintage machine or an antique
 
02:14:20.169 --> 02:14:20.179 align:start position:0%
machine and then that changed so that
 
02:14:22.790 --> 02:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
non-residents could do that so as far as
 
02:14:24.589 --> 02:14:24.599 align:start position:0%
the Vintage side that number has
 
02:14:27.109 --> 02:14:27.119 align:start position:0%
definitely come down since then
 
02:14:27.119 --> 02:14:28.250 align:start position:0%
definitely come down since then
um

02:14:28.250 --> 02:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:31.310 --> 02:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
but I I have not trying to think how
 
02:14:34.129 --> 02:14:34.139 align:start position:0%
many vintage ATV rides I may have had
 
02:14:37.069 --> 02:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
one in the last couple years
 
02:14:39.050 --> 02:14:39.060 align:start position:0%
um I could certainly try to verify that
 
02:14:41.390 --> 02:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
for you but I I off the top of my head
 
02:14:43.850 --> 02:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
it was probably one event
 
02:14:43.860 --> 02:14:48.709 align:start position:0%
it was probably one event
thanks

02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:51.950 --> 02:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
question by anyone else
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:03.050 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:15:03.050 --> 02:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:15:08.930 --> 02:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:12.410 --> 02:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
Mr chair that's the honorable Suzanne
 
02:15:17.450 --> 02:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:19.310 --> 02:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
I'll get a phone call
 
02:15:21.169 --> 02:15:21.179 align:start position:0%
I'm glad Captain Eastman answered all
 
02:15:22.910 --> 02:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
the hard questions and warmed up the
 
02:15:25.129 --> 02:15:25.139 align:start position:0%
seat so I'm ready to go uh for the
 
02:15:28.370 --> 02:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
record I'm Suzanne Smith I am the uh
 
02:15:30.830 --> 02:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
chair of the
 
02:15:33.770 --> 02:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1188 commissioned to study
 
02:15:37.910 --> 02:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
ohrv use in New Hampshire and I'm former
 
02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
ranking member and former chair of this
 
02:15:42.530 --> 02:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
committee too and it's really nice to
 
02:15:44.689 --> 02:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
see old colleagues and meet new
 
02:15:44.699 --> 02:15:46.129 align:start position:0%
see old colleagues and meet new
colleagues

02:15:46.129 --> 02:15:46.139 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
02:15:49.790 --> 02:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
so um I the commission did not do the
 
02:15:51.290 --> 02:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
commission kind of went to the Senate
 
02:15:53.149 --> 02:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
quickly before the commission had a
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
chance to review it so I'm not here to
 
02:15:58.550 --> 02:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
speak for or against the bill but I did
 
02:16:01.430 --> 02:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
want to give the committee a little bit
 
02:16:04.550 --> 02:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
of a background on ohrv bills because to
 
02:16:06.350 --> 02:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
the best of my knowledge this is the
 
02:16:09.530 --> 02:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
first ohrv bill you've had this session
 
02:16:13.129 --> 02:16:13.139 align:start position:0%
in the past 23 years the use of ohrvs
 
02:16:15.350 --> 02:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
has grown exponentially
 
02:16:17.629 --> 02:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
not just in New Hampshire but around the
 
02:16:20.870 --> 02:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
United States and resources has had many
 
02:16:24.050 --> 02:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
public hearings on many bills and work
 
02:16:26.270 --> 02:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
sessions and retainings and interim
 
02:16:28.930 --> 02:16:28.940 align:start position:0%
studies and reintroduction of bills
 
02:16:31.550 --> 02:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
throughout the years especially the last
 
02:16:34.129 --> 02:16:34.139 align:start position:0%
five or six years many people have
 
02:16:36.830 --> 02:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
testified pro and con on each of these
 
02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
bills and we actually did pass some good
 
02:16:42.469 --> 02:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
legislation related to the definitions
 
02:16:45.549 --> 02:16:45.559 align:start position:0%
of what vehicles would be called
 
02:16:48.469 --> 02:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
classifying speed limit clarifying speed
 
02:16:51.070 --> 02:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
limits on the trails and on the roads
 
02:16:55.009 --> 02:16:55.019 align:start position:0%
increasing fines to deter lawmakers and
 
02:16:57.410 --> 02:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
this year in transportation they're
 
02:17:01.250 --> 02:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
hearing a bill to better educate and
 
02:17:03.290 --> 02:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
provide for better education and require
 
02:17:06.709 --> 02:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
better education for not just people who
 
02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
own their own ohrv and young people but
 
02:17:11.929 --> 02:17:11.939 align:start position:0%
people who are renting ohrvs too
 
02:17:13.669 --> 02:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
but there's less to be done because
 
02:17:16.370 --> 02:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
there are as you can see and what I'm
 
02:17:17.990 --> 02:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
hearing from the questions you've all
 
02:17:21.349 --> 02:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
asked is between the ohrv enthusiasts
 
02:17:24.009 --> 02:17:24.019 align:start position:0%
the butters law enforcement agencies
 
02:17:26.209 --> 02:17:26.219 align:start position:0%
biologists and conservationists
 
02:17:29.209 --> 02:17:29.219 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to do what's best for
 
02:17:30.889 --> 02:17:30.899 align:start position:0%
the state some people just want to do
 
02:17:32.450 --> 02:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
what's best for them but most people are
 
02:17:34.610 --> 02:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
you know wanted to be for the public
 
02:17:36.290 --> 02:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
good and that's what the commission is
 
02:17:38.929 --> 02:17:38.939 align:start position:0%
trying to do review all these statutes
 
02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
so because of all the ongoing issues
 
02:17:45.770 --> 02:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
with ohrvs and their growth
 
02:17:48.709 --> 02:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
um I introduced the house bill 1188 and
 
02:17:51.410 --> 02:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
it is a long-term study commission and
 
02:17:53.570 --> 02:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
our hope when we introduce that bill and
 
02:17:55.969 --> 02:17:55.979 align:start position:0%
many of you signed on to that bill or
 
02:17:57.910 --> 02:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
passed that bill helped to pass the bill
 
02:18:00.410 --> 02:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
to bring everybody to the table the
 
02:18:02.209 --> 02:18:02.219 align:start position:0%
commission has pretty much every
 
02:18:04.009 --> 02:18:04.019 align:start position:0%
stakeholder you can imagine on it
 
02:18:07.790 --> 02:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
there's 17 people and to check out and
 
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
figure out the best way to deal with the
 
02:18:12.110 --> 02:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
laws and the rules pertaining to the
 
02:18:14.089 --> 02:18:14.099 align:start position:0%
four-wheelers the three-wheelers the
 
02:18:16.610 --> 02:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
dirt bikes and then this bill also
 
02:18:18.530 --> 02:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
includes the bill we have before us
 
02:18:21.190 --> 02:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
today has to do with um
 
02:18:23.570 --> 02:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles also are events that happen
 
02:18:27.709 --> 02:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
on the snow so the as Captain Eastman
 
02:18:30.230 --> 02:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
explained the Montana plates which
 
02:18:32.089 --> 02:18:32.099 align:start position:0%
actually it's not just Montana there's a
 
02:18:34.370 --> 02:18:34.380 align:start position:0%
couple of other states that do it have
 
02:18:36.530 --> 02:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
made it challenging in New Hampshire in
 
02:18:38.450 --> 02:18:38.460 align:start position:0%
fact we heard testimony in our
 
02:18:40.790 --> 02:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
commission that you know you can see
 
02:18:42.770 --> 02:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
them driving down you see an ohrv
 
02:18:44.570 --> 02:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
driving down Main Street in Concord and
 
02:18:46.429 --> 02:18:46.439 align:start position:0%
you're like how can this be happening
 
02:18:49.070 --> 02:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
you know and then you realize it's got a
 
02:18:50.810 --> 02:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle plate so therefore we
 
02:18:53.629 --> 02:18:53.639 align:start position:0%
can't keep them off the roads so this
 
02:18:56.089 --> 02:18:56.099 align:start position:0%
bill will help that first part of this
 
02:18:58.730 --> 02:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
bill which addresses these motor vehicle
 
02:19:01.610 --> 02:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
plates on ohrvs which they're in Montana
 
02:19:04.429 --> 02:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
they call Quadra Cycles because it
 
02:19:06.230 --> 02:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
started off just being for dirt bikes
 
02:19:09.049 --> 02:19:09.059 align:start position:0%
but now it's for they can they put any
 
02:19:12.709 --> 02:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
ohrv under that category so if they're
 
02:19:14.690 --> 02:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
not permitted to go on the trails here
 
02:19:16.610 --> 02:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and that was a good
 
02:19:18.530 --> 02:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
question representative Kelly had about
 
02:19:21.049 --> 02:19:21.059 align:start position:0%
the can you double dip there and that's
 
02:19:22.849 --> 02:19:22.859 align:start position:0%
an issue that commission will I'm sure
 
02:19:26.690 --> 02:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
be addressing if it isn't addressed well
 
02:19:31.610 --> 02:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
already in rules and statutes so it's a
 
02:19:33.230 --> 02:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
that's a really good part of the bill
 
02:19:34.429 --> 02:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
02:19:34.439 --> 02:19:35.450 align:start position:0%
and I think
um

02:19:35.450 --> 02:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:37.969 --> 02:19:37.979 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't be stretching things to say
 
02:19:40.250 --> 02:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
that I think the commission all agrees
 
02:19:42.830 --> 02:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
on that one the second part addresses
 
02:19:44.810 --> 02:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
the special events which you just had a
 
02:19:46.429 --> 02:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
lot of questions about and heard a good
 
02:19:48.530 --> 02:19:48.540 align:start position:0%
some good testimony from Captain Eastman
 
02:19:48.540 --> 02:19:49.910 align:start position:0%
some good testimony from Captain Eastman
on

02:19:49.910 --> 02:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:19:53.030 --> 02:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
um and so already people buy these
 
02:19:55.310 --> 02:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
permits and so already people are
 
02:19:57.290 --> 02:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
allowed to be in these events if their
 
02:19:59.990 --> 02:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
permit is approved if they have decibels
 
02:20:02.469 --> 02:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
higher than 96
 
02:20:06.110 --> 02:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
which is the law in New Hampshire 96 or
 
02:20:09.469 --> 02:20:09.479 align:start position:0%
under and the um but what's different
 
02:20:12.650 --> 02:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
about this is also and and these things
 
02:20:14.750 --> 02:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
are happening there are night events but
 
02:20:17.030 --> 02:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's written into the permit but this
 
02:20:20.570 --> 02:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
gives the puts it into statute so that
 
02:20:23.210 --> 02:20:23.220 align:start position:0%
it's not a jumping through hoops for
 
02:20:25.310 --> 02:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
fish and game to approve these events
 
02:20:27.590 --> 02:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
whether they're happening during the day
 
02:20:29.330 --> 02:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
or at night and whether there's a few
 
02:20:29.340 --> 02:20:30.550 align:start position:0%
or at night and whether there's a few
Vehicles

02:20:30.550 --> 02:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
Vehicles
 
02:20:33.590 --> 02:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
as was explained to me some of the
 
02:20:36.469 --> 02:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
vehicles are not uh rail bikes they're
 
02:20:38.809 --> 02:20:38.819 align:start position:0%
only used for competitions and for these
 
02:20:38.819 --> 02:20:40.450 align:start position:0%
only used for competitions and for these
events

02:20:40.450 --> 02:20:40.460 align:start position:0%
events
 
02:20:45.110 --> 02:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
but event also in despite all of this
 
02:20:48.410 --> 02:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
there were some concerns expressed in
 
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
commission and concerns that I have that
 
02:20:54.050 --> 02:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
make me to how when I testified in the
 
02:20:56.510 --> 02:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
body across the way
 
02:20:58.190 --> 02:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
um I said that I thought the bill was a
 
02:21:01.070 --> 02:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
little premature because we didn't
 
02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
really thoroughly vet it in the
 
02:21:04.730 --> 02:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
commission and I know I'm being selfish
 
02:21:06.290 --> 02:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
saying the commission can do everything
 
02:21:10.309 --> 02:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
but um that's kind of how I feel but um
 
02:21:12.410 --> 02:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
there is concern about disruption to
 
02:21:13.969 --> 02:21:13.979 align:start position:0%
Wildlife especially in the winter
 
02:21:16.250 --> 02:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
because as Captain Eastman said a lot of
 
02:21:18.590 --> 02:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
these events are in the winter so when
 
02:21:19.849 --> 02:21:19.859 align:start position:0%
you have
 
02:21:22.550 --> 02:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
um Wildlife that are used to you know
 
02:21:24.170 --> 02:21:24.180 align:start position:0%
they're in a neighborhood where there's
 
02:21:26.090 --> 02:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
always traffic or they have to cross the
 
02:21:27.830 --> 02:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
interstate they're kind of used to that
 
02:21:32.690 --> 02:21:32.700 align:start position:0%
ongoing problem for them but when it's a
 
02:21:34.730 --> 02:21:34.740 align:start position:0%
formerly really quiet place and there
 
02:21:38.150 --> 02:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
would be a huge loud bunch of noises one
 
02:21:40.130 --> 02:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
night it kind of throws them off their
 
02:21:42.710 --> 02:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
game and Wildlife are pretty desperate
 
02:21:46.250 --> 02:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
to keep all their calories on and having
 
02:21:48.889 --> 02:21:48.899 align:start position:0%
to use up more energy than they need to
 
02:21:50.809 --> 02:21:50.819 align:start position:0%
in the winter that can be a problem for
 
02:21:50.819 --> 02:21:52.250 align:start position:0%
in the winter that can be a problem for
them

02:21:52.250 --> 02:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:21:53.990 --> 02:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
um Butters people whose homes are near
 
02:21:57.050 --> 02:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
where the events are taking place could
 
02:21:58.969 --> 02:21:58.979 align:start position:0%
be affected by the loud noises of the
 
02:22:00.290 --> 02:22:00.300 align:start position:0%
decibels and the bright lights
 
02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
especially at night and one of the bills
 
02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:05.630 align:start position:0%
especially at night and one of the bills
we

02:22:05.630 --> 02:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:22:08.809 --> 02:22:08.819 align:start position:0%
the one of the concerns I have also is
 
02:22:11.690 --> 02:22:11.700 align:start position:0%
for racing races on ice
 
02:22:14.570 --> 02:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
which on Ice there are no speed limits
 
02:22:17.090 --> 02:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
and so there could be an organized right
 
02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
Ice Race of motorcycles
 
02:22:21.840 --> 02:22:22.849 align:start position:0%
Ice Race of motorcycles
um

02:22:22.849 --> 02:22:22.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:25.190 --> 02:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
in during the winter and you've got the
 
02:22:27.349 --> 02:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
butters around whatever Pond or lake it
 
02:22:27.359 --> 02:22:29.030 align:start position:0%
butters around whatever Pond or lake it
is

02:22:29.030 --> 02:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:22:31.790 --> 02:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
having to deal with it and most almost
 
02:22:33.889 --> 02:22:33.899 align:start position:0%
all the ice surfaces in the state
 
02:22:37.250 --> 02:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
because ice is water and water is public
 
02:22:37.260 --> 02:22:38.710 align:start position:0%
because ice is water and water is public
Trust

02:22:38.710 --> 02:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
Trust
 
02:22:41.990 --> 02:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
it is there are no speed limits on the
 
02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.150 align:start position:0%
it is there are no speed limits on the
water

02:22:44.150 --> 02:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
water
 
02:22:46.670 --> 02:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
um so anyway the because of the time
 
02:22:50.090 --> 02:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
constraints of the 2023 session the
 
02:22:51.710 --> 02:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
commission as I said did not have time
 
02:22:53.690 --> 02:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
to thoroughly vet the legislation when
 
02:22:56.270 --> 02:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
it was in the Senate so we're not making
 
02:22:59.630 --> 02:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
a stand and saying you need to pass this
 
02:23:02.990 --> 02:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
or you need to kill this but um I you
 
02:23:04.610 --> 02:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
are the resources Recreation and
 
02:23:07.490 --> 02:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
development committee and ohrvs are an
 
02:23:09.770 --> 02:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
important part of resources natural
 
02:23:13.370 --> 02:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
resources uh Recreation of the for the
 
02:23:15.710 --> 02:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
public and economic development because
 
02:23:18.770 --> 02:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
these ohrvs do bring money into the
 
02:23:21.110 --> 02:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
state so I hope you'll work hard and
 
02:23:23.270 --> 02:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
consider everything you've heard today
 
02:23:26.630 --> 02:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
and do your best on all the ohrv bills
 
02:23:28.010 --> 02:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
because I'll bet next year you'll have
 
02:23:30.469 --> 02:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
more of them and thank you and if you
 
02:23:34.010 --> 02:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:36.830 --> 02:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
questions for the uh honorable
 
02:23:39.469 --> 02:23:39.479 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
02:23:43.010 --> 02:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and and thank you
 
02:23:45.290 --> 02:23:45.300 align:start position:0%
honorable it's so good to see you
 
02:23:47.090 --> 02:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
um I have a question you said the
 
02:23:48.889 --> 02:23:48.899 align:start position:0%
commission hadn't had the opportunity to
 
02:23:51.410 --> 02:23:51.420 align:start position:0%
review this bill yet to render an
 
02:23:54.170 --> 02:23:54.180 align:start position:0%
opinion uh do you anticipate that they
 
02:23:56.929 --> 02:23:56.939 align:start position:0%
would within the next month or so we
 
02:24:00.590 --> 02:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
have reviewed it but there are so many
 
02:24:04.309 --> 02:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
interests there are so many issues just
 
02:24:06.530 --> 02:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
in any legislation as you know once you
 
02:24:08.750 --> 02:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
start digging in you find out there's
 
02:24:11.150 --> 02:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
more and more to learn on the subject so
 
02:24:14.570 --> 02:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
we didn't come to any no one felt when I
 
02:24:17.389 --> 02:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
asked did we want to take a vote nobody
 
02:24:21.170 --> 02:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
really spoke up so I would say that we
 
02:24:22.550 --> 02:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
just felt like we needed more time
 
02:24:24.650 --> 02:24:24.660 align:start position:0%
because every time you open one door
 
02:24:26.330 --> 02:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
there's another door two or three
 
02:24:28.370 --> 02:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
choices to make to figure out what to do
 
02:24:29.510 --> 02:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
about something
 
02:24:31.610 --> 02:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
so that I don't think in a month because
 
02:24:33.410 --> 02:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
we don't have another meeting until the
 
02:24:37.250 --> 02:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
first of June okay follow-up Mr chair
 
02:24:38.750 --> 02:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
um but I think
 
02:24:40.550 --> 02:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
um correct me if I'm wrong but I thought
 
02:24:43.250 --> 02:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
I heard you say that the commission was
 
02:24:45.110 --> 02:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
generally in favor of the first part of
 
02:24:47.750 --> 02:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
the bill regarding the registration I'm
 
02:24:49.550 --> 02:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
going out on a limb and that was my
 
02:24:51.530 --> 02:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
personal opinion oh that the commission
 
02:24:53.030 --> 02:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
would feel that way because I didn't
 
02:24:55.070 --> 02:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
hear anyone complaining about it when we
 
02:24:57.230 --> 02:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
were you know meeting and talking about
 
02:24:59.150 --> 02:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
everyone was pretty much aghast that
 
02:25:01.429 --> 02:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
this could happen okay with the Montana
 
02:25:05.510 --> 02:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:08.870 --> 02:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
and representative Farm
 
02:25:12.290 --> 02:25:12.300 align:start position:0%
representative welcome back thank you
 
02:25:12.300 --> 02:25:13.490 align:start position:0%
representative welcome back thank you
um

02:25:13.490 --> 02:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:15.770 --> 02:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
I know the commission hasn't made a
 
02:25:18.410 --> 02:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
decision but I highly respect your
 
02:25:20.450 --> 02:25:20.460 align:start position:0%
opinion personally and I know you and I
 
02:25:22.910 --> 02:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
have been through all sorts of ohrv
 
02:25:25.849 --> 02:25:25.859 align:start position:0%
pills with noise and lakes and and
 
02:25:28.969 --> 02:25:28.979 align:start position:0%
motorcycle racing what do you think of
 
02:25:37.490 --> 02:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:40.010 --> 02:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
um I'm kind of in the middle I can't I
 
02:25:42.349 --> 02:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
can't really I can't really say because
 
02:25:44.090 --> 02:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
02:25:45.770 --> 02:25:45.780 align:start position:0%
I feel like I still don't know
 
02:25:48.349 --> 02:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
everything even today sitting here and
 
02:25:50.450 --> 02:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
listening to the testimony I was even
 
02:25:52.849 --> 02:25:52.859 align:start position:0%
saying oh I didn't realize that oh I
 
02:25:55.309 --> 02:25:55.319 align:start position:0%
didn't realize that so I mean I don't
 
02:25:58.130 --> 02:25:58.140 align:start position:0%
feel that I'm there yet to make a final
 
02:26:01.849 --> 02:26:01.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:03.290 --> 02:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
representative Donnelly then
 
02:26:05.690 --> 02:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
representative Gould
 
02:26:07.370 --> 02:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:26:09.469 --> 02:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
taking my question do we know roughly
 
02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
the revenue stream that these events May
 
02:26:14.210 --> 02:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
bring into New Hampshire
 
02:26:17.510 --> 02:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
that I have no idea about but I'm sure
 
02:26:19.429 --> 02:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
Captain Eastman may know the answer to
 
02:26:20.929 --> 02:26:20.939 align:start position:0%
that and and anytime you're talking
 
02:26:22.730 --> 02:26:22.740 align:start position:0%
about a special event if it's in a
 
02:26:22.740 --> 02:26:24.170 align:start position:0%
about a special event if it's in a
community

02:26:24.170 --> 02:26:24.180 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:26:26.929 --> 02:26:26.939 align:start position:0%
um there's the adjunct money that comes
 
02:26:28.969 --> 02:26:28.979 align:start position:0%
in from people going to restaurants or
 
02:26:31.790 --> 02:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
being on the Parade route and shopping
 
02:26:34.250 --> 02:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
and things like that but Captain Eastman
 
02:26:36.650 --> 02:26:36.660 align:start position:0%
may know that better than I do or even
 
02:26:39.889 --> 02:26:39.899 align:start position:0%
director Rennie from the trails Bureau
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%

this or not but would it be
 
02:26:59.389 --> 02:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
something we could do to eliminate the
 
02:27:01.130 --> 02:27:01.140 align:start position:0%
second part that seems to be more of the
 
02:27:01.140 --> 02:27:02.450 align:start position:0%
second part that seems to be more of the
concerned

02:27:02.450 --> 02:27:02.460 align:start position:0%

concerns from community members like do
 
02:29:42.050 --> 02:29:42.060 align:start position:0%
you is there is there a public forum for
 
02:29:44.510 --> 02:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh for discussion or um and other
 
02:29:47.870 --> 02:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
concerns specifically about events
 
02:29:52.309 --> 02:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
we have not been soliciting from I mean
 
02:29:54.530 --> 02:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
anyone who wants to talk about the
 
02:29:57.830 --> 02:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
events should be here today
 
02:30:01.010 --> 02:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
um and we are still in the very
 
02:30:02.750 --> 02:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
beginning we've only had three or four
 
02:30:05.450 --> 02:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
meetings thus far we're meeting every
 
02:30:08.929 --> 02:30:08.939 align:start position:0%
other month for two hours and so we are
 
02:30:11.270 --> 02:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
going to we've got four years left so
 
02:30:14.090 --> 02:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
we've still got time to do that we'll be
 
02:30:16.670 --> 02:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
hearing from various factions the
 
02:30:18.110 --> 02:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
Butters and
 
02:30:19.790 --> 02:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
what we've been hearing from law
 
02:30:22.370 --> 02:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
enforcement thus far working addressing
 
02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
the safety issues first and the
 
02:30:27.110 --> 02:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement and how thing how the laws
 
02:30:29.450 --> 02:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
can be enforced and we tried to get some
 
02:30:31.969 --> 02:30:31.979 align:start position:0%
of that underway before we got into this
 
02:30:36.050 --> 02:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:38.090 --> 02:30:38.100 align:start position:0%

good morning chair renzullo and members
 
02:31:14.450 --> 02:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Rich Parsons
 
02:31:16.849 --> 02:31:16.859 align:start position:0%
I work at ryp Granite strategies here in
 
02:31:18.349 --> 02:31:18.359 align:start position:0%

02:31:19.490 --> 02:31:19.500 align:start position:0%

02:31:21.530 --> 02:31:21.540 align:start position:0%
Association
 
02:31:23.570 --> 02:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
um we are here today in support of this
 
02:31:25.849 --> 02:31:25.859 align:start position:0%
bill we represent about 25 or HIV clubs
 
02:31:27.469 --> 02:31:27.479 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
02:31:29.570 --> 02:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
um fishing game when they kind of
 
02:31:31.070 --> 02:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
brought forward these ideas last year we
 
02:31:32.030 --> 02:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
thought they made a lot of sense
 
02:31:33.950 --> 02:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
obviously the Montana plate you've heard
 
02:31:36.889 --> 02:31:36.899 align:start position:0%
a lot about Montana came up with a very
 
02:31:39.110 --> 02:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
clever way to try and get revenue for
 
02:31:41.690 --> 02:31:41.700 align:start position:0%
their state you know they make it very
 
02:31:43.550 --> 02:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
easy for you to be able to create an LLC
 
02:31:46.910 --> 02:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
go online and get one of these Montana
 
02:31:48.710 --> 02:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
plates that also comes with a sticker
 
02:31:50.270 --> 02:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
that lets you use it on the Montana
 
02:31:53.450 --> 02:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
Trails there you can do it from anywhere
 
02:31:54.770 --> 02:31:54.780 align:start position:0%
in the United States you don't have to
 
02:31:57.050 --> 02:31:57.060 align:start position:0%
be in Montana to do it so they have
 
02:31:59.510 --> 02:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
certainly made probably a good deal of
 
02:32:02.090 --> 02:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
profit from from doing this by you know
 
02:32:04.490 --> 02:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
letting you make it road legal as a
 
02:32:06.170 --> 02:32:06.180 align:start position:0%
quadricycle under their law which allows
 
02:32:08.110 --> 02:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
you to operate it on roads
 
02:32:10.250 --> 02:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
I won't spend much time on that because
 
02:32:12.770 --> 02:32:12.780 align:start position:0%
it sounds like most people understand
 
02:32:14.389 --> 02:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
that part and there's some general
 
02:32:18.050 --> 02:32:18.060 align:start position:0%
consensus that we should stop that the
 
02:32:19.610 --> 02:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
event permit part of the bill I guess
 
02:32:22.190 --> 02:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
I'll talk a little bit more about I know
 
02:32:23.510 --> 02:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative Donnelly you had a
 
02:32:24.590 --> 02:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
question about
 
02:32:26.270 --> 02:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
um how many people come to some of these
 
02:32:29.630 --> 02:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
events and I in Revenue so I looked up
 
02:32:33.230 --> 02:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
um the gun stock Hill Climb you know
 
02:32:35.150 --> 02:32:35.160 align:start position:0%
they're this year is their 100th Annual
 
02:32:37.130 --> 02:32:37.140 align:start position:0%
Ride and last year they had 6 000
 
02:32:39.830 --> 02:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
spectators at the rod so I don't know
 
02:32:42.410 --> 02:32:42.420 align:start position:0%
exactly how much revenue but just that's
 
02:32:43.790 --> 02:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
the amount of people that it's bringing
 
02:32:45.950 --> 02:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
in and I think
 
02:32:48.590 --> 02:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
um you know it's important to note that
 
02:32:50.210 --> 02:32:50.220 align:start position:0%
the event permit application that fish
 
02:32:52.790 --> 02:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
and game has is is very detailed and I
 
02:32:54.650 --> 02:32:54.660 align:start position:0%
encourage everyone to look it up you can
 
02:32:56.929 --> 02:32:56.939 align:start position:0%
find it online pretty easily
 
02:33:00.230 --> 02:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
um and you you have to notify or you
 
02:33:01.670 --> 02:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
have to list all the towns that would be
 
02:33:04.309 --> 02:33:04.319 align:start position:0%
impacted that you've notified them you
 
02:33:05.809 --> 02:33:05.819 align:start position:0%
have to give assurance that you've
 
02:33:07.429 --> 02:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
notified all landowners give their
 
02:33:09.469 --> 02:33:09.479 align:start position:0%
information their names you have to do a
 
02:33:12.290 --> 02:33:12.300 align:start position:0%
detailed a map of where the trails are
 
02:33:13.150 --> 02:33:13.160 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
02:33:16.610 --> 02:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
so that they can see exactly where this
 
02:33:19.490 --> 02:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
event will impact and I think also
 
02:33:21.469 --> 02:33:21.479 align:start position:0%
important to note you have to do it at
 
02:33:23.809 --> 02:33:23.819 align:start position:0%
least 45 days before an event at least
 
02:33:27.170 --> 02:33:27.180 align:start position:0%
so that gives fishing game enough time
 
02:33:29.929 --> 02:33:29.939 align:start position:0%
to call these these towns make sure that
 
02:33:32.389 --> 02:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
they are okay with this see if there's
 
02:33:33.590 --> 02:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
going to be a Butters that might be
 
02:33:36.349 --> 02:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
impacted see other other things that may
 
02:33:37.490 --> 02:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
happen and they're already doing this
 
02:33:38.929 --> 02:33:38.939 align:start position:0%
for a lot of these events obviously this
 
02:33:40.550 --> 02:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
is just adding a couple of flexibilities
 
02:33:44.450 --> 02:33:44.460 align:start position:0%
for them in the law and so we're just we
 
02:33:46.130 --> 02:33:46.140 align:start position:0%
trust that fish and game will do what is
 
02:33:48.770 --> 02:33:48.780 align:start position:0%
right you know we think it's very
 
02:33:50.510 --> 02:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
important and we're very sensitive to
 
02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
landowner rights we rely extremely
 
02:33:55.130 --> 02:33:55.140 align:start position:0%
heavily on landowners for our trail
 
02:33:57.530 --> 02:33:57.540 align:start position:0%
system in the North Country there have
 
02:33:59.929 --> 02:33:59.939 align:start position:0%
been issues in the past certainly that
 
02:34:03.050 --> 02:34:03.060 align:start position:0%
we want to put behind us and that I
 
02:34:06.170 --> 02:34:06.180 align:start position:0%
think fish and game is very much aware
 
02:34:09.110 --> 02:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
and sensitive to you know a Butters and
 
02:34:11.870 --> 02:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
towns that do allow this to make sure
 
02:34:13.790 --> 02:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
that you know there isn't blowback
 
02:34:15.110 --> 02:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
because the blowback isn't good for
 
02:34:17.290 --> 02:34:17.300 align:start position:0%
snowmobilers it's not good for ohrv
 
02:34:21.469 --> 02:34:21.479 align:start position:0%
communities in any sense so we we fully
 
02:34:23.389 --> 02:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
trust that the event permit process
 
02:34:26.210 --> 02:34:26.220 align:start position:0%
that's in place now is robust and that
 
02:34:27.170 --> 02:34:27.180 align:start position:0%
fishing game will make the right
 
02:34:29.210 --> 02:34:29.220 align:start position:0%
decisions on some of these and you know
 
02:34:31.370 --> 02:34:31.380 align:start position:0%
I think some of these that things that
 
02:34:32.570 --> 02:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
they're being allowed like on the hill
 
02:34:34.550 --> 02:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
climb or something you know you have a
 
02:34:36.050 --> 02:34:36.060 align:start position:0%
lot of folks coming in from out of state
 
02:34:39.469 --> 02:34:39.479 align:start position:0%
with their vehicles and you know I think
 
02:34:41.570 --> 02:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
it gives a little bit of flexibility
 
02:34:43.429 --> 02:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
where maybe there's gray area now in
 
02:34:46.010 --> 02:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
terms of the event operators tell
 
02:34:47.270 --> 02:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
everyone you can't have something with
 
02:34:49.610 --> 02:34:49.620 align:start position:0%
over 96 decibels whatnot but someone
 
02:34:51.950 --> 02:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
comes in with a dirt bike that
 
02:34:53.510 --> 02:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
goes over that and they're going up the
 
02:34:55.910 --> 02:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
hill or something that you know
 
02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
um kind of gets rid of the gray area a
 
02:35:00.530 --> 02:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
little bit to to allow it if needed
 
02:35:03.230 --> 02:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
um so with that I'll certainly take any
 
02:35:06.110 --> 02:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
questions folks might have
 
02:35:08.450 --> 02:35:08.460 align:start position:0%
any questions from the members of the
 
02:35:08.460 --> 02:35:13.130 align:start position:0%
any questions from the members of the
committee

02:35:13.130 --> 02:35:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
oh and then Darby thank you Mr chair
 
02:35:17.690 --> 02:35:17.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question can you
 
02:35:20.210 --> 02:35:20.220 align:start position:0%
just give me an example maybe of
 
02:35:22.969 --> 02:35:22.979 align:start position:0%
um an event that would require that that
 
02:35:24.950 --> 02:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
your group supports that would require
 
02:35:26.690 --> 02:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
each of these
 
02:35:28.670 --> 02:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
um you know new exemptions public ways
 
02:35:32.929 --> 02:35:32.939 align:start position:0%
louder than 90 successibles and um uh
 
02:35:34.550 --> 02:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
writing after hours
 
02:35:36.410 --> 02:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
is so I don't have one on the exhaust
 
02:35:38.510 --> 02:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
higher than 96 decibels
 
02:35:40.130 --> 02:35:40.140 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
02:35:42.230 --> 02:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
I think there's obviously a lot of these
 
02:35:43.910 --> 02:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
events are done in the winter maybe you
 
02:35:43.920 --> 02:35:44.630 align:start position:0%
events are done in the winter maybe you
know

02:35:44.630 --> 02:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:35:46.969 --> 02:35:46.979 align:start position:0%
race cars on ice or something like that
 
02:35:48.349 --> 02:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
there's some of those kind of events but
 
02:35:50.330 --> 02:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
our group I don't really have an example
 
02:35:52.910 --> 02:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
of that in terms of on public roadways
 
02:35:55.670 --> 02:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
or half hour between sunset or not I
 
02:35:55.680 --> 02:35:56.570 align:start position:0%
or half hour between sunset or not I
think

02:35:56.570 --> 02:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:35:58.190 --> 02:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
um Captain Eastman used the example of a
 
02:36:00.050 --> 02:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
Warren in terms of being able to ride
 
02:36:02.210 --> 02:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
your UTV down to watch the fireworks
 
02:36:04.070 --> 02:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
show and be able to then drive it back
 
02:36:08.450 --> 02:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:10.270 --> 02:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
thank you

02:36:14.750 --> 02:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
saying no one else

hello my name is Abby ivanko from quorum
 
02:36:41.150 --> 02:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
even though I live a mile away from the
 
02:36:43.910 --> 02:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
ATV trail ATV's wrapping up the trail
 
02:36:46.130 --> 02:36:46.140 align:start position:0%
has become the soundtrack to my home in
 
02:36:47.210 --> 02:36:47.220 align:start position:0%
the woods
 
02:36:48.950 --> 02:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
and my friends and neighbors who live
 
02:36:51.349 --> 02:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
even closer to the misplaced ATV trails
 
02:36:53.630 --> 02:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
obviously have it even worse
 
02:36:56.870 --> 02:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
sections one and two of SB 160 deserve
 
02:36:57.889 --> 02:36:57.899 align:start position:0%
your support
 
02:37:00.710 --> 02:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
but please strike section three which
 
02:37:02.929 --> 02:37:02.939 align:start position:0%
will allow as you know louder and later
 
02:37:06.770 --> 02:37:06.780 align:start position:0%
ohrv events Section 3 weakens the ohrv
 
02:37:09.530 --> 02:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
laws that were carefully written over 20
 
02:37:11.750 --> 02:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
years ago with input from all
 
02:37:13.730 --> 02:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to protect the people and
 
02:37:16.130 --> 02:37:16.140 align:start position:0%

off-road recreational vehicles I can
 
02:37:23.510 --> 02:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
tell you there are plenty of complaints
 
02:37:26.030 --> 02:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
people don't know who to call because no
 
02:37:27.530 --> 02:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
matter who they call they don't get
 
02:37:30.650 --> 02:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
relief they call the town they call Fish
 
02:37:32.870 --> 02:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
and Game they call the State Police and
 
02:37:34.490 --> 02:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
then they give up calling because the
 
02:37:37.130 --> 02:37:37.140 align:start position:0%
disturbance just goes on so
 
02:37:39.889 --> 02:37:39.899 align:start position:0%
uh there are plenty complaints and every
 
02:37:42.410 --> 02:37:42.420 align:start position:0%

the inclusion of public ways in Section

actually the fish and game build they
 
02:38:19.550 --> 02:38:19.560 align:start position:0%

02:43:20.570 --> 02:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
I think I know the answer but but do you
 
02:43:22.969 --> 02:43:22.979 align:start position:0%
believe that the impacts of oh HRV use
 
02:43:25.429 --> 02:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
are disparate or are evenly spread
 
02:43:26.450 --> 02:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
throughout the community or do they
 
02:43:28.309 --> 02:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
affect more some certain members more
 
02:43:30.349 --> 02:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
than others and then do you feel that
 
02:43:32.870 --> 02:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
that we as the state are doing enough to
 
02:43:36.410 --> 02:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:40.370 --> 02:43:40.380 align:start position:0%
a few people are bearing the burden of
 
02:43:43.730 --> 02:43:43.740 align:start position:0%
these Trails you know no one
 
02:43:46.790 --> 02:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
wants to be surrounded by 96 decibel
 
02:43:46.800 --> 02:43:47.870 align:start position:0%
wants to be surrounded by 96 decibel
vehicles

02:43:47.870 --> 02:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
02:43:51.050 --> 02:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
from half an hour before Sunrise to half
 
02:43:56.389 --> 02:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
an hour after sunset from May 23rd to
 
02:43:58.490 --> 02:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
November 1st
 
02:44:02.889 --> 02:44:02.899 align:start position:0%
it's just it's inhumane it's uncivilized
 
02:44:05.630 --> 02:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
and if more people knew or the right
 
02:44:07.250 --> 02:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
people were Disturbed it wouldn't be
 
02:44:09.110 --> 02:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
happening but it's picking and choosing
 
02:44:11.510 --> 02:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
which neighbors neighborhoods that are
 
02:44:13.610 --> 02:44:13.620 align:start position:0%
collateral damage and paying all the
 
02:44:17.150 --> 02:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:18.950 --> 02:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
did I answer your question
 
02:44:21.650 --> 02:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and the the other thing is
 
02:44:24.170 --> 02:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
um the laws in co-ops are different
 
02:44:26.750 --> 02:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
so you have more protections living in
 
02:44:28.790 --> 02:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
other counties than the citizens of coas
 
02:44:31.250 --> 02:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
and Grafton do so there's not even equal
 
02:44:33.349 --> 02:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
protection under the law in New
 
02:44:33.359 --> 02:44:39.889 align:start position:0%
protection under the law in New
Hampshire

02:44:39.889 --> 02:44:39.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:41.570 --> 02:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you for
 
02:44:43.730 --> 02:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
02:44:46.490 --> 02:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
um were you aware that gun stock
 
02:44:50.530 --> 02:44:50.540 align:start position:0%
mountain resort is actually County Land
 
02:44:54.230 --> 02:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
and that those gun stock hill climbs are
 
02:44:57.110 --> 02:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
sanctioned by the public body of the gun
 
02:44:58.969 --> 02:44:58.979 align:start position:0%
stock area commissioners
 
02:45:00.950 --> 02:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:45:04.130 --> 02:45:04.140 align:start position:0%
um I wasn't aware of the specifics no I
 
02:45:07.610 --> 02:45:07.620 align:start position:0%
just know that the uh the officials in
 
02:45:11.570 --> 02:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
koas are not speaking for the Butters
 
02:45:19.309 --> 02:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:23.450 --> 02:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:25.969 --> 02:45:25.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:45:27.770 --> 02:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:45:30.410 --> 02:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
um so I remember when we first started
 
02:45:34.550 --> 02:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
with the ohrv build in 2018 and I'm glad
 
02:45:36.770 --> 02:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
to see that you're still here working
 
02:45:39.950 --> 02:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
really hard with legislators and the
 
02:45:42.170 --> 02:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders in order to come to
 
02:45:43.849 --> 02:45:43.859 align:start position:0%
some resolutions
 
02:45:48.170 --> 02:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
at the time I had heard about when I
 
02:45:50.050 --> 02:45:50.060 align:start position:0%
first came in in
 
02:45:53.330 --> 02:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
transportation in 2018 that there were
 
02:45:54.950 --> 02:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
quite a few neighbors that were
 
02:45:58.610 --> 02:45:58.620 align:start position:0%
disturbed by ohrv use up in the north
 
02:46:02.030 --> 02:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
country and so I did some research and I
 
02:46:05.090 --> 02:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
found a bill that changed some of the
 
02:46:07.849 --> 02:46:07.859 align:start position:0%
environmental regulations that was able
 
02:46:12.230 --> 02:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
that enabled us to build ride the Wilds
 
02:46:13.969 --> 02:46:13.979 align:start position:0%
if I'm correct
 
02:46:13.979 --> 02:46:14.630 align:start position:0%
if I'm correct
um

02:46:14.630 --> 02:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:19.010 --> 02:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
so this has been a long road and you are
 
02:46:21.550 --> 02:46:21.560 align:start position:0%
here with just a couple of supporters
 
02:46:24.469 --> 02:46:24.479 align:start position:0%
where are the people who used to come in
 
02:46:26.510 --> 02:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
at the very beginning when we started
 
02:46:28.309 --> 02:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
looking at regulating some of these
 
02:46:28.319 --> 02:46:31.370 align:start position:0%
looking at regulating some of these
activities

02:46:31.370 --> 02:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:32.990 --> 02:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
um they're exhausted they're tired
 
02:46:34.550 --> 02:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
they're at home they're taking care of
 
02:46:37.309 --> 02:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
their elderly parents their disabled
 
02:46:37.319 --> 02:46:38.690 align:start position:0%
their elderly parents their disabled
children

02:46:38.690 --> 02:46:38.700 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:46:38.700 --> 02:46:39.950 align:start position:0%
children
um

02:46:39.950 --> 02:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:42.530 --> 02:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
they've spoken out for years and gotten
 
02:46:44.630 --> 02:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
no relief
 
02:46:46.309 --> 02:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
they're writing in
 
02:46:51.170 --> 02:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:53.630 --> 02:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
or or moved away
 
02:46:55.910 --> 02:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
that was my follow-up do you how many
 
02:46:59.150 --> 02:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
people have had to leave the uh the area
 
02:47:01.670 --> 02:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
from that advocacy group
 
02:47:04.490 --> 02:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
well I know of at least three people in
 
02:47:06.950 --> 02:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
Gorham who have moved away
 
02:47:10.309 --> 02:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
driven Away by the ohrvs and uh my
 
02:47:12.770 --> 02:47:12.780 align:start position:0%
friend in Pittsburgh she's lost most of
 
02:47:16.670 --> 02:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:18.050 --> 02:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
and I should point out that these
 
02:47:20.870 --> 02:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayers pay thousands of dollars in
 
02:47:23.809 --> 02:47:23.819 align:start position:0%
tax taxes but we don't have a state
 
02:47:26.630 --> 02:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
department representing us
 
02:47:28.429 --> 02:47:28.439 align:start position:0%
when we don't have a paid lobbyist
 
02:47:28.439 --> 02:47:32.270 align:start position:0%
when we don't have a paid lobbyist
either

02:47:32.270 --> 02:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:36.349 --> 02:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:38.389 --> 02:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
-up and actually
 
02:47:39.830 --> 02:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
um I think you just answered my question
 
02:47:42.770 --> 02:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:45.469 --> 02:47:45.479 align:start position:0%
any questions from any members of the
 
02:47:45.479 --> 02:47:47.929 align:start position:0%
any questions from any members of the
committee

02:47:47.929 --> 02:47:47.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:50.389 --> 02:47:50.399 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
02:47:52.130 --> 02:47:52.140 align:start position:0%
you for your time
 
02:48:01.630 --> 02:48:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:05.410 --> 02:48:05.420 align:start position:0%
uh it's County Cork and County Career
 
02:48:09.010 --> 02:48:09.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:12.349 --> 02:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh for taking my
 
02:48:15.469 --> 02:48:15.479 align:start position:0%
testimony my name is Catherine corkery I
 
02:48:17.630 --> 02:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
am representing New Hampshire Sierra
 
02:48:22.670 --> 02:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
Club and uh our motto is to explore no
 
02:48:27.230 --> 02:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
Enjoy explore and protect and I
 
02:48:31.190 --> 02:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
represent uh 14 or 15 000 people in the
 
02:48:31.200 --> 02:48:33.530 align:start position:0%
represent uh 14 or 15 000 people in the
state

02:48:33.530 --> 02:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:33.540 --> 02:48:36.050 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:48:36.050 --> 02:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:39.410 --> 02:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
I want to Echo what with the testimony
 
02:48:41.750 --> 02:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
that we just heard
 
02:48:47.030 --> 02:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
um about uh section three but uh before
 
02:48:49.510 --> 02:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
I get there I do support the
 
02:48:53.450 --> 02:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
reciprocosity aspects of section one and
 
02:48:56.469 --> 02:48:56.479 align:start position:0%
two I believe yeah um
 
02:49:01.010 --> 02:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
and and part of that is reflected in our
 
02:49:05.210 --> 02:49:05.220 align:start position:0%
opposition to section three and that is
 
02:49:08.809 --> 02:49:08.819 align:start position:0%
um the operation on the public ways for
 
02:49:10.370 --> 02:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
special events
 
02:49:10.380 --> 02:49:11.450 align:start position:0%
special events
um

02:49:11.450 --> 02:49:11.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:13.630 --> 02:49:13.640 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:49:17.650 --> 02:49:17.660 align:start position:0%
when you're not expecting these ATVs and
 
02:49:21.830 --> 02:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
ohrvs on the roadways and a special
 
02:49:25.790 --> 02:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
event comes it's rather shocking to see
 
02:49:30.650 --> 02:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
the the these these vehicles on on the
 
02:49:34.190 --> 02:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
road uh while you're driving I'm going
 
02:49:36.170 --> 02:49:36.180 align:start position:0%
pretty fast
 
02:49:38.150 --> 02:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
um on the road
 
02:49:39.889 --> 02:49:39.899 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:49:44.929 --> 02:49:44.939 align:start position:0%
having these special events which
 
02:49:47.230 --> 02:49:47.240 align:start position:0%
uh our annual or
 
02:49:51.889 --> 02:49:51.899 align:start position:0%
not annual uh for vintage vehicles or
 
02:49:54.830 --> 02:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
not vintage vehicles for competition
 
02:49:58.070 --> 02:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
vehicles or not competition vehicles
 
02:50:01.070 --> 02:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
seeing them on the roadway is shocking
 
02:50:01.080 --> 02:50:02.450 align:start position:0%
seeing them on the roadway is shocking
and

02:50:02.450 --> 02:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:50:02.460 --> 02:50:03.410 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:50:03.410 --> 02:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:07.190 --> 02:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
and having them louder not only at the
 
02:50:09.410 --> 02:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
event but driving through your
 
02:50:12.710 --> 02:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
neighborhood is shocking
 
02:50:15.590 --> 02:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
um and I I would ask
 
02:50:18.050 --> 02:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
um I I actually wanted some
 
02:50:20.690 --> 02:50:20.700 align:start position:0%
clarification because it seemed as
 
02:50:24.170 --> 02:50:24.180 align:start position:0%
though that some of these events would
 
02:50:29.570 --> 02:50:29.580 align:start position:0%
allow for operation well after sunset
 
02:50:32.150 --> 02:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
um and in the bill as I read it and
 
02:50:34.309 --> 02:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm missing something maybe
 
02:50:36.490 --> 02:50:36.500 align:start position:0%
there's something further in the rules
 
02:50:40.670 --> 02:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
it said that the operation would be a
 
02:50:44.030 --> 02:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
half an hour after Sunset and a half an
 
02:50:45.950 --> 02:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
hour before sunrise
 
02:50:49.730 --> 02:50:49.740 align:start position:0%
so that means no operation a half an
 
02:50:54.010 --> 02:50:54.020 align:start position:0%
hour after Sunset but
 
02:50:59.150 --> 02:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
fireworks usually end well after Sunset
 
02:51:01.550 --> 02:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm a little confused by that
 
02:51:01.560 --> 02:51:03.349 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm a little confused by that
piece

02:51:03.349 --> 02:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
piece
 
02:51:03.359 --> 02:51:04.790 align:start position:0%
piece
um

02:51:04.790 --> 02:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:07.250 --> 02:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
02:51:10.070 --> 02:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
um my last question what what was that
 
02:51:12.349 --> 02:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I wrote them down
 
02:51:12.359 --> 02:51:14.389 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I wrote them down
um

02:51:14.389 --> 02:51:14.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:18.469 --> 02:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
oh uh we had in the past we did support
 
02:51:21.349 --> 02:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
the commission and I think
 
02:51:21.359 --> 02:51:22.309 align:start position:0%
the commission and I think
um

02:51:22.309 --> 02:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:24.530 --> 02:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
maybe section three isn't ready for
 
02:51:29.030 --> 02:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
prime time yet and and uh it might be
 
02:51:31.730 --> 02:51:31.740 align:start position:0%
appropriate to allow the commission
 
02:51:36.050 --> 02:51:36.060 align:start position:0%
to spend some time with this idea of
 
02:51:39.290 --> 02:51:39.300 align:start position:0%
expanding the permits
 
02:51:42.590 --> 02:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
um and and have some further thought on
 
02:51:45.349 --> 02:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
that uh and with that I'll conclude my
 
02:51:50.450 --> 02:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:52.790 --> 02:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:51:59.210 --> 02:51:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:01.610 --> 02:52:01.620 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly uh thank you chair
 
02:52:02.809 --> 02:52:02.819 align:start position:0%
I'll just clear up that that
 
02:52:04.250 --> 02:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
clarification so the half hour before
 
02:52:06.650 --> 02:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
Sunset to have our side so by by Statute
 
02:52:08.809 --> 02:52:08.819 align:start position:0%
my understanding by Statute they are
 
02:52:11.630 --> 02:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
automatically blocked from that period
 
02:52:13.490 --> 02:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
of time so this like that's what it's
 
02:52:16.370 --> 02:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
saying that the the permit could allow
 
02:52:19.429 --> 02:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
them to operate During the period uh the
 
02:52:23.389 --> 02:52:23.399 align:start position:0%
nighttime period okay okay thank you for
 
02:52:25.010 --> 02:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
that I'm sure you're not the only one so
 
02:52:28.990 --> 02:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
just to clear that up thank you
 
02:52:31.309 --> 02:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
got it
 
02:52:33.889 --> 02:52:33.899 align:start position:0%
anyone else thank you
 
02:52:36.230 --> 02:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:52:39.590 --> 02:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
seeing no other cards
 
02:52:39.600 --> 02:52:41.750 align:start position:0%
seeing no other cards
we'll

02:52:41.750 --> 02:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
02:52:43.670 --> 02:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
declare the hearing
 
02:52:43.680 --> 02:52:48.110 align:start position:0%
declare the hearing
closed

02:52:48.110 --> 02:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:50.210 --> 02:52:50.220 align:start position:0%
that's that's what happens when you
 
02:52:53.450 --> 02:52:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:56.889 --> 02:52:56.899 align:start position:0%
yeah which I might gavel
 
02:52:59.630 --> 02:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
underneath here leave it in your drawer
 
02:53:01.730 --> 02:53:01.740 align:start position:0%
lock it in your little girl somebody
 
02:53:03.410 --> 02:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
will steal it but you can lock it
 
02:53:05.929 --> 02:53:05.939 align:start position:0%
there's a lock oh yeah that's true
 
02:53:07.969 --> 02:53:07.979 align:start position:0%
actually I don't know actually I got
 
02:53:10.269 --> 02:53:10.279 align:start position:0%
them in your wallet
 
02:53:13.610 --> 02:53:13.620 align:start position:0%
yeah but that's not I don't I don't have
 
02:53:15.530 --> 02:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
a key that I just did a drawers in there
 
02:53:18.110 --> 02:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
yeah there's a little key I I know but I
 
02:53:21.050 --> 02:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
don't I got it
 
02:53:21.060 --> 02:53:27.830 align:start position:0%
don't I got it
exactly

02:53:27.830 --> 02:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:29.630 --> 02:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
you know normally if they want to steal
 
02:53:37.090 --> 02:53:37.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:37.010 --> 04:04:37.020 align:start position:0%

oh ah
 
04:04:44.450 --> 04:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
missed call yeah potential spam

you know
 
04:06:03.349 --> 04:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
the bill itself in terms of what it
 
04:06:05.210 --> 04:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
amends in State Statute is is fairly
 
04:06:07.370 --> 04:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
simple if you look on the second page
 
04:06:07.380 --> 04:06:08.750 align:start position:0%

here

04:06:08.750 --> 04:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:06:08.760 --> 04:06:09.710 align:start position:0%
here
um

04:06:09.710 --> 04:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:11.330 --> 04:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
under the land and Community Heritage
 
04:06:12.950 --> 04:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
investment program you'll see the list
 
04:06:14.990 --> 04:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
of things that are eligible resources
 
04:06:17.170 --> 04:06:17.180 align:start position:0%
and a criteria by which they are
 
04:06:20.150 --> 04:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
evaluated and you'll see what it's doing
 
04:06:22.429 --> 04:06:22.439 align:start position:0%
here is adding biodiverse
 
04:06:25.130 --> 04:06:25.140 align:start position:0%
areas to the other kinds of things and
 
04:06:27.229 --> 04:06:27.239 align:start position:0%
considerations that can be used in this
 
04:06:30.290 --> 04:06:30.300 align:start position:0%

04:06:30.300 --> 04:06:32.269 align:start position:0%

04:06:32.269 --> 04:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:06:34.010 --> 04:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
um so but I'd like to back up from there
 
04:06:38.769 --> 04:06:38.779 align:start position:0%
as to why this is a useful tool for
 
04:06:41.450 --> 04:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
l-chip and potentially other areas of
 
04:06:43.849 --> 04:06:43.859 align:start position:0%
state that the government that deal with
 
04:06:45.950 --> 04:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
land conservation to be able to consider
 
04:06:45.960 --> 04:06:47.870 align:start position:0%
land conservation to be able to consider
biodiversity

04:06:47.870 --> 04:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
biodiversity
 
04:06:52.550 --> 04:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
and um so the pre the reasons for this
 
04:06:55.070 --> 04:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
are related to the kind of evolution of
 
04:06:56.929 --> 04:06:56.939 align:start position:0%
our understanding of how our environment
 
04:06:59.450 --> 04:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
works and how our ecological systems
 
04:06:59.460 --> 04:07:00.349 align:start position:0%
works and how our ecological systems
work

04:07:00.349 --> 04:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:07:03.410 --> 04:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
you know you look back 20 30 40 years 50
 
04:07:05.570 --> 04:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
years ago under President Nixon and the
 
04:07:08.030 --> 04:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
first efforts that we had to preserve
 
04:07:10.309 --> 04:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
endangered species and wetlands and so
 
04:07:12.290 --> 04:07:12.300 align:start position:0%
forth that tend to be focused on that
 
04:07:14.929 --> 04:07:14.939 align:start position:0%
endangered species we have lists of them
 
04:07:16.969 --> 04:07:16.979 align:start position:0%
State endangered federally endangered
 
04:07:18.950 --> 04:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
and we have certain protections for them
 
04:07:20.510 --> 04:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
that deal with the environment the
 
04:07:23.210 --> 04:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
habitats that they're in and then of
 
04:07:26.349 --> 04:07:26.359 align:start position:0%
course when all the concerns about water
 
04:07:29.170 --> 04:07:29.180 align:start position:0%
resources and wanting to preserve
 
04:07:32.210 --> 04:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
wetlands and other kind of special areas
 
04:07:34.790 --> 04:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
that those two that became a focus of a
 
04:07:36.950 --> 04:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
lot of a lot of legislation so you see
 
04:07:38.570 --> 04:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
kind of an evolution there
 
04:07:40.670 --> 04:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
and then we began to use words like you
 
04:07:42.769 --> 04:07:42.779 align:start position:0%
know ecological and environmental to try
 
04:07:45.290 --> 04:07:45.300 align:start position:0%
to have some understanding of just what
 
04:07:47.630 --> 04:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
we're getting at that is a value in
 
04:07:51.110 --> 04:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
keeping our landscape healthy for New
 
04:07:54.110 --> 04:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and for future Generations so
 
04:07:56.689 --> 04:07:56.699 align:start position:0%
over the last 20 30 years the concept of
 
04:07:59.630 --> 04:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
biodiversity has emerged as one that
 
04:08:01.969 --> 04:08:01.979 align:start position:0%
addresses the larger the larger picture
 
04:08:05.269 --> 04:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
in some very useful ways and that's why
 
04:08:07.550 --> 04:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
you have this definition at the bottom
 
04:08:07.560 --> 04:08:08.330 align:start position:0%
you have this definition at the bottom
of

04:08:08.330 --> 04:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:08:11.809 --> 04:08:11.819 align:start position:0%
on page one and two which is the kind of
 
04:08:13.610 --> 04:08:13.620 align:start position:0%
standard operating definition that's
 
04:08:15.229 --> 04:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
being used as a you know large
 
04:08:15.239 --> 04:08:16.490 align:start position:0%
being used as a you know large
International

04:08:16.490 --> 04:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
International
 
04:08:20.030 --> 04:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
body 192 Nations that are working on
 
04:08:22.610 --> 04:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
biodiversity conventions and guidelines
 
04:08:25.070 --> 04:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
that countries can come together to work
 
04:08:27.769 --> 04:08:27.779 align:start position:0%
on in individual Nations can use some
 
04:08:30.530 --> 04:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
guidances as well
 
04:08:32.510 --> 04:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
um so biodiversity then you'll see the
 
04:08:34.309 --> 04:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
comprehensiveness here means all the
 
04:08:36.590 --> 04:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
species including plants bacteria
 
04:08:38.150 --> 04:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
animals and humans in a particular
 
04:08:40.910 --> 04:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
region habitat or ecosystem they work
 
04:08:43.189 --> 04:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
together to maintain balance and support
 
04:08:43.199 --> 04:08:45.110 align:start position:0%
together to maintain balance and support
life

04:08:45.110 --> 04:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
life
 
04:08:48.010 --> 04:08:48.020 align:start position:0%
includes variability within those
 
04:08:51.830 --> 04:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
species it gets down into the kind of
 
04:08:54.349 --> 04:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
very roots of life in the you know
 
04:08:56.450 --> 04:08:56.460 align:start position:0%

distribution over place and time
 
04:09:02.929 --> 04:09:02.939 align:start position:0%
I just want to point out a couple of
 
04:09:05.630 --> 04:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
things one that it is very comprehensive
 
04:09:07.070 --> 04:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
and understanding if you want a healthy
 
04:09:09.290 --> 04:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
environment you've got to have all these
 
04:09:11.870 --> 04:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
components of a healthy but for me I
 
04:09:13.670 --> 04:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
think a really important thing here is
 
04:09:13.680 --> 04:09:15.050 align:start position:0%
think a really important thing here is
notice

04:09:15.050 --> 04:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
notice
 
04:09:18.469 --> 04:09:18.479 align:start position:0%
um in the first line there uh last time
 
04:09:21.170 --> 04:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
I checked humans are animals right and
 
04:09:24.490 --> 04:09:24.500 align:start position:0%
it recognizes that humans are part of
 
04:09:26.990 --> 04:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
biodiversity what's interesting to me
 
04:09:28.490 --> 04:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
about that is we kind of used to think
 
04:09:30.530 --> 04:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
about you set aside land and you kind of
 
04:09:32.750 --> 04:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
basically keep people off or you know
 
04:09:34.370 --> 04:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
imagine that you can conserve something
 
04:09:36.889 --> 04:09:36.899 align:start position:0%
in a pristine Wilderness condition but
 
04:09:38.689 --> 04:09:38.699 align:start position:0%
it's pretty clear now it's very hard to
 
04:09:40.309 --> 04:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
find a place on Earth
 
04:09:42.050 --> 04:09:42.060 align:start position:0%
or in the oceans that has not been
 
04:09:44.330 --> 04:09:44.340 align:start position:0%
impacted by human presence right so it
 
04:09:46.130 --> 04:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
kind of makes on you know that we ought
 
04:09:47.570 --> 04:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
to comprehensively understand what is
 
04:09:49.130 --> 04:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
the impact of humans in these
 
04:09:50.990 --> 04:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
environments as well and to come to
 
04:09:52.550 --> 04:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
understand that and I think that it's
 
04:09:54.290 --> 04:09:54.300 align:start position:0%
very interesting evolution of our
 
04:09:56.330 --> 04:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
understanding that you know biodiversity
 
04:09:58.610 --> 04:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
is everywhere and we're everywhere and
 
04:10:00.290 --> 04:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
the impacts of humans are everywhere so
 
04:10:03.050 --> 04:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
this is a useful book there
 
04:10:05.389 --> 04:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
now let me back into I want to come back
 
04:10:06.950 --> 04:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
to that definition in a minute um but
 
04:10:08.809 --> 04:10:08.819 align:start position:0%
let me back into
 
04:10:11.090 --> 04:10:11.100 align:start position:0%
um the findings here which as you know
 
04:10:13.309 --> 04:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
don't become part of Statute but they
 
04:10:15.769 --> 04:10:15.779 align:start position:0%
offer some kind of explanatory reason
 
04:10:17.630 --> 04:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
for why this is
 
04:10:20.090 --> 04:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
important two things that are noticed in
 
04:10:23.510 --> 04:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
the finding first species loss
 
04:10:26.389 --> 04:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
and then secondly the loss of
 
04:10:30.229 --> 04:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
populations and the figures there are
 
04:10:33.469 --> 04:10:33.479 align:start position:0%
rather staggering that there is a 69
 
04:10:33.479 --> 04:10:34.570 align:start position:0%
rather staggering that there is a 69
percent

04:10:34.570 --> 04:10:34.580 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:10:37.729 --> 04:10:37.739 align:start position:0%
loss of populations of animal and this
 
04:10:39.530 --> 04:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
is you know it's a variable over place
 
04:10:41.150 --> 04:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
but it's pretty much confirmed in terms
 
04:10:43.670 --> 04:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
of the num the populations in a lot of
 
04:10:46.429 --> 04:10:46.439 align:start position:0%
uh species in New Hampshire
 
04:10:46.439 --> 04:10:47.229 align:start position:0%
uh species in New Hampshire
um

04:10:47.229 --> 04:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:49.610 --> 04:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
and then uh the alteration of
 
04:10:49.620 --> 04:10:51.229 align:start position:0%
and then uh the alteration of
environments

04:10:51.229 --> 04:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
environments
 
04:10:53.090 --> 04:10:53.100 align:start position:0%
um you know I do a lot of work on you
 
04:10:55.309 --> 04:10:55.319 align:start position:0%
know microplastics and pfas and all
 
04:10:56.870 --> 04:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
those things and you bet you can find
 
04:10:59.090 --> 04:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
evidence of alteration of an environment
 
04:11:01.670 --> 04:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
in very various ways
 
04:11:04.490 --> 04:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
um and then secondly starting on uh line
 
04:11:04.500 --> 04:11:05.689 align:start position:0%
um and then secondly starting on uh line
11

04:11:05.689 --> 04:11:05.699 align:start position:0%
11
 
04:11:07.370 --> 04:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
um I think some pretty core principles
 
04:11:08.929 --> 04:11:08.939 align:start position:0%
that you know what are we most value
 
04:11:10.849 --> 04:11:10.859 align:start position:0%
about New Hampshire why do we The
 
04:11:13.189 --> 04:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
Landmark weeks act back in 1911 why did
 
04:11:14.389 --> 04:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Take the Lead National
 
04:11:16.610 --> 04:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
this because we recognize that for New
 
04:11:18.830 --> 04:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what counts as a healthy a
 
04:11:20.570 --> 04:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
healthy and clean environment I mean
 
04:11:22.250 --> 04:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
that's that's why people are here and
 
04:11:24.830 --> 04:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
and don't want to make sure that our our
 
04:11:26.510 --> 04:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
children can have a healthy and clean
 
04:11:30.050 --> 04:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
environment as as well and that you know
 
04:11:32.510 --> 04:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
as our It also says you know that our
 
04:11:32.520 --> 04:11:33.349 align:start position:0%
as our It also says you know that our
state

04:11:33.349 --> 04:11:33.359 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:11:36.290 --> 04:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
certainly many branches of our state are
 
04:11:38.689 --> 04:11:38.699 align:start position:0%
in the business of making sure we have a
 
04:11:41.330 --> 04:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
healthy and clean environment that is
 
04:11:43.010 --> 04:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
useful for hunters Hunters Fishers
 
04:11:43.020 --> 04:11:44.269 align:start position:0%
useful for hunters Hunters Fishers
hikers

04:11:44.269 --> 04:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
hikers
 
04:11:44.279 --> 04:11:45.229 align:start position:0%
hikers
um

04:11:45.229 --> 04:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:47.929 --> 04:11:47.939 align:start position:0%
biosystem resources like clean water and
 
04:11:50.210 --> 04:11:50.220 align:start position:0%
and so forth so you see I've kind of
 
04:11:52.070 --> 04:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
backed into you know why biodiversity
 
04:11:54.410 --> 04:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
and what we look at it and what it means
 
04:11:57.469 --> 04:11:57.479 align:start position:0%
for the potential threats to America uh
 
04:11:58.969 --> 04:11:58.979 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's environment and then
 
04:12:01.130 --> 04:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
also the value of biodiverse environment
 
04:12:03.170 --> 04:12:03.180 align:start position:0%
let me come back to the definition I
 
04:12:05.510 --> 04:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
know we're going to hear from some folks
 
04:12:07.130 --> 04:12:07.140 align:start position:0%
that if we're putting this in statute
 
04:12:09.469 --> 04:12:09.479 align:start position:0%
that maybe we ought to work on this
 
04:12:09.479 --> 04:12:10.370 align:start position:0%
that maybe we ought to work on this
language

04:12:10.370 --> 04:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
language
 
04:12:12.950 --> 04:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
um a little bit and uh I understand that
 
04:12:15.889 --> 04:12:15.899 align:start position:0%
I think that um you know for me what was
 
04:12:17.809 --> 04:12:17.819 align:start position:0%
important in this bill was having
 
04:12:19.849 --> 04:12:19.859 align:start position:0%
somewhere in statute a definition of
 
04:12:22.429 --> 04:12:22.439 align:start position:0%
biodiversity and I suspect that in the
 
04:12:24.889 --> 04:12:24.899 align:start position:0%
future it'll become useful to more areas
 
04:12:26.990 --> 04:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
of state government but let's get that
 
04:12:29.090 --> 04:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
definition right so I said this is the
 
04:12:31.490 --> 04:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
kind of standard one that is being used
 
04:12:34.370 --> 04:12:34.380 align:start position:0%
by government agencies and and so and
 
04:12:37.550 --> 04:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
and so forth um but you know maybe uh
 
04:12:38.990 --> 04:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to hear from some of our
 
04:12:41.510 --> 04:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
folks that uh this might need a little
 
04:12:42.590 --> 04:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
bit of work
 
04:12:45.170 --> 04:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
I thought I mentioned one last thing
 
04:12:46.490 --> 04:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
um one way that a lot of us have
 
04:12:48.229 --> 04:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
probably have heard about biodiversity
 
04:12:50.689 --> 04:12:50.699 align:start position:0%
is the commitment to preserve you know
 
04:12:52.969 --> 04:12:52.979 align:start position:0%
30 by 30 30 percent of New Hampshire of
 
04:12:55.070 --> 04:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh the country's
 
04:12:57.170 --> 04:12:57.180 align:start position:0%
um Land and Water Resources by the year
 
04:12:57.180 --> 04:12:59.030 align:start position:0%
um Land and Water Resources by the year
2030.

04:12:59.030 --> 04:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
2030.
 
04:13:01.910 --> 04:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
um and this is a national initiative and
 
04:13:04.910 --> 04:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
an international one as well uh and and
 
04:13:07.849 --> 04:13:07.859 align:start position:0%
you can understand how that that has
 
04:13:09.469 --> 04:13:09.479 align:start position:0%
become a vehicle
 
04:13:10.969 --> 04:13:10.979 align:start position:0%
um if you go online and look at some of
 
04:13:13.610 --> 04:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
those things for suggesting that we need
 
04:13:16.429 --> 04:13:16.439 align:start position:0%
to protect biodiverse areas in terms of
 
04:13:18.110 --> 04:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
that 30 by 30 you know Hampshire's kind
 
04:13:20.689 --> 04:13:20.699 align:start position:0%
of there already so it's an aspirational
 
04:13:22.849 --> 04:13:22.859 align:start position:0%
goal but you look at all the land that's
 
04:13:24.650 --> 04:13:24.660 align:start position:0%
under conservation here and how we're
 
04:13:26.510 --> 04:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
handling our Water Resources we're
 
04:13:28.130 --> 04:13:28.140 align:start position:0%
pretty good on 30 by 30 but I just
 
04:13:29.570 --> 04:13:29.580 align:start position:0%
thought I'd mention it because that is
 
04:13:31.309 --> 04:13:31.319 align:start position:0%
that's something that you you know you
 
04:13:32.809 --> 04:13:32.819 align:start position:0%
come out from this from New Hampshire
 
04:13:34.729 --> 04:13:34.739 align:start position:0%
and come out a little bit and you look
 
04:13:36.110 --> 04:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
at this you'll see that people are
 
04:13:37.849 --> 04:13:37.859 align:start position:0%
talking about that as well so Mr
 
04:13:39.110 --> 04:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
chairman once again more than three
 
04:13:40.790 --> 04:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
minutes but uh thank you for your
 
04:13:45.729 --> 04:13:45.739 align:start position:0%
Indulgence not a so any questions uh
 
04:13:48.889 --> 04:13:48.899 align:start position:0%
comments by people from the
 
04:13:51.170 --> 04:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
representative rung
 
04:13:54.050 --> 04:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
and representative beloved thank you Mr
 
04:13:55.490 --> 04:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you senator for
 
04:13:57.229 --> 04:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:13:58.969 --> 04:13:58.979 align:start position:0%
um this bill was this bill was amended
 
04:14:00.650 --> 04:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
by in the Senate
 
04:14:02.389 --> 04:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
um can you explain
 
04:14:04.550 --> 04:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
um the background of what what changed
 
04:14:06.469 --> 04:14:06.479 align:start position:0%
what uh was made with through the
 
04:14:06.479 --> 04:14:07.670 align:start position:0%
what uh was made with through the
amendment

04:14:07.670 --> 04:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:14:07.680 --> 04:14:09.490 align:start position:0%
amendment
everything

04:14:09.490 --> 04:14:09.500 align:start position:0%
everything
 
04:14:11.990 --> 04:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
I was afraid something look the original
 
04:14:12.000 --> 04:14:13.309 align:start position:0%
I was afraid something look the original
bill

04:14:13.309 --> 04:14:13.319 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:14:15.769 --> 04:14:15.779 align:start position:0%
I thought to myself okay if we're going
 
04:14:17.330 --> 04:14:17.340 align:start position:0%
to do biodiversity let's do it
 
04:14:20.450 --> 04:14:20.460 align:start position:0%
everywhere and uh I had gone through
 
04:14:22.370 --> 04:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
statute and everywhere I saw some
 
04:14:24.710 --> 04:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
preservation or Municipal preservation
 
04:14:26.750 --> 04:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
of land I said let's put biodiversity in
 
04:14:30.170 --> 04:14:30.180 align:start position:0%
there I also um look pretty closely at
 
04:14:32.809 --> 04:14:32.819 align:start position:0%
the ways in which you know biodiversity
 
04:14:35.450 --> 04:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
which potential recognition of
 
04:14:38.030 --> 04:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
you know uh if we if we valued
 
04:14:40.010 --> 04:14:40.020 align:start position:0%
biodiversity what kind of protections do
 
04:14:41.630 --> 04:14:41.640 align:start position:0%
they have and I was looking at animals
 
04:14:43.010 --> 04:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
and you know private action to protect
 
04:14:44.389 --> 04:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
your animals and private action to
 
04:14:46.370 --> 04:14:46.380 align:start position:0%
protect your land so
 
04:14:48.469 --> 04:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
um that bill
 
04:14:50.269 --> 04:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
um was the trial balloon that came down
 
04:14:51.769 --> 04:14:51.779 align:start position:0%
pretty hard
 
04:14:53.929 --> 04:14:53.939 align:start position:0%
um and came back to to this which I
 
04:14:55.550 --> 04:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
think does the essentials it lets us
 
04:14:57.170 --> 04:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
talk about biodiversity and why that's
 
04:14:59.630 --> 04:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
valuable and provides a useful tool for
 
04:15:01.729 --> 04:15:01.739 align:start position:0%
one program so
 
04:15:04.490 --> 04:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
um that's the way legislation goes and I
 
04:15:06.170 --> 04:15:06.180 align:start position:0%
think the wisdom of the Senate there was
 
04:15:08.450 --> 04:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
and the agencies was very helpful in
 
04:15:11.269 --> 04:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
directing Senator Waters back to Earth
 
04:15:11.279 --> 04:15:14.689 align:start position:0%
directing Senator Waters back to Earth
foreign

04:15:14.689 --> 04:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:17.450 --> 04:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator I I've been there I've
 
04:15:19.550 --> 04:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
had lead balloons too
 
04:15:22.490 --> 04:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
um now I think you kind of touched upon
 
04:15:25.309 --> 04:15:25.319 align:start position:0%
this but the definition of biodiversity
 
04:15:29.510 --> 04:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's online 26 of page one did is
 
04:15:32.450 --> 04:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
there a source that you you got that
 
04:15:36.050 --> 04:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:39.110 --> 04:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
I I wish I had it on in my tip I have if
 
04:15:41.450 --> 04:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
you'd search this online you will find
 
04:15:41.460 --> 04:15:42.950 align:start position:0%
you'd search this online you will find
um uh

04:15:42.950 --> 04:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
04:15:46.490 --> 04:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
you know various National
 
04:15:49.309 --> 04:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
um entities that work on biological
 
04:15:52.010 --> 04:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
diversity and this has been going on for
 
04:15:53.630 --> 04:15:53.640 align:start position:0%
decades and this is the kind of
 
04:15:57.469 --> 04:15:57.479 align:start position:0%
definition is offered as a guideline
 
04:15:59.809 --> 04:15:59.819 align:start position:0%
um I I participated in United Nations
 
04:15:59.819 --> 04:16:01.130 align:start position:0%
um I I participated in United Nations
convention

04:16:01.130 --> 04:16:01.140 align:start position:0%
convention
 
04:16:03.349 --> 04:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
of the parties and biodiversity up in
 
04:16:05.809 --> 04:16:05.819 align:start position:0%
Montreal where an international 192
 
04:16:07.670 --> 04:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
countries came up with a custom General
 
04:16:09.950 --> 04:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
guidelines and this is not their
 
04:16:11.750 --> 04:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
definition but it's it's in the ballpark
 
04:16:14.030 --> 04:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
okay so I wanted to put something here
 
04:16:17.389 --> 04:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
that seemed to be the kind of accepted
 
04:16:19.969 --> 04:16:19.979 align:start position:0%
parameters of it and I've kind of tried
 
04:16:22.250 --> 04:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
out on the parameters it's every all the
 
04:16:23.809 --> 04:16:23.819 align:start position:0%
all of the species
 
04:16:26.210 --> 04:16:26.220 align:start position:0%
and the inclusion of humans
 
04:16:28.429 --> 04:16:28.439 align:start position:0%
that's that's the core of all the
 
04:16:30.530 --> 04:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
definitions and that's what you got here
 
04:16:35.689 --> 04:16:35.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:38.210 --> 04:16:38.220 align:start position:0%
is that I love it thank you Mr chair uh
 
04:16:41.330 --> 04:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters did you mention an act
 
04:16:45.710 --> 04:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
that was passed in New Hampshire in 1911
 
04:16:47.450 --> 04:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
I hope I think of the date right it's
 
04:16:49.189 --> 04:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
the weeks act that's what it's called
 
04:16:50.990 --> 04:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean hasn't actually created it
 
04:16:52.490 --> 04:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
created the White Mountain National
 
04:16:54.590 --> 04:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
Forest I mean it's a national it's a
 
04:16:57.530 --> 04:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
federal act but a derived from here
 
04:16:59.450 --> 04:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
and the impetus is kind of interesting
 
04:16:59.460 --> 04:17:00.410 align:start position:0%
and the impetus is kind of interesting
because

04:17:00.410 --> 04:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:17:02.710 --> 04:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
um there was massive logging up north
 
04:17:04.790 --> 04:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
big fires
 
04:17:07.010 --> 04:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
and as with the Adirondacks it became
 
04:17:09.050 --> 04:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
recognized that these these places were
 
04:17:11.090 --> 04:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
sponges and if we wanted to have a clean
 
04:17:12.849 --> 04:17:12.859 align:start position:0%
water supply for the rest of your state
 
04:17:15.410 --> 04:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
you'd better offer some protection so
 
04:17:17.570 --> 04:17:17.580 align:start position:0%
the weeks act um established the
 
04:17:19.309 --> 04:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
principle of uh you know established the
 
04:17:20.809 --> 04:17:20.819 align:start position:0%
White Mountain National Forest and set
 
04:17:23.630 --> 04:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
the pattern for subsequent ones as well
 
04:17:27.229 --> 04:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
and I mean that's that's why we have the
 
04:17:28.610 --> 04:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
beautiful Northern Forest we have
 
04:17:32.269 --> 04:17:32.279 align:start position:0%
because that biodiversity was preserved
 
04:17:32.279 --> 04:17:33.229 align:start position:0%
because that biodiversity was preserved
um

04:17:33.229 --> 04:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:35.830 --> 04:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
go New Hampshire
 
04:17:38.750 --> 04:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions by
 
04:17:43.309 --> 04:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:49.130 --> 04:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
I'm thank you Mr chair thank you senator
 
04:17:51.370 --> 04:17:51.380 align:start position:0%
I taught biology at Plymouth state for
 
04:17:53.929 --> 04:17:53.939 align:start position:0%
quite a few years
 
04:17:56.269 --> 04:17:56.279 align:start position:0%
um but I retired about
 
04:17:59.090 --> 04:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
15 years ago
 
04:18:03.229 --> 04:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
by training I'm a marine psychologist
 
04:18:06.170 --> 04:18:06.180 align:start position:0%
that means that I study seaweed
 
04:18:10.490 --> 04:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
seaweed is not a plant it's an Elga
 
04:18:17.269 --> 04:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:21.469 --> 04:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
the five kingdoms of living things
 
04:18:23.210 --> 04:18:23.220 align:start position:0%
seems to me
 
04:18:25.370 --> 04:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
to not be fair
 
04:18:29.510 --> 04:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:32.929 --> 04:18:32.939 align:start position:0%
um and I think that fungiology should be
 
04:18:35.929 --> 04:18:35.939 align:start position:0%
included in that definition yeah
 
04:18:37.849 --> 04:18:37.859 align:start position:0%
um it that's just my opinion I'm just
 
04:18:40.250 --> 04:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
asking you know could we look into this
 
04:18:42.650 --> 04:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
a little further and
 
04:18:42.660 --> 04:18:44.090 align:start position:0%
a little further and
Maybe

04:18:44.090 --> 04:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
Maybe
 
04:18:46.969 --> 04:18:46.979 align:start position:0%
figure out whether those can be added or
 
04:18:46.979 --> 04:18:48.130 align:start position:0%
figure out whether those can be added or
not

04:18:48.130 --> 04:18:48.140 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:18:51.050 --> 04:18:51.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question and um you
 
04:18:52.910 --> 04:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
can tell me now I was thinking you know
 
04:18:54.110 --> 04:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
I was looking back at the language of
 
04:18:55.729 --> 04:18:55.739 align:start position:0%
the bill and it says biodiversity
 
04:18:57.349 --> 04:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
includes the variability among living
 
04:18:59.210 --> 04:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
organisms from all sources including
 
04:19:01.309 --> 04:19:01.319 align:start position:0%
terrestrial marine and other Aquatic you
 
04:19:04.790 --> 04:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
know so um what we have here
 
04:19:06.830 --> 04:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
um and then you'll see in line 30
 
04:19:08.870 --> 04:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
including variations so that that line
 
04:19:11.269 --> 04:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
down there is not meant to be exclusive
 
04:19:13.550 --> 04:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
you see what I'm saying those are very
 
04:19:16.490 --> 04:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
much yeah huge pieces of our
 
04:19:18.530 --> 04:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
biodiversity yeah yeah people who live
 
04:19:21.050 --> 04:19:21.060 align:start position:0%
on the Seacoast
 
04:19:23.870 --> 04:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
probably would agree that seaweed
 
04:19:25.429 --> 04:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
ought to be included in here that's very
 
04:19:28.189 --> 04:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
important I mean I have Marine in here
 
04:19:31.670 --> 04:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
but in in this and then including I mean
 
04:19:33.769 --> 04:19:33.779 align:start position:0%
you could add something there but the
 
04:19:35.450 --> 04:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
question I was going to ask is that is
 
04:19:37.490 --> 04:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
fungi a living organism or not
 
04:19:40.189 --> 04:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
yes okay good I was a little confused so
 
04:19:42.170 --> 04:19:42.180 align:start position:0%
if you think there's some clarification
 
04:19:44.510 --> 04:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
addition here of course I the language
 
04:19:46.969 --> 04:19:46.979 align:start position:0%
is meant to be incorporated and
 
04:19:49.269 --> 04:19:49.279 align:start position:0%
inclusive but if it needs more thank you
 
04:19:52.610 --> 04:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
representative you got to go in to the
 
04:19:54.889 --> 04:19:54.899 align:start position:0%
chair with these questions yeah excuse
 
04:19:56.929 --> 04:19:56.939 align:start position:0%
me Mr chair
 
04:20:00.229 --> 04:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
yeah we're in a hearing you go
 
04:20:02.750 --> 04:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
I don't usually have questions I know I
 
04:20:02.760 --> 04:20:04.309 align:start position:0%
I don't usually have questions I know I
know

04:20:04.309 --> 04:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:20:06.469 --> 04:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
but then but that's if you want to
 
04:20:09.050 --> 04:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
continue you can but you continue
 
04:20:12.170 --> 04:20:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:15.229 --> 04:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
any other question representative harp
 
04:20:17.689 --> 04:20:17.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Senator
 
04:20:19.189 --> 04:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
um on some of your other bills you
 
04:20:21.530 --> 04:20:21.540 align:start position:0%
always I think my memory says you used
 
04:20:23.630 --> 04:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
to mention who asked you to bring this I
 
04:20:25.490 --> 04:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
didn't say any notes Here did somebody
 
04:20:27.650 --> 04:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
ask you to bring this bill up or is this
 
04:20:29.330 --> 04:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
just your bill
 
04:20:32.090 --> 04:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
it's time to blame it's all me as I said
 
04:20:34.969 --> 04:20:34.979 align:start position:0%
I have been I've been working on um
 
04:20:37.130 --> 04:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
biodiversity environmental issues you
 
04:20:38.990 --> 04:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
know for for
 
04:20:41.389 --> 04:20:41.399 align:start position:0%
the last 14 years I've been in the
 
04:20:43.790 --> 04:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
legislature 15 years
 
04:20:46.250 --> 04:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
um and uh particularly issues related to
 
04:20:49.370 --> 04:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
Wildlife corridors habitat strongholds
 
04:20:52.070 --> 04:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
I'm on the Linux marine fisheries
 
04:20:53.150 --> 04:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
commission representative New Hampshire
 
04:20:55.189 --> 04:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
gregonian fishies from Maine to Florida
 
04:20:55.199 --> 04:20:56.689 align:start position:0%
gregonian fishies from Maine to Florida
so

04:20:56.689 --> 04:20:56.699 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:20:58.610 --> 04:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
um this is something that as I became
 
04:21:00.349 --> 04:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
aware of the national conversations
 
04:21:02.269 --> 04:21:02.279 align:start position:0%
around biodiversity I tried to put
 
04:21:07.969 --> 04:21:07.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:10.189 --> 04:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:21:11.809 --> 04:21:11.819 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Senator
 
04:21:11.819 --> 04:21:12.889 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Senator
um

04:21:12.889 --> 04:21:12.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:16.370 --> 04:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate the definitions um in the
 
04:21:19.189 --> 04:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
you know in in basically the l-chip um
 
04:21:21.710 --> 04:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
uh sex portion of the bill but I wonder
 
04:21:21.720 --> 04:21:23.210 align:start position:0%
uh sex portion of the bill but I wonder
if

04:21:23.210 --> 04:21:23.220 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:21:27.110 --> 04:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
um it's enough because as I read um as I
 
04:21:30.290 --> 04:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
read through this that you know 227 M
 
04:21:33.050 --> 04:21:33.060 align:start position:0%
which describes LG the section that
 
04:21:35.330 --> 04:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
seems to me that you're most trying to
 
04:21:39.469 --> 04:21:39.479 align:start position:0%
affect is I think is the guidelines for
 
04:21:42.889 --> 04:21:42.899 align:start position:0%
um how out chip properties are
 
04:21:48.229 --> 04:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
um evaluated and 227 M9 specifically is
 
04:21:50.870 --> 04:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
provide some guidance there and I don't
 
04:21:54.710 --> 04:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
see this this build doesn't amend uh 227
 
04:21:57.349 --> 04:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
M9 I'm wondering if it should to meet
 
04:21:58.910 --> 04:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
your goals
 
04:22:00.349 --> 04:22:00.359 align:start position:0%
well thank you you know we have the
 
04:22:03.290 --> 04:22:03.300 align:start position:0%
director of um l-chip coming up the
 
04:22:05.750 --> 04:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
reason I chose this is because
 
04:22:08.870 --> 04:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
eligible resources okay that that was
 
04:22:12.229 --> 04:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
that to me was the the place to put this
 
04:22:15.769 --> 04:22:15.779 align:start position:0%
because this is where eligible resource
 
04:22:19.309 --> 04:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
gets to find that then they can act on
 
04:22:22.309 --> 04:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
so that's why it's here but
 
04:22:23.870 --> 04:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
I hear what you're saying thank you
 
04:22:25.670 --> 04:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:22:30.110 --> 04:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:35.630 --> 04:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:38.510 --> 04:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
is it biodiversity
 
04:22:40.370 --> 04:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
like Beauty
 
04:22:40.380 --> 04:22:41.929 align:start position:0%
like Beauty
or

04:22:41.929 --> 04:22:41.939 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:22:43.729 --> 04:22:43.739 align:start position:0%
in other words it's in the eye of the
 
04:22:43.739 --> 04:22:45.590 align:start position:0%
in other words it's in the eye of the
beholder

04:22:45.590 --> 04:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
beholder
 
04:22:47.750 --> 04:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh yeah
 
04:22:47.760 --> 04:22:49.450 align:start position:0%
uh yeah
we

04:22:49.450 --> 04:22:49.460 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:22:49.460 --> 04:22:51.130 align:start position:0%
we
we

04:22:51.130 --> 04:22:51.140 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:22:54.170 --> 04:22:54.180 align:start position:0%
how do you I mean having this is a
 
04:22:56.389 --> 04:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
definition is
 
04:22:58.790 --> 04:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
not complete
 
04:23:01.309 --> 04:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
because you've just heard that the uh
 
04:23:04.010 --> 04:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
that there's there are other things that
 
04:23:06.110 --> 04:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
can be added yeah
 
04:23:09.950 --> 04:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
yeah but also the uh even if even if you
 
04:23:12.530 --> 04:23:12.540 align:start position:0%
added them they might not be complete
 
04:23:15.370 --> 04:23:15.380 align:start position:0%
simply because
 
04:23:20.030 --> 04:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
diversity is a is a concept that
 
04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
for in each individual
 
04:23:22.319 --> 04:23:24.110 align:start position:0%
for in each individual
uh

04:23:24.110 --> 04:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:23:24.120 --> 04:23:25.250 align:start position:0%
uh
yeah

04:23:25.250 --> 04:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:23:28.910 --> 04:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that and keeping
 
04:23:31.790 --> 04:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
diversity is not necessarily concept
 
04:23:34.969 --> 04:23:34.979 align:start position:0%
that for each individual I pref I don't
 
04:23:38.389 --> 04:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
I don't want to keep smallpox around if
 
04:23:40.870 --> 04:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
we can get rid of it
 
04:23:44.830 --> 04:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
there's things of that nature so
 
04:23:50.929 --> 04:23:50.939 align:start position:0%
use China if ins instill in the in in a
 
04:23:50.939 --> 04:23:52.070 align:start position:0%
use China if ins instill in the in in a
statue

04:23:52.070 --> 04:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
statue
 
04:23:56.330 --> 04:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
the uh just personal Concepts
 
04:23:59.330 --> 04:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
uh is that really what we're here for
 
04:24:00.950 --> 04:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
but that's
 
04:24:02.809 --> 04:24:02.819 align:start position:0%
thanks for the I think there are a
 
04:24:04.910 --> 04:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
couple questions there Mr chairman and
 
04:24:07.849 --> 04:24:07.859 align:start position:0%
um thank you for them and I'll answer it
 
04:24:09.830 --> 04:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
um you know if you think about the
 
04:24:11.630 --> 04:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
language that we do use in statute
 
04:24:15.410 --> 04:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
currently we've got words like ecology
 
04:24:18.590 --> 04:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
we've got words like environment
 
04:24:21.349 --> 04:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
and I think those are very amorphous
 
04:24:23.990 --> 04:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
words but they have been functional in
 
04:24:26.269 --> 04:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
statute for a long time
 
04:24:28.729 --> 04:24:28.739 align:start position:0%
I think biodiversity actually has the
 
04:24:30.229 --> 04:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
benefit of being
 
04:24:30.239 --> 04:24:30.830 align:start position:0%
benefit of being
um

04:24:30.830 --> 04:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:32.750 --> 04:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
more particular
 
04:24:32.760 --> 04:24:34.309 align:start position:0%
more particular
because

04:24:34.309 --> 04:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:24:37.070 --> 04:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
we are working towards a definition
 
04:24:39.710 --> 04:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
which includes just with that what does
 
04:24:41.750 --> 04:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
biodiversity mean
 
04:24:43.910 --> 04:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
the bio part
 
04:24:46.070 --> 04:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
and the diversity part
 
04:24:47.809 --> 04:24:47.819 align:start position:0%
that's why the definition is here and
 
04:24:49.550 --> 04:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
that's why it's important but it's only
 
04:24:52.370 --> 04:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
important not because it reflects one
 
04:24:54.769 --> 04:24:54.779 align:start position:0%
person but because it reflects a
 
04:24:56.809 --> 04:24:56.819 align:start position:0%
consensus among many scientific
 
04:24:59.689 --> 04:24:59.699 align:start position:0%
organizations conservation folks
 
04:25:01.670 --> 04:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
04:25:01.680 --> 04:25:02.650 align:start position:0%
and so forth
um

04:25:02.650 --> 04:25:02.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:05.630 --> 04:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
and because it can be used it can be
 
04:25:08.929 --> 04:25:08.939 align:start position:0%
useful it can help guide people as they
 
04:25:11.630 --> 04:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
evaluate land and the issues that it
 
04:25:14.090 --> 04:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
faces and how you conserve it
 
04:25:17.750 --> 04:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
now do note that you know is that we do
 
04:25:19.250 --> 04:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
this as you know just kind of your
 
04:25:22.849 --> 04:25:22.859 align:start position:0%
second question about it um and I don't
 
04:25:24.290 --> 04:25:24.300 align:start position:0%
really particularly like coronavirus
 
04:25:26.170 --> 04:25:26.180 align:start position:0%
either you know so
 
04:25:29.090 --> 04:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
my mom had Polio you know and uh yeah
 
04:25:31.070 --> 04:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
that kind of biodiversity we're not too
 
04:25:32.330 --> 04:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
keen on
 
04:25:32.340 --> 04:25:33.229 align:start position:0%
keen on
um

04:25:33.229 --> 04:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:37.010 --> 04:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
but note that the the definition does
 
04:25:37.020 --> 04:25:37.969 align:start position:0%
but note that the the definition does
not

04:25:37.969 --> 04:25:37.979 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:25:41.149 --> 04:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
require any action
 
04:25:43.729 --> 04:25:43.739 align:start position:0%
it enables some action
 
04:25:46.309 --> 04:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
in terms of what l-chip will do in this
 
04:25:46.319 --> 04:25:47.750 align:start position:0%
in terms of what l-chip will do in this
bill

04:25:47.750 --> 04:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:25:50.450 --> 04:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
but that's what we do as legislators is
 
04:25:52.550 --> 04:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
that we have definitions and then we
 
04:25:54.410 --> 04:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
consider how they should be wisely
 
04:25:57.469 --> 04:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
enacted for the use by our agencies and
 
04:26:00.170 --> 04:26:00.180 align:start position:0%
for our our public so
 
04:26:02.269 --> 04:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
um I think it I think it uh it makes
 
04:26:04.250 --> 04:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
sense it'll be useful it's a good tool
 
04:26:08.330 --> 04:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
and um if we need to keep working on a
 
04:26:10.250 --> 04:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
definition before people are comfortable
 
04:26:12.469 --> 04:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
with using it then so be it that's what
 
04:26:15.410 --> 04:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
the legislative process is too
 
04:26:18.710 --> 04:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
any other questions by uh members of the
 
04:26:18.720 --> 04:26:22.429 align:start position:0%
any other questions by uh members of the
board

04:26:22.429 --> 04:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:25.429 --> 04:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
Sarah thank you yes thank you chairman
 
04:26:28.490 --> 04:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
and thank you Senator waters for your
 
04:26:32.330 --> 04:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
testimony can you expound on a little
 
04:26:34.490 --> 04:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
bit here in the methodology SEC
 
04:26:36.590 --> 04:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
methodology section
 
04:26:39.110 --> 04:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
it says this bill also creates a form
 
04:26:41.689 --> 04:26:41.699 align:start position:0%
contract to preserve the rights of
 
04:26:44.450 --> 04:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
domestic animals and wild animals can
 
04:26:46.490 --> 04:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
you explain that a little bit um that
 
04:26:48.530 --> 04:26:48.540 align:start position:0%
means thank you for your question
 
04:26:50.450 --> 04:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
um that is not relevant to the bill as
 
04:26:50.460 --> 04:26:52.429 align:start position:0%
um that is not relevant to the bill as
amended

04:26:52.429 --> 04:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
amended
 
04:26:55.189 --> 04:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
the the bill is introduced had some
 
04:26:56.809 --> 04:26:56.819 align:start position:0%
things about animals the bill is amended
 
04:26:59.330 --> 04:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with that so I I just
 
04:27:01.729 --> 04:27:01.739 align:start position:0%
if you if you if you call up the bill as
 
04:27:02.929 --> 04:27:02.939 align:start position:0%
amended you won't find out language
 
04:27:05.630 --> 04:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
anymore so but thanks thanks for
 
04:27:12.349 --> 04:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:13.670 --> 04:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I should have mentioned that
 
04:27:15.710 --> 04:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
earlier so my apologies any other
 
04:27:21.910 --> 04:27:21.920 align:start position:0%

04:28:13.910 --> 04:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
since 2000 El chip has been working hand
 
04:28:15.290 --> 04:28:15.300 align:start position:0%
in hand with New Hampshire's land
 
04:28:17.630 --> 04:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
conservation Community to protect our
 
04:28:20.330 --> 04:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
most important natural resources today
 
04:28:22.490 --> 04:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
l-chip funds have helped conserve more
 
04:28:25.250 --> 04:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
than 237 thousand acres of land across

04:28:35.389 --> 04:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
as we understand it this bill seeks to
 
04:28:37.250 --> 04:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
highlight the value in preserving a
 
04:28:39.229 --> 04:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
healthy level of biodiversity in New
 
04:28:39.239 --> 04:28:40.189 align:start position:0%
healthy level of biodiversity in New
Hampshire

04:28:40.189 --> 04:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:28:42.170 --> 04:28:42.180 align:start position:0%
we applaud the Bill's sponsors for
 
04:28:44.630 --> 04:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
recognizing this important goal and
 
04:28:46.790 --> 04:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
agree that preserving biodiversity at
 
04:28:48.710 --> 04:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
levels sufficient to support healthy
 
04:28:50.990 --> 04:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
resilient and sustainable ecosystems
 
04:28:53.510 --> 04:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
over time is Paramount
 
04:28:55.670 --> 04:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
their efforts to place biodiversity
 
04:28:57.469 --> 04:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
preservation at the Forefront of natural
 
04:28:59.630 --> 04:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
resource conservation efforts in New
 
04:29:01.189 --> 04:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are commendable
 
04:29:04.849 --> 04:29:04.859 align:start position:0%
as amended by the Senate SB 164 seeks to
 
04:29:07.250 --> 04:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
insert a definition of biodiversity
 
04:29:10.370 --> 04:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
into the l-chip statute it also seeks to
 
04:29:12.649 --> 04:29:12.659 align:start position:0%
include biodiversity as a type of
 
04:29:15.590 --> 04:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
conservation easement and add biodiverse
 
04:29:17.990 --> 04:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
areas to our list of eligible resources
 
04:29:19.429 --> 04:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
for funding
 
04:29:21.530 --> 04:29:21.540 align:start position:0%
while acknowledging the importance of
 
04:29:23.990 --> 04:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
this complex issue we are concerned that
 
04:29:25.610 --> 04:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
the bill is proposed could create
 
04:29:28.610 --> 04:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
confusion within the l-chip statute and
 
04:29:31.189 --> 04:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
therefore around the larger issue
 
04:29:33.649 --> 04:29:33.659 align:start position:0%
defining biodiversity within the l-chip
 
04:29:35.929 --> 04:29:35.939 align:start position:0%
statute is appropriate but only if the
 
04:29:37.729 --> 04:29:37.739 align:start position:0%
term is used elsewhere within the
 
04:29:41.389 --> 04:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
statute however establishing a statutory
 
04:29:44.990 --> 04:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
definition for a concept as complex as
 
04:29:47.149 --> 04:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
biodiversity requires careful
 
04:29:49.550 --> 04:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
consideration at this time the l-chip
 
04:29:51.649 --> 04:29:51.659 align:start position:0%
board has not had sufficient time to
 
04:29:54.889 --> 04:29:54.899 align:start position:0%
fully consider the wording proposed
 
04:29:57.590 --> 04:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
the insertion of including biodiversity
 
04:29:59.809 --> 04:29:59.819 align:start position:0%
as a type of easement in the l-chip
 
04:30:02.090 --> 04:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
statute also creates significant
 
04:30:04.969 --> 04:30:04.979 align:start position:0%
confusion within that sentence depending
 
04:30:08.210 --> 04:30:08.220 align:start position:0%
on how that language is interpreted it
 
04:30:10.309 --> 04:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
either splits conservation from a list
 
04:30:12.769 --> 04:30:12.779 align:start position:0%
of easements or it introduces
 
04:30:15.530 --> 04:30:15.540 align:start position:0%
biodiversity easements as a subtype of
 
04:30:17.929 --> 04:30:17.939 align:start position:0%
conservation easements this could have
 
04:30:20.510 --> 04:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
negative impacts that are presumably not
 
04:30:22.309 --> 04:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill
 
04:30:24.469 --> 04:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
conservation easements are a very well
 
04:30:26.510 --> 04:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
established mechanism for preserving
 
04:30:29.269 --> 04:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
land in perpetuity conservation easement
 
04:30:32.090 --> 04:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
terms are tailored to achieve specific
 
04:30:34.610 --> 04:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
conservation purposes that are
 
04:30:37.969 --> 04:30:37.979 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the land being protected
 
04:30:40.429 --> 04:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
for example the preservation of habitats
 
04:30:42.530 --> 04:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
that support and sustain healthy levels
 
04:30:45.229 --> 04:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
of biodiversity could very well be a
 
04:30:47.149 --> 04:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
conservation purpose stated within an
 
04:30:49.550 --> 04:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
easement and the associated restrictions
 
04:30:51.410 --> 04:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
of that easement would be tied to that
 
04:30:51.420 --> 04:30:52.670 align:start position:0%
of that easement would be tied to that
purpose

04:30:52.670 --> 04:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
04:30:55.370 --> 04:30:55.380 align:start position:0%
thus conservation easements are already
 
04:30:57.590 --> 04:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
well positioned and well used to help
 
04:31:00.290 --> 04:31:00.300 align:start position:0%
preserve healthy biodiversity
 
04:31:03.349 --> 04:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
I'm unfamiliar with a type of easement a
 
04:31:05.510 --> 04:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
particular type of easement known as a
 
04:31:07.370 --> 04:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
biodiversity easement and I cannot
 
04:31:09.769 --> 04:31:09.779 align:start position:0%
comment on how those would be used in
 
04:31:11.809 --> 04:31:11.819 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:31:13.910 --> 04:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
as proposed the bill also defines
 
04:31:16.550 --> 04:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
biodiversity but then it uses the
 
04:31:19.370 --> 04:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
undefined term biodiverse areas to
 
04:31:21.110 --> 04:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
describe the types of land that would be
 
04:31:23.469 --> 04:31:23.479 align:start position:0%
eligible for l-chip funding
 
04:31:26.030 --> 04:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
biodiversity by definition is an
 
04:31:28.429 --> 04:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
attribute or more accurately a series of
 
04:31:30.349 --> 04:31:30.359 align:start position:0%
attributes which can be measured and
 
04:31:32.570 --> 04:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
which together help to describe a region
 
04:31:34.849 --> 04:31:34.859 align:start position:0%
habitat or ecosystem
 
04:31:36.830 --> 04:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
measuring the degree of biodiversity
 
04:31:39.530 --> 04:31:39.540 align:start position:0%
that exists requires analysis of several
 
04:31:41.870 --> 04:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
different properties these may include
 
04:31:43.910 --> 04:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
the number of species present in an area
 
04:31:46.070 --> 04:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
the distribution pattern of individual
 
04:31:49.070 --> 04:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
organisms among the species present the
 
04:31:51.410 --> 04:31:51.420 align:start position:0%
relationship between those species or
 
04:31:53.330 --> 04:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
the distribution of ecosystem types
 
04:31:54.830 --> 04:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
within the area
 
04:31:57.349 --> 04:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
we know that highly biodiverse areas are
 
04:31:59.090 --> 04:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
likely more resilient and better able to
 
04:32:01.969 --> 04:32:01.979 align:start position:0%
remain stable over time despite external
 
04:32:01.979 --> 04:32:03.229 align:start position:0%
remain stable over time despite external
stressors

04:32:03.229 --> 04:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
stressors
 
04:32:05.330 --> 04:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
but the degree of biodiversity in a
 
04:32:07.309 --> 04:32:07.319 align:start position:0%
defined area must also be considered
 
04:32:08.809 --> 04:32:08.819 align:start position:0%
within the context of the greater
 
04:32:12.050 --> 04:32:12.060 align:start position:0%
landscape a 100 Acre property may
 
04:32:13.729 --> 04:32:13.739 align:start position:0%
present with a very low degree of
 
04:32:16.010 --> 04:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
biodiversity if if considered in
 
04:32:18.710 --> 04:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
isolation but when considered as part of
 
04:32:20.929 --> 04:32:20.939 align:start position:0%
a greater biological region that
 
04:32:22.790 --> 04:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
property's critical habitat for example
 
04:32:25.670 --> 04:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
Open Fields Rocky ridges or Wetlands may
 
04:32:28.130 --> 04:32:28.140 align:start position:0%
very well support species or ecosystem
 
04:32:30.170 --> 04:32:30.180 align:start position:0%
diversity that is present in the larger
 
04:32:30.180 --> 04:32:31.130 align:start position:0%
diversity that is present in the larger
area

04:32:31.130 --> 04:32:31.140 align:start position:0%
area
 
04:32:33.469 --> 04:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
in that case land that might be
 
04:32:35.990 --> 04:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
considered having low biodiversity on
 
04:32:37.969 --> 04:32:37.979 align:start position:0%
its own couldn't very well be a vital
 
04:32:40.309 --> 04:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
component of a biological biological
 
04:32:40.319 --> 04:32:41.870 align:start position:0%
component of a biological biological
region

04:32:41.870 --> 04:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
region
 
04:32:44.030 --> 04:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
well the use of the term biodiverse
 
04:32:46.370 --> 04:32:46.380 align:start position:0%
areas in plain everyday language or
 
04:32:49.010 --> 04:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
conversation is generally understood to
 
04:32:51.950 --> 04:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
refer to highly biodiverse areas when it
 
04:32:54.830 --> 04:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
is used as the bill proposes it refers
 
04:32:57.710 --> 04:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
back to that definition and the plain
 
04:32:59.870 --> 04:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
language meaning is no longer valid the
 
04:33:02.389 --> 04:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
intent becomes confused we believe that
 
04:33:04.330 --> 04:33:04.340 align:start position:0%
developing language that qualifies
 
04:33:07.070 --> 04:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
ecologically significant lands a
 
04:33:09.289 --> 04:33:09.299 align:start position:0%
resource already included in the l-chip
 
04:33:11.990 --> 04:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
statute and eligible for funding could
 
04:33:13.849 --> 04:33:13.859 align:start position:0%
more explicitly convey the intent of
 
04:33:16.849 --> 04:33:16.859 align:start position:0%
this bill in summary l-chip recognizes
 
04:33:18.709 --> 04:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
both the complexity and importance of
 
04:33:20.269 --> 04:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
biodiversity preservation in New
 
04:33:22.490 --> 04:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we support efforts to
 
04:33:24.590 --> 04:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
maintain a healthy level of biodiversity
 
04:33:25.910 --> 04:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
04:33:28.010 --> 04:33:28.020 align:start position:0%
l-chip would welcome an opportunity to
 
04:33:29.750 --> 04:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
engage with the sponsors and other
 
04:33:31.970 --> 04:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
interested parties and stakeholders to
 
04:33:33.890 --> 04:33:33.900 align:start position:0%
address these concerns should that be
 
04:33:35.929 --> 04:33:35.939 align:start position:0%
the will of the committee I'm happy to
 
04:33:39.230 --> 04:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:41.209 --> 04:33:41.219 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
04:33:41.219 --> 04:33:44.570 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
committee

04:33:44.570 --> 04:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:46.310 --> 04:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:33:48.289 --> 04:33:48.299 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:33:51.429 --> 04:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
um I am looking at the language in the
 
04:33:54.410 --> 04:33:54.420 align:start position:0%
bill and wondering
 
04:33:58.390 --> 04:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
would it satisfy your concerns if the
 
04:34:01.670 --> 04:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
biodiverse areas in
 
04:34:04.609 --> 04:34:04.619 align:start position:0%
section four on the third pair or the
 
04:34:06.949 --> 04:34:06.959 align:start position:0%
second page I guess if that were
 
04:34:10.070 --> 04:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
replaced by something like areas that
 
04:34:12.650 --> 04:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
promote or protect biodiversity so
 
04:34:14.990 --> 04:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
they're referred directly back to the
 
04:34:15.000 --> 04:34:17.150 align:start position:0%
they're referred directly back to the
definition

04:34:17.150 --> 04:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
definition
 
04:34:19.310 --> 04:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
04:34:22.551 --> 04:34:22.561 align:start position:0%
I think that the the key point that I'd
 
04:34:24.769 --> 04:34:24.779 align:start position:0%
like to make is that biodiversity exists
 
04:34:27.470 --> 04:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
it exists in a field it exists in larger
 
04:34:29.269 --> 04:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
tracts of land the question we're really
 
04:34:31.910 --> 04:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
evaluating is to what degree is it
 
04:34:35.269 --> 04:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
highly biodiverse or not and so by
 
04:34:37.189 --> 04:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
including a definition of biodiversity
 
04:34:40.250 --> 04:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
that that is accurate that biodiversity
 
04:34:43.029 --> 04:34:43.039 align:start position:0%
is this mix of species Etc
 
04:34:45.529 --> 04:34:45.539 align:start position:0%
and then saying we want to protect
 
04:34:47.449 --> 04:34:47.459 align:start position:0%
biodiverse areas we're essentially
 
04:34:49.429 --> 04:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
saying we want to protect everything
 
04:34:52.369 --> 04:34:52.379 align:start position:0%
because every area is biodiverse to some
 
04:34:54.890 --> 04:34:54.900 align:start position:0%
degree so we really need to go a little
 
04:34:58.070 --> 04:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
bit deeper and look at what needs to be
 
04:35:01.609 --> 04:35:01.619 align:start position:0%
preserved in order to to to maintain a
 
04:35:03.230 --> 04:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
healthy level of biodiversity in the
 
04:35:05.330 --> 04:35:05.340 align:start position:0%
state or in a biological region so it
 
04:35:08.029 --> 04:35:08.039 align:start position:0%
becomes much more complicated I did
 
04:35:10.131 --> 04:35:10.141 align:start position:0%
think that representative Darby's was
 
04:35:12.890 --> 04:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
representative suggested that section 9
 
04:35:15.131 --> 04:35:15.141 align:start position:0%
might be an appropriate place
 
04:35:18.289 --> 04:35:18.299 align:start position:0%
to consider this was I wish I thought of
 
04:35:20.330 --> 04:35:20.340 align:start position:0%
it myself
 
04:35:23.390 --> 04:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
we are already considering biodiversity
 
04:35:25.970 --> 04:35:25.980 align:start position:0%
in every Grant round in almost all of
 
04:35:28.250 --> 04:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
our natural resource proposals there is
 
04:35:30.830 --> 04:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
a question about resource significance
 
04:35:33.890 --> 04:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
that the answer to which is usually tied
 
04:35:35.631 --> 04:35:35.641 align:start position:0%
to biodiversity to some degree or
 
04:35:37.789 --> 04:35:37.799 align:start position:0%
another so this is already happening at
 
04:35:40.250 --> 04:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
l-chip and it has been happening for you
 
04:35:41.709 --> 04:35:41.719 align:start position:0%
know 23 years
 
04:35:44.510 --> 04:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
we have studies on the state that help
 
04:35:46.789 --> 04:35:46.799 align:start position:0%
us to measure biodiversity and and help
 
04:35:48.890 --> 04:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
us evaluate which properties are more
 
04:35:51.051 --> 04:35:51.061 align:start position:0%
important to that end our conservation
 
04:35:54.289 --> 04:35:54.299 align:start position:0%
easements often relate to biodiversity
 
04:35:57.250 --> 04:35:57.260 align:start position:0%
so this it's already happening
 
04:35:59.810 --> 04:35:59.820 align:start position:0%
my concern would be that this language
 
04:36:06.189 --> 04:36:06.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:08.269 --> 04:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
give me a follow-up
 
04:36:09.769 --> 04:36:09.779 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:36:12.289 --> 04:36:12.299 align:start position:0%
um that's really helpful thank you and I
 
04:36:13.369 --> 04:36:13.379 align:start position:0%
think I know the answer this question
 
04:36:15.410 --> 04:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
but I just want to ask it explicitly to
 
04:36:17.689 --> 04:36:17.699 align:start position:0%
make sure that I'm not misreading
 
04:36:19.910 --> 04:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
so we were looking at the old
 
04:36:22.310 --> 04:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
methodology I think is attached still to
 
04:36:26.269 --> 04:36:26.279 align:start position:0%
the bill for how a fiscal note was made
 
04:36:28.429 --> 04:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
and I don't see
 
04:36:31.429 --> 04:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
um l-chip explicitly anywhere here and I
 
04:36:33.890 --> 04:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure if we were to
 
04:36:36.769 --> 04:36:36.779 align:start position:0%
pass this bill as is if you have a sense
 
04:36:39.410 --> 04:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
of whether it would make a fiscal impact
 
04:36:41.929 --> 04:36:41.939 align:start position:0%
on your work it sounds like maybe not
 
04:36:43.609 --> 04:36:43.619 align:start position:0%
because you're already doing it but you
 
04:36:45.590 --> 04:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
answer thank you for the question no
 
04:36:47.390 --> 04:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely correct because we are
 
04:36:50.990 --> 04:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
already undertaking evaluations of
 
04:36:53.510 --> 04:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
properties based on biodiversity levels
 
04:36:55.369 --> 04:36:55.379 align:start position:0%
it would make no impact on our program
 
04:36:56.570 --> 04:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
at all
 
04:36:56.580 --> 04:36:58.369 align:start position:0%
at all
oh

04:36:58.369 --> 04:36:58.379 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:37:00.949 --> 04:37:00.959 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:37:02.631 --> 04:37:02.641 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:37:04.490 --> 04:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:37:06.410 --> 04:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
so I mean
 
04:37:08.150 --> 04:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
I've listened to your testimony I'm
 
04:37:10.310 --> 04:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out does l-chip support
 
04:37:12.470 --> 04:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
this bill or oppose this bill as it's
 
04:37:14.449 --> 04:37:14.459 align:start position:0%
being introduced to this committee the
 
04:37:17.631 --> 04:37:17.641 align:start position:0%
l-chip board is neutral because it won't
 
04:37:20.209 --> 04:37:20.219 align:start position:0%
have an impact on the way we are
 
04:37:22.910 --> 04:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
operating the program there's not a
 
04:37:26.750 --> 04:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
concern but there is some
 
04:37:28.670 --> 04:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
question about how much time they've had
 
04:37:30.529 --> 04:37:30.539 align:start position:0%
to consider that definition it's very
 
04:37:32.990 --> 04:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
complex and I think that representative
 
04:37:35.650 --> 04:37:35.660 align:start position:0%
Baldwin raised some good points I have
 
04:37:39.131 --> 04:37:39.141 align:start position:0%
heard concerns about insects and how
 
04:37:41.750 --> 04:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
representation there and once we
 
04:37:43.730 --> 04:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
introduce a statutory definition it can
 
04:37:47.090 --> 04:37:47.100 align:start position:0%
also be linked to in the future and so
 
04:37:48.709 --> 04:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
what what are the impacts of that I
 
04:37:50.090 --> 04:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
think it's important and I think the
 
04:37:51.529 --> 04:37:51.539 align:start position:0%
board feels it's important we get it
 
04:37:53.810 --> 04:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
right if we're going to put it in okay
 
04:37:56.990 --> 04:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:59.330 --> 04:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
representative Darcy thank you thank you
 
04:38:00.470 --> 04:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
04:38:00.480 --> 04:38:01.250 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
question

04:38:01.250 --> 04:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:38:03.529 --> 04:38:03.539 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that you're already uh
 
04:38:03.539 --> 04:38:04.789 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that you're already uh
evaluating

04:38:04.789 --> 04:38:04.799 align:start position:0%
evaluating
 
04:38:07.490 --> 04:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
um or incorporating studies I think or
 
04:38:09.470 --> 04:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
listening to studies about biodiversity
 
04:38:12.529 --> 04:38:12.539 align:start position:0%
could you describe um briefly
 
04:38:15.289 --> 04:38:15.299 align:start position:0%
um how those are conducted and how
 
04:38:18.230 --> 04:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
um how you get inputs on um
 
04:38:20.150 --> 04:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
you get the words you use but
 
04:38:22.070 --> 04:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
um the resource the protection of
 
04:38:24.529 --> 04:38:24.539 align:start position:0%
resources sure thank you
 
04:38:26.689 --> 04:38:26.699 align:start position:0%
um I will not pretend to be able to
 
04:38:28.910 --> 04:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
explain the methodology behind the
 
04:38:32.631 --> 04:38:32.641 align:start position:0%
studies but for example The Nature
 
04:38:35.029 --> 04:38:35.039 align:start position:0%
Conservancy is resilient landscape study
 
04:38:38.090 --> 04:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
is often used and that measures any
 
04:38:40.070 --> 04:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
number of things to help us determine
 
04:38:42.051 --> 04:38:42.061 align:start position:0%
which properties are necessary to allow
 
04:38:44.750 --> 04:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
species to be resilient in the face of
 
04:38:46.970 --> 04:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
external stressors to move appropriately
 
04:38:49.429 --> 04:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
so that's one example
 
04:38:50.929 --> 04:38:50.939 align:start position:0%
um and I could certainly get you some
 
04:38:52.551 --> 04:38:52.561 align:start position:0%
others that's exactly what I was looking
 
04:38:55.730 --> 04:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:00.289 --> 04:39:00.299 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:06.709 --> 04:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:10.250 --> 04:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:11.631 --> 04:39:11.641 align:start position:0%
um fishing game
 
04:39:15.650 --> 04:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:17.269 --> 04:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
04:39:18.949 --> 04:39:18.959 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Dan Bergeron I'm the chief
 
04:39:20.390 --> 04:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
of the wildlife division for the New
 
04:39:22.369 --> 04:39:22.379 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Fish and Game department I'm
 
04:39:26.631 --> 04:39:26.641 align:start position:0%
here in opposition of SB 164.
 
04:39:28.010 --> 04:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
um I'll keep this I'll try and keep this
 
04:39:29.631 --> 04:39:29.641 align:start position:0%
brief because we share a lot of the same
 
04:39:29.641 --> 04:39:30.949 align:start position:0%
brief because we share a lot of the same
concerns

04:39:30.949 --> 04:39:30.959 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
04:39:33.109 --> 04:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
um that Paula highlighted from l-chip
 
04:39:33.119 --> 04:39:34.070 align:start position:0%
um that Paula highlighted from l-chip
there

04:39:34.070 --> 04:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:39:35.929 --> 04:39:35.939 align:start position:0%
um one of the concerns is that the
 
04:39:38.050 --> 04:39:38.060 align:start position:0%
definition is very broad
 
04:39:42.708 --> 04:39:42.718 align:start position:0%
we currently when we can serve land we
 
04:39:45.830 --> 04:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
also currently work to preserve either
 
04:39:49.970 --> 04:39:49.980 align:start position:0%
Wildlife diversity diverse habitats we
 
04:39:51.650 --> 04:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
work through our Wildlife action plan
 
04:39:54.170 --> 04:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
we've done analysis of the state and the
 
04:39:56.170 --> 04:39:56.180 align:start position:0%
different habitat types and the species
 
04:39:59.090 --> 04:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
to try and identify species that are at
 
04:40:01.368 --> 04:40:01.378 align:start position:0%
risk or species of greatest conservation
 
04:40:04.430 --> 04:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
concern we highlight those habitats in
 
04:40:07.130 --> 04:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
the state that we look to protect but
 
04:40:09.050 --> 04:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
our focus is mainly again wildlife and
 
04:40:11.090 --> 04:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
habitat diversity which in the broad
 
04:40:13.850 --> 04:40:13.860 align:start position:0%
scheme of things gets at biodiversity
 
04:40:17.510 --> 04:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
but with fairly specific goals in mind
 
04:40:19.970 --> 04:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
um again the concern would be this broad
 
04:40:19.980 --> 04:40:21.830 align:start position:0%
um again the concern would be this broad
definition

04:40:21.830 --> 04:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
definition
 
04:40:25.868 --> 04:40:25.878 align:start position:0%
in in-state law if that could be linked
 
04:40:28.788 --> 04:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
and to the Chairman's point that
 
04:40:30.470 --> 04:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
not necessarily that it's in the eye of
 
04:40:33.410 --> 04:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
the beholder but different groups may
 
04:40:35.150 --> 04:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
have a different impression of what's
 
04:40:38.150 --> 04:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
the most important part of biodiversity
 
04:40:40.670 --> 04:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
um for us you know our main concern is
 
04:40:43.010 --> 04:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
habitat diversity and Wildlife diversity
 
04:40:46.490 --> 04:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
but again when you have bacteria genetic
 
04:40:49.190 --> 04:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
variability humans are all part of this
 
04:40:49.200 --> 04:40:50.350 align:start position:0%
variability humans are all part of this
definition

04:40:50.350 --> 04:40:50.360 align:start position:0%
definition
 
04:40:53.570 --> 04:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
it creates and introduces I think
 
04:40:57.288 --> 04:40:57.298 align:start position:0%
confusion in in some ambiguity and we
 
04:40:58.970 --> 04:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
see that it could potentially create
 
04:41:01.130 --> 04:41:01.140 align:start position:0%
issues in the future if if again it were
 
04:41:04.368 --> 04:41:04.378 align:start position:0%
linked if other rsas were linked to this
 
04:41:05.930 --> 04:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
specific definition because of its
 
04:41:08.448 --> 04:41:08.458 align:start position:0%
broadness so we share a lot of the same
 
04:41:10.670 --> 04:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
concerns about that definition and and
 
04:41:12.288 --> 04:41:12.298 align:start position:0%
its potential to have impacts in the
 
04:41:14.990 --> 04:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
future a lot of these things can be very
 
04:41:16.670 --> 04:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
difficult to measure
 
04:41:16.680 --> 04:41:18.050 align:start position:0%
difficult to measure
um

04:41:18.050 --> 04:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:19.310 --> 04:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:41:32.530 --> 04:41:32.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:35.690 --> 04:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly
 
04:41:39.050 --> 04:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I'm I'm seeing that dncr
 
04:41:42.948 --> 04:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
has a natural heritage Bureau that has a
 
04:41:45.288 --> 04:41:45.298 align:start position:0%
list of plants and animal species does
 
04:41:47.390 --> 04:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
that does their work of compiling that
 
04:41:50.150 --> 04:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
list like does that how does that
 
04:41:52.430 --> 04:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
translate into your office like does
 
04:41:54.050 --> 04:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
that information reach you or is that
 
04:41:56.930 --> 04:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
just kept over there as information yeah
 
04:41:59.868 --> 04:41:59.878 align:start position:0%
no so so that that that information does
 
04:42:01.070 --> 04:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
reach us
 
04:42:03.830 --> 04:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
um within the natural heritage bureaus
 
04:42:06.530 --> 04:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
um within their their databases they
 
04:42:09.170 --> 04:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
also will keep records of rare rare and
 
04:42:11.570 --> 04:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
threatened species as well so we work
 
04:42:13.070 --> 04:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
closely with natural heritage Bureau
 
04:42:15.230 --> 04:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
when we do environmental review
 
04:42:17.510 --> 04:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
um we we see those that information as
 
04:42:18.948 --> 04:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
well so we work closely with them on
 
04:42:20.990 --> 04:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
that information
 
04:42:24.230 --> 04:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:27.708 --> 04:42:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:29.390 --> 04:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
not thank you very much thank you very
 
04:42:29.400 --> 04:42:38.628 align:start position:0%

04:42:40.910 --> 04:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
Kurt Ehrenberg
 
04:42:46.250 --> 04:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:46.260 --> 04:42:49.628 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:42:49.628 --> 04:42:49.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:53.510 --> 04:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I'm Kurt aaronberg I'm the
 
04:42:55.430 --> 04:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
state director for New Hampshire of the
 
04:42:57.350 --> 04:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
Humane Society of the United States here
 
04:42:59.150 --> 04:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
at its support
 
04:43:02.570 --> 04:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
of uh the amended bill
 
04:43:02.580 --> 04:43:04.250 align:start position:0%
of uh the amended bill
um

04:43:04.250 --> 04:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:07.010 --> 04:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
you know we are we represent all the
 
04:43:09.590 --> 04:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
animals in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:43:12.650 --> 04:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
and my interest here is the health and
 
04:43:14.690 --> 04:43:14.700 align:start position:0%
well-being of the animals of the state
 
04:43:17.570 --> 04:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
and I believe this bill
 
04:43:21.708 --> 04:43:21.718 align:start position:0%
uh furthers those interests which is why
 
04:43:24.050 --> 04:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
I support it we're happy to work
 
04:43:28.250 --> 04:43:28.260 align:start position:0%

make sure there is a work workable piece
 
04:43:32.868 --> 04:43:32.878 align:start position:0%
of legislation and I want to thank
 
04:43:36.530 --> 04:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
Senator waters for his foresight working
 
04:43:38.330 --> 04:43:38.340 align:start position:0%
on these issues
 
04:43:41.208 --> 04:43:41.218 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions
 
04:43:44.150 --> 04:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
04:43:44.160 --> 04:43:46.670 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
committee

04:43:46.670 --> 04:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:49.310 --> 04:43:49.320 align:start position:0%

you
 
04:44:00.128 --> 04:44:00.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:00.138 --> 04:44:01.850 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

foreign
 
04:44:04.670 --> 04:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you Mr chairman uh
 
04:44:06.948 --> 04:44:06.958 align:start position:0%
I am Matt Leahy I'm the public policy
 
04:44:10.190 --> 04:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
director for the four Society we are a
 
04:44:13.250 --> 04:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
Statewide land trust and Forestry
 
04:44:15.590 --> 04:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
organization and
 
04:44:18.770 --> 04:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
um I just I won't repeat what Paula
 
04:44:20.390 --> 04:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned but
 
04:44:21.770 --> 04:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
um you know we certainly would support
 
04:44:23.390 --> 04:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
the idea of
 
04:44:25.010 --> 04:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
um you know giving this bill more
 
04:44:25.020 --> 04:44:26.570 align:start position:0%
um you know giving this bill more
attention

04:44:26.570 --> 04:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
attention
 
04:44:29.330 --> 04:44:29.340 align:start position:0%
um you know to further it you know we
 
04:44:31.550 --> 04:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
are the forested idea is is neutral on
 
04:44:33.050 --> 04:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
the bill because quite frankly we're not
 
04:44:36.050 --> 04:44:36.060 align:start position:0%
sure if it necessarily changes you know
 
04:44:38.150 --> 04:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
how we operate and we are you know we do
 
04:44:40.730 --> 04:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
protect land
 
04:44:44.270 --> 04:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
um you know I would point out that
 
04:44:46.850 --> 04:44:46.860 align:start position:0%
when you look at what's driving the loss
 
04:44:50.270 --> 04:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
of species whether it's plant or animals
 
04:44:55.128 --> 04:44:55.138 align:start position:0%
or the whole range of life out there the
 
04:44:58.368 --> 04:44:58.378 align:start position:0%
biggest driver is the loss of habitat or
 
04:45:01.850 --> 04:45:01.860 align:start position:0%
the degradation of existing habitat and
 
04:45:04.368 --> 04:45:04.378 align:start position:0%
that is something which not just the
 
04:45:06.470 --> 04:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
four Society but I think
 
04:45:11.208 --> 04:45:11.218 align:start position:0%
or really all conservation organizations
 
04:45:13.850 --> 04:45:13.860 align:start position:0%
and public agencies fish and game for
 
04:45:16.550 --> 04:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
example is really one of the certainly
 
04:45:18.770 --> 04:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
one of the key Partners in New Hampshire
 
04:45:22.970 --> 04:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
in advancing the protection of land so I
 
04:45:25.190 --> 04:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
think if you know again if there are
 
04:45:26.810 --> 04:45:26.820 align:start position:0%
ways to
 
04:45:28.970 --> 04:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
really make sure that we're getting it
 
04:45:32.150 --> 04:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
right and to help Advance
 
04:45:33.470 --> 04:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
um you know the mission of the state
 
04:45:35.750 --> 04:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
agencies and you know private
 
04:45:38.570 --> 04:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
organizations conservation commissions
 
04:45:41.090 --> 04:45:41.100 align:start position:0%
who are who are doing this work we again
 
04:45:42.948 --> 04:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
would you know like be part of those
 
04:45:45.770 --> 04:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
conversations as well and I would just
 
04:45:47.750 --> 04:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
say and I know this is not the
 
04:45:49.730 --> 04:45:49.740 align:start position:0%
focus of the bill
 
04:45:52.970 --> 04:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
but you know ultimately what is going to
 
04:45:56.150 --> 04:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
protect our these really important areas
 
04:45:58.368 --> 04:45:58.378 align:start position:0%
is you know resources for the
 
04:46:00.050 --> 04:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
organizations that are doing this work
 
04:46:02.810 --> 04:46:02.820 align:start position:0%
and yeah certainly fish and game and
 
04:46:02.820 --> 04:46:04.610 align:start position:0%
and yeah certainly fish and game and
dncr

04:46:04.610 --> 04:46:04.620 align:start position:0%
dncr
 
04:46:07.190 --> 04:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
um you know l-chip is is one of the Key
 
04:46:10.070 --> 04:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
Programs to do this so again I
 
04:46:12.410 --> 04:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
understand this is not the focus of this
 
04:46:14.990 --> 04:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
bill but I I do think it should be a
 
04:46:17.390 --> 04:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
consideration going forward is that you
 
04:46:19.810 --> 04:46:19.820 align:start position:0%
know if the legislature legislature
 
04:46:22.250 --> 04:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
determines that
 
04:46:24.530 --> 04:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
um you know more needs to be done to
 
04:46:27.230 --> 04:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
protect biodiversity you know I think
 
04:46:29.510 --> 04:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
you know additional resources at some
 
04:46:32.868 --> 04:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
point again the fish and game department
 
04:46:36.110 --> 04:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
does a lot of work in this area
 
04:46:39.110 --> 04:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
um and you know they are really
 
04:46:42.288 --> 04:46:42.298 align:start position:0%
a key to this so but I'll have to take
 
04:46:43.788 --> 04:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:46:46.910 --> 04:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
any questions for uh by anybody in the
 
04:46:46.920 --> 04:46:51.288 align:start position:0%
any questions for uh by anybody in the
committee

04:46:51.288 --> 04:46:51.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:53.330 --> 04:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:46:55.070 --> 04:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:46:58.250 --> 04:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
um do you have in the um
 
04:47:00.530 --> 04:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
for a society do you happen to have a
 
04:47:02.270 --> 04:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
definition of biodiversity that you work
 
04:47:02.280 --> 04:47:03.050 align:start position:0%
definition of biodiversity that you work
with

04:47:03.050 --> 04:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:47:05.390 --> 04:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh no but that's a very good question I
 
04:47:07.368 --> 04:47:07.378 align:start position:0%
mean what we do if we're going to do a
 
04:47:10.128 --> 04:47:10.138 align:start position:0%
land protection project we do consult
 
04:47:10.138 --> 04:47:11.570 align:start position:0%
land protection project we do consult
with

04:47:11.570 --> 04:47:11.580 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:47:13.128 --> 04:47:13.138 align:start position:0%
um again fish and game they have their
 
04:47:15.350 --> 04:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
Wildlife action plan
 
04:47:18.708 --> 04:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
um the uh the uh
 
04:47:18.718 --> 04:47:19.788 align:start position:0%
um the uh the uh
um

04:47:19.788 --> 04:47:19.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:23.510 --> 04:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
Heritage Bureau at dncr you know has you
 
04:47:26.050 --> 04:47:26.060 align:start position:0%
know inventory of of the different
 
04:47:29.090 --> 04:47:29.100 align:start position:0%
species plants Etc that are in a
 
04:47:31.850 --> 04:47:31.860 align:start position:0%
particular area so we consult you know
 
04:47:34.730 --> 04:47:34.740 align:start position:0%
with our state agency partners to
 
04:47:37.368 --> 04:47:37.378 align:start position:0%
basically find out what's there
 
04:47:38.510 --> 04:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
um and you know if there are maybe
 
04:47:42.050 --> 04:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
important resources that
 
04:47:44.390 --> 04:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
um you know make the particular parcel
 
04:47:46.550 --> 04:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
in question you know more important or
 
04:47:48.288 --> 04:47:48.298 align:start position:0%
more valuable
 
04:47:50.270 --> 04:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
I mean I I have honestly I've seen a
 
04:47:53.030 --> 04:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
very uh simple definition
 
04:47:54.430 --> 04:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
um about
 
04:47:56.868 --> 04:47:56.878 align:start position:0%
biodiversity but it's not I mean we
 
04:47:59.690 --> 04:47:59.700 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily rely on a definition
 
04:48:01.850 --> 04:48:01.860 align:start position:0%
we really rely on what's on the ground
 
04:48:04.250 --> 04:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
when we decide whether or not to protect
 
04:48:07.730 --> 04:48:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:07.740 --> 04:48:08.750 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:48:08.750 --> 04:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:48:10.930 --> 04:48:10.940 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:48:13.250 --> 04:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
 
04:48:13.260 --> 04:48:15.170 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
committee

04:48:15.170 --> 04:48:15.180 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:48:17.750 --> 04:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly
 
04:48:19.430 --> 04:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm trying to figure out the
 
04:48:21.230 --> 04:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
best way to word this so from a forestry
 
04:48:23.448 --> 04:48:23.458 align:start position:0%
perspective we New Hampshire doesn't
 
04:48:27.770 --> 04:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
seem to have much plantain uh Plantation
 
04:48:30.590 --> 04:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh forestry and I'm wondering if from a
 
04:48:32.208 --> 04:48:32.218 align:start position:0%
from your public policy background if
 
04:48:34.610 --> 04:48:34.620 align:start position:0%
you have any thoughts about what if we
 
04:48:36.230 --> 04:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
have things in a law that prevent that
 
04:48:37.850 --> 04:48:37.860 align:start position:0%
right now or if that's just because of
 
04:48:39.830 --> 04:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
the there's no market for it
 
04:48:42.830 --> 04:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
you mean for uh Forest plantations yeah
 
04:48:44.510 --> 04:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
like cutting down a forest and replacing
 
04:48:46.310 --> 04:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
it all with Southern yellow pine or
 
04:48:47.510 --> 04:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
something like they would do down south
 
04:48:47.520 --> 04:48:48.340 align:start position:0%
something like they would do down south
yeah

04:48:48.340 --> 04:48:48.350 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:48:48.350 --> 04:48:48.948 align:start position:0%
yeah
[Music]

04:48:48.948 --> 04:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:48:48.958 --> 04:48:49.550 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:48:49.550 --> 04:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:51.050 --> 04:48:51.060 align:start position:0%
I mean well of course we you know we do
 
04:48:54.410 --> 04:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
have the tree farm program so but it's
 
04:48:56.030 --> 04:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
not the same thing
 
04:48:59.030 --> 04:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
um and I don't honestly know
 
04:48:59.040 --> 04:49:01.430 align:start position:0%
um and I don't honestly know
um

04:49:01.430 --> 04:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:02.868 --> 04:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
that's a good question I'm sure I can
 
04:49:05.390 --> 04:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
give you a direct answer on that but I
 
04:49:07.910 --> 04:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
mean it's it's never been a
 
04:49:07.920 --> 04:49:08.810 align:start position:0%
mean it's it's never been a
um

04:49:08.810 --> 04:49:08.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:11.390 --> 04:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
you know focus of land managers land
 
04:49:14.030 --> 04:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
owners you know loggers Foresters to to
 
04:49:16.448 --> 04:49:16.458 align:start position:0%
do that type of
 
04:49:20.090 --> 04:49:20.100 align:start position:0%
operation in New Hampshire
 
04:49:21.530 --> 04:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
okay yeah thank you if you think of
 
04:49:22.730 --> 04:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
anything after you can just send it okay
 
04:49:26.510 --> 04:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:30.288 --> 04:49:30.298 align:start position:0%
any other questions I have maybe it's an
 
04:49:32.690 --> 04:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
observation I've
 
04:49:35.628 --> 04:49:35.638 align:start position:0%
sitting here really thinking and
 
04:49:38.090 --> 04:49:38.100 align:start position:0%
what's what's what's going on
 
04:49:38.100 --> 04:49:40.310 align:start position:0%
what's what's what's going on
isn't

04:49:40.310 --> 04:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
04:49:43.310 --> 04:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
isn't this uh well
 
04:49:45.708 --> 04:49:45.718 align:start position:0%
isn't the biggest
 
04:49:50.270 --> 04:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh adversary of biodiversity
 
04:49:52.610 --> 04:49:52.620 align:start position:0%
Mother Nature itself
 
04:49:56.750 --> 04:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
considering the fact that from beginning
 
04:50:00.650 --> 04:50:00.660 align:start position:0%
of time or the beginning of Life on this
 
04:50:00.660 --> 04:50:01.788 align:start position:0%
of time or the beginning of Life on this
Earth

04:50:01.788 --> 04:50:01.798 align:start position:0%
Earth
 
04:50:04.190 --> 04:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
things have come and things have gone
 
04:50:07.070 --> 04:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
and this was long before man yeah I'm
 
04:50:08.330 --> 04:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
doing anything
 
04:50:10.368 --> 04:50:10.378 align:start position:0%
are we just trying to freeze something
 
04:50:12.410 --> 04:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
in place yeah well thanks to the
 
04:50:14.750 --> 04:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
question so I mean it is true that
 
04:50:17.270 --> 04:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
throughout history you know species have
 
04:50:20.050 --> 04:50:20.060 align:start position:0%
gone extinct through you know natural
 
04:50:21.890 --> 04:50:21.900 align:start position:0%
functions you know they just couldn't
 
04:50:25.190 --> 04:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
compete but the the issue and concern
 
04:50:27.948 --> 04:50:27.958 align:start position:0%
now is the the rate at which this is
 
04:50:27.958 --> 04:50:29.390 align:start position:0%
now is the the rate at which this is
happening

04:50:29.390 --> 04:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
happening
 
04:50:31.730 --> 04:50:31.740 align:start position:0%
um and so that
 
04:50:35.690 --> 04:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
is being generated by again the loss of
 
04:50:38.150 --> 04:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
habitat or the degradation of habitat
 
04:50:41.510 --> 04:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know the introduction of invasive
 
04:50:43.550 --> 04:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
plants and pests
 
04:50:46.788 --> 04:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
um is another driving force and of
 
04:50:50.750 --> 04:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
course uh pollution you know especially
 
04:50:54.470 --> 04:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
a water resources so there are things
 
04:50:57.350 --> 04:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
happening which you know go beyond what
 
04:51:00.830 --> 04:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
Mother Nature intends and really what's
 
04:51:07.010 --> 04:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:10.190 --> 04:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:13.430 --> 04:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:13.440 --> 04:51:15.770 align:start position:0%
 
with

04:51:15.770 --> 04:51:15.780 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:51:18.050 --> 04:51:18.060 align:start position:0%
anyone else who wishes to speak from the
 
04:51:18.060 --> 04:51:20.570 align:start position:0%
anyone else who wishes to speak from the
audience

04:51:20.570 --> 04:51:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:20.580 --> 04:51:22.550 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:51:22.550 --> 04:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:51:34.070 --> 04:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:47.350 --> 04:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:49.850 --> 04:51:49.860 align:start position:0%
want to meet for a few minutes just not
 
04:51:52.970 --> 04:51:52.980 align:start position:0%
on you know uh well it's
 
04:51:52.980 --> 04:55:07.070 align:start position:0%
on you know uh well it's
you know just

04:55:07.070 --> 04:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:14.690 --> 04:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:19.810 --> 04:56:19.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:22.190 --> 04:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
yeah you want to take next week off what
 
04:56:28.788 --> 04:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:32.150 --> 04:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
schedule the next week right so
 
04:56:35.448 --> 04:56:35.458 align:start position:0%
I could uh we could we could have uh
 
04:56:37.850 --> 04:56:37.860 align:start position:0%
work sessions because work sessions
 
04:56:41.270 --> 04:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
don't have to appear in the calendar
