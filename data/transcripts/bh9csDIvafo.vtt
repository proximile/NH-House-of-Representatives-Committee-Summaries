00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
let's go ahead and get started
 
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.430 align:start position:0%
let's go ahead and get started
um

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
we have a sign-in sheet here
 
00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:35.699 align:start position:0%
if you put in your name and email would
 
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
be appreciated
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
and I have a few
 
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
pink slips for people will be testifying
 
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
um we'll squeeze you in when we can
 
00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:48.419 align:start position:0%
between this and the second uh testimony
 
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
starting at 10 o'clock
 
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
unless uh where this will first one runs
 
00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:55.139 align:start position:0%
long and that's okay too then we'll take
 
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
you afterwards
 
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
but first I'd like to welcome our uh
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
yes please come and introduce yourself
 
00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:04.259 align:start position:0%
and make sure you have the red light on
 
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
good morning good
 
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.300 align:start position:0%
this is awkward because I want to face
 
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
everybody but good morning gentlemen my
 
00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:21.539 align:start position:0%
name is Megan Dom I'm with the American
 
00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
Beverage Association we represent the
 
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
beverage industry refreshment beverages
 
00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:28.259 align:start position:0%
so you know our biggest members are Coke
 
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
Pepsi Keurig Dr Pepper Red Bull Niagara
 
00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
etc etc but
 
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
just like to start by saying you know as
 
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
you know recycling programs in our
 
00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:41.539 align:start position:0%
country they differ from state to state
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
municipality by municipality city by
 
00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:44.990 align:start position:0%
municipality by municipality city by
City

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
City
 
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:46.860 align:start position:0%
we have a recycling national average
 
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
right now that has stagnated in the low
 
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
30 percents which there's clearly room
 
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
for improvement there
 
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
so what we know is that we're losing
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
valuable materials that should be used
 
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
again and again to landfills to
 
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
waterways to Nature
 
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
we don't have incentives or programs
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
that hold consumer brands or producers
 
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
responsible for the packaging choices
 
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
they make when delivering products to
 
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.210 align:start position:0%
they make when delivering products to
Consumers

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
Consumers
 
00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
and recycling in most places in our
 
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
country is underperforming due to
 
00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:17.639 align:start position:0%
inefficient systems or placing onus on
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
local governments to fix it
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
there's understandably great amounting
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
pressure from environmental groups and
 
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
lawmakers to reduce waste and many of
 
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:29.220 align:start position:0%
the largest consumer brand companies
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
have made ambitious environmental
 
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
commitments including robust recycled
 
00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:34.919 align:start position:0%
content and recyclability and reuse
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
goals including our companies
 
00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:39.659 align:start position:0%
voluntary action alone is not going to
 
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
achieve the scale needed to meet these
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
targets or retrieve critical system
 
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
change we need good policy and we need
 
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
good policy that's built upon four key
 
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
principles they're simple I'll get to
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
the specifics of what epr for packaging
 
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
and printed paper entails in a moment
 
00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to talk kind of writ
 
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
large about all policy for recycling for
 
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
Consumer Packaging
 
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
and those four pillars are one strong
 
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
environmental outcomes none of us would
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
be here if we didn't need to be here if
 
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
we didn't have recycling in the low 30
 
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
in our country we want to have less
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
material in nature packaging
 
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
strategically considered at the point of
 
00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
design higher recycling rates a circular
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
economy two consumer convenience all
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
consumers should be able to recycling
 
00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:24.899 align:start position:0%
something just as easily as they can
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
throw something away
 
00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
Three Financial efficiency money in the
 
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
system stays in the system too often
 
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
money for recycling is reallocated I
 
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
think we can all agree that pensions and
 
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
roads are really important but when
 
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
we're talking about money that's been
 
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:41.220 align:start position:0%
allocated for recycling we think it
 
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
should stay there
 
00:09:44.449 --> 00:09:44.459 align:start position:0%
a non-profit running the system is
 
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
really important
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
and there is a really important role for
 
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
government which is to set the scope of
 
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
a system and provide oversight but then
 
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
letting the private sector fund and
 
00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
operate the system to meet specific
 
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.870 align:start position:0%
operate the system to meet specific
targets

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
targets
 
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
the fourth is access to material in
 
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
order to create circularity and put
 
00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:03.959 align:start position:0%
these valuable materials back into their
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
next best use and I'm talking about
 
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
materials like aluminum strong durable
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
Plastics like pet HDPE and polypropylene
 
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
as well as glass and paper
 
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
we need producer spill to access those
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
materials and at market prices so no
 
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:20.700 align:start position:0%
smoke screens here producers will pay
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
for the materials at the back end but
 
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
they need to be able to access them
 
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
and buy them
 
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
but we're here to talk about extended
 
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
produce responsibility and for packaging
 
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
and printed paper
 
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
an epr is run successfully in countries
 
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
around the world so if you want to
 
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
implement epr that's what I'm here to
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
talk about epr is simple how it works in
 
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
practice can be really nuanced
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
but what epr is writ large epr is a
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
policy that shifts responsibility for
 
00:10:51.769 --> 00:10:51.779 align:start position:0%
what happens to Consumer packaging and
 
00:10:53.889 --> 00:10:53.899 align:start position:0%
printed paper at the end of its life
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
from local governments and consequently
 
00:10:59.569 --> 00:10:59.579 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who pay for it to the
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
producers who put packaging and printed
 
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
paper on the marketplace
 
00:11:05.569 --> 00:11:05.579 align:start position:0%
and it sets targets so that producers
 
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
are funding and operating the system to
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
achieve efficiency but also strong
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
environmental outcomes
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
recycling today is mostly a linear
 
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
system where producers make and sell
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
products to Consumers who then use and
 
00:11:19.449 --> 00:11:19.459 align:start position:0%
dispose of them
 
00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:21.899 align:start position:0%
municipalities are primarily responsible
 
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
for collecting that stuff
 
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
and based on many different factors
 
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:29.700 align:start position:0%
including a lack of robust education a
 
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
lack of consumer access to recycling
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
system inefficiencies lack of
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
investments in collection and separation
 
00:11:38.329 --> 00:11:38.339 align:start position:0%
and processing technology and even
 
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
non-existent systems too many materials
 
00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:43.019 align:start position:0%
are not getting recycled and no one's
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
held responsible
 
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
under well-designed epr which is really
 
00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:48.839 align:start position:0%
critical this word well designed because
 
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
there's all different epr but under
 
00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:53.220 align:start position:0%
well-designed epr the producer
 
00:11:55.009 --> 00:11:55.019 align:start position:0%
responsibility organization which is
 
00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
made up of the consumer brand so you
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
have your Cokes your Clorox your L'Oreal
 
00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
everybody all these companies that are
 
00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:02.820 align:start position:0%
putting packaging on the market whether
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
it's recyclable or not all of them are
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
mandated to join a producer
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility organization
 
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
which is a privately run
 
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
non-profit organization
 
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:16.140 align:start position:0%
and these companies are then responsible
 
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
for operating and funding the system
 
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:21.660 align:start position:0%
from education to collection to
 
00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
processing so that they can look at the
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
system from thirty thousand feet and
 
00:12:27.769 --> 00:12:27.779 align:start position:0%
optimize the entire system from the
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
front to the back end
 
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
The Producers importantly are advised by
 
00:12:34.009 --> 00:12:34.019 align:start position:0%
the waste industry and the recycling
 
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
Community especially the private haulers
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
who have a very vested interest in this
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
and we want to make sure that their
 
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
concerns are addressed because this is
 
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
how they make money
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
as well as advised by environmental
 
00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
organizations material groups local
 
00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:47.700 align:start position:0%
governments and other vested
 
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.949 align:start position:0%
governments and other vested
stakeholders

00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
and please interrupt me at any moment if
 
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
you want to ask questions okay
 
00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:54.839 align:start position:0%
fees to run the system so you have this
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
entire look at the entire system you
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
determine how much it's going to cost
 
00:12:59.690 --> 00:12:59.700 align:start position:0%
through what's called A needs assessment
 
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
so you take for example the state of New
 
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you do A needs assessment
 
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and say these are the
 
00:13:06.769 --> 00:13:06.779 align:start position:0%
needs of the system this is how much
 
00:13:08.569 --> 00:13:08.579 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost so you know that up
 
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
front and then the fees to run that
 
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
system are assessed by different
 
00:13:14.449 --> 00:13:14.459 align:start position:0%
material types so not all materials pay
 
00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
the same depending on their how they
 
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
operate in the system the net cost to
 
00:13:20.329 --> 00:13:20.339 align:start position:0%
recycle and then they are further what's
 
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:23.220 align:start position:0%
called equal modulated to incentivize
 
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
environmental factors like recyclability
 
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
recycle content Etc so you're paying
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
less if you have packaging that that
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
does well in the environment that is
 
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
recyclable that includes recycled
 
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
content and you're paying more if it
 
00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:38.579 align:start position:0%
does not and like I said this is all
 
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
packaging and printed paper it's not
 
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
just what's recyclable it's everything
 
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:44.940 align:start position:0%
and then the producer we're gonna yes
 
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
notes it's a very nerdy term
 
00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.769 align:start position:0%
notes it's a very nerdy term
[Laughter]

00:13:54.769 --> 00:13:54.779 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
so Eco modulation is basically the idea
 
00:13:58.970 --> 00:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
that you have this pot of money that you
 
00:13:58.980 --> 00:13:59.690 align:start position:0%
that you have this pot of money that you
need

00:13:59.690 --> 00:13:59.700 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
you need to pay for work you need to pay
 
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
for the system and so what you do is you
 
00:14:05.329 --> 00:14:05.339 align:start position:0%
allocate it based on different materials
 
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
so aluminum might pay certain fee pet
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
which is the plastic water bottles
 
00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
um HTTP your milk jugs might pay
 
00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:15.899 align:start position:0%
differently but then it's further Eco
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
modulated and what that means is that if
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
I have um recycled content in my in my
 
00:14:23.569 --> 00:14:23.579 align:start position:0%
cans the average aluminum can as a 73
 
00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
recycled content that's really high so
 
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
if I'm in aluminum beverage can I'm
 
00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:29.220 align:start position:0%
going to pay a lot less and maybe in
 
00:14:31.129 --> 00:14:31.139 align:start position:0%
some some countries like France I'm not
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
going to pay anything because my that
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
can is so recyclable that we've done our
 
00:14:38.509 --> 00:14:38.519 align:start position:0%
part right so the net cost is is more
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
valuable at the back end and so that's
 
00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
what equal modulation means
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
and to follow up on what just said if I
 
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.310 align:start position:0%
and to follow up on what just said if I
may

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.629 align:start position:0%
may
um

00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
have you noticed that this is now
 
00:14:53.689 --> 00:14:53.699 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility is very
 
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
new to these Shores but it's been
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
practiced in Europe and other places
 
00:14:58.009 --> 00:14:58.019 align:start position:0%
around the world
 
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
has equal modulation had an effect upon
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
the producers how they packaged their
 
00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.269 align:start position:0%
the producers how they packaged their
materials

00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
materials
 
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
actually the idea correct the idea is
 
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
that you know if I'm a producer and I'm
 
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
making for example a Twix and I'm not
 
00:15:13.009 --> 00:15:13.019 align:start position:0%
calling on anybody but I'm thinking when
 
00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
I I visited Japan that Twix for example
 
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
in our the candy bar in our country is
 
00:15:20.569 --> 00:15:20.579 align:start position:0%
packaged in a multi-layer plastic
 
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
aluminum but in Japan it's packaged in
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
paper and so if the difference between
 
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
those material types in the U.S I'm
 
00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:29.339 align:start position:0%
going to pay a lot more for that
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
multi-material because it's not
 
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
recyclable every time that's going in
 
00:15:34.129 --> 00:15:34.139 align:start position:0%
the trash but in Japan it's made of
 
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
paper which is recyclable so I would be
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
paying less so yes there is a built-in
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
incentive and that's the that's the
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
entire idea is to incentivize producers
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
to think about packaging when they're
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.350 align:start position:0%
okay
um voila

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
um voila
 
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
so like I said so Investments we made
 
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
throughout the system all the way from
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
consumer education to access and by
 
00:15:59.090 --> 00:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
access they mean that every consumer
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
will have a bin at their homes whether
 
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
single family or multi-family
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
um to collection by the haulers to
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
processing to commodity markets to end
 
00:16:10.129 --> 00:16:10.139 align:start position:0%
markets back to producers and this
 
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
results in producers having greater
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
access to more recycled materials and
 
00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:15.899 align:start position:0%
that increased supply of recycled
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
materials will of course allow producers
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
to use more recycled content in their
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
packaging which reduces the use of
 
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
Virgin materials like plastic
 
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
and while this system is operated as I
 
00:16:29.569 --> 00:16:29.579 align:start position:0%
said by the private sector government
 
00:16:32.329 --> 00:16:32.339 align:start position:0%
provides oversight ensures transparency
 
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
and accountability in the system and
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
government ultim government ultimately
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
approves the Pro's plan and targets but
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
the producer organization is ultimately
 
00:16:44.449 --> 00:16:44.459 align:start position:0%
given the flexibility to meet those
 
00:16:44.459 --> 00:16:45.829 align:start position:0%
given the flexibility to meet those
targets

00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
targets
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
four states in the country have passed
 
00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
epr for printed paper and packaging and
 
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
many seats have passed epr for other
 
00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
things like sharps or carpets or paint
 
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
mattresses and other things but for
 
00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
packaging a printed paper there have
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
been four
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
and those are main Oregon Colorado and
 
00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.110 align:start position:0%
and those are main Oregon Colorado and
California

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
California
 
00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:05.339 align:start position:0%
but even with just the four laws that
 
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799 align:start position:0%
have passed it's abundantly clear that
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
there are very different ways to write
 
00:17:11.449 --> 00:17:11.459 align:start position:0%
these laws and consequently we will see
 
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
wildly different outcomes for example
 
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
the law in Maine has no system change
 
00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:18.299 align:start position:0%
built into it and in my opinion will not
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
achieve any strong environmental
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
outcomes because it's not part of the
 
00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.250 align:start position:0%
outcomes because it's not part of the
law

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:17:24.409 --> 00:17:24.419 align:start position:0%
and most of the bill proposals we saw in
 
00:17:27.409 --> 00:17:27.419 align:start position:0%
2023 none of which passed saw various
 
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:29.700 align:start position:0%
groups attend to use epr as a cover for
 
00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:32.220 align:start position:0%
things that aren't really epr or really
 
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
outside of the scope and I think it's
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
really important in this moment that we
 
00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:38.700 align:start position:0%
keep epr pure about epr which is about
 
00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:40.980 align:start position:0%
residential consumer Recycling and
 
00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
consumer package Goods
 
00:17:45.409 --> 00:17:45.419 align:start position:0%
it's not a Panacea for everything in the
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
Environmental Landscape and it and it
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be but when it's done well it
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
works but of course the devil is in the
 
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
details and I'm happy to answer any and
 
00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:55.740 align:start position:0%
all specific questions you have about
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
epr but I just wanted to lay the lay the
 
00:17:58.559 --> 00:18:07.850 align:start position:0%
epr but I just wanted to lay the lay the
land

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:09.049 --> 00:18:09.059 align:start position:0%
um could you speak a little bit more
 
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
about your
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
opinion and the main uh
 
00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
epr legislation I know it's a long
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
process it's in there only the very
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
beginning of it maybe you could speak to
 
00:18:22.909 --> 00:18:22.919 align:start position:0%
that as well about absolutely where they
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
are and where their timeline is on that
 
00:18:27.169 --> 00:18:27.179 align:start position:0%
yeah so um I did improve my cheat sheet
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
on that but the date the law passed was
 
00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:33.299 align:start position:0%
July 2021 the issues that I have that we
 
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
have I guess I have Within Me Bill is
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
first it doesn't include printed paper
 
00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:39.539 align:start position:0%
um I don't know about you but my
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
recycling bin if I think about my
 
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
recycling bin at home it's mostly
 
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
printed paper right it's your it's your
 
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
mail it's your newspapers it's all that
 
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
stuff and so if you have a system that
 
00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
is focusing on residential recycling and
 
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:52.860 align:start position:0%
the idea being that we're going to pay
 
00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
for the whole thing then printed paper
 
00:18:57.049 --> 00:18:57.059 align:start position:0%
should surely be part of that and the
 
00:18:59.150 --> 00:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
argument is that well the paper industry
 
00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
thinks that their recycling rates are
 
00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:01.799 align:start position:0%
high enough that they shouldn't have to
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
pay in but the paper recycling rate in
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
our country hovers in like the 60s 66
 
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
a lot higher than a lot of materials
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
certainly but that still means that a
 
00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
third of paper is not being recycled
 
00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
which arguably lends for work to be done
 
00:19:18.409 --> 00:19:18.419 align:start position:0%
and so I think that was a real flaw in
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
the system because the way that happens
 
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:23.220 align:start position:0%
if you exclude printed paper either the
 
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
rest of the producers are covering the
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
costs of the printed paper for them or
 
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
you still have taxpayers praying the
 
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
printed paper portion of recycling and
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
that goes against the entire philosophy
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
of epr which is to shift the cost away
 
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
from taxpayers so they're not paying for
 
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.310 align:start position:0%
from taxpayers so they're not paying for
it

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:42.539 align:start position:0%
um and then the other piece that we that
 
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
I have an issue with is that um the epr
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
law set in Maine is more of what we call
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
like an ATM model so the producers will
 
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
pay for the system and that's it they'll
 
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
write the check and they will have no
 
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
say about kind of where the money goes
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
or how the operation the operation of
 
00:19:58.970 --> 00:19:58.980 align:start position:0%
the system works and so the
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
inefficiencies built into that system
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
will stay it pretty much preserves the
 
00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:06.299 align:start position:0%
status quo of that main system as it
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
exists and the whole purpose of epr is
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
that the system isn't working as well as
 
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:11.460 align:start position:0%
it could and we need to make certain
 
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
changes to it and that's not built into
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.029 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me that
 
00:20:27.529 --> 00:20:27.539 align:start position:0%
you think the most effective epr laws
 
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
are comprehensive in my original
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
thinking and putting this bill and
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
something that was brought up in the
 
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.970 align:start position:0%
something that was brought up in the
committee

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
um and the ENA committee I believe was
 
00:20:39.409 --> 00:20:39.419 align:start position:0%
the idea of taking it in smaller bytes
 
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
go after say paint maybe perhaps or we
 
00:20:45.049 --> 00:20:45.059 align:start position:0%
already have epr for mercury in the
 
00:20:45.059 --> 00:20:46.490 align:start position:0%
already have epr for mercury in the
state

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:20:48.049 --> 00:20:48.059 align:start position:0%
um but you're seeing a comprehensive
 
00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
bill is actually be would be more
 
00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
favorable to the industry is what I hear
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
you're saying is that correct for
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
packaging and printed paper so if you
 
00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
were going to have an epr law for paint
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
or mattresses or sharps in my view those
 
00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
things are separate so and absolutely
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
you should do those things I think that
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
they're very successful I'm not an
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
expert on on the mattress or or paying
 
00:21:09.409 --> 00:21:09.419 align:start position:0%
epr laws but I think that they they work
 
00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
very well they're very different though
 
00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
I mean you buy a mattress how often you
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
buy consumer packaging every day so they
 
00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
they're they're quite different so if
 
00:21:21.049 --> 00:21:21.059 align:start position:0%
you're going to implement a law for
 
00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
Consumer packaging and paper
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
then then that's what I'm here to speak
 
00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:31.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for taking my question so
 
00:21:36.529 --> 00:21:36.539 align:start position:0%
can you explain to me how how this would
 
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
affect a mattress what is it the
 
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:40.980 align:start position:0%
packaging when you get it from the store
 
00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
or how they dispose of it my
 
00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
understanding and I could be wrong to
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
anybody watching this like not an expert
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
in mattresses but my understanding is
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
and if anybody else in the room knows
 
00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:52.740 align:start position:0%
better um when you buy your mattress you
 
00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:55.380 align:start position:0%
are kind of paying a advanced fee on it
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
for what happens to an end of life so if
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
it's all baked into it so if I'm buying
 
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
a mattress that has that cloth baked
 
00:22:03.649 --> 00:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
into it so that at the end of it when
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
1 800 mattress comes in picks my old
 
00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:07.740 align:start position:0%
mattress up when they deliver the new
 
00:22:09.649 --> 00:22:09.659 align:start position:0%
one that is already kind of like been
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
peeved where to deal with the end of
 
00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
life of it I do I believe that old
 
00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
mattresses are kind of ripped apart and
 
00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
made into new mattresses I don't really
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
like to think about that um but I think
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
that is part of it but again not an
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
expert on mattress CPR but if somebody
 
00:22:32.529 --> 00:22:32.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:35.820 align:start position:0%
I'm very naive about this
 
00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:38.460 align:start position:0%
I live in co-wash County just down the
 
00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:40.860 align:start position:0%
road from my house as a recycling center
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
and so we like if I get rid of a
 
00:22:45.649 --> 00:22:45.659 align:start position:0%
mattress I just bring it there and throw
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
it in the auger and they
 
00:22:51.169 --> 00:22:51.179 align:start position:0%
grind it up I I you know same thing with
 
00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
every day when I'm in there I see bales
 
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
of aluminum bales of plastic cardboard
 
00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
so everything's
 
00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
done right there uh
 
00:23:03.529 --> 00:23:03.539 align:start position:0%
that's surprising to me 30 is a very low
 
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
number that I I didn't realize it was
 
00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
that low
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I so it sounds to me like
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
you have a drop off like you put your
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
well you pay like you pay like
 
00:23:15.409 --> 00:23:15.419 align:start position:0%
Electronics you pay a certain amount if
 
00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
you have tires you pay a certain three
 
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
dollars a tire
 
00:23:21.049 --> 00:23:21.059 align:start position:0%
a lot you know things like that so that
 
00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
three dollars probably ensures that the
 
00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
tire is going to the place where it
 
00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
needs to go to get
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
remade into whatever happens to the tire
 
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
for the consumer packaging I think that
 
00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
was what I used to do I grew up in New
 
00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
Jersey that was what I did as well when
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
I was a kid we used to go we'd load up
 
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
the car we'd go down they had the
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
different Bays for the aluminum Bay the
 
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
clear glass Bay the brown glass Bay and
 
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
that is honestly a really great system
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
because that is you are automatically
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
separating that stuff but if you think
 
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
about the way we've transitioned in our
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
country not in your community but in
 
00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:52.919 align:start position:0%
most of communities to single stream
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
recycling which means that at my house
 
00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
right now I dump all of my stuff into
 
00:23:58.970 --> 00:23:58.980 align:start position:0%
one bin and it all gets mixed together
 
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
and then the truck comes and it squishes
 
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
it and it squishes it and so by the time
 
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
it gets to the murf or the material
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
recovery facility which is where those
 
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
trucks go the trucks go not where you go
 
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
because that stuff is beautiful and
 
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
clean it doesn't need to go to a Murph
 
00:24:13.549 --> 00:24:13.559 align:start position:0%
the only job of a Murph is to take
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
single stream and separate it back out
 
00:24:18.169 --> 00:24:18.179 align:start position:0%
into the beautiful clean bales that that
 
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
you're talking about in your community
 
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
that's all the network does but what
 
00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
happens is that stuff is so contaminated
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
because if you think about
 
00:24:27.649 --> 00:24:27.659 align:start position:0%
some consumers aren't thinking as well
 
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
and maybe they're putting their hoses or
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
their hangers or their Christmas lights
 
00:24:33.169 --> 00:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
in there because they can't they can get
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
away with that in a closed bin versus in
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
a drop-off you can't and the wetness of
 
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:40.740 align:start position:0%
consumer food and peanut butter and all
 
00:24:42.049 --> 00:24:42.059 align:start position:0%
that stuff is
 
00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:44.039 align:start position:0%
so yeah contamination is a big part of
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
the issue in our country and education
 
00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.029 align:start position:0%
the issue in our country and education
frankly

00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
um we need to do a much better educating
 
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
consumers about what's put in and
 
00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.590 align:start position:0%
consumers about what's put in and
whatnot

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
whatnot
 
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to compare this to a tax
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
but I would say
 
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
the way it's happening in in Berlin it's
 
00:24:59.390 --> 00:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
more like a user fee which I I would
 
00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:02.940 align:start position:0%
think is is very fair but it like the
 
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
mattress thing you explained
 
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
when it's
 
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
they already charged you before you you
 
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
buy it I think that it would be
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
not a not a tax but it would affect the
 
00:25:18.649 --> 00:25:18.659 align:start position:0%
lower income people more than anybody
 
00:25:21.789 --> 00:25:21.799 align:start position:0%
and that that's where I don't absolutely
 
00:25:24.649 --> 00:25:24.659 align:start position:0%
yes for Consumer packaging and printing
 
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
paper epr
 
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:27.900 align:start position:0%
um we do not support what's called like
 
00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:30.059 align:start position:0%
a consumer fee a consumer site it's
 
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:31.740 align:start position:0%
called the CRF a consumer recycling fee
 
00:25:33.409 --> 00:25:33.419 align:start position:0%
we do not support that we don't think
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
that the cost should then be borne down
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
to Consumers
 
00:25:39.649 --> 00:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
um that epr should be the cost should be
 
00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
born by the producers and not consumers
 
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
or taxpayers
 
00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:47.570 align:start position:0%
or taxpayers
okay

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
thank you um one more finally
 
00:25:52.799 --> 00:25:53.710 align:start position:0%
thank you um one more finally
um

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing a lot of good stuff here
 
00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.149 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing a lot of good stuff here
um

00:25:59.149 --> 00:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:01.860 align:start position:0%
if we are really concerned
 
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
as a committee as our charge says of
 
00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:08.220 align:start position:0%
reducing Municipal costs
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
we our greatest
 
00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:13.580 align:start position:0%
impact will be to be look at single uh
 
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:16.980 align:start position:0%
packaging rather rather than such things
 
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
as mattresses tires and paints which are
 
00:26:21.049 --> 00:26:21.059 align:start position:0%
all very important I think that's part
 
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
of a comprehensive bill
 
00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:27.179 align:start position:0%
but if we really want to
 
00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
lower the cost to Consumers so that's
 
00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.590 align:start position:0%
lower the cost to Consumers so that's
our

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
May if it were and I'm not saying it
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
necessarily is even but if it were would
 
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
you say that um looking at packaging is
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
the strongest area to
 
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
it's it's a strong area I mean because
 
00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
you're taking the cost of recycling not
 
00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
disposal but of recycling away from
 
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:48.470 align:start position:0%
disposal but of recycling away from
consumers

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:49.860 align:start position:0%
um that said I think that you know one
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
thing I'll say is that I think that
 
00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
you'll have pushback from the hauling
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
community so the you know the private
 
00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:55.740 align:start position:0%
haulers the waste managements the
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
republics not to call anybody out I know
 
00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
this is going on a video somewhere
 
00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:01.740 align:start position:0%
um but we're trying to figure out how to
 
00:27:03.409 --> 00:27:03.419 align:start position:0%
how to work with those guys because we
 
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
we hear them and we hear that they have
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
very legitimate concerns
 
00:27:09.169 --> 00:27:09.179 align:start position:0%
um about what happens to their
 
00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:10.740 align:start position:0%
for-profit businesses and they're trying
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
to make money just like everybody else
 
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
and so we're trying to figure out how to
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
collaborate with them in better ways so
 
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
that we're not taking their autonomy
 
00:27:21.649 --> 00:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
away from them but I just I'm putting
 
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
that as like a flag for you that I think
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
that you'll probably hear from them
 
00:27:27.169 --> 00:27:27.179 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for these flags along
 
00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
the way they are I'm sure they'll be
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
thank you I want to thank you so much
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
for your time today thank you for having
 
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
me and um Adam behind me you can always
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
get in touch with us we are so happy to
 
00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
we have a scheduled
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
um P well um
 
00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:09.059 align:start position:0%
Peter Blair will be speaking to us from
 
00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
uh just zero
 
00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:14.700 align:start position:0%
at 10 o'clock you set up to come in in
 
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:16.740 align:start position:0%
the meantime I'm wondering if you may
 
00:28:18.529 --> 00:28:18.539 align:start position:0%
hear from
 
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
I know which one came in first Ann or
 
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
Christine uh
 
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.810 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:38.820 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:48.529 --> 00:28:48.539 align:start position:0%
I'm Christine baber from Dover I am the
 
00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:51.539 align:start position:0%
co-chair of the Dover plastic reduction
 
00:28:54.049 --> 00:28:54.059 align:start position:0%
group and a member of the New Hampshire
 
00:28:57.850 --> 00:28:57.860 align:start position:0%
Network plastic working group both
 
00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
non-partisan citizen volunteer groups
 
00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
I'm pleased that our state is actively
 
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:07.740 align:start position:0%
studying extended producer
 
00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:11.220 align:start position:0%
responsibility in order to develop a
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
plan for product manufacturers to share
 
00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:18.260 align:start position:0%
responsibility for reducing the
 
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
environmental impact of their products
 
00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:25.740 align:start position:0%
for reducing the waste stream going into
 
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
our landfills and saving money for
 
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:43.220 align:start position:0%
um the the previous person who spoke
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned the the benefit some of the
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
benefits of Shifting financial
 
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility Upstream to manufacturers
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
this would also provide incentives for
 
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
them to reduce production of difficult
 
00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
to dispose of materials and to
 
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
incorporate environmental considerations
 
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
into the designs of their products and
 
00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:13.370 align:start position:0%
into the designs of their products and
packaging

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:13.380 align:start position:0%
packaging
 
00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:17.820 align:start position:0%
Six States have epr or similar bills
 
00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:21.500 align:start position:0%
covering packaging California Colorado
 
00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
Maine Oregon New Jersey and Washington I
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
hope we will add New Hampshire to the
 
00:30:29.399 --> 00:30:31.330 align:start position:0%
hope we will add New Hampshire to the
list

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:31.340 align:start position:0%
list
 
00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
an epr bill would have multiple benefits
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire according to a report
 
00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:43.740 align:start position:0%
by the recycling partnership that looked
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
at the impact of epr programs in seven
 
00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions worldwide and in six U.S
 
00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.230 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions worldwide and in six U.S
states

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:53.240 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
implementing epr programs and these are
 
00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
effective strong epr programs can
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
increase overall residential recycling
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
rates by as much as 48 percentage points
 
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
can create nearly universal access to
 
00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:21.740 align:start position:0%
recycling can increase overall
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
participation in recycling can boost the
 
00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:29.460 align:start position:0%
amount of recycled content by millions
 
00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
of tons also can recapture between 13
 
00:31:40.149 --> 00:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
million and 91 million in Lost material
 
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:49.860 align:start position:0%
in addition it can reduce hundreds of
 
00:31:54.169 --> 00:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
thousands of metric tons of climate
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
damaging emissions in these states and
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
very importantly can create thousands of
 
00:32:02.159 --> 00:32:05.870 align:start position:0%
very importantly can create thousands of
jobs

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
we all in New Hampshire are concerned
 
00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
about our taxpayers and costume
 
00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.590 align:start position:0%
about our taxpayers and costume
municipalities

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
epr will reduce costs for these groups
 
00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:23.220 align:start position:0%
the product stewardship Institute claims
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
that under current recycling systems the
 
00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:31.140 align:start position:0%
consumer actually pays three times
 
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:34.140 align:start position:0%

00:32:58.450 --> 00:32:58.460 align:start position:0%

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
some who benefit from our current system
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
of dealing with product waste allege
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
that epr legislation will raise costs
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
for consumers however the conservation
 
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
law Foundation asserts that there is no
 
00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:29.460 align:start position:0%
credible data indicating epr would raise
 
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
consumer prices
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with the Natural
 
00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
Resources Council of Maine they
 
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
estimated that adopting an epr policy
 
00:33:44.649 --> 00:33:44.659 align:start position:0%
would save Maine's
 
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
Municipal taxpayers at least 16 million
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
a year
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
it could reasonably be expected that
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
similar savings could occur in New
 
00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.289 align:start position:0%
similar savings could occur in New
Hampshire

00:34:00.289 --> 00:34:00.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
because of the groups within which I'm
 
00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.110 align:start position:0%
because of the groups within which I'm
involved

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
we believe that single-use plastic
 
00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:12.899 align:start position:0%
packaging needs to be included in
 
00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
extended producer
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
innate extended producer bill
 
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
there is a long line of products that
 
00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:25.139 align:start position:0%
would benefit from extended producer
 
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility but we strongly Advocate
 
00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
that single-use plaque plastic be
 
00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:34.930 align:start position:0%
that single-use plaque plastic be
involved

00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:34.940 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
U.S plastic recycling rates which were
 
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
only about nine percent in 2015 are now
 
00:34:49.129 --> 00:34:49.139 align:start position:0%
reported to have dropped to about five
 
00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:50.450 align:start position:0%
reported to have dropped to about five
percent

00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
and we are learning more almost every
 
00:35:00.609 --> 00:35:00.619 align:start position:0%
week about the health hazards as well as
 
00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
environmental hazards associated with uh
 
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
84 of plastic waste goes to our
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
landfills and 11 is incinerated
 
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
releasing more toxics into the
 
00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.890 align:start position:0%
releasing more toxics into the
environment

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
we we need to prohibit the use of
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
hazardous chemicals in Plastics and
 
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:34.140 align:start position:0%
significantly reduce the production of
 
00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
single-use plastics while choosing safer
 
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
sustainable materials that could support
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:50.940 align:start position:0%
one of the really encouraging pieces of
 
00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:54.980 align:start position:0%
research that I have found is that
 
00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:00.020 align:start position:0%
voters support adopting policies such as
 
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
epr a 2023 Nationwide poll of U.S voters
 
00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:11.420 align:start position:0%
found overwhelming support from both
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
Republicans 75 percent of the
 
00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
Republicans pulled and Democrats 86
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
percent of the Democrats for Shifting
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
the cost of cleaning up plastic
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
pollution from taxpayers to the
 
00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
companies that make and use plastic
 
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
90 percent of registered Democrats and
 
00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:39.500 align:start position:0%
79 percent of registered Republicans
 
00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:42.839 align:start position:0%
were concerned about the extent of
 
00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
plastic found in our environment
 
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
76 percent of Republicans and 89 percent
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
of Democrats are concerned that less
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
than six percent of plastics are being
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
recycled and the rest sent to landfills
 
00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
exported incinerated or discarded into
 
00:37:08.589 --> 00:37:08.599 align:start position:0%
the environment
 
00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
therefore it's not surprising that 82
 
00:37:15.609 --> 00:37:15.619 align:start position:0%
percent of Democrats and 70 percent of
 
00:37:19.609 --> 00:37:19.619 align:start position:0%
Republicans agree that companies should
 
00:37:22.609 --> 00:37:22.619 align:start position:0%
stop producing and using so much
 
00:37:25.849 --> 00:37:25.859 align:start position:0%
single-use plastic an epr would
 
00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly do that
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
and in conclusion to that piece 66
 
00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
percent of Democrats and 70 percent of
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
Republicans say that taxpayers shouldn't
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
have to pay for the cleanup of plastic
 
00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
luckily we have a strong model epr bill
 
00:37:56.890 --> 00:37:56.900 align:start position:0%
that exists to guide New Hampshire
 
00:37:59.089 --> 00:37:59.099 align:start position:0%
legislators work
 
00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
the model epr Bill developed by just
 
00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:07.140 align:start position:0%
zero and Beyond plastic
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
addresses the key requirements for
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
Effective packaging reduction including
 
00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:17.300 align:start position:0%
strong oversight and accountability
 
00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:20.940 align:start position:0%
providing Financial relief to taxpayers
 
00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:25.140 align:start position:0%
and consumers reducing toxics in
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
packaging and establishing environmental
 
00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:32.700 align:start position:0%
standards for packaging among others
 
00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:36.839 align:start position:0%
this bottle bill could be easily adapted
 
00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire and I think would
 
00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
address the uh multiple types of
 
00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:45.900 align:start position:0%
products that we would cover
 
00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:46.550 align:start position:0%
products that we would cover
um

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
this per the the earlier discussion a
 
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:53.720 align:start position:0%
strong effective extended producer
 
00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
responsibility Bill offers the
 
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
opportunity to reduce waste going to our
 
00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
burgeoning landfills
 
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
to protect the health of our environment
 
00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:09.900 align:start position:0%
and our residents to increase jobs and
 
00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
to reduce the economic costs of dealing
 
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
with difficult to recycle plastic in
 
00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
other ways
 
00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
I hope this committee will seize this
 
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity and work to pass an epr bill
 
00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and both our Dover
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
group and the plastic working group
 
00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
stand ready to assist in whatever way we
 
00:39:43.609 --> 00:39:43.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:48.069 align:start position:0%
thank you
please

00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I don't know a lot about
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
it but in Northumberland there's a pilot
 
00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
program where they're taking
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
non-recyclable Plastics and turning it
 
00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
into fuel do you have any information on
 
00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:04.490 align:start position:0%
into fuel do you have any information on
that

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
um I don't know about that particular
 
00:40:07.079 --> 00:40:09.010 align:start position:0%
um I don't know about that particular
program

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:09.020 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:40:11.329 --> 00:40:11.339 align:start position:0%
but they're
 
00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
there there is again growing concern
 
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:18.260 align:start position:0%
about taking Plastics
 
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
incinerating them
 
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.030 align:start position:0%
incinerating them
um

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
releasing the toxics that they carry
 
00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
into our environment and we know you
 
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
know just recently with
 
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
um Sango Bain situation
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
the trouble we get ourselves into in
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
releasing toxic substances into our
 
00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.450 align:start position:0%
releasing toxic substances into our
environment

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:47.460 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
so you know our approach is go Upstream
 
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
reduce the Plastics particularly
 
00:40:59.329 --> 00:40:59.339 align:start position:0%
single-use Plastics there are Plastics
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
that you know are very important in
 
00:41:08.829 --> 00:41:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
but a lot of the Plastics that is that
 
00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:16.859 align:start position:0%
are being produced are non-essential
 
00:41:16.859 --> 00:41:20.030 align:start position:0%
are being produced are non-essential
polluting

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
and thank you also for your testimony um
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
could we get a copy of your testimony
 
00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
and may also asked the prior speaker I
 
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
can give you my email address if you
 
00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
need it I have I have copies okay
 
00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:37.430 align:start position:0%
need it I have I have copies okay
um

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind mailing it I if if
 
00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.569 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind mailing it I if if
it's

00:41:41.569 --> 00:41:41.579 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:44.460 align:start position:0%
um I can do both yeah
 
00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
makes it easier to put a record that way
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
00:41:50.329 --> 00:41:50.339 align:start position:0%
and uh and I have no questions but then
 
00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
again I think I've
 
00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
oh I do have one question
 
00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:57.950 align:start position:0%
oh I do have one question
um

00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
and this is something which I don't
 
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
expect to answer for right now you say
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
that our recycling rates dropped from
 
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:05.460 align:start position:0%
nine to five percent on many of these
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
could you Plastics yes could you find me
 
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:11.820 align:start position:0%
your citation on that absolutely it's
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
what it's just it's in there in here
 
00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
perfect perfect thank you so much sir I
 
00:42:17.569 --> 00:42:17.579 align:start position:0%
was surprised to hear that but not
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
my eye eyes on this time maybe I can get
 
00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
and plug nippy
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
am I close
 
00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:51.890 align:start position:0%
am I close
it

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:51.900 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
I don't want to limit your testimony we
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
have about 15 minutes before we have one
 
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
somebody else scheduled if that's if if
 
00:43:04.849 --> 00:43:04.859 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
free time to run over may I interrupt
 
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:10.140 align:start position:0%
and come back is that possible I just my
 
00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
name is Ann pod lipney I am from Chester
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
I am also part of the New Hampshire
 
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
Network Plastics working group and
 
00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:19.740 align:start position:0%
Christine baber did such an excellent
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
job of representing us that I don't have
 
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
very much to add at all just a couple of
 
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
little points but I think Christine
 
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
covered the the ground extremely well so
 
00:43:33.849 --> 00:43:33.859 align:start position:0%
the only thing I wanted to add is that
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
according to what I've found in my
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
research the recycling rate for
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
container deposit programs is 75 percent
 
00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
if you don't have such a program the
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
recycling rate is only 38 percent so
 
00:43:50.569 --> 00:43:50.579 align:start position:0%
there's an enormous difference between
 
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
those two the those percentages
 
00:43:58.370 --> 00:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
um the other factoid is I've also found
 
00:44:00.609 --> 00:44:00.619 align:start position:0%
uh from the container recycling
 
00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
Institute that the 10 bottle Bill States
 
00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:06.069 align:start position:0%
Institute that the 10 bottle Bill States
recycle

00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
recycle
 
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
490 containers per capita per year at a
 
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
cost of 1.53 cents per unit the 40
 
00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:19.700 align:start position:0%
non-body non-bottle Bill States recycle
 
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
191 containers per capita per year at a
 
00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
cost of 1.24 cents per unit thus for a
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
minimal price increase more than two and
 
00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
a half times as many containers are
 
00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:35.450 align:start position:0%
a half times as many containers are
recovered

00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
recovered
 
00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
so you can see the importance of this
 
00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
whole Initiative for uh epr and finally
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
no State bottle bill has ever been
 
00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
repealed which is interesting and three
 
00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
have expanded California Maine and
 
00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
Oregon have expanded to con to uh can
 
00:44:58.010 --> 00:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
include other containers so uh that's a
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
good fact to know that no bottle bill
 
00:45:02.329 --> 00:45:02.339 align:start position:0%
has ever been repealed and in fact it's
 
00:45:04.609 --> 00:45:04.619 align:start position:0%
the beginning of expanding them to other
 
00:45:04.619 --> 00:45:06.290 align:start position:0%
the beginning of expanding them to other
categories

00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
categories
 
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
so that's all I have to add again I
 
00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
think Christine has beautifully covered
 
00:45:14.329 --> 00:45:14.339 align:start position:0%
the environmental hazards the risk to
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
human health and the importance of
 
00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
reducing uh waste in our waste stream uh
 
00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
especially to prevent landfill buildup
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
and build up of plastic waste in our
 
00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:30.180 align:start position:0%
oceans rivers streams and other
 
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
so much for testimony and for updating
 
00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
us on the battle bills which I don't
 
00:45:41.329 --> 00:45:41.339 align:start position:0%
know if there'll be more to be said
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
about that in the future or not
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
and I also should add I don't know if
 
00:45:49.569 --> 00:45:49.579 align:start position:0%
that's really part of this particular
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh legislation I really can't say
 
00:45:56.089 --> 00:45:56.099 align:start position:0%
um but uh but thank you for picking it
 
00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
up they're good that's very good
 
00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.210 align:start position:0%
up they're good that's very good
information

00:45:59.210 --> 00:45:59.220 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:02.220 align:start position:0%
and again could we get a copy of your
 
00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:04.140 align:start position:0%
just email if you don't mind I will
 
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
you're going to recess for about 10
 
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
minutes sir while we get ready for our
 
00:46:16.849 --> 00:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
next uh person to testify
 
00:53:50.089 --> 00:53:50.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh speaking for the committee
 
00:53:58.430 --> 00:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
if anybody would care this is probably a
 
00:54:00.109 --> 00:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
little unusual but if anybody would care
 
00:54:03.049 --> 00:54:03.059 align:start position:0%
to come sit on this side of the table so
 
00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:04.980 align:start position:0%
you may watch as well you are welcome to
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
do so
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:15.780 align:start position:0%
and good morning Peter I don't know if
 
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
yes we can thank you so much well it
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:28.809 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:54:28.809 --> 00:54:28.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
yes we I I think we're looking forward
 
00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:33.300 align:start position:0%
to that in fact
 
00:54:33.300 --> 00:55:01.849 align:start position:0%
to that in fact
awesome

00:55:01.849 --> 00:55:01.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.609 --> 00:55:04.619 align:start position:0%
are you able to see the PowerPoint
 
00:55:07.069 --> 00:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
yes we are and I think we're all ready
 
00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:09.180 align:start position:0%
to get started when whenever you would
 
00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:26.109 --> 00:55:26.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
a new environment the organization we
 
00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:31.140 align:start position:0%
work with policy makers experts
 
00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:33.180 align:start position:0%
communities uh to implement just
 
00:55:35.210 --> 00:55:35.220 align:start position:0%
Equitable and sensible solutions to
 
00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
waste management issues a key component
 
00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
of my job
 
00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
understanding the website of YMCA
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
policies and proposals that solve waste
 
00:55:48.049 --> 00:55:48.059 align:start position:0%
management issues in an SM the last
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
year's specific event understanding
 
00:55:53.329 --> 00:55:53.339 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility for faculty and
 
00:55:56.890 --> 00:55:56.900 align:start position:0%
paper material or eprer
 
00:55:59.809 --> 00:55:59.819 align:start position:0%
at least four years this has become
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
probably the most widely discussed zero
 
00:56:05.329 --> 00:56:05.339 align:start position:0%
waste policy in the country so where are
 
00:56:05.339 --> 00:56:25.569 align:start position:0%
waste policy in the country so where are
we

00:56:25.569 --> 00:56:25.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
similar to what you guys have done with
 
00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
your study commission but they're
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
actually doing a comprehensive needs
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
assessment to to figure out the
 
00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:34.740 align:start position:0%
landscape and design a program that's
 
00:56:38.089 --> 00:56:38.099 align:start position:0%
tailored for their State uh look at just
 
00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
the laws that have passed that doesn't
 
00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:42.180 align:start position:0%
tell you the full picture so in 2023
 
00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:44.220 align:start position:0%
there were 18 different epr for
 
00:56:46.609 --> 00:56:46.619 align:start position:0%
packaging bills introduced across 12
 
00:56:49.609 --> 00:56:49.619 align:start position:0%
States uh and the interest in this
 
00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
policy really is not that surprising we
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
have a packaging waste crisis in this
 
00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
country roughly a third of all household
 
00:57:00.170 --> 00:57:00.180 align:start position:0%
waste is some form of packaging so think
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
plastic wrap cardboard boxes styrofoam
 
00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:06.140 align:start position:0%
bubble wrap all of that
 
00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
and right now uh we're buying things but
 
00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
we don't really want the packaging but
 
00:57:12.589 --> 00:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
we're stuck paying for the packaging
 
00:57:14.809 --> 00:57:14.819 align:start position:0%
anyway because it just comes with the
 
00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
products we're buying I think we've all
 
00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
had the experience where you buy
 
00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
something probably online only to end up
 
00:57:26.589 --> 00:57:26.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:29.329 --> 00:57:29.339 align:start position:0%
ultimately most of this is unrecyclable
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
plastic that can't be put anywhere
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
except into a landfill into a narrator
 
00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
or littered to other countries three
 
00:57:38.089 --> 00:57:38.099 align:start position:0%
options that are expensive and
 
00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
environmentally problematic
 
00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
um and without new laws this just is not
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
going to change uh right now the
 
00:57:46.609 --> 00:57:46.619 align:start position:0%
companies that design uh their products
 
00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
really have no incentive to change this
 
00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
system uh because we're the ones stuck
 
00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:54.180 align:start position:0%
paying to collect and manage all of this
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
materials uh in fact these companies
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
have an incentive to just make sure that
 
00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
their packaging their products as
 
00:58:01.849 --> 00:58:01.859 align:start position:0%
cheaply as possible since they're not
 
00:58:03.290 --> 00:58:03.300 align:start position:0%
connected to the end of like management
 
00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:06.180 align:start position:0%
of it but this really doesn't make sense
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
because local governments consumers we
 
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
don't have control over how these
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
products are being designed or the
 
00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:14.220 align:start position:0%
materials they're using to package their
 
00:58:16.790 --> 00:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
products so it's really this chicken and
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
egg game where they create a new type of
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
packaging some new type of plastic
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
and we're stopped trying to design items
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
that can manage is not working so epr
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
for packaging is designed to address it
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
by first and foremost taking that
 
00:58:33.049 --> 00:58:33.059 align:start position:0%
Financial incentive to pay for the cost
 
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
of collecting managing transporting all
 
00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
this packaging waste and disposing it
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
and recycling it from residents from
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers from communities and put it
 
00:58:43.309 --> 00:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
back on the companies that have control
 
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
over these products when properly
 
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
developed these programs can
 
00:58:49.549 --> 00:58:49.559 align:start position:0%
significantly increase recycling rates
 
00:58:51.410 --> 00:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
create a pathway towards a circular
 
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
economy and most importantly reduce
 
00:58:56.030 --> 00:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
waste in general here's how these
 
00:58:58.430 --> 00:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
programs work each company that sells or
 
00:59:01.130 --> 00:59:01.140 align:start position:0%
distributes products using any type of
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
single-use packaging has to be a part of
 
00:59:06.049 --> 00:59:06.059 align:start position:0%
a producer responsibility organization
 
00:59:08.530 --> 00:59:08.540 align:start position:0%
has to be a part of the program
 
00:59:10.970 --> 00:59:10.980 align:start position:0%
the program is going to be overseen by
 
00:59:12.589 --> 00:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
the state but implemented by that Pro
 
00:59:14.089 --> 00:59:14.099 align:start position:0%
that produce a responsibility
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
organization and each individual
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
producer is going to pay fees that cover
 
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
the whole cost of the system some of
 
00:59:22.609 --> 00:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
that money is going to go towards
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
reimbursing local governments for the
 
00:59:26.569 --> 00:59:26.579 align:start position:0%
cost of managing the waist and the rest
 
00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:27.660 align:start position:0%
of it is going to go towards system
 
00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:29.220 align:start position:0%
improvements making sure our recycling
 
00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
system is working making sure that
 
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
everything is moving to the end goals
 
00:59:35.049 --> 00:59:35.059 align:start position:0%
the end markets that we want it to
 
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
that's traditional epr we've seen a new
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
interest in also making sure that these
 
00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:41.700 align:start position:0%
systems are well designed and that
 
00:59:43.490 --> 00:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
there's pressure on producers to change
 
00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
the way that they're designing and
 
00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:46.980 align:start position:0%
marketing their products through
 
00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:49.140 align:start position:0%
performance standards
 
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
now all of this sounds really simple
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
right but obviously it's very nuanced
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
when you're trying to actually Implement
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
one of these programs so what just
 
01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
Sierra has done is two things first
 
01:00:02.569 --> 01:00:02.579 align:start position:0%
we've created model legislation to help
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
States Implement programs for their
 
01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:08.460 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions it's model legislation so
 
01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:10.140 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of boilerplate language
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
that we think could be applied to all
 
01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:13.140 align:start position:0%
programs but really it can be tailored
 
01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:14.220 align:start position:0%
by legislators to meet your
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
state-specific needs but we've also
 
01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
created a list of essential components
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
for a successful epr for packaging
 
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
program and both the model legislation
 
01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:25.140 align:start position:0%
and our components were created by
 
01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
looking at the existing programs across
 
01:00:29.569 --> 01:00:29.579 align:start position:0%
the world the laws that have been passed
 
01:00:31.069 --> 01:00:31.079 align:start position:0%
here in the US and the bills that are
 
01:00:32.809 --> 01:00:32.819 align:start position:0%
being considered to really understand
 
01:00:35.329 --> 01:00:35.339 align:start position:0%
how these programs how these are trying
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
to address the really thorny complex
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
issues when it comes to setting up a
 
01:00:42.289 --> 01:00:42.299 align:start position:0%
very big overarching program like APR
 
01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:44.460 align:start position:0%
for packaging so I'm just going to run
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
through with those essential components
 
01:00:48.049 --> 01:00:48.059 align:start position:0%
are and also if you have any questions
 
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
at any point just stop me
 
01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
I'd like to stop here for a moment if I
 
01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:53.270 align:start position:0%
I'd like to stop here for a moment if I
may

01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.530 align:start position:0%
may
yes

01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:00:57.049 --> 01:00:57.059 align:start position:0%
um is there any way you can make your
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint full screen I think at least
 
01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
I'm having trouble seeing some of it
 
01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:07.380 align:start position:0%
um okay I was full screen for me uh bear
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
with me for a second I'm gonna stop
 
01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
despite my youthful look I'm not as good
 
01:01:41.930 --> 01:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:47.339 align:start position:0%
okay uh is it full screen now
 
01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:50.460 align:start position:0%
I think that's it's much better
 
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
yeah it does I think that is full screen
 
01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:55.980 align:start position:0%
sorry I had a little trouble hearing you
 
01:02:00.289 --> 01:02:00.299 align:start position:0%
there oh yes short answer yes
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
okay great um sorry about that so okay
 
01:02:05.329 --> 01:02:05.339 align:start position:0%
the essential components for strong epr
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
packaging program the first the holistic
 
01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
make sure the program covers all
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
packaging material all papers possible
 
01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
with minimal exemptions uh and you want
 
01:02:14.089 --> 01:02:14.099 align:start position:0%
to make sure you're covering the whole
 
01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:16.140 align:start position:0%
range of producers of this packaging
 
01:02:17.809 --> 01:02:17.819 align:start position:0%
material with some exemptions for small
 
01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
businesses uh data driven you want to
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
make sure that the program is reflecting
 
01:02:24.049 --> 01:02:24.059 align:start position:0%
the needs of your specific States so you
 
01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:25.740 align:start position:0%
do that with a comprehensive needs
 
01:02:28.730 --> 01:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
assessment at the beginning second don't
 
01:02:30.890 --> 01:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
put the industry in charge regulated
 
01:02:32.329 --> 01:02:32.339 align:start position:0%
producers should have a role in the
 
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
development of the program it is
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility at all but that
 
01:02:38.569 --> 01:02:38.579 align:start position:0%
rule really should not be in setting the
 
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
core values of the program things like
 
01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
setting the fees determining the
 
01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:43.980 align:start position:0%
performance standards those types of
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
things those are better left with the
 
01:02:45.359 --> 01:02:46.370 align:start position:0%
things those are better left with the
state

01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
next create a strong transparent Key
 
01:02:50.089 --> 01:02:50.099 align:start position:0%
System the money created from the
 
01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
program is a really big component of
 
01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
this so you want to make sure that it is
 
01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:55.260 align:start position:0%
covering the whole cost of the program
 
01:02:57.710 --> 01:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
and that the fees are actually being
 
01:03:00.349 --> 01:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
used to incentivize good behavior by the
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
companies next with all of that money
 
01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
you also want to make sure it's going
 
01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
towards the objectives of the law so
 
01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:09.380 align:start position:0%
reimbursing towns and cities for their
 
01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
Recycling and Disposal costs and funding
 
01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
new infrastructure to make sure the
 
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
system's working even better next you
 
01:03:17.089 --> 01:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
want to make sure you have clear
 
01:03:19.609 --> 01:03:19.619 align:start position:0%
enforceable strong performance standards
 
01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
the fees alone even with Eco modulation
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
which I'll get into in a little bit just
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
aren't going to give you widespread
 
01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
benefits that can come from this type of
 
01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
program you really want to set
 
01:03:31.549 --> 01:03:31.559 align:start position:0%
environmental performance standards as
 
01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
part of the program that produce the
 
01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.450 align:start position:0%
part of the program that produce the
meat

01:03:34.450 --> 01:03:34.460 align:start position:0%
meat
 
01:03:37.130 --> 01:03:37.140 align:start position:0%
avoiding glaring loopholes uh this is a
 
01:03:39.109 --> 01:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
new type of policy there's a lot of
 
01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
nuance to it so there's a lot of ways
 
01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:43.140 align:start position:0%
that you can insert or you can insert
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
language to undermine the effectiveness
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
of the program so you want to make sure
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
that that's not included and then
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
finally you can say that's about any
 
01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
type of law but you really wrong
 
01:03:54.650 --> 01:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
oversight account be an enforcement a
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
good law on paper really is nothing if
 
01:03:59.870 --> 01:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be enforced it's
 
01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
okay be holistic let's try to cover as
 
01:04:05.329 --> 01:04:05.339 align:start position:0%
much packaging and paper as we can so
 
01:04:06.589 --> 01:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
first and foremost what does that mean
 
01:04:09.049 --> 01:04:09.059 align:start position:0%
it means covering primary secondary and
 
01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
tertiary packaging most epr for
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
packaging programs only focus on primary
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
packaging and that's the packaging uh
 
01:04:18.349 --> 01:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
that we get when we go and buy a product
 
01:04:20.809 --> 01:04:20.819 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of back-end packaging
 
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
that gets Associated from the
 
01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
development of the product shipping it
 
01:04:25.849 --> 01:04:25.859 align:start position:0%
to the Distributors and ultimately the
 
01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
retailers so you want to make sure
 
01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:28.980 align:start position:0%
that's covered
 
01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
um there are some exemptions things that
 
01:04:32.770 --> 01:04:32.780 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be covered under this program
 
01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
reusable and refillable packaging that's
 
01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
where we want the direction to go we
 
01:04:38.809 --> 01:04:38.819 align:start position:0%
want to get away from single use from
 
01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:43.140 align:start position:0%
that linear create use dispose system so
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
if you have reusable refillable
 
01:04:46.609 --> 01:04:46.619 align:start position:0%
packaging that shouldn't be covered to
 
01:04:48.609 --> 01:04:48.619 align:start position:0%
incentivize companies to switch to that
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
this containers paint other packaging
 
01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:53.099 align:start position:0%
that are better covered by a more
 
01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:55.140 align:start position:0%
targeted program those should be
 
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
excluded and covered by their own
 
01:04:59.569 --> 01:04:59.579 align:start position:0%
producer Responsibility program and then
 
01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
certain packing is covered by federal
 
01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
law and regulation the food drug and
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
cosmetic act those things you'll run
 
01:05:07.789 --> 01:05:07.799 align:start position:0%
into preemption issues sometimes so you
 
01:05:09.289 --> 01:05:09.299 align:start position:0%
need to be careful about making sure
 
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
that you accept those if you don't run
 
01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
into any legal issues there
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
so just quickly I mentioned this but
 
01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
when it comes to figuring out what those
 
01:05:20.809 --> 01:05:20.819 align:start position:0%
targeted specific types of packaging
 
01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:22.140 align:start position:0%
that are better managed by other
 
01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:24.780 align:start position:0%
programs uh the biggest one is a bottle
 
01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:27.059 align:start position:0%
Bill uh there's been a renewed interest
 
01:05:28.849 --> 01:05:28.859 align:start position:0%
in Bottle bills wow there's been this
 
01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
uptick in epr for packaging interest and
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
it makes sense both of them are
 
01:05:35.569 --> 01:05:35.579 align:start position:0%
packaging uh widely glittered products
 
01:05:37.490 --> 01:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
things that are just not being recycled
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
as possible really the question
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be do you include bottle bills
 
01:05:43.789 --> 01:05:43.799 align:start position:0%
and epr for packaging it should be how
 
01:05:45.770 --> 01:05:45.780 align:start position:0%
to create a complementary bottle Bill
 
01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
system and there's three reasons you
 
01:05:49.609 --> 01:05:49.619 align:start position:0%
really want a separate bottle Bill
 
01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
program the first when you include
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
beverage containers in epr for packaging
 
01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
you're losing the litter reduction
 
01:05:57.849 --> 01:05:57.859 align:start position:0%
benefits that are core to bottle bills
 
01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
so when you have a bottle Bill program
 
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
and you place that refundable deposit on
 
01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
every single used beverage container
 
01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
sold in the state that creates an
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
incentive for people to hold on to their
 
01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
empty cans and bottles bring them back
 
01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
for recycling and make sure that they're
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
properly managed that's really important
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
because beverage containers are
 
01:06:17.809 --> 01:06:17.819 align:start position:0%
generally consumed on the go right have
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
them in your car you have them when
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
you're leaving the house there's a
 
01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
reason we see Coke bottles beer bottles
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
all these things littered across our
 
01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods but you're not seeing uh
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
cereal boxes or peanut butter it's
 
01:06:30.049 --> 01:06:30.059 align:start position:0%
because beverage containers are
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
different from us packaging they're
 
01:06:33.529 --> 01:06:33.539 align:start position:0%
consumed on the go so if you want that
 
01:06:35.410 --> 01:06:35.420 align:start position:0%
litter reduction you need a bottle build
 
01:06:38.809 --> 01:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
second recycling beverage containers are
 
01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
made of materials that are highly
 
01:06:42.529 --> 01:06:42.539 align:start position:0%
recyclable if they're actually kept
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
clean and uncontaminated so when you
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
create a bottle build program you're
 
01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
creating a standalone system that is
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
just managing those containers your
 
01:06:52.849 --> 01:06:52.859 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing that you have a clean
 
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
stream of high quality recycled content
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
that can be repurposed into new things
 
01:07:00.589 --> 01:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
if you have them in an epr packaging
 
01:07:01.849 --> 01:07:01.859 align:start position:0%
system they're going to stay in that
 
01:07:03.529 --> 01:07:03.539 align:start position:0%
single stream they're going to stay in
 
01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
the you know curbside recycling system
 
01:07:06.410 --> 01:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
and you're just not going to get the
 
01:07:08.569 --> 01:07:08.579 align:start position:0%
same benefits and then third and perhaps
 
01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
most importantly is you lose the ReUse
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
and refill value if you don't have
 
01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
so bottle meals create the consumer
 
01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
culture as well as the systems needed to
 
01:07:19.609 --> 01:07:19.619 align:start position:0%
transition from single-use beverage
 
01:07:21.770 --> 01:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
containers to reusable and refillable
 
01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
ones uh Oregon has already done this
 
01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
they've had their bottle Bill program
 
01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:26.819 align:start position:0%
for I think they're the the second
 
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
longest so it's been since about the 70s
 
01:07:30.650 --> 01:07:30.660 align:start position:0%
and recently they've started to
 
01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
integrate reusable beverage containers
 
01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
into their programs and for the consumer
 
01:07:36.589 --> 01:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
nothing's changed they still go and drop
 
01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
off the containers at their Redemption
 
01:07:42.049 --> 01:07:42.059 align:start position:0%
Center points of drop off but instead of
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
having the bottles crushed up and
 
01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
recycled they're clean sterilized and
 
01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
reused which has significant
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:53.809 --> 01:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
so okay that's what's regulated now the
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
big question is who's regulated uh who
 
01:07:58.250 --> 01:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
is the producer under the system uh
 
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
generally it's anyone who sells offers
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
for sale or distributes products using
 
01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
single use packaging in the state but
 
01:08:06.049 --> 01:08:06.059 align:start position:0%
what's really important is that you use
 
01:08:08.569 --> 01:08:08.579 align:start position:0%
a tiered approach to Define insert with
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
the goal of targeting the largest
 
01:08:12.349 --> 01:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
possible company who could be considered
 
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
the producer of the product of the
 
01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
packaging itself
 
01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:19.739 align:start position:0%
that way you're not going after just a
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
small in-state business that is selling
 
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
it on behalf of a bigger company right
 
01:08:25.729 --> 01:08:25.739 align:start position:0%
the idea is to get changes in the design
 
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
of the packaging so you want to make
 
01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:28.739 align:start position:0%
sure you're regulating the company that
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
has control over how the product is
 
01:08:32.110 --> 01:08:32.120 align:start position:0%
being designed
 
01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
and you should have some exemptions for
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
small businesses generally when you look
 
01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
at the laws that have passed these
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
exemptions are kind of twofold the first
 
01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
is you pick a certain amount of gross
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
annual income and if a company makes
 
01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:45.900 align:start position:0%
under that they're accepted from the
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
program and the second is if they're
 
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
using a relatively small amount of
 
01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
packaging material to sell and
 
01:08:52.849 --> 01:08:52.859 align:start position:0%
distribute their products this typically
 
01:08:58.729 --> 01:08:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
okay so that's the first one next is a
 
01:09:03.530 --> 01:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
data-driven program using a
 
01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:05.819 align:start position:0%
comprehensive needs assessment to figure
 
01:09:08.209 --> 01:09:08.219 align:start position:0%
out what the specifics of your state are
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
so you can have a really tailored
 
01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.030 align:start position:0%
so you can have a really tailored
program

01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
um so when it comes to waste management
 
01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
and especially packaging waste we really
 
01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
have a limited amount of data we don't
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
know how much packaging ways the state
 
01:09:21.650 --> 01:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
is dealing with how much of it's cycled
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
how much of it's deposed of what types
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
of materials are actually recyclable in
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
your jurisdiction all of this
 
01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
information is really necessary to
 
01:09:32.570 --> 01:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
having a strong program so what you want
 
01:09:34.610 --> 01:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
to do with the outset is require this
 
01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
needs assessment to figure out where
 
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
things stand now how do we get them to a
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
better place and what are the
 
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities for targeted Investments
 
01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
and how much does it actually cost to
 
01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
manage all this material in the first
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
place and you can do this either as part
 
01:09:50.570 --> 01:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
of a comprehensive bill or you can pass
 
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
a standalone needs assessment bill which
 
01:09:54.050 --> 01:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
is what Maryland and Illinois did this
 
01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:55.669 align:start position:0%
is what Maryland and Illinois did this
year

01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
so next uh this is a very big component
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
of it is figuring out the right balance
 
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
between the state and the producer
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility organization the the pro
 
01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
the non-profit entity that's going to
 
01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
kind of run the system on behalf of the
 
01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:10.010 align:start position:0%
kind of run the system on behalf of the
producers

01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:10.020 align:start position:0%
producers
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
so responsibility does not mean
 
01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:14.460 align:start position:0%
unregulated producer control over the
 
01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
program in reality it means the opposite
 
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
the laws and regulations that are
 
01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
designed the program are going to be I
 
01:10:21.610 --> 01:10:21.620 align:start position:0%
said they're going to say clear
 
01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
understandable and enforceable standards
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
which The Producers must meet and then
 
01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
the producer responsibility organization
 
01:10:31.850 --> 01:10:31.860 align:start position:0%
we recommend there's only one so all the
 
01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
producers are under this umbrella uh are
 
01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
going to be responsible for complying
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
with the components of the law
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
to ensure the breakdown of his power
 
01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:43.020 align:start position:0%
there's two things you can do and
 
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
actually Maine's program did both abuse
 
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
really well in my opinion the first is
 
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
have in the law a clear breakdown of
 
01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
what the responsibilities for the pro is
 
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
and what the state is and the second is
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
to not let the producers themselves just
 
01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
create the producer responsibility
 
01:10:59.209 --> 01:10:59.219 align:start position:0%
organization but have the state select
 
01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:00.900 align:start position:0%
one through a comprehensive bidding
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
process so first figuring out who should
 
01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
be in charge of what the state should be
 
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
in charge of the really big picture
 
01:11:08.689 --> 01:11:08.699 align:start position:0%
things things like setting the
 
01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
performance standards setting the fees
 
01:11:12.890 --> 01:11:12.900 align:start position:0%
determining the fee structures and
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
ultimately determining what type of
 
01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
packaging is readily recyclable in your
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction on the other hand the
 
01:11:19.970 --> 01:11:19.980 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility organization
 
01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
should act more as a data and compliance
 
01:11:24.649 --> 01:11:24.659 align:start position:0%
applicator they should be responsible
 
01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
for collecting the fees from
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
participating producers making sure that
 
01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
all the compliance data is being sent in
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
an understandable format to the
 
01:11:34.970 --> 01:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
department and making sure that the
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
producers are meeting the requirements
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
under the law again to help with this
 
01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
that competitive solicitation process
 
01:11:42.169 --> 01:11:42.179 align:start position:0%
that Maine's doing should really help
 
01:11:44.330 --> 01:11:44.340 align:start position:0%
they're going to issue an RFP and then
 
01:11:45.649 --> 01:11:45.659 align:start position:0%
people are going to bid to be that
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
okay this are obviously a very big
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
they'll produce responsibility uh you
 
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that the fees are
 
01:11:58.510 --> 01:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
designed in a clear and transparent way
 
01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
so one of the most important thing is to
 
01:12:02.689 --> 01:12:02.699 align:start position:0%
make sure that you're covering the whole
 
01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
cost associated with the program so what
 
01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
does that include the actual cost of
 
01:12:09.709 --> 01:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
collecting transporting managing dealing
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
with all the covered packaging material
 
01:12:14.450 --> 01:12:14.460 align:start position:0%
that should be included in the fees next
 
01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
you want to make sure that the
 
01:12:17.290 --> 01:12:17.300 align:start position:0%
Department's environmental
 
01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
administrative enforcement all of their
 
01:12:21.229 --> 01:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
work to keep this program afloat is
 
01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
being covered so that you don't need
 
01:12:24.530 --> 01:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funding to keep this thing
 
01:12:27.050 --> 01:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
going the pros administration of the
 
01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
program kind of that breakdown I just
 
01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
talked about they are going to have a
 
01:12:31.669 --> 01:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
role that should be covered by the
 
01:12:33.890 --> 01:12:33.900 align:start position:0%
program as well and then also things
 
01:12:35.570 --> 01:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
like the cost of promulgating the rules
 
01:12:37.130 --> 01:12:37.140 align:start position:0%
paying for the needs assessment you want
 
01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
all of that big into the overarching fee
 
01:12:41.630 --> 01:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
so this is really a completely closed
 
01:12:44.209 --> 01:12:44.219 align:start position:0%
loop that the fees the producers are
 
01:12:46.490 --> 01:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
paying over the entire system you don't
 
01:12:48.050 --> 01:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
need outside funding you're not going to
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
run into play issues
 
01:12:50.159 --> 01:12:51.350 align:start position:0%
run into play issues
foreign

01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
so that's the large fees in general how
 
01:12:55.970 --> 01:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
you figure out the big pot what the
 
01:12:58.010 --> 01:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
whole system is going to cost Nick
 
01:13:00.050 --> 01:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
making sure that the individ producer
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
payments are designed in a way to seek
 
01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
environmental benefits so each
 
01:13:07.010 --> 01:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
individual producer is going to pay a
 
01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
quart of that big number but fee based
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
on the amount of packaging material that
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
they use any type of packaging material
 
01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
that they use and each type of material
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
is probably going to have a different
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
fee so things like paper and cardboard
 
01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
that are highly recyclable that have
 
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
good recycling rates those are going to
 
01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
probably have a lower fee in something
 
01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:26.830 align:start position:0%
probably have a lower fee in something
like

01:13:26.830 --> 01:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
single-use plastic film which really can
 
01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
only be burned or buried
 
01:13:32.689 --> 01:13:32.699 align:start position:0%
um so that's how you're going to get a
 
01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
base fee but then that base fee should
 
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
be further change and eco-modulated and
 
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
this is just adjusting it to incentivize
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
good behavior so if the specific type of
 
01:13:44.930 --> 01:13:44.940 align:start position:0%
packaging you're talking about is
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
recyclable if it doesn't have toxic
 
01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
materials in it if it has a certain
 
01:13:51.169 --> 01:13:51.179 align:start position:0%
portion of recycled content all things
 
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
will want to see that producer species
 
01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
Rock and conversely those who aren't
 
01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
doing those things are using
 
01:13:59.570 --> 01:13:59.580 align:start position:0%
unrecyclable materials who have
 
01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
Incorporated recycled content who
 
01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
haven't faced out toxic materials their
 
01:14:05.209 --> 01:14:05.219 align:start position:0%
fees will increase
 
01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
any kind of marketing for the results we
 
01:14:10.370 --> 01:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
want to see packaging reduction in
 
01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:12.770 align:start position:0%
want to see packaging reduction in
redesign

01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:12.780 align:start position:0%
redesign
 
01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
next make sure that the money is
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
actually funding the solutions so
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
there's going to be different ways the
 
01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
money is used to the program the first
 
01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
kind of bucket is covering the cost of
 
01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:24.900 align:start position:0%
the program I talked about this already
 
01:14:26.810 --> 01:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
make sure that a good chunk of the money
 
01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
is just keeping the system running and
 
01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
taking care of the whole system's cost
 
01:14:32.930 --> 01:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
of administration but the second is more
 
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
about funding improvements to recycling
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
and packaging management you want to
 
01:14:38.330 --> 01:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's Investments that
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
are going to help reduce packaging waste
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
and improve Recycling and you do this in
 
01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
two ways first is by those reimbursement
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
payments to cover local government's
 
01:14:48.169 --> 01:14:48.179 align:start position:0%
cost of managing packaging ways this
 
01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
will significantly reduce their tax
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
burdens it will shift that Financial
 
01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:53.580 align:start position:0%
component of the understanding of manage
 
01:14:55.970 --> 01:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
packaging waste from good use that to
 
01:14:58.490 --> 01:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
the producers and next is you don't just
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
want to fund the system that we have
 
01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
currently because it's unfortunately not
 
01:15:03.649 --> 01:15:03.659 align:start position:0%
working so you want to make sure that
 
01:15:05.209 --> 01:15:05.219 align:start position:0%
there's funds for system improvements
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
and you do that to targeted grants that
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
are going to improve the waste
 
01:15:10.010 --> 01:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
management system
 
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
so we recommend doing that through a
 
01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
packaging reduction and recycling grant
 
01:15:16.370 --> 01:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
program so a portion of the money will
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
go into this fund the producer
 
01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
responsibility organization is going to
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
be responsible for reviewing Grant
 
01:15:22.970 --> 01:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
applications and making recommendations
 
01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
to the State Environmental agency here
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
01:15:29.689 --> 01:15:29.699 align:start position:0%
about what should be funded the grants
 
01:15:31.130 --> 01:15:31.140 align:start position:0%
need to be focused on eliminating
 
01:15:33.290 --> 01:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
single-use packaging increasing the
 
01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
transition of singlings packaging to
 
01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
reusable and refillable packaging
 
01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
increasing the recyclability of
 
01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
single-use packaging uh investments in
 
01:15:42.649 --> 01:15:42.659 align:start position:0%
reuse and rebuild infrastructure which
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
are going to be necessary and providing
 
01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
education and Outreach so everyone knows
 
01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
the proper ways management methods for
 
01:15:52.729 --> 01:15:52.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:55.490 --> 01:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
oh so a lot of that is just fee based
 
01:15:56.689 --> 01:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
right what I've talked about at this
 
01:15:58.970 --> 01:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
point but unfortunately that's not
 
01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:00.780 align:start position:0%
really going to do a good enough job to
 
01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:02.460 align:start position:0%
get the kind of widespread changes that
 
01:16:04.010 --> 01:16:04.020 align:start position:0%
we want
 
01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:04.669 align:start position:0%
we want
um

01:16:04.669 --> 01:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know just creating a system that
 
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
shifts of paying and paying uh packaging
 
01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
waste from individuals local governments
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
to the producers just is not going to
 
01:16:16.850 --> 01:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
work uh in fact as a result of kind of
 
01:16:18.649 --> 01:16:18.659 align:start position:0%
exclusively focusing on this speed
 
01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
shifting uh mechanisms existing producer
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility laws really haven't
 
01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
achieved the significant packaging waste
 
01:16:27.410 --> 01:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
production or packaging redesign that we
 
01:16:28.970 --> 01:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
want to see and that's because a lot of
 
01:16:30.290 --> 01:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
the money is continuing to flow
 
01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
Downstream towards collection disposal
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
and recycling so even when the programs
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
attempt to kind of get around this
 
01:16:40.010 --> 01:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
through Eco modulation what I talked
 
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
about before incentivizing good behavior
 
01:16:44.330 --> 01:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
punishing bad it's really just not a
 
01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
strong enough economic trigger to have
 
01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:48.900 align:start position:0%
serious change so what you want to do
 
01:16:50.810 --> 01:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
with effective modern producer
 
01:16:52.970 --> 01:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
responsibility programs is set clear
 
01:16:54.830 --> 01:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
environmental standards that focus on
 
01:16:57.709 --> 01:16:57.719 align:start position:0%
packaging cycling we're talking about
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
rates and dates setting specific targets
 
01:17:02.090 --> 01:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
for when a certain amount of packaging
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
has to be reduced and how much that
 
01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
needs to be recycled
 
01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
um this is starting to happen especially
 
01:17:10.970 --> 01:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
in the U.S California currently is
 
01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
packaging reduction requirements in
 
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
their law and they only applied a
 
01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
plastic plastic packaging but it's a
 
01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
good start Oregon's program has a very
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
specific recycling requirements for both
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
plastic packaging and single-use Food
 
01:17:26.330 --> 01:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
Service wear they're requiring that all
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
of that material will be recycled at a
 
01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
rate of 25 by 2028 50 by 2040 and then
 
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
70 by 2015. uh Maine's law did not
 
01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
actually set any of these performance
 
01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:39.300 align:start position:0%
standards in statute but they're being
 
01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
figured out through the rulemaking
 
01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
process which is happening right now
 
01:17:46.970 --> 01:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
um next avoid flaring loopholes again
 
01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
this is a new type of program it's
 
01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
Innovative which that invites a whole
 
01:17:53.570 --> 01:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
bunch of nonsense and uh ways that users
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
can minimize stiffness of the program
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
and this is really important because
 
01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:00.300 align:start position:0%
these programs take a while to get off
 
01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
the ground for instance Maine passed
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
their launch live 2021 they're still in
 
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
the process of developing the Draft
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
rules we're talking probably two to
 
01:18:10.729 --> 01:18:10.739 align:start position:0%
three more years before their programs
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
fully implemented so if you have any
 
01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:14.820 align:start position:0%
loopholes or inefficiencies in your
 
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
program in the law it's going to take a
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
while before the program is even up and
 
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
running pretty last end so the two
 
01:18:23.149 --> 01:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
biggest ones we're seeing is inviting
 
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
false Solutions so weak definitions of
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
recycling that allow for things like
 
01:18:29.090 --> 01:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
Advanced recycling or chemical recycling
 
01:18:32.570 --> 01:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
this could be its own topic
 
01:18:34.370 --> 01:18:34.380 align:start position:0%
so I'm not going to go into all of it I
 
01:18:35.810 --> 01:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
will just say there is a significant
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
amount of data that shows that advanced
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
recycling or chemical recycling does not
 
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
actually result in the meaningful
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
recycling of plastic material
 
01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
um and another common thing we're seeing
 
01:18:48.189 --> 01:18:48.199 align:start position:0%
is just very large and vague exemptions
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
California's law has a really good
 
01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
example of this they're going to exempt
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
any single-use packaging material that
 
01:18:55.610 --> 01:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
presents a unique challenge in terms of
 
01:18:57.770 --> 01:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
compliance with the law as an attorney
 
01:18:59.810 --> 01:18:59.820 align:start position:0%
that's just a gold mine no one knows
 
01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
what that's going to mean you can
 
01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
litigate that for years to come and it's
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
going to result in a lot of material
 
01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
being excluded which doesn't need not
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
there it just means being paid for by
 
01:19:10.970 --> 01:19:10.980 align:start position:0%
the system
 
01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
and then finally strong oversight
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
accountability and enforcement you can
 
01:19:16.490 --> 01:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
say this with any type of law but you
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
really want to make sure what you write
 
01:19:19.010 --> 01:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
on paper is going to have a real world
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
impact so enforcement make sure the
 
01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
State Environmental agency has adequate
 
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement measures in the law to bring
 
01:19:27.290 --> 01:19:27.300 align:start position:0%
actions against individual producers and
 
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
the pro oversight you want periodic
 
01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
audits of the program to track how much
 
01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
money is being brought in is that money
 
01:19:36.169 --> 01:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
being spent in accordance with the
 
01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
requirements of the law and our
 
01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
producers complying with the
 
01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
environmental standards that are set and
 
01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
then finally accountability you want to
 
01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
make sure that all of this is publicly
 
01:19:46.850 --> 01:19:46.860 align:start position:0%
transparent that people can weigh in on
 
01:19:50.209 --> 01:19:50.219 align:start position:0%
the system and that they understand it I
 
01:19:52.189 --> 01:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
know that was a lot probably very
 
01:19:53.930 --> 01:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
quickly so I'm happy to answer any
 
01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:57.610 align:start position:0%
quickly so I'm happy to answer any
questions

01:19:57.610 --> 01:19:57.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:02.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:20:02.810 --> 01:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
one of the keys that seems to have an
 
01:20:09.050 --> 01:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
effective program is making sure that um
 
01:20:11.630 --> 01:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
adequate what I would assume would be
 
01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:15.420 align:start position:0%
consumer sorting of these various
 
01:20:19.250 --> 01:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
products uh keeping uh bio waste you
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
know compostable things out of the waste
 
01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.090 align:start position:0%
know compostable things out of the waste
flow

01:20:23.090 --> 01:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
flow
 
01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:25.189 align:start position:0%
flow
um

01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:27.410 --> 01:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
making sure that
 
01:20:30.110 --> 01:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
things are separated properly and this
 
01:20:31.729 --> 01:20:31.739 align:start position:0%
would probably require some amount of
 
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
Education to the consumer
 
01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh you were you had quite a list of what
 
01:20:40.810 --> 01:20:40.820 align:start position:0%
uh could be done Beyond
 
01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
uh just the fees themselves being levied
 
01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:45.950 align:start position:0%
uh just the fees themselves being levied
back

01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:20:47.810 --> 01:20:47.820 align:start position:0%
um is consumer education is part of that
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
did I miss that
 
01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
so where education is a big part of it
 
01:20:56.810 --> 01:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.970 --> 01:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
necessarily the state
 
01:20:59.870 --> 01:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
um they're the ones who are
 
01:21:02.209 --> 01:21:02.219 align:start position:0%
manufacturing the products they're going
 
01:21:03.950 --> 01:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
to have this kind of umbrella of the
 
01:21:05.570 --> 01:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
producers that understand their products
 
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
and the packaging associated with it we
 
01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
see a big role that they're going to
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
play is creating that uniformed list of
 
01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
educational materials that paint what is
 
01:21:14.810 --> 01:21:14.820 align:start position:0%
recyclable what can actually be recycled
 
01:21:16.610 --> 01:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
in let's say New Hampshire what
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
currently isn't how they should be
 
01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:21.300 align:start position:0%
managed those types of things and
 
01:21:23.330 --> 01:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
education is a big part of these
 
01:21:24.890 --> 01:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
programs especially in Europe where
 
01:21:28.490 --> 01:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
they've been in place since the 1990s
 
01:21:33.729 --> 01:21:33.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:36.290 --> 01:21:36.300 align:start position:0%
we will get a copy of that PowerPoint is
 
01:21:37.729 --> 01:21:37.739 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
yes I can send you a copy the PowerPoint
 
01:21:42.290 --> 01:21:42.300 align:start position:0%
and I didn't necessarily have a written
 
01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
testimony but bullet points which I'm
 
01:21:45.890 --> 01:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
also happened to Fair sure that that
 
01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
both would be very helpful
 
01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:49.250 align:start position:0%
both would be very helpful
um

01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:50.930 --> 01:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
I think I'll save the rest of my
 
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
questions for all flying if that's okay
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
I need to do a little processing on this
 
01:21:56.630 --> 01:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
but I want to thank you for your
 
01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.729 align:start position:0%
but I want to thank you for your
testimony

01:21:58.729 --> 01:21:58.739 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:22:00.649 --> 01:22:00.659 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for having me
 
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
could I ask a question
 
01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:20.930 align:start position:0%
could I ask a question
foreign

01:22:20.930 --> 01:22:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:24.229 --> 01:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead please uh yes I have a
 
01:22:24.239 --> 01:22:25.070 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead please uh yes I have a
question

01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:22:28.970 --> 01:22:28.980 align:start position:0%
um I know in the process of
 
01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
making plastic
 
01:22:34.490 --> 01:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
thousands of chemicals are being used
 
01:22:37.189 --> 01:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
none of them or very few of them are
 
01:22:39.770 --> 01:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
ever regulated or restricted
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
when you down cycle plastic
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
what incentive is there in this process
 
01:22:49.729 --> 01:22:49.739 align:start position:0%
of repackaging and uh you know these epr
 
01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
laws to reduce the number of chemicals
 
01:22:56.090 --> 01:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
in plastic when it's being recycled
 
01:22:58.010 --> 01:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
because when it gets recycled it's
 
01:23:00.169 --> 01:23:00.179 align:start position:0%
coming back to us even though it's
 
01:23:03.410 --> 01:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
downgraded we're still getting them and
 
01:23:05.090 --> 01:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
what is the incentive for these
 
01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
industries to reduce the number of
 
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
chemicals being used and and exposing
 
01:23:13.850 --> 01:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:15.770 --> 01:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
that's a great question
 
01:23:18.290 --> 01:23:18.300 align:start position:0%
um currently right now no incentive
 
01:23:19.729 --> 01:23:19.739 align:start position:0%
right they're completely detached from
 
01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
the end of life management of this if
 
01:23:23.330 --> 01:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
they include toxics and they're fill and
 
01:23:26.209 --> 01:23:26.219 align:start position:0%
if those toxic does when we're using the
 
01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:27.719 align:start position:0%
products when they're being recycled
 
01:23:29.810 --> 01:23:29.820 align:start position:0%
it's not their problem through epr
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
there's kind of two ways you can do it
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
the first is that Eco modulation so
 
01:23:35.689 --> 01:23:35.699 align:start position:0%
making sure that the fees are tailored
 
01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
to those environmental outcomes and most
 
01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
of the programs that are coming up in
 
01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
the U.S they have Eco modulation for
 
01:23:45.169 --> 01:23:45.179 align:start position:0%
toxic so if you reduce the amount of
 
01:23:46.430 --> 01:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
toxics that are present in your
 
01:23:48.770 --> 01:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
packaging your feed goes down if you
 
01:23:50.330 --> 01:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
still have harmful toxins in the
 
01:23:52.729 --> 01:23:52.739 align:start position:0%
packaging fee goes up so that's that's
 
01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
one way and that can be very helpful the
 
01:23:57.290 --> 01:23:57.300 align:start position:0%
other way is with those performance
 
01:23:59.390 --> 01:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
standards I was talking about calling
 
01:24:02.209 --> 01:24:02.219 align:start position:0%
out specific types of toxics and just
 
01:24:04.490 --> 01:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
phasing them out and requiring that all
 
01:24:06.110 --> 01:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
of The Producers regulated under this
 
01:24:10.250 --> 01:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
program must phase out X toxins in our
 
01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
bill we've done that I is a list of the
 
01:24:16.130 --> 01:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
common problematic toxics in plastic and
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
consumer good packaging as a starting
 
01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
point and then allowing the state
 
01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
environment agency to periodically
 
01:24:24.410 --> 01:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
remove additional toxic materials and
 
01:24:25.729 --> 01:24:25.739 align:start position:0%
determine if they should be included in
 
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
the program and included in that phase
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
out so it is a big problem and you can't
 
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
really have anything that's recyclable
 
01:24:34.370 --> 01:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
if it has toxics in it because even if
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
they're present in the initial packaging
 
01:24:37.490 --> 01:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
when you create it heating them up going
 
01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
through the recycling process it really
 
01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
does increase the likelihood that
 
01:24:47.510 --> 01:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:49.669 --> 01:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
one more question from our
 
01:24:49.679 --> 01:24:50.930 align:start position:0%
one more question from our
representative

01:24:50.930 --> 01:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:24:53.450 --> 01:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
Sherry dutzy
 
01:24:55.970 --> 01:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
hi Peter uh representative Sherry dutzy
 
01:24:58.250 --> 01:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
here how you doing uh I had a question
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
about the echo modulation and how is
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
that regulated would we as a state have
 
01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
to set up uh maybe a a laboratory that
 
01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
you know if the packaging has been
 
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
changed then the producer just submits
 
01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
the new packaging for testing so that we
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
know that the formula has been changed
 
01:25:34.669 --> 01:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:36.890 --> 01:25:36.900 align:start position:0%
ultimately you'd want the state to come
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
up with the entire fee structure and
 
01:25:40.490 --> 01:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
Maine is going through this process
 
01:25:42.110 --> 01:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
right now with their rules so you're
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
going to figure out a laundry list of
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
packaging in general you're going to
 
01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
assign a fee to each type of packaging
 
01:25:52.669 --> 01:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
so Plastics one two three four all the
 
01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
way through seven cardboard paper glass
 
01:25:57.070 --> 01:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
steel aluminum
 
01:25:59.810 --> 01:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
and then you're gonna figure out in the
 
01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
legislation or in the rulemaking process
 
01:26:03.649 --> 01:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
how you want to Eco modulate it what is
 
01:26:06.110 --> 01:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
going to be given kind of pluses and
 
01:26:09.290 --> 01:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
minuses and then the producers are going
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
to pay individual fees based on their
 
01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
packaging portfolio and they're going to
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
have to submit uh you know plans not
 
01:26:17.629 --> 01:26:17.639 align:start position:0%
plan sorry um
 
01:26:21.290 --> 01:26:21.300 align:start position:0%
reports to the pro to show kind of where
 
01:26:23.689 --> 01:26:23.699 align:start position:0%
they are okay with this specific type of
 
01:26:25.870 --> 01:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
car packaging it's got a 50
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
post-consumer to recycled content uh
 
01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
that's why our fees should be this and
 
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
the pro is responsible for collecting
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
the fees and doing everything with the
 
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
money but the state sets the
 
01:26:38.450 --> 01:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
requirements and then those audits I
 
01:26:39.890 --> 01:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
talked about in the enforcement section
 
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's how you make sure everything's
 
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
you know working as properly as it
 
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
should be and that there's no funny
 
01:26:51.790 --> 01:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
those are one of those things that sound
 
01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
a lot more complicated than you think
 
01:26:57.290 --> 01:26:57.300 align:start position:0%
but I'd encourage you to look at Maine's
 
01:26:58.669 --> 01:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
process where they're figuring out the
 
01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
rules and it is complicated but you know
 
01:27:02.930 --> 01:27:02.940 align:start position:0%
we've got a lot of very complicated
 
01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
environmental programs in this country
 
01:27:08.209 --> 01:27:08.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:11.209 --> 01:27:11.219 align:start position:0%
foreign thank you again Peter and I
 
01:27:12.649 --> 01:27:12.659 align:start position:0%
don't think we have many more questions
 
01:27:14.209 --> 01:27:14.219 align:start position:0%
for you and I want to thank you for the
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
excellent questions in addition to
 
01:27:19.010 --> 01:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
um what you presented
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm seeking for our next meeting I
 
01:27:30.890 --> 01:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
would really like to consult with our
 
01:27:32.930 --> 01:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
two absent members before we reschedule
 
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
does that make sense to you
 
01:27:37.729 --> 01:27:37.739 align:start position:0%
um beyond that I believe our business
 
01:27:43.129 --> 01:27:43.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:44.570 --> 01:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to ask for a motion to
 
01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:47.060 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to ask for a motion to
adjourn
