00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you all for being here today I'm
 
00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
not used to sitting in this
 
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
chair um so we are coming together for
 
00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee on House Bill
 
00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 align:start position:0%
553 um we want to respect all the work
 
00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 align:start position:0%
that was done by Senator Carson and her
 
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
committee over last summer and fall
 
00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
along with a lot of our Advocates and we
 
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
do think that they did a very thorough
 
00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 align:start position:0%
job but some questions some worries have
 
00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
come up so we just want to make sure
 
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
that we have all of those kind of
 
00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
fleshed out so that that way people can
 
00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 align:start position:0%
understand where it's coming from how
 
00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 align:start position:0%
this law would impact um or how this
 
00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
change in 169c would actually impact um
 
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 align:start position:0%
the state and families in the state I
 
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
also want to start out by saying that on
 
00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 align:start position:0%
House Bill 5 53 this is not a um a
 
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
punishment thing or anything this is
 
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
literally the definitions of child abuse
 
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 align:start position:0%
and neglect and the rebuttable
 
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 align:start position:0%
presumption of harm and abuse and
 
00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
neglect case so this is really the
 
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
foundation of how we then build other
 
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
bills as far as what we do with this
 
00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
information but for us this would be a
 
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
definition of what abuse is so I will um
 
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
leave it to any of the committee members
 
00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 align:start position:0%
if you have a subject you'd like to
 
00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 align:start position:0%
bring up first I know that we have had
 
00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
quite a few um
 
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
questions yes
 
00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 align:start position:0%
representative eimon thank you madam
 
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
chair uh there was a question of the
 
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of this bill uh I
 
00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
checked the Constitution and in my
 
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
opinion there is
 
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
no um data say showing that this is
 
00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and further I went into
 
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
the system and there are a multitude of
 
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
cases one being uh Troxel V Troxel where
 
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court felt
 
00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 align:start position:0%
that uh this particular Bill uh and the
 
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
definitions of which don't seem to fit
 
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
the criteria for being non uh
 
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional either and I just
 
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to set that tone before we move
 
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
on with this important work thank you I
 
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate it there has been a lot of
 
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
question on that and um certainly I
 
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
think that is once again when we have
 
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
extensions of this bill what we do as
 
00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 align:start position:0%
far as um quote unquote punishments or
 
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 align:start position:0%
actions and stuff that is not not a part
 
00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 align:start position:0%
of the definitions of this does anybody
 
00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
else have a concern that they'd like to
 
00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
that are any concerns that you've heard
 
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that we did uh we
 
00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
had some testimony on was actually our
 
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
trauma informed language um when it
 
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
comes to somebody who has a substance
 
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
abuse disorder
 
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 align:start position:0%
and so I did actually look at trauma
 
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
informed language so here's what we what
 
00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 align:start position:0%
we have um and then uh I I have supplied
 
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
this to the office of child advocate um
 
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
so the more trauma informed language and
 
00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 align:start position:0%
then why the changes so we can take a
 
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
look at that that could be a possible
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
amendment I also do want to um bring to
 
00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 align:start position:0%
light that I think a lot of the concerns
 
00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
that we had before were based on how 553
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
came out of OSS which was not the
 
00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:01.639 align:start position:0%
intended way that it came out so we did
 
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
have that
 
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
um uh the amendment yeah which what is
 
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.749 align:start position:0%
um uh the amendment yeah which what is
that

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:18.919 align:start position:0%
is4 114 Zer yeah 114 so anyway and that
 
00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
replaces that language back to what the
 
00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
uh study committee had and that we
 
00:07:25.869 --> 00:07:25.879 align:start position:0%
refined last fall y so if everybody
 
00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:28.039 align:start position:0%
wants to look at the trauma in form
 
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
language does anybody in the audience
 
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
want to see what the trauma and form
 
00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:34.039 align:start position:0%
language is and
 
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
copies and this is just around concerns
 
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
of um mothers who have substance abuse
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%
uh disorder and their child is born does
 
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
this you know flag them to have their
 
00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
children removed immediately it does not
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
it just we understand that children who
 
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
are born uh with substances have
 
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
tendency to have certain complications
 
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
and we want to make sure that that's um
 
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
known that that's not um best practice
 
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.149 align:start position:0%
known that that's not um best practice
for

00:08:06.149 --> 00:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
children everybody agree with
 
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.550 align:start position:0%
children everybody agree with
that

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
okay so does someone want to get an
 
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
amendment to so that language yes would
 
00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
you guys like to vote on that language
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
or or do we have to vote what do we well
 
00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:25.639 align:start position:0%
I I or we just have to do an amendment
 
00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:28.919 align:start position:0%
yeah so I agree that we need to do that
 
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
but I think there may be further changes
 
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
uh to the current Amendment before we
 
00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
um we send to any right uh language to
 
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
OS and I'd like it to be one um I
 
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
personally would like it to be one clean
 
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment so I absolutely agree that
 
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
this should go into the amendment but we
 
00:08:59.630 --> 00:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
not um send anything to OS and until
 
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
we're done I agree and I don't we
 
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
haven't voted on the other amendment
 
00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:05.079 align:start position:0%
that we brought in so we could actually
 
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
redo and have one one seamless Amendment
 
00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
correct okay so we can do that
 
00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.870 align:start position:0%
correct okay so we can do that
okay

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay so well she has uh do
 
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
you want me to wait to continue at all
 
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
right ahead okay so I think one of the
 
00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:24.200 align:start position:0%
larger questions that we had and this
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
was on and I know there's some people
 
00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
here that can testify who are doing
 
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
groundwork on this particular thing is
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
the emotional abuse side of it and
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not somebody could let's say
 
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
get in trouble for grounding their child
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
for you know not having their car or say
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
the child comes out as um as gay or
 
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
something and then that's disagreed upon
 
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
would that be you know grounds for a
 
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
child for being abused would and my
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
understanding has always been that a
 
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
disagreement is a disagreement it's how
 
00:09:58.990 --> 00:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
far you take it that whether or not it
 
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
takes it do we have somebody in the
 
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
audience that has done ground workor
 
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
recently or can talk to us about what
 
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
DCF would if there would be an
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
intervention or what would happen in
 
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:16.750 align:start position:0%
intervention or what would happen in
that

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
case good morning Jen Ross deputy
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
director DCF thank
 
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
you can you ask your question again
 
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
representative Greg yes so one of the
 
00:10:28.509 --> 00:10:28.519 align:start position:0%
concerns that we had is basically on the
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse side and what that
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
entails like whether or not a parent
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
disagreeing with the child's gender or a
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
parent disagreeing about whether or not
 
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
a child has certain friends or how that
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
impacts how that would fall into that
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
would that be a concern with the way
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
that the language is now written on 553
 
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
having emotional and psychological abuse
 
00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:51.399 align:start position:0%
or what if that was called in let's say
 
00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
what what you would look at for that um
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
it would not make any changes to what we
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
would currently do um when we think
 
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
about psychological abuse and when we
 
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
are looking at the information that's
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
being reported whether to screen in or
 
00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
screen out we're looking at um a couple
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
of different things one is the nature of
 
00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
the um the allegation we're looking at
 
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
um is it something that is likely to
 
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
cause or the child is likely to suffer
 
00:11:19.629 --> 00:11:19.639 align:start position:0%
serious psychological emotional harm as
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
a result of the parents behaviors their
 
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
actions are inactions um and we're
 
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:27.519 align:start position:0%
looking at um things such as pers
 
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
persistent and severe uh like ridiculing
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh terrorizing bullying isolating we're
 
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
looking at um ongoing
 
00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
oh yeah certainly
 
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
y so this is right from our um our own
 
00:11:44.629 --> 00:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
policy so psychological abuse is defined
 
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
as reports where a child suffers or is
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
likely to suffer
 
00:11:51.629 --> 00:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
psychological emotional harm as a result
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
of Parental
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
behaviors it considers both the
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
caregiver's actions and
 
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:06.269 --> 00:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
child so actions that are reasonably
 
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
expected to produce significant adverse
 
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
impact on a child's emotional well-being
 
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:13.720 align:start position:0%
could be examples like persistent and
 
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
severe ridiculing terrorizing bullying
 
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:22.839 align:start position:0%
child it could be threatening specific
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
physical harm to themselves a family
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
member or the pets persistent
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
non-specific threats of self harm
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh or care caregiver overdose in front
 
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
of the child so those are sort of what
 
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
we're thinking of when we're looking at
 
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
psychological emotional abuse
 
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
yes I see that you're reading that uh
 
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
policy um is it possible for that to be
 
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
forwarded to us in some way yep yeah I I
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
can't I'm sorry and and this is so
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
crucial I don't want to miss anything
 
00:13:01.389 --> 00:13:01.399 align:start position:0%
yes it truly is crucial I believe to the
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
bill yes thank you and then we're
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
looking at what is the impact to the
 
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
child um does the child have ongoing um
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
indicators of emotional disturbance or
 
00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse which would be bed
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
weding um anger issues psychological
 
00:13:20.829 --> 00:13:20.839 align:start position:0%
emotional concerns um depression anxiety
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
severe withdrawal um extrem or
 
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
persistence Behavior or running away or
 
00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:27.399 align:start position:0%
self harming and so really it's the
 
00:13:29.189 --> 00:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
twofold it's what is the action or
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
action of the caregiver and then what is
 
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
the result of that action or in action
 
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
to the child um and so certainly I think
 
00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
when you're being asked about whether or
 
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
not taking away car keys or uh grounding
 
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
um a child or taking away their cell
 
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
phone is what we would consider to be
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
that prudent parenting you're doing it
 
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:50.680 align:start position:0%
for a reason of concern uh either
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
they're contacting you know someone that
 
00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:54.759 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be contacting to
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
representative Greg's um example uh or
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
you're trying to prevent them from
 
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:01.160 align:start position:0%
harming themselves or harming others
 
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
That's The Prudent parenting that we one
 
00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
would expect a parent would do to take
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
concern thank you thank you for taking
 
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
my question there has been uh there have
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
have been statements bantered about that
 
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
people are afraid to um be on board with
 
00:14:23.749 --> 00:14:23.759 align:start position:0%
this bill because they're afraid that
 
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
parents will say go clean your room and
 
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
don't come out of your room till it's
 
00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
cleaned up that that would be considered
 
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:34.360 align:start position:0%
parental abuse can you speak a little
 
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
bit about that thank
 
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
you yeah exactly so if we were to
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
receive a call on that it would not be
 
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
something that would be screened in
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
because again it's prudent parenting a
 
00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:45.079 align:start position:0%
parent exercising their right to ask
 
00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
their child to go clean their room and
 
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
don't come out until it's clean again
 
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
what we would be looking for is some
 
00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
more of those extreme um actions of a
 
00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
parent where they're perhaps locking
 
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
their child in their room for days until
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
the room is cleaned or something like
 
00:14:59.710 --> 00:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
that so a simple request by parent for a
 
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
child to go do something is not in of
 
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:07.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you for being here thanks for
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I know that one of
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
the concerns that people are having are
 
00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
um what if a parent denies gender
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
affirming care to their child because
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
they don't believe that that
 
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
is necessary believes they're too young
 
00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.509 align:start position:0%
is necessary believes they're too young
believes

00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
believes
 
00:15:31.949 --> 00:15:31.959 align:start position:0%
anything um how are we going to protect
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
those parents because this is going to
 
00:15:37.949 --> 00:15:37.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
passed so if a parent is again acting
 
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
within their right as a parent and it's
 
00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
prudent parenting that is a I think for
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
me it's a little bit more of a difficult
 
00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
um what if um to say that there'd be one
 
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
thing or another I think we would have
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
to look at the whole picture of that um
 
00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
so what is the outcome of that for the
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
young person um and are they you know
 
00:16:03.309 --> 00:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
what is the conversation that the parent
 
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
is having with the young person around
 
00:16:07.629 --> 00:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
the gender affirming care or their they
 
00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
their disagreement with that action for
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
their youth um we would want to know um
 
00:16:15.629 --> 00:16:15.639 align:start position:0%
how is that impacting the youth um and
 
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
or the child themselves it's it's a hard
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
question to answer either way um I think
 
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things what we would be
 
00:16:23.949 --> 00:16:23.959 align:start position:0%
looking at again is that's a parent's
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
right to exercise um that particular
 
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:29.240 align:start position:0%
right for themselves and their youth um
 
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:31.240 align:start position:0%
but I get the bigger picture like is it
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
causing the youth severe um emotional
 
00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:37.639 align:start position:0%
discomfort yeah I don't know Susan if
 
00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:40.959 align:start position:0%
you want to help me with the legal so
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
in in that so if you got a call that
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
would not be screened
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
out well so we got a call and it was
 
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
simply that um they were not allowing
 
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
their their child to do that no it would
 
00:16:56.509 --> 00:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
probably be screened out um I don't know
 
00:16:58.509 --> 00:16:58.519 align:start position:0%
if probably is a strong enough I don't
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
know that's a strong enough word I I I
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
have I I'm concerned yeah so again it we
 
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:07.720 align:start position:0%
we would be looking at if a child had
 
00:17:09.549 --> 00:17:09.559 align:start position:0%
diabetes and needed Medical Care and the
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
parent was um withholding that Medical
 
00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:13.559 align:start position:0%
Care from their child that would and and
 
00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:17.319 align:start position:0%
that's a life um altering you know a a
 
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:19.720 align:start position:0%
life-threatening um disability we that
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
would be a report in of neglect from the
 
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
parent um for in their inability to
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
provide their child the correct or
 
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
needed Medical Care um affirming um care
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
is not an in my opinion is not a
 
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
necessary medical care for the child
 
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
that they would need so a parent would
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
have the right to not um con consent to
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
that care for their
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
child and it wouldn't be screened in
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
under neglect so what we're looking for
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
is what is the outcome to the child so
 
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't necessarily be neglect for
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
the child because it's not a medical
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
necess a necessary medical care for them
 
00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
is it more how it's so this is not in
 
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
itself denying the gender care would not
 
00:18:07.549 --> 00:18:07.559 align:start position:0%
be an issue it's how the parent handles
 
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
it after that so it's one thing to tell
 
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
your kid no I disagree it's another
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
thing to start getting you know verbally
 
00:18:15.549 --> 00:18:15.559 align:start position:0%
emotionally maybe physically abusive
 
00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:18.200 align:start position:0%
about how you how you have that
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
conversation and that's why it might
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
lead to something besides screening it
 
00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
out is that kind of what you're saying
 
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
yes yeah yes so it is it it depends on
 
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
how the parent then goes about handling
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
it and it depends on what's happening
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
for the Youth um and so if because the
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
parent and youth have a disagreement
 
00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
with you know what's to happen the youth
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
wants the gender affirming care the
 
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
parent doesn't want it the youth then
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
becomes angry upset suicidal and needs
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
additional mental health care as a
 
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
result of that we would expect the
 
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
parent to meet the needs of that
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
additional mental health care and if
 
00:18:49.149 --> 00:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
they're not doing that then that could
 
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
potentially be neglect um or like you
 
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
said representative Greg the other side
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
is how is the parent handling um that
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
request of their youth if they disagree
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
with that um and so then do they start
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
calling them names or are they um you
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
know prohibiting them from let's say
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
they want to wear certain clothes and it
 
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
becomes a greater issue where the parent
 
00:19:11.909 --> 00:19:11.919 align:start position:0%
is now
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
persistently um you know negatively
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
communicating with their child about
 
00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:19.039 align:start position:0%
their wishes or their wants and it
 
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
becomes then a a bigger
 
00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.310 align:start position:0%
becomes then a a bigger
issue

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:19:28.149 --> 00:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative CG thank
 
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um do you
 
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
have um an imp policy for screeners to
 
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
have the same um uh approach to this um
 
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
topic that you
 
00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
do we do yes we do have policy for
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
screening um all of our screeners look
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
at the policy to determine what is the
 
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
information they're receiving uh what
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
where does it fall within our policy
 
00:19:56.909 --> 00:19:56.919 align:start position:0%
pertaining to neglect or abuse um and
 
00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
then they start to weed out the
 
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
specifics um and then they look at you
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
know this then this then this so there
 
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
is some consistent decision making is it
 
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
in there specifically around uh gender
 
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
affirming care no we don't have anything
 
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
that can I follow up oh yeah would you
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
be able to do
 
00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
that I'm uncertain if we would want to
 
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
start breaking out different types of
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
needs that families have you know we
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
keep it broad for a reason and so if we
 
00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:34.039 align:start position:0%
were to add gender affirming care would
 
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
we then have to add uh something else or
 
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
in addition to gender affirming care
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
that could become a challenge for
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
through I I know that's an important
 
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
topic for for a lot of people and I do
 
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
understand and once again I I think when
 
00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
we're looking at definitions of
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
emotional it's not just disagreeing with
 
00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:08.559 align:start position:0%
the child it's really like where you
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
take that that's what emotional and
 
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
psycholog I think that's really the kind
 
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
of Crux of the entire thing that it's
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
not about saying gosh I mean we're
 
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
talking about gender affirming care even
 
00:21:22.269 --> 00:21:22.279 align:start position:0%
though yes that's very impactful we talk
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
also talk about piercing ears or you
 
00:21:27.549 --> 00:21:27.559 align:start position:0%
know other things that kids religion y
 
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
you know so I see I see the how hard
 
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
that would be to start separating things
 
00:21:35.269 --> 00:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
out to specify for each each individual
 
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:37.480 align:start position:0%
thing certainly religion is a big topic
 
00:21:39.789 --> 00:21:39.799 align:start position:0%
one that I even had with my own children
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
um where we differ and that's part of
 
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
them becoming you know who we who we um
 
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:47.240 align:start position:0%
are raising so thank you for that does
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any questions for her
 
00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.470 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any questions for her
on

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
that um okay did you have okay did you
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
have something legally that you wanted
 
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
okay come on up I see her yes I
 
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
know good morning thank you for having
 
00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
me Susan larby General Council for DCF
 
00:22:12.269 --> 00:22:12.279 align:start position:0%
again I just want to reiterate that over
 
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
the last decades the legislature all of
 
00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
us have been doing a lot of work based
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
on what we've learned about being trauma
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
informed and back in 2021 I think I
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned as a previous hearing back in
 
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
2021 uh the legislature added house bill
 
00:22:30.269 --> 00:22:30.279 align:start position:0%
1573 to the statute which finally
 
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
defined psychological M
 
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:35.480 align:start position:0%
treatment and as deputy director Ross
 
00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:37.559 align:start position:0%
just pointed to our policy that policy
 
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
and procedure was written in response to
 
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
finally defining psychological Mal
 
00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
treatment which we all Society know that
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
that is the most common form of abuse
 
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
and neglect in our country probably the
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
world if you look at statistics and so
 
00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
back in 2021 they uh the legislature you
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
all added psychologic melt treatment
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
finallys the definitions that
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
psychological melt treatment means
 
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
pervasive and emotionally abusive
 
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
Behavior which shall include but not be
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
limited to patterns of threatening
 
00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:14.440 align:start position:0%
berating or demeaning behavior and
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative Greg as you mentioned
 
00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:18.799 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily the the reason why
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
they are berating the child or
 
00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:23.919 align:start position:0%
belittling the child it's the it's the
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
belittling and the and
 
00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:29.720 align:start position:0%
the berading and the patterns of
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
threatening behavior that's the neglect
 
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
of a
 
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
child I hope that makes sense and again
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
the context of it all so there is really
 
00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
no change to the definitions of neglect
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
right the definition of neglect that you
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
have a parent who is or child sorry a
 
00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
neglected child who is without the
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
proper parental care or control Ed
 
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
education is required by law or other
 
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
care control and there is that serious
 
00:23:59.630 --> 00:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
risk of impairment that harm and we're
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
just fine-tuning what is that harm
 
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:03.640 align:start position:0%
that's really hard to Define it's really
 
00:24:06.669 --> 00:24:06.679 align:start position:0%
it's very nebulous um and what has been
 
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
done over the course of many many months
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
and now years is relooking at these
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
definitions as they are so the average
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
person when they're reading the statue
 
00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
understand what it means because serious
 
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
impairment risk of serious impairment
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's a mouthful um it then points you
 
00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:27.640 align:start position:0%
to another section of the statute saying
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
okay let's define serious impairment
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
serious impairment means a substantial
 
00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:33.640 align:start position:0%
weakening or diminishment of a child's
 
00:24:35.789 --> 00:24:35.799 align:start position:0%
emotional physical or mental health or
 
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
of a child's safety and well-being again
 
00:24:40.029 --> 00:24:40.039 align:start position:0%
that's already in the statute it's just
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
very hard to understand so again what
 
00:24:44.389 --> 00:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
was what's being done here and
 
00:24:45.789 --> 00:24:45.799 align:start position:0%
throughout many efforts and a
 
00:24:48.669 --> 00:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort is to make it more
 
00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
user friendly that the average reader is
 
00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
going to read this statue and understand
 
00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
what's expected of our community when it
 
00:24:59.070 --> 00:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
comes to reporting AB suspicous of abuse
 
00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.029 align:start position:0%
comes to reporting AB suspicous of abuse
and

00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.039 align:start position:0%
and

the answer but go
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
ahead good morning Jen Ross deputy
 
00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
director um so to your question of the
 
00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:27.799 align:start position:0%
qualifications of a cpsw um we they're
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
Broad uh we can take anyone with uh an
 
00:28:33.509 --> 00:28:33.519 align:start position:0%
education in human services social work
 
00:28:36.909 --> 00:28:36.919 align:start position:0%
uh psychology education we look for um a
 
00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:39.519 align:start position:0%
background in working with children
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
youth and families um to bring that work
 
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
into ours um but we certainly will you
 
00:28:47.149 --> 00:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
know we will work with anyone who has
 
00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:49.799 align:start position:0%
that education component uh even if they
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
lack an extensive history uh they then
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
go through uh what we call a Core
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
Academy which is a 12we um educational
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
component for our staff um that really
 
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
goes over our policies procedural work
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
with families engaging families um and
 
00:29:08.509 --> 00:29:08.519 align:start position:0%
understanding sort of what it is to be a
 
00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
cpsw and what does that role look like
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
there's a component of going through the
 
00:29:16.029 --> 00:29:16.039 align:start position:0%
law and the statute with them um there's
 
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
a component of uh going through
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
investigations and casework with
 
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
families and how to engage them so we
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
really focus on the engagement with
 
00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
families to understand what is the
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
challenges that brought your family to
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
our attention and then how can we work
 
00:29:32.909 --> 00:29:32.919 align:start position:0%
together so there isn't a specific Focus
 
00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
if you will on psychological or
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
emotional well-being um it's really
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
looking at the family as the whole scope
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
we do have staff attorneys that we then
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
work with to determine what is the
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
information that I've collected these
 
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
are the concerns and what fits the scope
 
00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
of the law or doesn't fit the scope of
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
the law and supervision you know and so
 
00:29:53.909 --> 00:29:53.919 align:start position:0%
it's it's really a team approach to the
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
information that we're Gathering and
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
then what does that mean in terms of how
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
we might be become involved or not
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
become involved or what is the family
 
00:30:02.669 --> 00:30:02.679 align:start position:0%
need in addition to that for referrals
 
00:30:02.679 --> 00:30:04.710 align:start position:0%
need in addition to that for referrals
or

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
resources I don't know that answers your
 
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
question so um I guess
 
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.389 align:start position:0%
question so um I guess
my

00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
uh what how do I want to phrase
 
00:30:22.669 --> 00:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
this um so you if if it is a case of um
 
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:25.720 align:start position:0%
psychological abuse you have the ability
 
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
to um offer resources to these families
 
00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
especially for say a psychiatrist or a
 
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
counselor or things like that correct
 
00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:40.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
yep I don't know if any of who would be
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
the right person to answer this question
 
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
but in looking at um representative
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
markel's uh suggestions and stuff this
 
00:30:55.509 --> 00:30:55.519 align:start position:0%
looks more like to me the process that
 
00:30:58.629 --> 00:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
would be litigated after DC has initial
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
findings where these the bill we're
 
00:31:02.909 --> 00:31:02.919 align:start position:0%
talking about is actually just
 
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
definitions so I'm actually concerned
 
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:07.240 align:start position:0%
that he's taking it that bit farther
 
00:31:10.029 --> 00:31:10.039 align:start position:0%
this is not about definitions what I see
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
wrong structuring a policy procedures
 
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
turn your mic on it's it's not
 
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
structuring policies or procedures it's
 
00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
strictly definitions as a guideline MH
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
so I I too don't feel that this is this
 
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
stuff is necessary to change anything in
 
00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:41.519 align:start position:0%
here yeah I think he makes points for
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
after the fact but not about this
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
particular yes let sasio you think she's
 
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.629 align:start position:0%
particular yes let sasio you think she's
got

00:31:47.629 --> 00:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
got
 
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
input oh I was goingon to say to your
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
point ex exactly representative Greg
 
00:31:54.669 --> 00:31:54.679 align:start position:0%
that this is information that we would
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
do um post filing or even before filing
 
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
if we were working with a family on an a
 
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
voluntary basis is really um allowing
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
for these assessments to occur to help
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
us have a better understanding of what
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
are the needs of the child the youth or
 
00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
the family and then what are the
 
00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate referrals for them so
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
exactly this would be our case work
 
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:17.320 align:start position:0%
after filing or when we open a case to
 
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
um work with a
 
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
family hi Lista massio associate child
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
advocate um and I we're sharing all one
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
copy here but um I just want wanted to
 
00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:32.799 align:start position:0%
reiterate too that um the basis of this
 
00:32:35.629 --> 00:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
bill it did come before the legislature
 
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
last session in tandem with s SP
 
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
4177 which was written very specifically
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
around placement preferences and this
 
00:32:48.909 --> 00:32:48.919 align:start position:0%
bill the the sort of purpose section and
 
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
4177 really focuses on the fact that
 
00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
preserving the unity of the family is
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
the primary purpose maintain maining the
 
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
family Unity so this is not meant to
 
00:33:05.789 --> 00:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
take children away from parents which
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
417 says very clearly that's already
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
been signed into law in this purpose
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
section very clearly again there's even
 
00:33:13.629 --> 00:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
a change in language here that says
 
00:33:15.549 --> 00:33:15.559 align:start position:0%
instead of determining the best interest
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
of the child it is determined already
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
that the best interest is to remain with
 
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
family um so again I think you all keep
 
00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:26.440 align:start position:0%
hitting on on the the point here that
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
these are the definitions
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
that allow the agency to get involved to
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
provide services to help that family
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
maintain their integrity um one of the
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
precursors too was that there were times
 
00:33:43.389 --> 00:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
though where the agency was trying to
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
get involved had filed a petition even
 
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
for an inhome case which means the
 
00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:49.559 align:start position:0%
family children not get removed and the
 
00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
courts were interpreting neglect
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
interpreting serious impairment in a way
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
that was leading to results that babies
 
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
with nine broken bones were getting sent
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
right back to caregivers without any
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
services or safety plans in place so it
 
00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:08.919 align:start position:0%
was sort of that Gap that was trying to
 
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
be filled and continues trying to be
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
filled that the goal is not to take a
 
00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
bunch of children away from parents who
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
want to make them clean their rooms it
 
00:34:20.829 --> 00:34:20.839 align:start position:0%
really was filling these specific gaps
 
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
um that the agency was seeing so I just
 
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to kind of Jen's doing a great
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
job I just want to bring that up
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
again thank you um I I just want to let
 
00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
you know that at the last DCF meeting uh
 
00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:37.599 align:start position:0%
of which I'm on the
 
00:34:40.589 --> 00:34:40.599 align:start position:0%
board this is exactly what I was talking
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
about is the where is and I ask the
 
00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:46.919 align:start position:0%
question where is the gap uh what does
 
00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:49.720 align:start position:0%
the legislature need to do to fill that
 
00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
Gap so that the job can be done well and
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
and and I think that's what you're just
 
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
pointing out to us and I appreciate that
 
00:34:59.230 --> 00:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
and that's why we worked so closely this
 
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
fall we had eight sessions most of them
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
two hours long in front of Senator
 
00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
Carson Senator Whitley representative
 
00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
mcmah was there as well and
 
00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
representative Robert harb talking
 
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
through every word in here every
 
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment what the purpose was what the
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
outcome would be and really thoughtfully
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
collaborating um of you know what would
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
be the impact of changing this word that
 
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
word and and as attorney larby said some
 
00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:28.839 align:start position:0%
of these changes were made and policies
 
00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
have been put into place but the court
 
00:35:32.349 --> 00:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
is still not quite reading it the same
 
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
way particularly I think the addition of
 
00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
the definition of trauma informed was
 
00:35:38.589 --> 00:35:38.599 align:start position:0%
super helpful and that was at the
 
00:35:40.109 --> 00:35:40.119 align:start position:0%
request of Senator Carson and
 
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon we all say that
 
00:35:44.829 --> 00:35:44.839 align:start position:0%
all the time like we know what it means
 
00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
but again I think attorney lby is
 
00:35:50.589 --> 00:35:50.599 align:start position:0%
correct that a lot of the nuances here
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
are not a change but make it a lot more
 
00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
transparent for parents to know what
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
neglect so I think
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
to talk a little bit about um
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative maral's email I think
 
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
what he's trying to do
 
00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
is understand what the bill and the
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
amendment say and then try to educate us
 
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
on what would happen if it goes to
 
00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
court not that
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
not that we need to change everything in
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
the bill but he's I think that's where
 
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
his brain's going so I agree with you
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
that this is going to be the aftermath
 
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
yeah well this yeah and I I think that I
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate that he's of of that mind and
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
that we have him on our committee now to
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
kind of help us work through that stuff
 
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
but what that comes you don't have that
 
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
kind of you know when we go through the
 
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
steps of legislation as far as I
 
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
understand I'm still fairly
 
00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
but is that when we have the definitions
 
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
this is not this is literally the root
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
of this of protecting kids and what he's
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
talking about is something that builds
 
00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
on after so maybe there's something in
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
legislation that comes from this but
 
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
this at least defines it and that's my
 
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
understanding so I think he's got a
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
valid point but I just don't think it
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
belongs in here then all of a sudden
 
00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
it's not just definitions right and I I
 
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
think too for just from what I've
 
00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
skimmed it would be several steps like
 
00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
attorney larby said when the law changed
 
00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:31.640 align:start position:0%
in 2021 legislature did a definition it
 
00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
was two sentences long the division then
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
works on creating new policies new
 
00:37:39.309 --> 00:37:39.319 align:start position:0%
standard operating procedures that then
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
goes into their core training it goes
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
into attorney training so I think you're
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
right that this definitions is the first
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
step and then you need to let it play
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
out a bit let the division do their work
 
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
the OCA does have oversight we work with
 
00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
them very closely on developing policies
 
00:37:58.829 --> 00:37:58.839 align:start position:0%
um and you'd have to let it play out
 
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:01.240 align:start position:0%
again and see like the policies and
 
00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
trainings that happened
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
right if I may so I so what
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
I'm getting from this is this is just
 
00:38:16.109 --> 00:38:16.119 align:start position:0%
providing clar Clarity and transparency
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
especially for parents too right there's
 
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
nothing in here that says we're taking
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
your children this is just providing
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
transparency and Clarity of the
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
definitions that are B really already
 
00:38:30.589 --> 00:38:30.599 align:start position:0%
being put to
 
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:35.240 align:start position:0%
work um and so I I don't other than the
 
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
the changes that with the
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
trauma um language trauma informed
 
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
language I don't
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
see any problems with this bill I think
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
it was it was worked on intensely I
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
think that you know anything that was
 
00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
not appropriate to be put in here I
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
trust was not I know senator
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
Carson and so that's that's where I am
 
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
with this I I think that this is with as
 
00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.950 align:start position:0%
with this I I think that this is with as
amended

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
opinion thank you and thank you for
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
question should this bill become law do
 
00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
you foresee any
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
significant increases in the amount of
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
cases that will uh happen or this is
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
going this is not going to increase and
 
00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
it's just defining and and Def better
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
practice thank you thank you for the
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
question I I don't see it as increasing
 
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
cases for the division um like um OCA
 
00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:56.359 align:start position:0%
masio suggested is that it's just some
 
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
additional Clarity for um the division
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh and I think additional Clarity for
 
00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
the courts I think it will help us
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
protect um a certain population of
 
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
children um who I think we have
 
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
struggled to protect those being the
 
00:40:12.829 --> 00:40:12.839 align:start position:0%
youngest with those injuries that have
 
00:40:14.349 --> 00:40:14.359 align:start position:0%
um been a challenge we've worked
 
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
together with the OCA to have
 
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
discussions about those which I think
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
was some of the precipitous to prompt
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
this this legislation um I it it does
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
allow us to to work with families in the
 
00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:30.079 align:start position:0%
way we already are um and so I don't
 
00:40:32.349 --> 00:40:32.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily see it as a way for us to
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
become further court involved with
 
00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.309 align:start position:0%
become further court involved with
families

00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you that's what I thought too I
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
wanted it on the record because I think
 
00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
that there are people who are very
 
00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
concerned about that so I just wanted to
 
00:40:46.109 --> 00:40:46.119 align:start position:0%
to have that and and we worked very hard
 
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
to um bring this forward in a way that
 
00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't an expansion so much as a
 
00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
clarification I believe uh the division
 
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
has said throughout that there was no
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal notice as well um we did actually
 
00:41:02.349 --> 00:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
take out a section during that fall
 
00:41:05.069 --> 00:41:05.079 align:start position:0%
working Section on institutional child
 
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
abuse um because the implementation of
 
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
it would have been challenging it may
 
00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
have created more cases it it was a
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
little bit unclear so we were very
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
mindful about that through that whole
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
working process in the
 
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
fall do you know how many states have
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
language similar to this with the
 
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
emotional in there I do not know the
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
number of states but I can tell you when
 
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
the OCA was working on this language
 
00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:36.200 align:start position:0%
originally which was in the fall of
 
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
20123 um we had done sort of a survey of
 
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
a number of other states on a a number
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
of different sections um looking at
 
00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
Colorado Connecticut
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
um New Jersey maybe there was like five
 
00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
or six that we were looking at to try
 
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
and really hone in on on the right
 
00:41:59.309 --> 00:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
terminology um and most of those I think
 
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
all of those ones were using emotional
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
they had sort of a different combination
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
so we sort of landed on the combination
 
00:42:08.589 --> 00:42:08.599 align:start position:0%
that made the most sense um but
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
certainly it was ours was much narrower
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
than many others at this point because
 
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
ours was drafted 45 years ago and had
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
not had sort of a a large expansion of
 
00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:20.910 align:start position:0%
not had sort of a a large expansion of
of

00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
terminology and we hear about this more
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
and more and I think just for the record
 
00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand why is it
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
important to include emotional when
 
00:42:35.069 --> 00:42:35.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:37.549 --> 00:42:37.559 align:start position:0%
definitions it's important because
 
00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse um tends it's it's not
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
when we investigate or have uh an
 
00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:44.200 align:start position:0%
involvement with a family it's sometimes
 
00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
not just one type of abuse or neglect
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
that we see um that we know emotional
 
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
abuse uh happens far more frequently and
 
00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:55.640 align:start position:0%
can be just as traumatic for a child to
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
experience um and the old legislation um
 
00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
was prohibitive of our ability to be
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
able to recognize emotional and
 
00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:05.839 align:start position:0%
psychological abuse of children um we
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
had to
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
have Specialists to come in and testify
 
00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
to the fact that that was happening uh
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
this does allow us an ability to um be
 
00:43:17.309 --> 00:43:17.319 align:start position:0%
more involved with families when they're
 
00:43:19.069 --> 00:43:19.079 align:start position:0%
struggling with um you know meeting
 
00:43:20.829 --> 00:43:20.839 align:start position:0%
their needs of their kids in a healthy
 
00:43:23.829 --> 00:43:23.839 align:start position:0%
way um that's not you know emotionally
 
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
or physically or or um damaging to their
 
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
well-being so I think it's important to
 
00:43:32.349 --> 00:43:32.359 align:start position:0%
have the psychological Mal treatment
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
component we know it's it's pretty
 
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
kids is there anyone way that you can
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
find out that for us how many states
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
other states involve the emotional and
 
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
psychological abuse in their definitions
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
I actually have that um at home so I
 
00:44:08.109 --> 00:44:08.119 align:start position:0%
can't tell
 
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
you you okay with jodies I'm okay
 
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
um don't we want to um check out um
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson's research and
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
look at what we have here as a
 
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
definition for the emotional abuse um
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
versus in other states versus what
 
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
happens in other states um tried and
 
00:44:52.829 --> 00:44:52.839 align:start position:0%
true methods or whatever I I just think
 
00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
it really emotional abuse is so
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
difficult to Define um I I read um and
 
00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
I'm I'll bet people out here have heard
 
00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
about the books I've read David pelzer's
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
books um I I don't know if you've ever
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
read them it's
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
a powerful powerful powerful if
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
you uh if you want a good
 
00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:21.880 align:start position:0%
cry but he his first book was a child
 
00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.190 align:start position:0%
cry but he his first book was a child
called

00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
called
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
it um
 
00:45:29.309 --> 00:45:29.319 align:start position:0%
they are absolutely
 
00:45:29.319 --> 00:45:32.829 align:start position:0%
they are absolutely
horrifying

00:45:32.829 --> 00:45:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:36.069 --> 00:45:36.079 align:start position:0%
um and I don't mind telling you that uh
 
00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:37.960 align:start position:0%
I am a
 
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
survivor um I had one brother called a
 
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
bundle of love and myself my younger
 
00:45:47.309 --> 00:45:47.319 align:start position:0%
brother and my sister were called
 
00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:52.280 align:start position:0%
Meatheads I get it I get how somebody
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
would say because of uh there were there
 
00:45:59.790 --> 00:45:59.800 align:start position:0%
was a series on TV about um a very nasty
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
man and he called his son-in-law
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
Meathead and people thought it was funny
 
00:46:03.839 --> 00:46:05.190 align:start position:0%
Meathead and people thought it was funny
it's

00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
not it's just not so I I think it's
 
00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:11.800 align:start position:0%
important for us to get that component
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
right uh it's very difficult for a child
 
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
to come forward and
 
00:46:23.549 --> 00:46:23.559 align:start position:0%
say how it hurts their hearts and and
 
00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
I've said this a million times uh on my
 
00:46:29.069 --> 00:46:29.079 align:start position:0%
refrigerator I always posted when I was
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
raising my kids Sticks and Stones can
 
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
break your bones but words can break
 
00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
your heart we can put casts on broken
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
bones and not to minimize that and I'm
 
00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
not minimizing the the physical abuse at
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
all we can put Band-Aids we can put
 
00:46:48.549 --> 00:46:48.559 align:start position:0%
stitches we can heal bones but we we
 
00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
forget about healing the heart and I
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
think that's one of the most important
 
00:46:57.069 --> 00:46:57.079 align:start position:0%
components of this bill is
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
how do we help parents understand what
 
00:47:02.349 --> 00:47:02.359 align:start position:0%
words do to
 
00:47:05.069 --> 00:47:05.079 align:start position:0%
children I appreciate you sharing that
 
00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:06.839 align:start position:0%
representative deimon I actually have a
 
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
resource that I meant to send to you
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
this morning and I forgot I'll will send
 
00:47:11.549 --> 00:47:11.559 align:start position:0%
it to you as soon as I get back to my
 
00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:13.720 align:start position:0%
office I actually attended a really
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
wonderful training um for the new
 
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:17.800 align:start position:0%
children's attorneys you all passed SB
 
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:21.880 align:start position:0%
463 last year um about Aces the adverse
 
00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
childhood experiences so that study
 
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
originally B dates back all the way to
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
the early 90s it not controversial in
 
00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
any way well accepted science there were
 
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
definitions of emotional abuse and
 
00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
emotional neglect in that original study
 
00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
so I have a slide deck to share with you
 
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:41.079 align:start position:0%
all um that I think really does lay that
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
Foundation it's not new it is very old
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
um it just hasn't correct so um but I
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
think it would be really helpful because
 
00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
it really splits out sort of those
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
adverse childhood experiences and the
 
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
different typ types of abuse and neglect
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
which includes very specifically
 
00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:02.680 align:start position:0%
emotional gives some examples so I I
 
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
think it'd be helpful for you all and
 
00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
also just in talking to your colleagues
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
um so I will share that and I apologize
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
I it was on my list of things to do this
 
00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
morning it's a Monday yes it sure is now
 
00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
that we are going to have one more um
 
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting I think after this
 
00:48:20.829 --> 00:48:20.839 align:start position:0%
in a couple week actually it's G to end
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
up in a few weeks because we have that
 
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
week off so um anyway we will have
 
00:48:26.829 --> 00:48:26.839 align:start position:0%
another one so we can talk more about
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
that does anybody else have concerns for
 
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
today that they'd like to flush out go
 
00:48:34.589 --> 00:48:34.599 align:start position:0%
ahead just some feedback that I've heard
 
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:37.640 align:start position:0%
is that people are concerned about um
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
specifically what the definition is of
 
00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
that and they're really stuck on the if
 
00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:44.559 align:start position:0%
I send my kid to the their room are they
 
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
going to call um dcyf so um that is one
 
00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:50.079 align:start position:0%
thing that I wanted to bring up here
 
00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
today yeah and I think that's going to
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
be important for us to have those
 
00:48:56.829 --> 00:48:56.839 align:start position:0%
conversations because I there is a sense
 
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
and you get that any anytime we talk
 
00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:01.240 align:start position:0%
about the definitions of child abuse and
 
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
we we start talking about the neglect
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
people get worried because of what
 
00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:07.720 align:start position:0%
happens after that um we did have in all
 
00:49:11.069 --> 00:49:11.079 align:start position:0%
um uh openness we had you know a couple
 
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
different groups wanting exceptions like
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
except and we heard that the other day
 
00:49:17.069 --> 00:49:17.079 align:start position:0%
you know that this is ex abuse except
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
for when but ultimately this is about
 
00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
the definitions of child abuse period
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
what happens after that is very very
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
different this gives no more right for
 
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
people to take their kids away as a
 
00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
matter of fact this actually has
 
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
language in here that strengthens as as
 
00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:37.400 align:start position:0%
um um I want to call you just Lisa as
 
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
Lissa masio from yeah the uh the OCA has
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
said but we do know and it is in law in
 
00:49:46.349 --> 00:49:46.359 align:start position:0%
Statute in this state that we think the
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
family is the best place so that's
 
00:49:50.309 --> 00:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
really the security blanket on this for
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
families this is about defining it so
 
00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
that we can get definitions so people
 
00:49:57.069 --> 00:49:57.079 align:start position:0%
that maybe have patterns set up from
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
their own how they were raised or
 
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:00.839 align:start position:0%
whatever we can you know they can step
 
00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
in and say so that's not that's not the
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
best practice anymore we understand that
 
00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:07.640 align:start position:0%
this is not great and that's my
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
understanding is that for you guys
 
00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:11.910 align:start position:0%
understanding is that for you guys
correct

00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
okay so I just want to um be reassured
 
00:50:18.789 --> 00:50:18.799 align:start position:0%
you're going to send us the the the list
 
00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
that's going to be very helpful I will
 
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:28.829 --> 00:50:28.839 align:start position:0%
did you have something that you wanted
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
okay well congratulations early thank
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
you and I I hope it the last one I had
 
00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
was eight days late and so I'm like
 
00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:53.240 align:start position:0%
really pray that we don't go that long
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
so um thank you very much my name is
 
00:50:56.789 --> 00:50:56.799 align:start position:0%
Michelle Merritt I'm the president at
 
00:50:59.309 --> 00:50:59.319 align:start position:0%
new futures um my colleague Emma savini
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
testified during the hearing and I did
 
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
want to bring up an issue um that new
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
Futures had been working on it's
 
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
actually a legacy issue that was sort of
 
00:51:09.069 --> 00:51:09.079 align:start position:0%
brought back up um in the context of
 
00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
reviewing this bill in 2016 um when we
 
00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
were in the height of the opiate
 
00:51:15.789 --> 00:51:15.799 align:start position:0%
epidemic there was a bill very similar
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
to this that was put forward that um had
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
some unintended consequences when it
 
00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
came to uh parental substance misuse and
 
00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
including it in the definition of
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
neglect um we did a lot of work on this
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
and ultimately settled in the area of
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
creating a rebuttable presumption of
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
harm um that still exists within the
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
statute so by way of refresher and um I
 
00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
know that Dartmouth as well as many
 
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
OBGYNs and others had concerns around
 
00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
this provision as well I've taken a look
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
at what I think is the amended language
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
and I we still have concerns about this
 
00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:50.150 align:start position:0%
and I we still have concerns about this
um

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
so essentially what it boils down to is
 
00:51:56.349 --> 00:51:56.359 align:start position:0%
we never want to create a situation in
 
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
which we are deterring individuals with
 
00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:02.200 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder from obtaining
 
00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:03.270 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder from obtaining
prenatal

00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
prenatal
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
care um how we are reading this language
 
00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:09.160 align:start position:0%
because it's included in the definition
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
is that it would subject objn as well as
 
00:52:15.309 --> 00:52:15.319 align:start position:0%
social workers and others to report
 
00:52:17.069 --> 00:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
women who have children at home who are
 
00:52:20.589 --> 00:52:20.599 align:start position:0%
also pregnant for abuse and
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
neglect the unintended consequence of
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
that is that they may not receive the
 
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
care that they want out of fear that
 
00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
their children are going to be taken
 
00:52:33.309 --> 00:52:33.319 align:start position:0%
away it is our opinion that there is
 
00:52:35.069 --> 00:52:35.079 align:start position:0%
nothing within the rebuttable
 
00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
presumption of harm that we're trying to
 
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
figure out exactly what it is that is
 
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
trying to be addressed here by including
 
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
these additional definitions and the
 
00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
neglect yes so if I may M chair so it
 
00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
specifically States when the child is
 
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
born M okay so I don't think that that
 
00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
affects the children at home
 
00:53:00.069 --> 00:53:00.079 align:start position:0%
but I do think that a parent that is
 
00:53:02.789 --> 00:53:02.799 align:start position:0%
having issues with substance misuse
 
00:53:04.829 --> 00:53:04.839 align:start position:0%
there is always a danger to that child
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
like I said in that in the committee
 
00:53:10.109 --> 00:53:10.119 align:start position:0%
that anytime there are drugs around you
 
00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:11.960 align:start position:0%
run the risk of a child
 
00:53:15.549 --> 00:53:15.559 align:start position:0%
dying I don't I and I you know I I mean
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
I just listened to a podcast of that
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
very same thing where the state was
 
00:53:23.549 --> 00:53:23.559 align:start position:0%
called on this family several times and
 
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:25.240 align:start position:0%
that child was never removed and that
 
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
child's dead because it got into its
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
parents' drugs so I I don't think it's
 
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:31.720 align:start position:0%
fair I I don't think this is going to
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
stop anyone from going to prenatal I I
 
00:53:36.789 --> 00:53:36.799 align:start position:0%
just don't see that happening this is
 
00:53:39.309 --> 00:53:39.319 align:start position:0%
when the child is born
 
00:53:42.109 --> 00:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
and I I think it's more important that
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
we protect all those
 
00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:47.720 align:start position:0%
children yep so hi for the record uh um
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
senior director of government relations
 
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:51.640 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth health so I am I am reading
 
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
this with both my OBS in mind and our
 
00:53:56.589 --> 00:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
general counsel and our general counsel
 
00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
has to have um reviews policies and
 
00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
procedures that our OB departments have
 
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
to use and so I'm I have their lens in
 
00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
mind I'm an attorney as well and when I
 
00:54:10.109 --> 00:54:10.119 align:start position:0%
look at this um I am
 
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:13.240 align:start position:0%
seeing uh qu yes one's born right that
 
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:15.640 align:start position:0%
that would trigger the referral itself
 
00:54:17.549 --> 00:54:17.559 align:start position:0%
but when I am looking if you look
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
further down and I'm on page I don't
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
think I'm on the amendment but I'm on
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
page five lines
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
31 and um when it's it specifically says
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
unless uh the exposure is due to having
 
00:54:33.309 --> 00:54:33.319 align:start position:0%
been prescribed so what if a what if a
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
mom comes to us and her third trimester
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
and she be Suboxone or borine but what
 
00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
happens um for a mom who comes and she
 
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
and it's just the third trimester but
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
for the first two trimesters she was
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
using illicit
 
00:54:50.589 --> 00:54:50.599 align:start position:0%
substances if I'm if I'm an when they're
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
born this has nothing to do during their
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
trimester right but if I'm an OB
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
provider our general counsel was going
 
00:54:59.349 --> 00:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
to have to say in that one circumstance
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
even though the child was born and mom
 
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
was prescribed those medications in the
 
00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:04.549 align:start position:0%
was prescribed those medications in the
third

00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
third
 
00:55:07.069 --> 00:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
trimester that was not protected in the
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
first trimester or the second trimester
 
00:55:12.549 --> 00:55:12.559 align:start position:0%
so this would trigger a a referral and
 
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
that's where that's where this provision
 
00:55:16.589 --> 00:55:16.599 align:start position:0%
is very gray and really subject to
 
00:55:19.109 --> 00:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
interpretation in our my conservative
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
General Council my with conservative Len
 
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
is is going to say this a referral needs
 
00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:26.680 align:start position:0%
to go forward but it states right in the
 
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
language that they are monitored by a
 
00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:31.640 align:start position:0%
licensed healthc care provider when on
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
this and that's what would it would be
 
00:55:36.029 --> 00:55:36.039 align:start position:0%
if they even if it came to the third
 
00:55:38.549 --> 00:55:38.559 align:start position:0%
trimester they would be monitored by a
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
health care Prof professional who is
 
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
giving them the Suboxone in that one
 
00:55:46.029 --> 00:55:46.039 align:start position:0%
scenario though they weren't monitored
 
00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:48.200 align:start position:0%
for the first two trimester but the
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
child wasn't born it's once they AR the
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
child is born right and as long as
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
they're in that third trimester and
 
00:55:57.390 --> 00:55:57.400 align:start position:0%
they're having that I I'm never going to
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
change from this language and and I love
 
00:56:04.349 --> 00:56:04.359 align:start position:0%
you guys you know that but um I I'm just
 
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
not because I think CH children deserve
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
the right to be protected also so I
 
00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
think if the legislative intent is to
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's a a smaller
 
00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
window I I I'm know Michelle would be
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
happy to work on that I would be happy
 
00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
to work on that I hear the intent but I
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
as I'm reading the language there's some
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
gray area and I'm just concerned that I
 
00:56:28.589 --> 00:56:28.599 align:start position:0%
do think that there I do know that there
 
00:56:30.829 --> 00:56:30.839 align:start position:0%
will be women who are afraid to receive
 
00:56:33.029 --> 00:56:33.039 align:start position:0%
prenatal care that they need so I'm
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
going to respectfully disagree with you
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
because I think the language is quite
 
00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
clear go ahead thank you thank you madam
 
00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
um so two may ask two question course um
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
would you be able to email us some
 
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
suggested um we we could work on that um
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
to try to tighten it up and make it more
 
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
narrowly tailored I'm I'm with
 
00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:00.200 align:start position:0%
representative rice um because um I
 
00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:02.680 align:start position:0%
think that we need to protect innocent
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
children but I also wanted to bring up a
 
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
point that it's also an opportunity when
 
00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
the child is born for the mother to get
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
support that she might not have had
 
00:57:18.829 --> 00:57:18.839 align:start position:0%
before and so that is this provides that
 
00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
and you know um the
 
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
goal our goal is to keep families intact
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
so providing support to the mother so
 
00:57:31.390 --> 00:57:31.400 align:start position:0%
she can keep that baby instead of you
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
know God knows what so the baby lives
 
00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:36.200 align:start position:0%
yeah you're singing our song you're
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
singing our song We're not in
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
disagreement with any of this it's truly
 
00:57:43.549 --> 00:57:43.559 align:start position:0%
a matter of how this is phrased and the
 
00:57:46.349 --> 00:57:46.359 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences that will come
 
00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:48.440 align:start position:0%
up of women not receiving prenatal care
 
00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:50.799 align:start position:0%
for really high-risk pregnancies when
 
00:57:52.829 --> 00:57:52.839 align:start position:0%
they we want to encourage them to go and
 
00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:55.480 align:start position:0%
receive care um we also have Federal
 
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
requirements so any baby bornn in the
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire right now that is
 
00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
exposed to substances has to have a safe
 
00:58:03.789 --> 00:58:03.799 align:start position:0%
plan of care as it is right now those
 
00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
resources are being coordinated the
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
hospital is responsible for making sure
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
that that occurs um and there also are
 
00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:13.480 align:start position:0%
ways in which if a provider has concern
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
it's sort of it's substance use plus is
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
the standard if if there is evidence of
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
substance use plus any concern at all
 
00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
that a child is at risk for not having
 
00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate supervision that there may
 
00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:26.799 align:start position:0%
be drugs that are in the home home that
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
are not being put away they are not
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
having stable housing there are things
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
in place right now that allow for DCF to
 
00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
get involved the question that we have
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
is how really why is this section
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
necessary above and beyond what already
 
00:58:46.349 --> 00:58:46.359 align:start position:0%
exists in statute that provides that
 
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
level of assurance um given the work
 
00:58:52.829 --> 00:58:52.839 align:start position:0%
that was done in 2016 and again in 2021
 
00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:55.240 align:start position:0%
where we address this issue fairly
 
00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:56.950 align:start position:0%
where we address this issue fairly
comprehensively

00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
comprehensively
 
00:58:59.430 --> 00:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
um I do have the legislative history
 
00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:01.640 align:start position:0%
because we worked on that um we actually
 
00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
worked on it with you representative
 
00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
rice um Senator long and you
 
00:59:09.150 --> 00:59:09.160 align:start position:0%
representative deimon at the time so it
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
has this is something that we have
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
talked about about the negative
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
consequences that are possible for
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
babies being born in tents and moms not
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
receiving prenatal care and that is a
 
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
new Futures and Dartmouth are in
 
00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
agreement that is something that we want
 
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
to avoid and we do have concern with how
 
00:59:27.069 --> 00:59:27.079 align:start position:0%
the language is framed here that that
 
00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
may be an unintended consequence if we
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
don't tighten it up well I would be
 
00:59:34.349 --> 00:59:34.359 align:start position:0%
really interested to hear what your um
 
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
and we'll be meeting again that first
 
00:59:39.069 --> 00:59:39.079 align:start position:0%
Monday in March what the but before then
 
00:59:40.829 --> 00:59:40.839 align:start position:0%
if you could send us I will not be here
 
00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
hope yes you will not be here but um but
 
00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:46.359 align:start position:0%
we worked with Dr Roy if I am I'm gonna
 
00:59:48.670 --> 00:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
be bringing in a week old baby with me
 
00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
Dr Roy ex I know yeah Dr Roy extensively
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
from Dartmouth worked on this you know
 
00:59:55.789 --> 00:59:55.799 align:start position:0%
in this language because this really is
 
00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
the definitions of what child abuse and
 
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
neglect looks like and once again we
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
don't want to make exceptions when we're
 
01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
just defining this now what happens
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
after what happens with communication
 
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
with mothers and stuff is very very
 
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
import important now we did have some
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
trauma informed language that we kind of
 
01:00:15.549 --> 01:00:15.559 align:start position:0%
switch that up to that we have um and we
 
01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
have no issue with any other part or
 
01:00:20.829 --> 01:00:20.839 align:start position:0%
section of what is trying to be
 
01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
accomplished here well in this and in
 
01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
this state we want to be um we we can't
 
01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
leave this out we do have you know
 
01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
issues in this state that this is going
 
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
to be really important as far as how
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
this goes right now um I actually think
 
01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
because we have this about monitoring
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
you know unless it's monitored by a
 
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
licensed healthcare provider which by
 
01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
the way in statutes after talking to a
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
federal judge would include if they if
 
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
they weren't there the first couple
 
01:00:50.549 --> 01:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
months but then came in you know at the
 
01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
last part of their pregnancy because in
 
01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
that point we can't Define and by the
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
way the original I think Bill that came
 
01:00:58.829 --> 01:00:58.839 align:start position:0%
out said in utero and we would never put
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
that in there because that's not the
 
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
definition that's not the children that
 
01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
we're defining at that point um but
 
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
certainly that's more about the mother
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
until they're born so as long as even if
 
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
they've come in like within two weeks
 
01:01:14.109 --> 01:01:14.119 align:start position:0%
before they give birth they still at
 
01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:16.280 align:start position:0%
that point are now under care if
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
anything I would think looking at this
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
um in in talking to women who have been
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
in high atrisk situations knowing that
 
01:01:26.589 --> 01:01:26.599 align:start position:0%
if they have a Prov provider that's
 
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
caring for them that helps to protect
 
01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
them I think this language actually
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
would be more of a seat belt for them
 
01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
wanting to get healthc care provider um
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
input or at least talking to them
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
because at that point then they're under
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
that care yeah you just need to have you
 
01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
have to understand that healthc care
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
providers have work for a healthcare
 
01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
institution that that have a general
 
01:01:52.029 --> 01:01:52.039 align:start position:0%
counsel that's going to read this
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
language with a strict with a really
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
strict legal lens and this does happen
 
01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
and even with the rebuttable presumption
 
01:01:59.950 --> 01:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
language that we've done extensive
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
amount of work on there are still
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
concerns and I am I'm not asking to walk
 
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
back the rebuttable presumption language
 
01:02:08.109 --> 01:02:08.119 align:start position:0%
but I'm just saying that even today with
 
01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
that rebuttable presumption language our
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
providers are being placed between their
 
01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:14.440 align:start position:0%
patients whom they want to care for and
 
01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
do it really holistically and
 
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
appropriately and general counsel who
 
01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
are attorneys that um have to look at
 
01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
the language of the law only the
 
01:02:25.349 --> 01:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
language of the law um I also just want
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
to knowe Dr Roy did not work with our
 
01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:29.960 align:start position:0%
office to on this language so the
 
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
legislative history that that we have in
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
in government relations is not something
 
01:02:37.269 --> 01:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
that Dr Roy knows about I don't know Dr
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
Roy it's my understanding that she
 
01:02:40.349 --> 01:02:40.359 align:start position:0%
actually works at Elliott which is a
 
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
partner program in our child and safety
 
01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
protection program so would love to meet
 
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
her but I um that was not done through
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
our office and um there were other folks
 
01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
within Dartmouth that were part of the
 
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
group that articulated concern including
 
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
their Pediatric
 
01:03:00.029 --> 01:03:00.039 align:start position:0%
department so um yeah it is something
 
01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
that we remain concerned about great and
 
01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
we would love so I know that when you
 
01:03:06.029 --> 01:03:06.039 align:start position:0%
came to the hearing before we asked for
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
new language that would be helpful so we
 
01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:11.240 align:start position:0%
would really because we would like um
 
01:03:13.109 --> 01:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
obviously we have some high concerns too
 
01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
so if you could get that language to us
 
01:03:15.789 --> 01:03:15.799 align:start position:0%
in the next two weeks that would be
 
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
fantastic let's work on that maybe
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
there's a way to contemplate the safe
 
01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
plan of care and thread the needle in
 
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
this bill I don't know we can look we
 
01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
can look at it yeah and it would be
 
01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
helpful to understand from our
 
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
perspective where the rebuttable
 
01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
presumption of harm language that's in
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
there that covers some of these
 
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
situations is falling short um because
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
it's something that we're not really
 
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
making that connection of why it's
 
01:03:40.269 --> 01:03:40.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary that it's repeated
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
twice in here and where there's failures
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
and folks falling through the gaps um
 
01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
because we would certainly want to
 
01:03:48.829 --> 01:03:48.839 align:start position:0%
tighten that up but we just we work with
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
the recovery Community all the time we
 
01:03:51.549 --> 01:03:51.559 align:start position:0%
don't have an understanding or an
 
01:03:52.990 --> 01:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
appreciation for where that it actually
 
01:03:55.269 --> 01:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
is occurring what is the actual problem
 
01:03:57.069 --> 01:03:57.079 align:start position:0%
that we're trying solve by adding this
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
language in here and where the
 
01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:01.090 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption is falling
 
01:04:01.090 --> 01:04:02.910 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption is falling

[Music]
 
01:04:05.269 --> 01:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
short hi thank you and thank you for
 
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question and maybe this is
 
01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
something that we might have um need
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
help with um in researching but do you
 
01:04:15.549 --> 01:04:15.559 align:start position:0%
um have any um anything that you can
 
01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
email to us or um maybe you know this
 
01:04:24.549 --> 01:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
that would um let us know the percentage
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
of women with with substance use
 
01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
disorders who are using while pregnant
 
01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
who seek uh prenatal care period and is
 
01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
there any data that shows a correlation
 
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
in states where they have added this
 
01:04:44.109 --> 01:04:44.119 align:start position:0%
into their child abuse language in law
 
01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
um a decrease in the amount of prenatal
 
01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
care for women in that population do you
 
01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
know of anything yeah I'd have to look
 
01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:51.640 align:start position:0%
back some of it might be a little bit
 
01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
stale but I do recall when we were
 
01:04:55.870 --> 01:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
working on this in 2016 that the data in
 
01:04:58.069 --> 01:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
that area was fairly compelling that
 
01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
there was a deterrent in women receiving
 
01:05:03.549 --> 01:05:03.559 align:start position:0%
pratal care because they were scared um
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
yeah but after legislation is what
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
you're talking about in States that had
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
similar Provisions that what their
 
01:05:13.589 --> 01:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
impact was and again to Courtney's Point
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
um it it has been the case and we've
 
01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:17.480 align:start position:0%
been navigating this for a while there's
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
a presumption to theability issues of
 
01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
like obviously when in doubt report and
 
01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
in some cases even when it's not
 
01:05:29.309 --> 01:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
necessary um and that also has been a
 
01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
factor that we have been actively trying
 
01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
to work with the recovery community and
 
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
providers and others to try to say you
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
don't have to report every single
 
01:05:38.349 --> 01:05:38.359 align:start position:0%
instant where Mom comes in pregnant and
 
01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
has an active substance use disorder um
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
but it's still occurs and I have concern
 
01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
that the language as drafted is just
 
01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
going to make that situation worse but I
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
think I do have some information and
 
01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
data back from when we originally worked
 
01:05:56.029 --> 01:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
on this in 2016 that I can pull for you
 
01:05:58.750 --> 01:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
thank you we did hear testimony that day
 
01:06:01.269 --> 01:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
that there is already uh worry and
 
01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
concern amongst people who are using so
 
01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
what how does that change then like if
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
they're already concerned I'm yeah
 
01:06:12.029 --> 01:06:12.039 align:start position:0%
that's my point no yeah it's a it's a
 
01:06:14.109 --> 01:06:14.119 align:start position:0%
valid point there is some concern
 
01:06:16.349 --> 01:06:16.359 align:start position:0%
providers are actively being educated
 
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
like I know Dartmouth has done a lot of
 
01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
work internally to try to sway people um
 
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
of their practices hospitals have
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
internal practices that they have been
 
01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
actively working with the Department to
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
try to receive education so that they're
 
01:06:30.269 --> 01:06:30.279 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing but this is an
 
01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
added layer of confusion that when we're
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
trying to do that already right now it's
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
not going to make the situation any
 
01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
better okay nobody else has questions we
 
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time and I'd love to see
 
01:06:43.470 --> 01:06:43.480 align:start position:0%
that language I was looking for it after
 
01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
our last after you were here last time
 
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:52.029 --> 01:06:52.039 align:start position:0%
you um
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
we you guys have time for Lista masota
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay okay are you okay
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
on okay I just real quick wanted to
 
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
clarify the the background of this um
 
01:07:07.069 --> 01:07:07.079 align:start position:0%
because again this bill has been out
 
01:07:09.789 --> 01:07:09.799 align:start position:0%
there since the fall of
 
01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
2023 um with this substance exposed
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
newborn language in there Dr Roy was at
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
the Elliott at that time she is a
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
pediatric abuse specialist not not
 
01:07:20.269 --> 01:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
maternal Health but we did talk to her
 
01:07:21.789 --> 01:07:21.799 align:start position:0%
about it she is actually at Dartmouth
 
01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:23.799 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock now though she's been
 
01:07:26.269 --> 01:07:26.279 align:start position:0%
installed for month and a half or so as
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
the new cap examiner there but um
 
01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
regardless I think when this language
 
01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
was drafted and we did not pull in the
 
01:07:38.069 --> 01:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
maternal Health folks which we certainly
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
should have and would love to see
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
additional language it was with a lot of
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
research as to best practice around this
 
01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
issue a lot of states have addressed
 
01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
this issue in statute and was adopting
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
this best practice of substance exposure
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
plus which was just mentioned that's
 
01:08:01.069 --> 01:08:01.079 align:start position:0%
what this language is it's the exposure
 
01:08:03.789 --> 01:08:03.799 align:start position:0%
at Birth with a carve out for
 
01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate Medical Care Plus additional
 
01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
indicators of harm just as you were
 
01:08:11.269 --> 01:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
saying representative rice because the
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
concern is not just the exposure we do
 
01:08:18.669 --> 01:08:18.679 align:start position:0%
not want every mother whose infant has
 
01:08:20.749 --> 01:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
an exposure at Birth could even just be
 
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
the marijuana we don't want those calls
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this language was to
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
permit women who have are under
 
01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
treatment for Methadone or whatever but
 
01:08:33.789 --> 01:08:33.799 align:start position:0%
to also require something more and it is
 
01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:35.799 align:start position:0%
our understanding and again if there's
 
01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
different language out there we'd love
 
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
to see it um it shouldn't just be
 
01:08:42.749 --> 01:08:42.759 align:start position:0%
exposure it's exposure plus but it is
 
01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
that plus that is scary because we have
 
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
also seen infant deaths fentanyl
 
01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
exposure deaths safe sleep deaths which
 
01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
increase exponentially when there's
 
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
substance use in the home and that is
 
01:08:56.829 --> 01:08:56.839 align:start position:0%
what we are trying to void um the
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption language I think
 
01:09:02.749 --> 01:09:02.759 align:start position:0%
is different it does not directly
 
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
address substance exposed newborns in
 
01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
the same way that this language does so
 
01:09:10.510 --> 01:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
that's why we we weren't looking at them
 
01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
as duplicative or or conflicting in any
 
01:09:17.229 --> 01:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
way um we they're separate so I just
 
01:09:18.669 --> 01:09:18.679 align:start position:0%
want to give you guys the background
 
01:09:20.269 --> 01:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
certainly if there's other language out
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
there but we were really trying to put
 
01:09:22.159 --> 01:09:23.709 align:start position:0%
there but we were really trying to put
in

01:09:23.709 --> 01:09:23.719 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
clearly this best practi standard of
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
exposure plus which was not in our
 
01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:36.950 align:start position:0%
exposure plus which was not in our
statute

01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
before I think that uh concludes our
 
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting for today and it
 
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
certainly gave us a Full Slate of what
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
to talk about this next time so we do
 
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
look forward to having that language
 
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
obviously not from you and good luck
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
with your delivery um but uh we would
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
like to have that as soon as possible
