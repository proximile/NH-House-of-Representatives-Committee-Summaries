recognize representative Bale for a
 
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chair I I make a
 
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%

second second by representative rung you

wish to speak on the on the
 
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.710 align:start position:0%
wish to speak on the on the
motion

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
representative yes thank you um so the
 
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
motion of itl comes forth um as
 
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:31.240 align:start position:0%
we look at the
 
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.790 align:start position:0%
we look at the
um

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
desalination plant we just felt that
 
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
this is not something that we want to
 
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:40.919 align:start position:0%
support at this time because it t it's
 
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
time consuming and it may impact
 
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.190 align:start position:0%
time consuming and it may impact
the

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
commission that's already in force that
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
we learned about that started in 2019 so
 
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
this is really the basis of the motion
 
00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.069 align:start position:0%
this is really the basis of the motion
thank

00:08:58.069 --> 00:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:06.069 --> 00:09:06.079 align:start position:0%
second yes thank you Mr chair um I agree
 
00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:09.399 align:start position:0%
with my colleague um Senator Vale I mean
 
00:09:10.829 --> 00:09:10.839 align:start position:0%
Senator you getting promotion
 
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
representative Vil you know we have a SE
 
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
Coast commission that's already looking
 
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
into this I think we need to allow them
 
00:09:20.069 --> 00:09:20.079 align:start position:0%
to do their work um and then instead of
 
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:22.240 align:start position:0%
having two groups studying this let's
 
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
let the commission come through with
 
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
is there anyone who wishes to else wish
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
motion uh I will I will speak I will be
 
00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:45.320 align:start position:0%
voting in favor of the bill I think uh
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh it's a reasonable request and I think
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
that uh it would be it would be of value
 
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
but it uh other than
 
00:09:58.910 --> 00:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
that so is there anyone else who will
 
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:02.920 align:start position:0%

345

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
345
 
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative the Q for a motion
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I move ought to
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.629 align:start position:0%
 
345

00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
345
 
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
second I second that would you like to
 
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
speak on your motion yes I I think it's
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
a good bill um every other state charges
 
00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839 align:start position:0%
more for out ofate visitors our Park
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
system is self-sustaining and this
 
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:12.200 align:start position:0%
represents an opportunity actually to
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
give our own citizens a break uh and
 
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
achieve some parity with other state
 
00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
park systems I think Vermont is the only
 
00:12:22.189 --> 00:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
system that has that parity yet they do
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
charge an increased fee for overnight
 
00:12:27.189 --> 00:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
camping for out ofers I think uh so not
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
only is this an opportunity for us to
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
achieve parody
 
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
potentially achieve additional revenue
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
and I think it's a a good bill a good
 
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to help out our own
 
00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:38.839 align:start position:0%
citizens on the park fees and we do it
 
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
for a lot of other categories we have
 
00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
reduced fees and uh the least we can do
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
for our own citizens
 
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
thanks just to speak to your second uh I
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
believe uh representative MCU or Senator
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
mugh um Senator M uh encapsulated it
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
much wish to speak against or for or
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
against you you recognizing thank you um
 
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to vote for the OTP um
 
00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
particularly because I've had the
 
00:13:21.069 --> 00:13:21.079 align:start position:0%
experience um recently with another a
 
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
department agency that we don't work
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
with here but the challenge of
 
00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
um having fees in statute
 
00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:33.519 align:start position:0%
and that it really um can sometimes
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
constrain the department from adjusting
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
with inflation adjusting over the years
 
00:13:42.189 --> 00:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
um not adjusting frequently enough to
 
00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
keep up with costs um so I I I'd rather
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
we as much as possible um move away from
 
00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
specifying um fees in
 
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
statute thank
 
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:01.240 align:start position:0%
you oh we got to go around first of all
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh for the first time representative L
 
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
montin and
 
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
was thank you Mr chair um yes I'm going
 
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
to vote against um OTP also um it seems
 
00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
that the department is opposed to this
 
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
bill um because they're already in the
 
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
midst of a multi-year process of
 
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
assessing their fees and calibrating
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
their fees and I feel like we're
 
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
stepping in the middle of that um what
 
00:14:30.749 --> 00:14:30.759 align:start position:0%
the man dat and I believe that we should
 
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
let them continue their work and not try
 
00:14:37.389 --> 00:14:37.399 align:start position:0%
to interfere in their own process of
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
calibrating their
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
fees um and and by the data that they
 
00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839 align:start position:0%
presented it doesn't look that that
 
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
there are many days that um that are
 
00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
sold out I think New Hampshire residents
 
00:14:53.949 --> 00:14:53.959 align:start position:0%
um are still able to to get for the most
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
part a reservation when they want to
 
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative ale and
 
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
oh representative
 
00:15:13.949 --> 00:15:13.959 align:start position:0%
B thank you um in in line with what my
 
00:15:16.189 --> 00:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
colleagues have shared um thank you so
 
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:19.160 align:start position:0%
much for mentioning those points I just
 
00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to also mention that um
 
00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
Representatives Rulo harb and myself are
 
00:15:27.749 --> 00:15:27.759 align:start position:0%
on the state park system
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
advisory and we have been working
 
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
to understand and
 
00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
to help advise in terms of the state
 
00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
park fees things are seem to be going
 
00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
very well and this is something that we
 
00:15:45.629 --> 00:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
can look at further up the road once we
 
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
have things established
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
um with the changes that we're making
 
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
right now but we can promise the
 
00:15:53.949 --> 00:15:53.959 align:start position:0%
committee this is a continuing
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
conversation and it also involves the
 
00:15:58.269 --> 00:15:58.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee and that process has
 
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
you representative Derby and then oh
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
actually you you haven't spoken for the
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
first time either so representative rung
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
then representative M thank you Mr chair
 
00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
um although I as a New Hampshire
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
resident I would love to have a 50%
 
00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
discount on state Park admission but I
 
00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill is very fiscally
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
irresponsible um aside from the point
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
points that it's already been looked at
 
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
but we you know the letter from the
 
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
division says that it would bind their
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
ability uh currently in statute to
 
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
adjust their fees according to markting
 
00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
conditions because state parks are an
 
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
Enterprise System they're supposed to be
 
00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
self-funding and just making this cut as
 
00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
an advantage to New Hampshire residents
 
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
could actually be crippling our ability
 
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
to fund the state parks we also heard
 
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759 align:start position:0%
compelling evidence from the C Co
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
Science Center um about the economic
 
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
impact to them that it would be a result
 
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
in devastating impact to the SEO Science
 
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
Center visitation and admission Revenue
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
so I think um even though it's a great
 
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
idea I think it needs more economic
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
analysis to understand um how it can be
 
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
implemented and still ensure
 
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:17.480 align:start position:0%
sustainability of not only the state
 
00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
park system but also businesses and
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
Enterprises that um are impacted by that
 
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.230 align:start position:0%
Enterprises that um are impacted by that
thank

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair in addition to um the
 
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:35.240 align:start position:0%
the Department's uh opposition or
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
concern um about the impact on tourism
 
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
um that we heard and and how they spend
 
00:17:45.549 --> 00:17:45.559 align:start position:0%
millions in uh yearly trying to um
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
trying to advertise New Hampshire um to
 
00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
out ofate residents and how this really
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
sends a mixed message I and in addition
 
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
to the you know the CCO Science Center
 
00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:57.640 align:start position:0%
that said they would lose uh they may
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
have to cut two staff um if this passes
 
00:18:03.789 --> 00:18:03.799 align:start position:0%
we also heard from the uh New Hampshire
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
travel Council who was also concerned
 
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
about the impact on the uh the potential
 
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:13.720 align:start position:0%
impact to uh tourism revenue and um and
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
we know that tourism is a major source
 
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
of revenue for the state so for those
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
reasons um I would urge the uh this uh
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
committee to oppose the OTP motion thank
 
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.789 align:start position:0%
committee to oppose the OTP motion thank
you

00:18:29.789 --> 00:18:29.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
representative M mchu for for a second
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
time thank you Mr chairman I I agree
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly with my colleague
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative Simpson that we should
 
00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:40.039 align:start position:0%
not put
 
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
fees in the statute which is why this
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't do that it actually
 
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
indicates a
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
percentage and I'll further remind the
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
committee that we have a very fiscally
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
responsible approach to our Park fees
 
00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.590 align:start position:0%
responsible approach to our Park fees
designed

00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
designed
 
00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:01.799 align:start position:0%
to be the lowest and the most
 
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
competitive in the entire region at $4 a
 
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
day that's it and even if we double
 
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
those for out of states to $8 or reduce
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
them to
 
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
$2 I'm sure we can all agree that not a
 
00:19:22.029 --> 00:19:22.039 align:start position:0%
single visitor is going to decide to
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
drive all the way to Maine or across our
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
state to Vermont to save two bucks when
 
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
it would cost some $10 in gas so this in
 
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
fact is a really very fiscally
 
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:38.440 align:start position:0%
responsible way to save money for our
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
residents and keep that money in our
 
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
state it's a great idea and it's exactly
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
what the legislature should be doing
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
directing our bureaucrats our
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
commissioners and department heads to
 
00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:55.039 align:start position:0%
make more money for the state and keep
 
00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
it in the pockets of our residents so I
 
00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
urge you to support the ought to pass on
 
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
this very fiscally responsible bill that
 
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
protects our citizens and looks out for
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
first represent representative Darby for
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
a second time Then followed by
 
00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
representative rung for a second thank
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair very briefly I had
 
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
forgotten to mention um the the this
 
00:20:24.909 --> 00:20:24.919 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't address the cost to the
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
resources to update the it systems that
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
would allow for verification of um
 
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
residency in reservations and also I
 
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
don't believe that this um this bill
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
addresses the the core concern that was
 
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
raised by the constituent that Senator
 
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
Murphy referenced that said that um the
 
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
constituent couldn't um couldn't get
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
access to the park um because this
 
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
really isn't going to um uh this doesn't
 
00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
provide a preference in terms of
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
reservation time I think there's a
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
better way um by allowing New Hampshire
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
State residents to reserve ahead of time
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
that would actually address this
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.990 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
representative I just want to clarify a
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
comment representative MCU made this
 
00:21:22.029 --> 00:21:22.039 align:start position:0%
isn't going to cut rates for residents
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to double it for out of state
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
residents so what New Hampshire
 
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
residents are paying now they're not
 
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
going to pay less they're just if you're
 
00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
out of state you're going to pay at
 
00:21:34.029 --> 00:21:34.039 align:start position:0%
least 50% more thank
 
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
you repres representative wolf for the
 
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.950 align:start position:0%
you repres representative wolf for the
first

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
time thank you Mr chairman um I am
 
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
because 30 plus years ago we set up a
 
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
system to make the parks
 
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient we shouldn't be putting
 
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
our finger in the till and monkeying
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
with the system and I think that the
 
00:22:01.149 --> 00:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
fees should be done by the fiscal
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
committee by the division and not by the
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
legislature I've seen it happen too many
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
times where A legislature passes a fee
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't get looked at for 10 years
 
00:22:15.269 --> 00:22:15.279 align:start position:0%
and guess what we're 10 years behind or
 
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
maybe at that point only 20 years people
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to vote uh against the OTP
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we can bring forth an
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
fail um I thank you Mr chair I just
 
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:37.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to add that I'm just looking at
 
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
the online submissions on this bill and
 
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:44.039 align:start position:0%
people wait in from across the state in
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
opposition there's 30 opposed zero in
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
support and zero that are neutral many

Donnelly for a
 
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chair I'd like to
 
00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
make a motion to do an interm study on
 
00:25:00.029 --> 00:25:00.039 align:start position:0%
SB 345 I have a second second got
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
it would you wish to speak to your
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
motion yes thank you due to all of the
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
um people that just spoke about the
 
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
specific Bill and um also the amount of
 
00:25:12.269 --> 00:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
people that came forward running our
 
00:25:16.389 --> 00:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
different state parks and is a you know
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
I think there is a lot of opportunity
 
00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
here for improvement and I do agree with
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
um uh representative McHugh that we do
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
need to give our state uh residents an
 
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to maybe do
 
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
a pre um residence there's lots of
 
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
different things that can be done
 
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
especially with New Hampshire parks they
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
had they stated that they have the
 
00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
ability to manage their fees so um going
 
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
back to um representative wolf I agree
 
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
that let them manage their fees and by
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
doing an interm study we can bring that
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
information together and hopefully
 
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
especially um Veil harb and chairman
 
00:25:59.350 --> 00:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
Rulo on the uh the Parks Commission
 
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
that may be an opportunity to integrate
 
00:26:03.149 --> 00:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
more of that information to do it
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
properly and also they talked about the
 
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
state um ski resorts and we don't know
 
00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
the impact of what this would cause to
 
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
the skate the skiing Resorts that are
 
00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
well let's see who's second the
 
00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
har wish to speak on the second thank
 
00:26:28.389 --> 00:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
you yes I I Echo representative donal's
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
comments and add I think this gives us
 
00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
an opportunity with interim study to
 
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
work with the parks uh who have
 
00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:37.720 align:start position:0%
suggested that perhaps this might be a
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
way that we can get them on their own to
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
work so that maybe we can get a
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
resolution and come back and report that
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
to the entire committee so I I think
 
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
it's important it's an important bill uh
 
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
to help our residents but we don't want
 
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:55.720 align:start position:0%
to hurt our tourism so working with the
 
00:26:59.149 --> 00:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
Department uh especially with uh parks
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
and the spa committee that the three of
 
00:27:03.149 --> 00:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
us are on I think um it's the proper way
 
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
to go thank
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
you anyone else wish to speak on the
 
00:27:11.389 --> 00:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
motion of interim
 
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
study chair will say one
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
thing this is a real going to be a real
 
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.430 align:start position:0%
thing this is a real going to be a real
interim

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:18.440 align:start position:0%
interim
 
00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.230 align:start position:0%
interim
study

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.909 align:start position:0%
study
this

00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:27:27.549 --> 00:27:27.559 align:start position:0%
is the the having all of our neighbors
 
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.230 align:start position:0%
 
raised

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
raised
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
is having having fees raised for out
 
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
ofers and we
 
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
don't is a very bad look for our uh for
 
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
our Park
 
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
system I mean we are
 
00:27:51.789 --> 00:27:51.799 align:start position:0%
the we have the park system is the jewel
 
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.509 align:start position:0%
of this
state

00:27:54.509 --> 00:27:54.519 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:27:57.789 --> 00:27:57.799 align:start position:0%
but you got to also realize that the
 
00:27:57.799 --> 00:27:58.950 align:start position:0%
but you got to also realize that the
people

00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
who are funding this mostly are in in in
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
state and if they're if they're going to
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
be be come come
 
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh Canon fodder in other
 
00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
states for get for uh raising fees I
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
think it would be nice to be able to at
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
least say you know maybe give them
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
charge a little bit more for the out
 
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
ofers simply because everybody else is
 
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
doing it and we know I'm I'm tired maybe
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
I'm tired of being a py and when I think
 
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
maybe the other people in the state
 
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
might be also so with
 
00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:49.389 --> 00:28:49.399 align:start position:0%
ahead I I do have a further argument and
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
that's that we are on the state with the
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
state parks advisory Council we are
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
going through these the timing is just
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
not going to be there um and we are
 
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
putting the parks in
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
the you know H having this bill hanging
 
00:29:10.509 --> 00:29:10.519 align:start position:0%
over us is going to also not be a good
 
00:29:12.909 --> 00:29:12.919 align:start position:0%
look and having people come into the
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
parks and saying oh well next time
 
00:29:17.389 --> 00:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to pay more um
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
could be an issue too and I just think
 
00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:21.320 align:start position:0%
we have the vehicle to be talking about
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
this and as we're in the middle of the
 
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
fee structures being changed we want to
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
wait and let those things things plan
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
play out so I'll be voting against
 
00:29:33.509 --> 00:29:33.519 align:start position:0%
interm study because I just think it's
 
00:29:33.519 --> 00:29:34.470 align:start position:0%
interm study because I just think it's
too

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
soon I would be more happy if this was
 
00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:38.919 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the term and we
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
option representative of wrong okay
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I found
 
00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
representative Donnelly's arguments
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
really compelling and I think one of the
 
00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
benefits of interm study is it will send
 
00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
a message to the parks Council about um
 
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:07.919 align:start position:0%
our intent that we we do want to see New
 
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents have an advantage
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
when we're using our own um property so
 
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
I I'm going to support the interim study
 
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
for that thank
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
you anyone
 
00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:23.240 align:start position:0%
else pres M and then
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
representative I'll support the interim
 
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
study as well it seems like Park fees
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
are complicated there was another bill
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
on Park fees that that I happen to
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor that passed and would went
 
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
through another committee uh and uh
 
00:30:37.149 --> 00:30:37.159 align:start position:0%
there's some confusion on this bill
 
00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:38.559 align:start position:0%
apparently representative rung stated
 
00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:40.120 align:start position:0%
that this would not lower fees in fact
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
it would the bill and it doesn't set
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
specific fees it doesn't bind the hands
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
it gives the commissioner flexibility to
 
00:30:48.029 --> 00:30:48.039 align:start position:0%
set the fees it just defines a
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
percentage and it says right in the bill
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
that that res residents get a 50%
 
00:30:57.549 --> 00:30:57.559 align:start position:0%
discount so it doesn't you know it's
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
very very clear that it does reduce fees
 
00:31:02.029 --> 00:31:02.039 align:start position:0%
it just gives the commissioner the
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
department the ability to set those fees
 
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
so it's very clearly a reduction so
 
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:08.120 align:start position:0%
obviously there's there's some confusion
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
so on Park fees sounds like interim
 
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
study is the way to go and I'll support
 
00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:15.320 align:start position:0%
that too thank you representative wolf
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
as we discussed in
 
00:31:21.629 --> 00:31:21.639 align:start position:0%
carcass um I hope that the uh department
 
00:31:24.629 --> 00:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
and looking at it now understands that
 
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
the committee is sending a message that
 
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
the fees have to be looked at and that
 
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:32.120 align:start position:0%
committee that you talked about
 
00:31:34.629 --> 00:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
representative fail
 
00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:37.639 align:start position:0%
should get their act together and move
 
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
this whole fee thing rather quickly
 
00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:43.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully the interim study can just be
 
00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
put to bed because you will have come up
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
with a new schedule and a complete look
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
you seeing no one
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%

Report

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not certain well we can go to
 
00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
necessarily to consent because it is a
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
an early Bill and uh it does have fees
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
in it but we can try why don't we try to
 
00:33:17.549 --> 00:33:17.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
the but yes consent
 
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
but sometimes you know you don't know
 
00:33:31.389 --> 00:33:31.399 align:start position:0%
all right um well in House Bill
 
00:33:34.629 --> 00:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
345 and that that is an early bill so
 
00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:37.559 align:start position:0%
that's got to get out of here
 
00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
pass uh representative U mugh do you
 
00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
have a a motion thank you Mr
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
chairman on this park fee bill I'll move
 
00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:56.200 align:start position:0%
interim study as
 
00:33:59.549 --> 00:33:59.559 align:start position:0%
well is there is there a
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
second I'll second Mr chair second by
 
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
representative harb you wish to speak to
 
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
your motion thank you Mr chairman we
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
heard compelling testimony for the need
 
00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
uh to have some increased access to the
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
state parks um but we did hear that the
 
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
the revenue source for this was
 
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
questioned as far as grants and how long
 
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
and what how exactly the passes would be
 
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
administered would it be for one person
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
or for a bus load how long the pass
 
00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
would be good for um so with all of that
 
00:34:34.109 --> 00:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
and considering that we now have some
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
work to do on park passes with a genuine
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
inter room study my suggestion is that
 
00:34:40.109 --> 00:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
we roll This in with the other inter
 
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
room study and study the two together I
 
00:34:43.149 --> 00:34:43.159 align:start position:0%
mean obviously there'll be their
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
separate bills and separate interim
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
studies but could meet on the same day
 
00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
at the same time with the same
 
00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:50.200 align:start position:0%
stakeholders so it seems like on Park
 
00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:52.919 align:start position:0%
fees interim study is the way to go for
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
this bill and this committee so I urge
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
the committee to support interim study
 
00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
and uh on on the second do you wish to
 
00:35:04.109 --> 00:35:04.119 align:start position:0%
speak very briefly thank you Mr chair uh
 
00:35:06.589 --> 00:35:06.599 align:start position:0%
I agree with my fellow representative
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
with those comments uh I also think that
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
there was some questions that I had
 
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
concerning the length of the pilot the
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
actual how the program would work uh
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
funding um that's why I support we need
 
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
to look at this some more and I support
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
the interim study thank
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
you representative wolf
 
00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
I think my comments have been uh stated
 
00:35:34.109 --> 00:35:34.119 align:start position:0%
by representative harb representative
 
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
together representative R yeah I'm going
 
00:35:46.829 --> 00:35:46.839 align:start position:0%
to oppose the interm study this bill
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't have anything to do with fees
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
this has to do with collecting data on
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
the usage and the benefits of enabling
 
00:35:59.069 --> 00:35:59.079 align:start position:0%
people that our clients of mental health
 
00:36:01.309 --> 00:36:01.319 align:start position:0%
centers in the state there's only 30 of
 
00:36:04.349 --> 00:36:04.359 align:start position:0%
them um to be able to access the parks
 
00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
to confirm to collect data and confirm
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
existing research that um this type of
 
00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
encounter between people suffering
 
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
mental illness and nature actually helps
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
them recover um from their disease and I
 
00:36:21.069 --> 00:36:21.079 align:start position:0%
think that with the
 
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
very um you know our mental health
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
system in New Hampshire has room for
 
00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
improvement and this may be an extreme
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
ex costeffective way for us to support
 
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
those patients um it says right in the
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
bill it's a three-year pilot program so
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
it's not going to extend beyond that it
 
00:36:42.109 --> 00:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
has the support of the state parks it's
 
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
not going to cost them any money extra
 
00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
there it's it's going to work like a
 
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
library pass system like I can go to the
 
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:51.640 align:start position:0%
maraman public library I can get passes
 
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
to a lot of various things um and if and
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
and I'm able to enjoy it and people that
 
00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
can afford to pay for those passes they
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
can check them out of the library that's
 
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
what this is It's a library check
 
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
checkout program for a pass um and I and
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
the park system did say that after the
 
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
three-year pilot they would assess if
 
00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
the program is successful then there
 
00:37:16.349 --> 00:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
would be a charge so this isn't
 
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
something that is a permanent program
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
it's threee start to finish and I think
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
the data that we can collect for it is
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
going to be very very valuable in
 
00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
informing us in our Mental Health
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
Services pres
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
Veil thank you Mr chair I'm going to
 
00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
join my colleague representative rang in
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
my other hat I'm a long-term mental
 
00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
health Advocate who's worked for um
 
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals and in major mental health
 
00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
centers for the past 30 years and I feel
 
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
like this is a really good step in the
 
00:37:54.829 --> 00:37:54.839 align:start position:0%
right direction for um helping us to
 
00:37:56.349 --> 00:37:56.359 align:start position:0%
understand that mental illness is
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
everybody's problem
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
and that The Cure is
 
00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
everybody's obligation and this is a way
 
00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:07.640 align:start position:0%
for us to be able to provide what can be
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
considered part of a person's treatment
 
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
and that is outdoor recreation it is a
 
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
place you know we're talking about
 
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
facilities that where you can really
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
roam free and these things are critical
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
to helping people get across that divide
 
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
that's standing between them and
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
sobriety or them and a long-term mental
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
illness Complicated by chemical
 
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
dependency so I will um be opposing the
 
00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
interim study because I think that this
 
00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
is something that we could have another
 
00:38:43.309 --> 00:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
motion on um the parks does support it
 
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
and they're also saying they can
 
00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
operationalize it so that's my argument
 
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.710 align:start position:0%
operationalize it so that's my argument
thank

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
you else representative M second thank
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman this bill
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
is make no mistake about fees for Park
 
00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
systems I heard from my colleague
 
00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
representative rung that this was about
 
00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.309 align:start position:0%
representative rung that this was about
collecting

00:39:09.309 --> 00:39:09.319 align:start position:0%
collecting
 
00:39:12.309 --> 00:39:12.319 align:start position:0%
data the bill says it's fees for Park
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
systems it in fact in line four directs
 
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the Department of
 
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
Natural and cultural resources to shall
 
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
establish in its fee
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
package a three-year pilot program to I
 
00:39:28.309 --> 00:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
quote provide one or more passes to
 
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
state parks for each participating
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
Center we don't know how many centers we
 
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
don't know where the money's coming from
 
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's an unfunded another unfunded social
 
00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
program from some mystery state and
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
federal grants based on some mystery
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
available funds and donations and I'm
 
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
quoting right out of the bill so this is
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
not a data collection bill this is a
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
state park fee Bill and in fact it goes
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
a several steps further than the last
 
00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
state park bill it mandates free passes
 
00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:01.640 align:start position:0%
from some unknown source of money for
 
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
some unknown number of
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
centers it's we all know that mental
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
health is a huge problem this doesn't
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
solve that problem this forces our
 
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner to give out free passes
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
from some unknown bucket and it's
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
probably a good idea but it needs to be
 
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
studied until we figure out where the
 
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
money's coming from how much it is and
 
00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
the only thing we actually know is that
 
00:40:27.309 --> 00:40:27.319 align:start position:0%
it's three years that's the only
 
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
definitive thing in it so the right
 
00:40:32.109 --> 00:40:32.119 align:start position:0%
thing to do is to study it if we're not
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
willing to give a $2 discount to our
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
citizens but we are willing to give a
 
00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
blank check to an unknown number of
 
00:40:46.109 --> 00:40:46.119 align:start position:0%
people what are we doing right it just
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
makes sense this is born for interim
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
study along with the other fees so come
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
on interim study this bill with the
 
00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:55.240 align:start position:0%
other state park fee bill that's the
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
right thing to do that's a sensible
 
00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
thing to do and I hope I could clarify
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
the actual language in the actual bill
 
00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
it's a state park fee bill with a
 
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:17.829 align:start position:0%
 
commissioner

00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
derbyan thank you Mr chair if I'm
 
00:41:22.109 --> 00:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
smiling it's not because I'm laughing I
 
00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
promise I'm just I thought that was a
 
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
compassionate argument that you made um
 
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
I I do want to point out this bill is
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
actually very well bounded um you
 
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
there's some other points that you made
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
that I don't disagree with but this bill
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
is very well bounded there are 30 um
 
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
Community me mental health C centers
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
targeted 20 recovery centers 10 um
 
00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:45.400 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers and this
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
um and the the program that this is
 
00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:49.720 align:start position:0%
based off of already has sort of an
 
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
established cost so the the B the cost
 
00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:55.480 align:start position:0%
to the for the passes is very well known
 
00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
and it's not arbitrary um
 
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
I I will not be supporting um the
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
interim study because I believe that
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
mental health is very important in the
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
state and this is a a step um towards
 
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
that um so I I hope that we can move
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
towards an utop pass but um I just
 
00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:13.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to reinforce that the costs are
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
this okay representative Harvey
 
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
boo well um at the bottom of the bill it
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
says that due to time constraints there
 
00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:30.200 align:start position:0%
unable to provide a fiscal note um as
 
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
introduced um I just would like to note
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
that I believe that libraries are Town
 
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
libraries pay for their Library passes
 
00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:43.720 align:start position:0%
as a library they have the
 
00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
subscription I believe the I think this
 
00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
is the idea behind the bill is is
 
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
wonderful and I would love to see more
 
00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
people um in mental health programs
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
access our parks and I support the idea
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
possibly through interim study um
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
enabling that in the same way that
 
00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
libraries get subscriptions I just want
 
00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure it's fair across the board
 
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
since we already have our libraries
 
00:43:15.309 --> 00:43:15.319 align:start position:0%
paying for their passes I believe this
 
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
possibly uh expand the program a little
 
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
bit more to include these sort of groups
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
thanks representive ran thank you Mr
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
chair uh my concern is where does it
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
stop um so I I'm totally for mental
 
00:43:34.829 --> 00:43:34.839 align:start position:0%
health and recovery centers I was a
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
mental health worker for 20 years
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
however um the next group could be um
 
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
underfunded um daycares um the next
 
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
group could be um Wounded Warrior I
 
00:43:50.589 --> 00:43:50.599 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know where does this where
 
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
does it end that the next pilot program
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
and the next I I volunteer for a
 
00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
homeless teens program why can't we get
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
passes um as the um fiscal
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility to our Parks I'm not sure
 
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
where the end is that's my biggest
 
00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:11.960 align:start position:0%
concern representative
 
00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
run thank you um not withstanding the
 
00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
the speech of my colleague from miramac
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
um this is very clear it's not this is
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
not a fee they're just offering the
 
00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
current day use one day use past to 30
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers um I
 
00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
think for the cost of this compared to
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
the cost we spend on Mental Health this
 
00:44:40.549 --> 00:44:40.559 align:start position:0%
is actually a very economical way to
 
00:44:42.829 --> 00:44:42.839 align:start position:0%
address the needs of our citizens
 
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
suffering from mental health disease and
 
00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
I'd also like to remind people we had
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
compelling testimony from the state and
 
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
from Nami and if you read if you read
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
their written
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
testimony this bill I'm surprised it's
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
even controversial it should be
 
00:44:59.230 --> 00:44:59.240 align:start position:0%
something that should be easily passed
 
00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
to support these people and learn from
 
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:06.839 align:start position:0%
this pilot whether um day use passes can
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
be continued for these centers at a cost
 
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
which was estimated at $105 per year
 
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.349 align:start position:0%
which was estimated at $105 per year
thank

00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
you anyone
 
00:45:20.829 --> 00:45:20.839 align:start position:0%
else I do want to make a make a comment
 
00:45:27.549 --> 00:45:27.559 align:start position:0%
or two uh we did hear a lot from uh
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
from people as
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
to what would the the
 
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:35.720 align:start position:0%
extent what would the this pass cover
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
would it recover would it cover one
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
person would it recover two people five
 
00:45:44.589 --> 00:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
people and would well what would how
 
00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
would it be uh how would it be
 
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
implemented would somebody have to go
 
00:45:52.549 --> 00:45:52.559 align:start position:0%
with that person would that mean that
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
per the whoever went with that person
 
00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
have to get a pass as well it was also
 
00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
even talked about what about a bus load
 
00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
of people for every so everyone can go
 
00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
there what how would that be covered
 
00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
there were all of those things that had
 
00:46:11.549 --> 00:46:11.559 align:start position:0%
not yet been worked out and
 
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:15.160 align:start position:0%
discussed U and that was my that is one
 
00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:17.839 align:start position:0%
of the big issues to get this thing
 
00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
before a an interim study
 
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
committee and also I mean I just want
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
when I hear that this is a data
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
study if we had a data collection of
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
free ice cream for people and we all
 
00:46:45.309 --> 00:46:45.319 align:start position:0%
found that everybody liked free ice
 
00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
cream except for the one
 
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
person it would would that justify the
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
same kind of behavior this is going out
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
in the park is like free ice cream it's
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
nice it's great I agree I don't think
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
you need a study for that to know that
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
having people in the park is is
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
great issue in with this is how do you
 
00:47:15.309 --> 00:47:15.319 align:start position:0%
pay for it and who should pay for it
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
realizing that the person entering the
 
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
park is
 
00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
subsidizing that issue subsidizing that
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
other person who's coming in at a
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
discount or free and that I think is
 
00:47:33.549 --> 00:47:33.559 align:start position:0%
something that we want we want to
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
discuss you know similar to what
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative Ryan said what about all
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
of the other things so that's what I'm
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
saying I support the
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%

property4 representative representative
 
00:49:50.349 --> 00:49:50.359 align:start position:0%
Veil for a
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
motion I make a motion of itl on Senate
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
Bill 474
 
00:50:02.789 --> 00:50:02.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:11.789 --> 00:50:11.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:16.589 --> 00:50:16.599 align:start position:0%
by you wish to speak on your uh on your
 
00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:22.799 align:start position:0%
M representative there yes um so just
 
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
quickly the um I the itl motion just
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
comes from the fact that um we learned
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
that municipalities often have the
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over the athletic fields
 
00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:37.160 align:start position:0%
and so they can restrict um treasure
 
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
hunting by metal detecting there um and
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
we also heard that in terms of State
 
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
lands um the example that was brought up
 
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
was Plymouth State University and the
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
university grounds although they may be
 
00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:52.150 align:start position:0%
university grounds although they may be
State

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
State
 
00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
Property we again there are already
 
00:50:57.069 --> 00:50:57.079 align:start position:0%
methods in place and people are not
 
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
allowed to treasure hunt on that
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
property so for that reason I think
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
right now um the best motion is a motion
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
legislate pres rung to speak to your
 
00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
second I
 
00:51:21.309 --> 00:51:21.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
is is there anyone else who wishes to
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
see not I will just say that I uh I I
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
will be voting against the motion of itl
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
I think uh State Property uh
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
is treated somewhat differently I think
 
00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
uh people seem to feel that state
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
property is their is the people's
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
property and they have rights on it so
 
00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
unless you have specifically our
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
are uh but have statutes on what you can
 
00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
and can't do then uh uh it's you're
 
00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:08.200 align:start position:0%
there there is there are issues involved
 
00:52:10.349 --> 00:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
that that's why I would support this
 
00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:13.720 align:start position:0%
bill as it exists
 
00:52:15.789 --> 00:52:15.799 align:start position:0%
so with
 
00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
that any no one else speak on the motion
 
00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:22.280 align:start position:0%
no you want to step on my well no I I'm
 
00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
just confused by what you said so
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
because this will Lim limit the Public's
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
access to State prop that's right it
 
00:52:31.589 --> 00:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
will put it will limit the Public's
 
00:52:31.599 --> 00:52:32.870 align:start position:0%
will put it will limit the Public's
access

00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:52:35.309 --> 00:52:35.319 align:start position:0%
statutorily right now if it's not in
 
00:52:38.349 --> 00:52:38.359 align:start position:0%
statute they feel that they have a right
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
for to access to that
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:47.549 --> 00:52:47.559 align:start position:0%
do if you don't know though who they are
 
00:52:47.559 --> 00:52:48.750 align:start position:0%
do if you don't know though who they are

we have a
 
00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
second s by second by representative
 
00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
vilici to speak to your motion yes thank
 
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um this bill has three
 
00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
components to it um and primarily their
 
00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:19.160 align:start position:0%
housekeeping one is to remove the term
 
00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
interconnecting from statute when
 
00:55:24.109 --> 00:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
referring to sewers because it prevents
 
00:55:27.309 --> 00:55:27.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities from accessing Monies to
 
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
improve their sewer infrastructure
 
00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
because intercepting isn't a term that's
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
consistent with state grants and even
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
and it's part of the sewer system it's
 
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
just a glitch that we need to fix so
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
that our cities and towns can get help
 
00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
with these infrastructure projects the
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
other thing it does is it increases the
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
fee for certification of uh Wastewater
 
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
operators um that last the $50 fee
 
00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
that's currently in effect has been in
 
00:55:58.750 --> 00:55:58.760 align:start position:0%
effect for about 25 years it doesn't
 
00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
cover the cost of this self-funding
 
00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
program this training center so in order
 
00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
to keep this training center operating
 
00:56:09.549 --> 00:56:09.559 align:start position:0%
um and in in the administration we need
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
to increase the fee there was no um
 
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:14.799 align:start position:0%
opposition by anyone that takes part
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
they they want this fee because they
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
want this training and certification and
 
00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
then the third thing it does is it
 
00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
clarifies that Dees certifies
 
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
engineering firms that do
 
00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
in this type of infrastructure work
 
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
rather than um Wastewater Engineers um
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
we have the office of professional lure
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
which already certifies that profession
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
um but um the changes in this bill make
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
it clear that when Dees is compiling a
 
00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
list of valid firms that it is firms and
 
00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:51.400 align:start position:0%
not just an individual engineer engineer
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
I hope I didn't make it more confusing
 
00:56:55.789 --> 00:56:55.799 align:start position:0%
but that's the three things that spill
 
00:56:55.799 --> 00:56:57.870 align:start position:0%
but that's the three things that spill
does

00:56:57.870 --> 00:56:57.880 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
wish speak your
 
00:57:03.069 --> 00:57:03.079 align:start position:0%
second only to say I I believe my
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
colleague covered um the reasons why I
 
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
bill representa representative Derby for
 
00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I support this
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
bill because what we learned is that
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
this um the state aid um Grant already
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
covers um the systems but the this
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
language um adds to the to the time
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
delays that it takes to approve these um
 
00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
those time delays can actually have
 
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
significant impacts in um in when
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh are are making grants
 
00:57:41.309 --> 00:57:41.319 align:start position:0%
to to for the municipal water system or
 
00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
Municipal system improvements so this is
 
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
actually an important bill in order to
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
improve efficiency and support our
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities um and and the the
 
00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
there's no except for the minor fee
 
00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
change that uh representative rang
 
00:57:58.990 --> 00:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned there's no change in in cost
 
00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:00.200 align:start position:0%
from the state's
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
perspective um in addition to what um
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative rang said about uh
 
00:58:10.029 --> 00:58:10.039 align:start position:0%
the the request from the people that
 
00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
will be charged this fee to to pay it so
 
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
that they can actually get their
 
00:58:16.029 --> 00:58:16.039 align:start position:0%
training facilities upgraded which
 
00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
ultimately will result uh result in more
 
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:21.640 align:start position:0%
efficient training and less cost overall
 
00:58:23.789 --> 00:58:23.799 align:start position:0%
by the municipalities because more less
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
time away um from the work they actually
 
00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
have to do there also is the elimination
 
00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
of a penalty fee so there's a um there's
 
00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
a you know a slight fee increase but
 
00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:38.799 align:start position:0%
there's also a penalty fee elimination
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
um overall I think it's it's an really
 
00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
important bill to help our
 
00:58:44.109 --> 00:58:44.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities and I hope that the
 
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
committee votes and support of the OTP
 
00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
motion thank
 
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
you any other any
 
00:58:54.349 --> 00:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
other comments or
 
00:58:58.349 --> 00:58:58.359 align:start position:0%
questions this simply that the chair
 
00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
will not be voting in favor of this bill
 
00:59:05.309 --> 00:59:05.319 align:start position:0%
be because the fee still exists so and I
 
00:59:10.109 --> 00:59:10.119 align:start position:0%
did not get any uh it was said in
 
00:59:13.589 --> 00:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
testimony that uh
 
00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:17.720 align:start position:0%
the people who got the fee like liked it
 
00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
or wanted to have it increased I did not
 
00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
get any information onto that other than
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
verbal so I will be voting against the
 
00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:30.190 align:start position:0%
verbal so I will be voting against the
bill

thank you Mr chair I'd like to make a
 
01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
motion of ought to pass on Senate Bill
 
01:02:26.549 --> 01:02:26.559 align:start position:0%
549 a second
 
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
second by representative Vale wish to
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
speak on your motion yes Mr chair thank
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
you um we heard testimony How are um
 
01:02:37.789 --> 01:02:37.799 align:start position:0%
this dams across the state are
 
01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
critically underfunded which are which
 
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh requires um funding maintenance um
 
01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
and repairs from the general funds um
 
01:02:50.269 --> 01:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
this bill will set up a committee that
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
will seek funding options um that will
 
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:55.240 align:start position:0%
seek options to both uh increase the
 
01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
funding avail ailable as well as other
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
maintenance and um operation support in
 
01:03:02.829 --> 01:03:02.839 align:start position:0%
addition um it another important Clause
 
01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:05.720 align:start position:0%
of this bill is that it um permits the
 
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services um
 
01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:11.720 align:start position:0%
to appropriately uh classify reclassify
 
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
dams um if they uh if there's a risk of
 
01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:19.640 align:start position:0%
that their design um no longer meets the
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
let me say it differently if there's a
 
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
um if the design no longer meets the
 
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
risk that would be um of cat of dam
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
failure basically allows these to be
 
01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
marked as uh Hazard classification um
 
01:03:36.589 --> 01:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
that's an that's an important aspect
 
01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
because it um there are State there
 
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
right now um the dams can only be
 
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
reclassified if there's Downstream
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
changes um and it doesn't and it and
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
there are high high Hazard dams that
 
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
aren't correctly classified as such so
 
01:03:57.309 --> 01:03:57.319 align:start position:0%
I'd urge the um committee to um uh vote
 
01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
you representative Bale and just to
 
01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:08.440 align:start position:0%
reinforce um the reclassification part
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
of this bill is really critical and um I
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
pass there anyone else wishes to speak
 
01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:19.799 align:start position:0%

this amendment makes a an incredibly
 
01:06:52.829 --> 01:06:52.839 align:start position:0%
trivial change um to the language of the
 
01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
bill which simply Mo removes the
 
01:06:55.119 --> 01:06:56.430 align:start position:0%
bill which simply Mo removes the
restriction

01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
restriction
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
that this bill only applies to towns and
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
in in particular does not apply to
 
01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
cities there no are no other options in
 
01:07:06.309 --> 01:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
statute to provide intermunicipal
 
01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
agreements where cities can benefit in a
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
similar manner um as provided in this
 
01:07:14.109 --> 01:07:14.119 align:start position:0%
bill and this the the language from this
 
01:07:17.069 --> 01:07:17.079 align:start position:0%
bill explicitly included currently
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
includes prior to this amendment a
 
01:07:22.349 --> 01:07:22.359 align:start position:0%
clause that restricts it to only
 
01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
towns including cities um in the these
 
01:07:28.829 --> 01:07:28.839 align:start position:0%
agreements will encourage intermunicipal
 
01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
collaboration which was stated as a side
 
01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
benefit of
 
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
testimony um without this it will
 
01:07:39.069 --> 01:07:39.079 align:start position:0%
continue to pit cities against towns
 
01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
which we see and and having more sort of
 
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
C collaborative um intermunicipal uh
 
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
Arrangements will benefit all the
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
citizens of New
 
01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire these
 
01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
um cities likely can develop waste Water
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
Systems especially with the um in with
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
the increasing increasingly challenging
 
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh requirements for example of recent
 
01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
past changes that could support not only
 
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
the city um but also towns um and the
 
01:08:13.029 --> 01:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
towns would benefit by not having to uh
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
independently the um when asked um of
 
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
the dairy Town counselor when he
 
01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
testified why this um why this charge
 
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
was in place he's said reasonably it's
 
01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
because um the towns want to to benefit
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
um from the sir charge for non septic
 
01:08:40.269 --> 01:08:40.279 align:start position:0%
related uh measures in in the fairness
 
01:08:42.269 --> 01:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
that we have in this state that that
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
benefit should also apply to
 
01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
cities currently the mod the language
 
01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
that this was um based off of which is
 
01:08:55.470 --> 01:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
for um intermunicipal um water
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
agreements only applies to a single town
 
01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
and it's that same single town that is
 
01:09:02.789 --> 01:09:02.799 align:start position:0%
the only um this will only benefit two
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
towns in the entire State we're not
 
01:09:08.829 --> 01:09:08.839 align:start position:0%
actually um it's not good practice to
 
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
pass legislation that benefits one town
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
but I'm wholeheartedly in support of of
 
01:09:17.789 --> 01:09:17.799 align:start position:0%
supporting it if um it uh if we could
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
encourage better intermunicipal
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
cooperation by including cities in this
 
01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise I'll be forced to vote against
 
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
the unamended bill I urge my colleagues
 
01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:39.269 --> 01:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
you anyone wish to uh speak in support
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
of the of the
 
01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you Mr chair I'll speak
 
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
to my second um I think by including
 
01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
cities in this and giving cities the
 
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
ability to do a SE charge it recognizes
 
01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
that their taxpayers too make a
 
01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
significant contribution when they're
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
building sewer Wastewater infrastructure
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
and they should be able to benefit from
 
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
that sear charge that you know it and it
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
saves towns uh town taxpayers from
 
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
having to make that investment of a
 
01:10:10.669 --> 01:10:10.679 align:start position:0%
sewer system when they can hook into a
 
01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
city so um I I support that we strike
 
01:10:16.830 --> 01:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
the language that only limits this to
 
01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
towns that we expand it to cities so
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
that all property taxpayers can reap the
 
01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
benefits of the investment they make in
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
anyone wish to speak represent
 
01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.390 align:start position:0%
anyone wish to speak represent
representative

01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:31.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
veale yes um without the amendment um
 
01:10:36.189 --> 01:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
for the reasons that have been given by
 
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
my colleagues um this wouldn't I
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to vote for this
 
01:10:42.149 --> 01:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
because cities against towns is very
 
01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
difficult with being in a city
 
01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
particularly and this will be helpful
 
01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Darby for
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
amendment representative wolf do you
 
01:10:59.709 --> 01:10:59.719 align:start position:0%
have you have your mic on is no okay I
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
thought we were signaling that you have
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
you on is there uh anyone who wishes to
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
speak uh on the amendment representative
 
01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
donelly um I'm unsure of this amendment
 
01:11:15.550 --> 01:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
because we have no testimony from anyone
 
01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
that's running municipal or uh City s
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
systems um I'm not an expert and I don't
 
01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
know if anyone else in the room is an
 
01:11:26.189 --> 01:11:26.199 align:start position:0%
expert on on what does this Amendment
 
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
how does this impact cities how does
 
01:11:32.350 --> 01:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
this impact um our existing cities with
 
01:11:34.830 --> 01:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
water treatment plants because right now
 
01:11:37.709 --> 01:11:37.719 align:start position:0%
this is uh strictly going after um the
 
01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
other bill as it is is allowing for all
 
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
towns to work with cities this is now
 
01:11:45.310 --> 01:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
allowing correct me if I'm wrong cities
 
01:11:47.709 --> 01:11:47.719 align:start position:0%
to work with cities and I don't
 
01:11:49.149 --> 01:11:49.159 align:start position:0%
understand the impact of what this
 
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
amendment may have and we have no
 
01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
expertise no expert witnesses to help us
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
representative Derby thank you Mr chair
 
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
just in response to the question this is
 
01:12:05.629 --> 01:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation which allows
 
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
intermunicipal agreements intermunicipal
 
01:12:10.669 --> 01:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
agreements have to be approved by all
 
01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
the municipalities
 
01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
involved um the specific language
 
01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
strikes a clause that says um for
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities governed by a particular
 
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
RSA which which uh limits it to towns so
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
by eliminating that Clause it allows
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
towns to work with towns towns to work
 
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
with cities and cities to work with
 
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
cities although there are no as far as I
 
01:12:34.990 --> 01:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
know in the state not many adjacent
 
01:12:37.709 --> 01:12:37.719 align:start position:0%
cities at least not um not in the south
 
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
central part of the state um so uh this
 
01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
is only enabling legislation legislation
 
01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
and has to be approved by the um
 
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities where it where those
 
01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
intermunicipal agreements would be put
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:59.070 --> 01:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
representative har going to speak
 
01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
against the amendment I am concerned on
 
01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
two fronts the first one is it would
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
change what the Senate sent I think it's
 
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
an important bill as written that should
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
be passed as written secondly I don't
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
really see it a major event with a city
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
interconnecting with another city since
 
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
I am told most cities already have their
 
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
own septic U or sewer systems so the
 
01:13:27.149 --> 01:13:27.159 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be a need for them to do
 
01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
it I want to see the bill passed I think
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
we have the best chance to have it
 
01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
passed overall as written thank
 
01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
KH thank you Mr chairman again I because
 
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
I was not on the public hearing and lack
 
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
of knowledge about my uh about this
 
01:13:52.149 --> 01:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
amendment uh my question to
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
representative Derby that uh uh the town
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
of sebr when I was the
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
selectman for years we had discussion
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
with the Hampton Falls that they want to
 
01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
tie into SE Brook sewer system how it
 
01:14:08.350 --> 01:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
affects now let me let me go back a
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
little bit this town of SE Brook um
 
01:14:13.709 --> 01:14:13.719 align:start position:0%
asked that they will have a different
 
01:14:16.830 --> 01:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
rate than cbook residents how this
 
01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
amendment affects that uh um SE Brook if
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh SE Brook asking for different rates
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair this um this will not
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
affect any have any impact at all on um
 
01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
town to um town to toown um inter
 
01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
Municipal agreements which is the intent
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
of the original Bill between London
 
01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
Dairy and dairy and so if if C Brook is
 
01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
a town um and I'm Hampton I forget what
 
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
the other town is in town as well this
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
would have no impact at all if either of
 
01:14:51.709 --> 01:14:51.719 align:start position:0%
those were cities then this amendment
 
01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
would um would have an impact but I'd
 
01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
like to just make one other statement um
 
01:14:58.590 --> 01:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
in response to uh representative harb's
 
01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
comment um just for clarification this
 
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
is um this amendment will while it will
 
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
enable you know intermunicipal
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
agreements between cities will also
 
01:15:09.629 --> 01:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
allow intermunicipal
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
agreements between a city and between a
 
01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
town and a city that's that's the case
 
01:15:18.270 --> 01:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
that's the majority case um NASA for
 
01:15:20.910 --> 01:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
example is surrounded by towns there are
 
01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
no other cities um I don't think
 
01:15:24.669 --> 01:15:24.679 align:start position:0%
Hudson's the city um there are no other
 
01:15:24.679 --> 01:15:25.510 align:start position:0%
Hudson's the city um there are no other
cities

01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
cities
 
01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
around it um and so the uh the intent is
 
01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
to allow for example Hollis or marac to
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
um to share uh septic system uh
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant uh facilities
 
01:15:41.629 --> 01:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
if needed and let ntion would benefit
 
01:15:43.709 --> 01:15:43.719 align:start position:0%
from that the same way that Dairy would
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:53.320 align:start position:0%
Bill see no other questions or no other
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%

01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
because uh Hadley Falls Dam in center of
 
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
gtown was there for 100 years it was
 
01:22:39.149 --> 01:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
used to generate electricity uh it lost
 
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
the license with firk was no longer
 
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
economically viable and DS has moved to
 
01:22:46.669 --> 01:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
remove it and it's going to be gone this
 
01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
year um this raised the question of how
 
01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
many dams do we have like that well
 
01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
there's 27 three state-owned
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
dams the code the cost to bring them up
 
01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
to current standard would be$ 414
 
01:23:06.110 --> 01:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
million dollar 63 of those 273 dams have
 
01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
been designated by Dees as high
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
Hazard the um the issue is that these
 
01:23:16.510 --> 01:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
dams Beyond
 
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
providing uh a natural resource for our
 
01:23:22.990 --> 01:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
citizens is also a huge source of
 
01:23:25.229 --> 01:23:25.239 align:start position:0%
property value for our citizens
 
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
if those dams any of those dams that go
 
01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
away the property value is adjacent are
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
going to fall precipitously for
 
01:23:34.149 --> 01:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
waterfront properties over half in
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
general over half of the value of those
 
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
properties is tied to the fact that it's
 
01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:41.950 align:start position:0%
properties is tied to the fact that it's
Waterfront

01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
Waterfront
 
01:23:44.910 --> 01:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
so this is a a property tax issue as
 
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
much as a natural resource
 
01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:49.669 align:start position:0%
much as a natural resource
issue

01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:23:52.709 --> 01:23:52.719 align:start position:0%
um Dees has made the decision at least
 
01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
in some cases that it's simply not worth
 
01:23:57.709 --> 01:23:57.719 align:start position:0%
the cost to repair them and they don't
 
01:23:59.830 --> 01:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
want the continual cost of maintaining
 
01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
them and they don't want the liability
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
in having those dams remain and so in
 
01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
some cases after a very thorough process
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
I give the department credit but after a
 
01:24:11.709 --> 01:24:11.719 align:start position:0%
very thorough process of evaluation
 
01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
they've decided to remove those
 
01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
dams so Hadley's only the first in G
 
01:24:21.070 --> 01:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
toown but every one of us in this room
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
has towns or is close to towns
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
that is going to face this issue and so
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
it seemed to me that it was important to
 
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
come up with a process to address the
 
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
issue and so the bill as passed through
 
01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
the Senate does two things one it
 
01:24:38.350 --> 01:24:38.360 align:start position:0%
creates a general obligation for the
 
01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
Department to at least offer the town uh
 
01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
the the right to have the
 
01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
dam uh take over the liability and the
 
01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
cost of Maintenance and secondly it
 
01:24:54.669 --> 01:24:54.679 align:start position:0%
creates a revolving Loan Fund um to uh
 
01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
allow communities to tap into
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
resources uh to bring those dams up to
 
01:25:03.629 --> 01:25:03.639 align:start position:0%
code should they choose to accept the
 
01:25:06.030 --> 01:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility after this committee
 
01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
passed House Bill 1429 it was sent to
 
01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means um ways and means if you
 
01:25:15.070 --> 01:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
listen to the
 
01:25:17.149 --> 01:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
hearing in my opinion they really
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
focused on the policy question you I
 
01:25:22.149 --> 01:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
once sat on house waying means believe
 
01:25:25.149 --> 01:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
it or not my first term
 
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
I thought we were supposed to focus on
 
01:25:28.109 --> 01:25:28.119 align:start position:0%
dollars and cents but they really did
 
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
focus on the policy question and they
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
ited House Bill
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
1429 and I have no wish to see this bill
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
which I think is a very good
 
01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
idea uh face the same outcome and so the
 
01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
amendment that I'm waiting for any
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
moment strips out the second part of the
 
01:25:49.229 --> 01:25:49.239 align:start position:0%
bill the section two dealing with the
 
01:25:51.629 --> 01:25:51.639 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund which I assume was the trigger
 
01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
that sent it to Ways and Means
 
01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment also makes a small
 
01:25:59.590 --> 01:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
correction uh to address an issue that
 
01:26:01.870 --> 01:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
was brought forward by Dees two days ago
 
01:26:04.229 --> 01:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
in a letter um
 
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
which includes the easement any easement
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
associated with the dam would also be
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
able to be transferred to the town so I
 
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
think that addresses their concern there
 
01:26:16.590 --> 01:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
was a question of whether the the the
 
01:26:20.430 --> 01:26:20.440 align:start position:0%
bill includes language um dealing with
 
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
DS's right to take away dams if they're
 
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
deemed to be environmentalist
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
um unwise and I did include that
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
language on page one line 21 and
 
01:26:33.550 --> 01:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
22 so I truly hope that when the
 
01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
amendment comes in should the committee
 
01:26:37.709 --> 01:26:37.719 align:start position:0%
choose to adopt it uh and save it from
 
01:26:40.030 --> 01:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
the same outcome as House Bill
 
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
1429 uh I hope you'll look kindly upon
 
01:26:46.149 --> 01:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
it and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:26:48.910 --> 01:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative L montin followed by
 
01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:51.310 align:start position:0%
okay representative L montin followed by
representative

01:26:51.310 --> 01:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
Derby thank you Mr chair um
 
01:26:57.950 --> 01:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
with the and thank you for taking my
 
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
question with the if you're removing
 
01:27:03.189 --> 01:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
section two in your
 
01:27:07.229 --> 01:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment um but section three which for
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
me was important that we included that
 
01:27:15.510 --> 01:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
in um hb1 1429 but I wasn't able to get
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment um written the way that
 
01:27:21.189 --> 01:27:21.199 align:start position:0%
would work but um if you're removing
 
01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
section two the procedure um
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
um uh to exempt that if there's a
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
compelling environmental interest refers
 
01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
to section two so it's still in there if
 
01:27:36.109 --> 01:27:36.119 align:start position:0%
you Che
 
01:27:38.790 --> 01:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
out section two well section two and
 
01:27:40.270 --> 01:27:40.280 align:start position:0%
really three and four they all deal with
 
01:27:41.669 --> 01:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
the revolving Loan Fund so they would
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
all have to go in order to I think pass
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means muster but if you look at
 
01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
line assuming we're looking at the same
 
01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
bill here um lines 21 and 22 unless
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
there is a compelling environmental
 
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
interest in
 
01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:57.430 align:start position:0%
interest in
removal

01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
removal
 
01:28:00.990 --> 01:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
right um oh it does refer to paragraph
 
01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:09.189 --> 01:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
so okay like for me can I answer your
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
question ma'am I just want to be sure
 
01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
that that line is kept in there if you
 
01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
remove section
 
01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
two yes uh section two is it won't touch
 
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
it yes ma'am next question
 
01:28:27.709 --> 01:28:27.719 align:start position:0%
is representative Derby thank you Mr
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
chair thank you senator for taking my
 
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
question yes sir um the bill that we
 
01:28:33.709 --> 01:28:33.719 align:start position:0%
passed was an amended bill um that
 
01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
introduced the new um Loan Fund at least
 
01:28:40.109 --> 01:28:40.119 align:start position:0%
that's my recollection and I sorry that
 
01:28:42.149 --> 01:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not completely prepared I I didn't
 
01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
know an amendment was coming um the
 
01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
original bill was to um add the purpose
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
to the existing Dam uh add a new purpose
 
01:28:53.669 --> 01:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
to the dam maintenance fund and there
 
01:28:56.270 --> 01:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
was um my recollection and my note say
 
01:28:58.390 --> 01:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
that there was some strong concern about
 
01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
that because of the funding sources for
 
01:29:04.189 --> 01:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
that um and that it wouldn't be able to
 
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
provide a uh it wouldn't be able to
 
01:29:10.189 --> 01:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
provide these loans that were desired
 
01:29:13.870 --> 01:29:13.880 align:start position:0%
under you know under section one so what
 
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
um if we remove the dedicated fund what
 
01:29:20.109 --> 01:29:20.119 align:start position:0%
where do you propos to the money comes
 
01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
from that's a great question I agree
 
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
that the revolving loan fund is an
 
01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
important piece of the original bill um
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
that's why I included it in the in the
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
original bill as drafted having said
 
01:29:34.270 --> 01:29:34.280 align:start position:0%
that uh if Ways and Means does not going
 
01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:36.280 align:start position:0%
to allow that fund to come into being
 
01:29:37.709 --> 01:29:37.719 align:start position:0%
and that's what they've indicated
 
01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
through killing the companion bill it's
 
01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
better to still have in my opinion the
 
01:29:45.109 --> 01:29:45.119 align:start position:0%
obligation of Dees to at least offer the
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
community the right to the dam and the
 
01:29:48.910 --> 01:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
easement and the town can decide whether
 
01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
they want to adopt that and take on the
 
01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
cost themselves it would also leave in
 
01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
place um on page one lines 23 to 26 it
 
01:29:58.830 --> 01:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
leaves in place the Department's
 
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
obligation to offer documentation
 
01:30:02.590 --> 01:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
regarding Dam's condition and a good
 
01:30:06.070 --> 01:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
faith estimate of cost of repairs so DS
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
would still have to go to the community
 
01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
and say this Dam uh isn't going to meet
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
code it requires in the case of Hadley
 
01:30:16.229 --> 01:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
Falls it was $5 million I believe it's
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
going to require $5 million in cost um
 
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
you can choose to take it or
 
01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
not now without Al loone f the truth is
 
01:30:26.830 --> 01:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
is that very few communities I think in
 
01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
general are going to take that and I
 
01:30:30.510 --> 01:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
would look to come back next year uh
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
assuming that we're all lucky enough to
 
01:30:35.310 --> 01:30:35.320 align:start position:0%
be sitting in in this building and to um
 
01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
establish a Loan Fund with perhaps a
 
01:30:37.790 --> 01:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Committee that might
 
01:30:40.629 --> 01:30:40.639 align:start position:0%
smile upon it for for a followup and
 
01:30:42.590 --> 01:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
then thank you Mr chair very briefly so
 
01:30:44.910 --> 01:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
just just to make sure I I understand so
 
01:30:47.950 --> 01:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting let the um let the U
 
01:30:49.070 --> 01:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities figure out how they're
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
going to pay for it there would be no um
 
01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
there would be no change to existing
 
01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
other existing funds to provide some
 
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
other loan
 
01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
mechanism that's correct I me it is a
 
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
non-budget year and I think that may
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
have been part of the concern part ways
 
01:31:06.550 --> 01:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
and means it it is better to have the
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
obligation of Dees I think made into law
 
01:31:13.030 --> 01:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
to offer the dam at least have them have
 
01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:18.280 align:start position:0%
the ability to to um to choose to take
 
01:31:20.030 --> 01:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
on the expense and the liability if they
 
01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
so choose I know in the case of of of
 
01:31:24.430 --> 01:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
gtown they felt like they had some
 
01:31:26.350 --> 01:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
notice but they really didn't see what
 
01:31:29.590 --> 01:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
options they had and you know the having
 
01:31:31.629 --> 01:31:31.639 align:start position:0%
a an empowerment in the middle of their
 
01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
town really they identified with that
 
01:31:35.830 --> 01:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
they it had been there for Generations
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
they really felt strongly about keeping
 
01:31:41.070 --> 01:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
it they really didn't have any any
 
01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
chance to save
 
01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
it at least that was their feeling okay
 
01:31:48.430 --> 01:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
representative Khan for a
 
01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
you senator for taking my question yes
 
01:31:55.149 --> 01:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
sir uh
 
01:31:57.709 --> 01:31:57.719 align:start position:0%
we talking about two uh different kind
 
01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
of uh expense that uh is going to be
 
01:32:05.390 --> 01:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
imposed on the town and cities one is to
 
01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
bring it to the code and the other is
 
01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:09.350 align:start position:0%
bring it to the code and the other is
the

01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:11.430 align:start position:0%
the
maintenance

01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
01:32:15.390 --> 01:32:15.400 align:start position:0%
so how many how many dams are not uh
 
01:32:19.229 --> 01:32:19.239 align:start position:0%
fall into the code right now that uh out
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
of 200 some dams in New Hampshire many
 
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
are not
 
01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
um is falling to the
 
01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
code my notes indicate that there's 273
 
01:32:34.590 --> 01:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
dams that are owned by the state of the
 
01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
273 the state handles maintenance on 208
 
01:32:40.189 --> 01:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
of them I'm unaware of how many do not
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
meet code to the letter but 63 of them
 
01:32:46.189 --> 01:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
have have been designated as quote high
 
01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:48.280 align:start position:0%
Hazard dams
 
01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
unquote um you
 
01:32:53.550 --> 01:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
know dams are expensive to to correct
 
01:32:55.790 --> 01:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
and maintain it doesn't help that as
 
01:32:58.350 --> 01:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
well that the the standards have
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
certainly increased over time Hadley
 
01:33:02.229 --> 01:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
Falls Dam if you have ever been there
 
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
isn't very large and um to bring it to
 
01:33:08.270 --> 01:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
code they essentially have to remove it
 
01:33:10.830 --> 01:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
and reinstall it tying into Bedrock on
 
01:33:12.669 --> 01:33:12.679 align:start position:0%
both sides of the river which that's
 
01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
where the expense is followup Mr
 
01:33:16.510 --> 01:33:16.520 align:start position:0%
chairman for
 
01:33:20.790 --> 01:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
followup um if we talk about 208 that
 
01:33:24.189 --> 01:33:24.199 align:start position:0%
state maintains right now and if those
 
01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
208 is not code and we imposing those uh
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
to the towns and cities uh small towns
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
it will be it could be a very big
 
01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
expense for their uh budget and
 
01:33:39.149 --> 01:33:39.159 align:start position:0%
everything so that is a concern for this
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
members I I think you misunderstood my
 
01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
my statement I'm not saying that 208
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
dams don't meet code I'm saying I don't
 
01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
know how many meet code or do not I only
 
01:33:50.590 --> 01:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
know that 63 of them are high hazard out
 
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
of the 208 dams some some number of them
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
would meet current standards some number
 
01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:56.750 align:start position:0%
would meet current standards some number
do

01:33:56.750 --> 01:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:33:59.310 --> 01:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
not this bill does not obligate
 
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
communities to take on the liability it
 
01:34:03.310 --> 01:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
simply allows them to take on liability
 
01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
if they choose it's enabling legislation
 
01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:06.669 align:start position:0%
if they choose it's enabling legislation
thank

01:34:06.669 --> 01:34:06.679 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
you representative har thank you Mr
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
chair thank you senator for taking this
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
question I think representative L
 
01:34:16.669 --> 01:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
montain asked the question but I can't
 
01:34:20.350 --> 01:34:20.360 align:start position:0%
remember that you actually addressed it
 
01:34:22.109 --> 01:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned that we will be getting
 
01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
or you will be getting um an amendment
 
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
to delete section two
 
01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
correct but I look at the bill in
 
01:34:33.950 --> 01:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
section three and four relates to
 
01:34:36.109 --> 01:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
section two so is your Amendment going
 
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
to delete two three and four I believe
 
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
in my answer representative L mon I did
 
01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
indicate that sections two three and
 
01:34:43.950 --> 01:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
four all deal with the revolving Loan
 
01:34:46.030 --> 01:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
Fund and they would all be stripped by
 
01:34:47.669 --> 01:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
the amendment I just want to make sure
 
01:34:49.109 --> 01:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
the others were covered the important
 
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
language to represent L montain was was
 
01:34:54.669 --> 01:34:54.679 align:start position:0%
contained uh in section so it would not
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
be touched thank
 
01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
you representative wrong thank thank you
 
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you senator for taking my
 
01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
question' so as I understand the bill as
 
01:35:09.149 --> 01:35:09.159 align:start position:0%
you're proposing it be amended dams
 
01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether they've been
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
deemed a menace or non- Menace can be
 
01:35:15.870 --> 01:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
transferred to the town if the town
 
01:35:19.109 --> 01:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
wants that Dam correct and then they
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
would then be responsible for raising
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
the funds within the tax
 
01:35:27.550 --> 01:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
to maintain or repair the
 
01:35:30.910 --> 01:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
dam but I'm wondering about a scenario
 
01:35:33.310 --> 01:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
where if the town has to raise those
 
01:35:35.910 --> 01:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
funds it may have to be through a bond
 
01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:39.679 align:start position:0%
issue or a very large budget hit if that
 
01:35:42.270 --> 01:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
fails and the dam then doesn't have the
 
01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
the you know the town doesn't have the
 
01:35:45.669 --> 01:35:45.679 align:start position:0%
money to make the repairs and if that
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
Dam should fail and impact communities
 
01:35:51.790 --> 01:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
Downstream would that town then be
 
01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
liable for any damages um how would
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
because we're not just talking we're
 
01:35:59.750 --> 01:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
talking about the liability of the dam
 
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
but that you're with this bill the town
 
01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
is also taking on a liability that may
 
01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
impact many could be many communities
 
01:36:10.189 --> 01:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
Downstream I was just wondering if
 
01:36:12.590 --> 01:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
there's any recourse for the town if
 
01:36:14.390 --> 01:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
that happens because the state would
 
01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
correct oh that's a very complicated
 
01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
question with a number of ways to answer
 
01:36:29.470 --> 01:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
it first off the line uh 20 and 21 says
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh unless the commissioner of
 
01:36:32.910 --> 01:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services believes the dam
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
to be an imminent danger of failure and
 
01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
a threat to the lives and property
 
01:36:38.910 --> 01:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
Downstream so DS is already already
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
empowered to remove a dam that they find
 
01:36:44.910 --> 01:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
in in in need of in danger of failure um
 
01:36:47.790 --> 01:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
but dams are subject to routine
 
01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
inspection anything that has a firk
 
01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
license has a very very thorough
 
01:36:54.990 --> 01:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
inspection process
 
01:36:57.910 --> 01:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
um and again this does not obligate
 
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
towns to take on a dam it simply says
 
01:37:01.629 --> 01:37:01.639 align:start position:0%
that prior to
 
01:37:04.189 --> 01:37:04.199 align:start position:0%
removal so DS would have already had to
 
01:37:06.149 --> 01:37:06.159 align:start position:0%
decide this Dam's going to go
 
01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
away it only applies to dams that DS has
 
01:37:11.310 --> 01:37:11.320 align:start position:0%
said we're going to take this Dam away
 
01:37:12.750 --> 01:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
now instead of just taking it away they
 
01:37:15.149 --> 01:37:15.159 align:start position:0%
have to say unless you want
 
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
it and you can decide whether you want
 
01:37:20.430 --> 01:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
not and the bill also if a few recall it
 
01:37:27.070 --> 01:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
expanded the time so that the towns
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
would have a chance to be able to go
 
01:37:32.950 --> 01:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
through a process to try to get the the
 
01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:35.159 align:start position:0%
funding that I think was part of the
 
01:37:37.870 --> 01:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
amendment process that we had which was
 
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
incorporated into this
 
01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:42.709 align:start position:0%
incorporated into this
bill

01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:37:46.990 --> 01:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
uh and uh was very similar to what uh I
 
01:37:49.229 --> 01:37:49.239 align:start position:0%
think this bill was put together because
 
01:37:51.589 --> 01:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
of I guess because it ran into the
 
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
problems in ways and means that that's
 
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
correct okay and so we're trying
 
01:38:01.629 --> 01:38:01.639 align:start position:0%
to basically be a workaround uh I let me
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
let me two things the our um committee
 
01:38:09.310 --> 01:38:09.320 align:start position:0%
researchers is trying to track down the
 
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
state of the uh of the amendment uh it
 
01:38:17.669 --> 01:38:17.679 align:start position:0%
it uh it will have to come in under the
 
01:38:20.350 --> 01:38:20.360 align:start position:0%
house name so I should put my name on it
 
01:38:22.709 --> 01:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
so just to able to get it through
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
because otherwise if you came in on the
 
01:38:26.189 --> 01:38:26.199 align:start position:0%
your name it wouldn't it wouldn't count
 
01:38:27.229 --> 01:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
I understand
 
01:38:32.709 --> 01:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
so and uh thirdly I I've served on Ways
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
and Means yesterday as
 
01:38:39.109 --> 01:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
substitute and this is that issue came
 
01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
up about what further bills they had and
 
01:38:45.550 --> 01:38:45.560 align:start position:0%
the chair said well none I said wait a
 
01:38:49.550 --> 01:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
minute uh you have one in
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
resources and what one is that oh that's
 
01:38:57.070 --> 01:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
the that's the B the the uh the dam Bill
 
01:38:58.270 --> 01:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
and they
 
01:39:01.589 --> 01:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
going and put it this way the
 
01:39:04.830 --> 01:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
question I had several
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
people said please remove the part
 
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
around uh around funding so that we
 
01:39:15.790 --> 01:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
don't get it so I think they understand
 
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
the issue that they they now I don't
 
01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159 align:start position:0%
want to say anything on the record but
 
01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
uh I think they would be they would
 
01:39:27.870 --> 01:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
rather they we remove the the the
 
01:39:31.589 --> 01:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
funding for this time for for this point
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
in time and be able to to take up the
 
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
funding next year under the normal
 
01:39:39.950 --> 01:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
course of action of course that and Mr
 
01:39:42.629 --> 01:39:42.639 align:start position:0%
chairman if I may you did exec exec a
 
01:39:44.950 --> 01:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
bill and you voted it all to pass that I
 
01:39:46.470 --> 01:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
think May provide some additional
 
01:39:48.589 --> 01:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
opportunities for revenue and ways to
 
01:39:51.070 --> 01:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
fund those repairs so maybe it's better
 
01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:52.639 align:start position:0%
that we wait till next year on that
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
piece and just focus on creating the
 
01:39:57.669 --> 01:39:57.679 align:start position:0%
obligation of the department to offer
 
01:40:00.189 --> 01:40:00.199 align:start position:0%
the dam
 
01:40:05.229 --> 01:40:05.239 align:start position:0%
okay with that is there any other
 
01:40:05.239 --> 01:40:08.950 align:start position:0%
okay with that is there any other
questions

01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:11.950 --> 01:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
that a question of the chair are is this
 
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
a bill that we have to have an executive
 
01:40:17.430 --> 01:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
session on today yes we do okay thank
 
01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:18.470 align:start position:0%
session on today yes we do okay thank
you

01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:40:21.589 --> 01:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
yes this bill it has to go
 
01:40:23.950 --> 01:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
out a bit of
 
01:40:25.629 --> 01:40:25.639 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr CH I did have one more
 
01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:28.199 align:start position:0%
question sorry for the delay um one of
 
01:40:30.910 --> 01:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
the changes between um this bill and the
 
01:40:32.910 --> 01:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
bill that um the amendment that we
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
passed is a particular uh um sort of
 
01:40:39.870 --> 01:40:39.880 align:start position:0%
qualification about the with it's on
 
01:40:43.629 --> 01:40:43.639 align:start position:0%
line 14 um sorry 15 but it's it's
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
combined with line 14 it has to do with
 
01:40:48.550 --> 01:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
if the municipality doesn't ex um
 
01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
decides not to um you know uh buy the
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
dam for one reason or another um the DS
 
01:40:57.189 --> 01:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
will offer it to land Owners Association
 
01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
of land owners or interested parties the
 
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
change is that it says capable of
 
01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
assessing local property taxes that
 
01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
stuck out as me is uh because I wasn't
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's not clear to me what associations
 
01:41:11.669 --> 01:41:11.679 align:start position:0%
can assess local property
 
01:41:13.310 --> 01:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
taxes thank you for the question
 
01:41:14.910 --> 01:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
representative this was a a change that
 
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
was requested in uh the Senate um
 
01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
committee your counterparts across the
 
01:41:22.430 --> 01:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
wall um H requested by the principal
 
01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:24.470 align:start position:0%
wall um H requested by the principal
Association

01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
Association
 
01:41:26.589 --> 01:41:26.599 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
I I'm not sure that there are any public
 
01:41:31.790 --> 01:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
entities U that aren't municipalities
 
01:41:33.149 --> 01:41:33.159 align:start position:0%
capable of assessing property taxes
 
01:41:36.109 --> 01:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
although you do have some things like
 
01:41:38.709 --> 01:41:38.719 align:start position:0%
Pilots um there are groups that are able
 
01:41:41.109 --> 01:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
through basically communities are able
 
01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
to delegate taxing authority to those uh
 
01:41:46.189 --> 01:41:46.199 align:start position:0%
to those groups but there are there are
 
01:41:48.189 --> 01:41:48.199 align:start position:0%
certainly groups registered public
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
entities capable of of issuing debt so I
 
01:41:54.510 --> 01:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
think that that's why I let let that go
 
01:41:57.149 --> 01:41:57.159 align:start position:0%
thanks for the background there yes
 
01:41:59.589 --> 01:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
sir representative R for addition
 
01:42:01.310 --> 01:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair so the
 
01:42:03.070 --> 01:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
action we have to take today is
 
01:42:05.189 --> 01:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
predicated on getting an amendment which
 
01:42:08.709 --> 01:42:08.719 align:start position:0%
we haven't received yet that's so I mean
 
01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
we're not going to sit here and wait
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
what I will do after the
 
01:42:16.390 --> 01:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
is uh I will not I will
 
01:42:19.589 --> 01:42:19.599 align:start position:0%
recess the meeting or and then start you
 
01:42:22.990 --> 01:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
know the additional hearings that we we
 
01:42:27.149 --> 01:42:27.159 align:start position:0%
have have and when the amendment comes
 
01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
in uh I'll I will then re I will
 
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
then uh re re re recall reopen the
 
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
meeting and uh in order to actually take
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
the the the vote uh otherwise we're just
 
01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
going to be sitting
 
01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
here your time is too valuable for
 
01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative just question of the
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
chair Mr chairman we have a hearing at
 
01:42:56.990 --> 01:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
12 12:00 that's potentially a like
 
01:43:01.589 --> 01:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
fairly well attended hearing right on uh
 
01:43:04.030 --> 01:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
the boat voting Bill yes so we could
 
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
potentially recess until after that and
 
01:43:06.239 --> 01:43:07.109 align:start position:0%
potentially recess until after that and
have

01:43:07.109 --> 01:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:43:11.550 --> 01:43:11.560 align:start position:0%
until 130 I will I will recess that
 
01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
meeting when as soon as the amendment
 
01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
comes in I will re I will re recess that
 
01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
meeting for you know 15 20 minutes and I
 
01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:24.149 align:start position:0%
meeting for you know 15 20 minutes and I
will

01:43:24.149 --> 01:43:24.159 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
reconvene this
 
01:43:30.510 --> 01:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
meeting to take care of the bill to pass
 
01:43:33.149 --> 01:43:33.159 align:start position:0%
what has to hopefully the amendment
 
01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any pickups in it then then
 
01:43:38.189 --> 01:43:38.199 align:start position:0%
it gets to be a real problem so we have
 
01:43:40.510 --> 01:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
a few hours I
 
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%

that and
 
01:43:50.350 --> 01:43:50.360 align:start position:0%
then get
 
01:43:53.589 --> 01:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
a adjourn this this meeting then
 
01:43:56.550 --> 01:43:56.560 align:start position:0%

01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
good 5:39 morning Mr ch39 yes for the
 
01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
record rainy pet here I'm the Water
 
01:45:09.270 --> 01:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
Division director at Dees and here as
 
01:45:11.109 --> 01:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
you will see in our letter of testimony
 
01:45:15.189 --> 01:45:15.199 align:start position:0%
we support this bill um we have worked
 
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
with Senator Murphy I think and S
 
01:45:19.709 --> 01:45:19.719 align:start position:0%
Senator delisandros Bill which you
 
01:45:22.270 --> 01:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
passed earlier today 541 to look at
 
01:45:25.270 --> 01:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
Revenue sour es I mean it all comes into
 
01:45:28.390 --> 01:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
play I think the big thing that we have
 
01:45:31.629 --> 01:45:31.639 align:start position:0%
concerns with is always funding um and I
 
01:45:33.709 --> 01:45:33.719 align:start position:0%
think Senator Murphy's amendment makes a
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
lot of sense that we step back and walk
 
01:45:39.589 --> 01:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
before we run on a loan program as you
 
01:45:42.109 --> 01:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
know we have many loan programs for
 
01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
water and wastewater one of the concerns
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
about the Loan program for this Dam
 
01:45:50.830 --> 01:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
program is funding and number two as
 
01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
Senator Murphy noted we figure we have
 
01:45:58.350 --> 01:45:58.360 align:start position:0%
some somewhere north of $414 million
 
01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
doll needed just to bring the 273 dams
 
01:46:04.589 --> 01:46:04.599 align:start position:0%
we have up to our current standards Dam
 
01:46:07.669 --> 01:46:07.679 align:start position:0%
standards so I think I have nothing to
 
01:46:10.390 --> 01:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
add over Senator Murphy's uh quite
 
01:46:13.109 --> 01:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
articulate explanation of the bill but
 
01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly here to answer any
 
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
questions of Dees that you may
 
01:46:27.790 --> 01:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:29.430 align:start position:0%
 
chair

01:46:29.430 --> 01:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:46:31.589 --> 01:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr shair and
 
01:46:34.750 --> 01:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question
 
01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
um is there already a process say um if
 
01:46:43.870 --> 01:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
there if this were to pass would
 
01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:46.310 align:start position:0%
there if this were to pass would
Dees

01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
Dees
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
review do a new review perhaps before
 
01:46:53.950 --> 01:46:53.960 align:start position:0%
they agree to pass it on to determine
 
01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
the current safety of the dam and to
 
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
assess the environmental impact of the
 
01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
dam staying or or not staying would
 
01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
would it automatically be reviewed again
 
01:47:10.270 --> 01:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
yes good question thank you yeah the
 
01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
bill actually provides a year where Dees
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
will notify the town or the municipality
 
01:47:19.270 --> 01:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
if you will and also provide information
 
01:47:21.790 --> 01:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
about the cost and and what kind of
 
01:47:24.109 --> 01:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
condition the dam is in in it relative
 
01:47:26.830 --> 01:47:26.840 align:start position:0%
to public health and safety so that is
 
01:47:32.990 --> 01:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:36.430 --> 01:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
written representative wolf thank you Mr
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
you can never remember your title R
 
01:47:46.790 --> 01:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um if
 
01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
there is an error in the state's
 
01:47:51.790 --> 01:47:51.800 align:start position:0%
estimate of costs or things like that
 
01:47:53.629 --> 01:47:53.639 align:start position:0%
underlying conditions that were not
 
01:47:55.709 --> 01:47:55.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned does the state assume any
 
01:47:59.669 --> 01:47:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:02.510 --> 01:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
that uh good question considering I'm a
 
01:48:05.109 --> 01:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
civil engineer and not an attorney I'm
 
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
not sure I can answer that but I I would
 
01:48:09.990 --> 01:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
feel very comfortable about the
 
01:48:11.950 --> 01:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
analytics that we do when we look at
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
dams and what's needed we go all the way
 
01:48:17.669 --> 01:48:17.679 align:start position:0%
from the hydrogeological analysis and
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
look at what the Bedrock is is it on
 
01:48:23.669 --> 01:48:23.679 align:start position:0%
Stone is it on Sand so if that would
 
01:48:25.229 --> 01:48:25.239 align:start position:0%
have occurred and we didn't make a
 
01:48:28.430 --> 01:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
mistake then I suspect you know if it
 
01:48:30.350 --> 01:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
went to court it would be decided there
 
01:48:32.350 --> 01:48:32.360 align:start position:0%
but I have all the confidence in the
 
01:48:34.910 --> 01:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
world that the technical expertise that
 
01:48:38.510 --> 01:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
we possess I don't see that as a
 
01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:50.109 align:start position:0%
we possess I don't see that as a
potential

01:48:50.109 --> 01:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
risk thank you very much um just point
 
01:48:56.470 --> 01:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
clarification it says in the letter um
 
01:49:00.550 --> 01:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
the 63 dams class 63 dams are classified
 
01:49:03.629 --> 01:49:03.639 align:start position:0%
as high Hazard the failure of any of
 
01:49:06.270 --> 01:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
which would cause loss of life so high
 
01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:07.830 align:start position:0%
which would cause loss of life so high
Hazard

01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
Hazard
 
01:49:10.189 --> 01:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
means when you put a dam into the high
 
01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
Hazard category that is simply to
 
01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
categorize them as sort of proximity to
 
01:49:23.629 --> 01:49:23.639 align:start position:0%
population or does it also entail um
 
01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
the condition of the damp thanks yeah
 
01:49:30.550 --> 01:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
when we rate something as high Hazard
 
01:49:32.470 --> 01:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
that means there's a possibility of loss
 
01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
of life um public infrastructure
 
01:49:38.430 --> 01:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
driveways those types of things and
 
01:49:40.030 --> 01:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
that's when it gets into that high
 
01:49:42.990 --> 01:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
Hazard status we currently have 63 High
 
01:49:46.109 --> 01:49:46.119 align:start position:0%
Hazard dams um that need to be addressed
 
01:49:48.109 --> 01:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
over time and we've estimated somewhere
 
01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
around 300 million to take care of just
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
the dams that stay owns we do regulate
 
01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
keep in mind some 2600 dams throughout
 
01:50:01.390 --> 01:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
the state 273 of those are owned by Dees
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
and they were formally owned by fishing
 
01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
game in some cases so funding for this
 
01:50:08.310 --> 01:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
program is a big issue that's why it's
 
01:50:12.270 --> 01:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
kind of exciting that 549 was voted off
 
01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
the pass today to figure out how we can
 
01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
fund these projects you know I've been a
 
01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
Dees for go 50 years now and I think um
 
01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
when I look back on when the state took
 
01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
over dams it was well be before my
 
01:50:32.870 --> 01:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
tenure there but I think over the years
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
the politics approved taking over a lot
 
01:50:37.709 --> 01:50:37.719 align:start position:0%
of these dams and there was a lot of
 
01:50:40.629 --> 01:50:40.639 align:start position:0%
risk associated with the repair keep in
 
01:50:43.069 --> 01:50:43.079 align:start position:0%
mind most of these dams are 50 years old
 
01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
some are 100 years old and they've had
 
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
little attention over the years this
 
01:50:51.189 --> 01:50:51.199 align:start position:0%
year let's say to do damn maintenance on
 
01:50:53.069 --> 01:50:53.079 align:start position:0%
what we consider the highest PR priority
 
01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
dams we've got a capital budget request
 
01:50:58.669 --> 01:50:58.679 align:start position:0%
in for 17 million um and that's where
 
01:51:01.790 --> 01:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
the funding comes from now in the the
 
01:51:03.510 --> 01:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
bill that Senator Murphy is doing an
 
01:51:05.870 --> 01:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
amendment on I think
 
01:51:08.629 --> 01:51:08.639 align:start position:0%
4558 that's the dam maintenance fund
 
01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:10.639 align:start position:0%
which used to be a little more flush
 
01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
with money when the hydro people were
 
01:51:15.189 --> 01:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
paying into it right now their return
 
01:51:17.950 --> 01:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
their rate of return is very low we have
 
01:51:19.790 --> 01:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of people that are opting out of
 
01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
their F license to have Hydro power
 
01:51:27.629 --> 01:51:27.639 align:start position:0%
so the need for funding to repair these
 
01:51:30.229 --> 01:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
has been exacerbated over time and
 
01:51:32.550 --> 01:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
that's why I think 541 is such an
 
01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:40.750 align:start position:0%
that's why I think 541 is such an
important

01:51:40.750 --> 01:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
bill is there any other questions if not
 
01:51:47.350 --> 01:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
we assess the thank you very much thank
 
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
you I will recess the hearing we uh
 
01:51:53.229 --> 01:51:53.239 align:start position:0%
you're seeing an amendment that came in
 
01:51:56.270 --> 01:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
there is an issue with it uh it's being
 
01:51:59.470 --> 01:51:59.480 align:start position:0%
taken care of so we'll recess and uh
 
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
start the hearing on the next uh the
 
01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:04.629 align:start position:0%
start the hearing on the next uh the
next

01:52:04.629 --> 01:52:04.639 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:52:08.030 --> 01:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
bill representative Arby thank you Mr

there was an issue can you yes can you
 
01:52:16.589 --> 01:52:16.599 align:start position:0%
mention that issue uh it's right it's
 
01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
the last page on the amendment you'll
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
see in the bottom it's uh it's it's
 
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
talks about providing funds for loans
 
01:52:28.350 --> 01:52:28.360 align:start position:0%
transfer the dams thank you I just
 
01:52:30.149 --> 01:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that that I that's
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
the one y okay thank you okay yeah that
 
01:52:37.069 --> 01:52:37.079 align:start position:0%
otherwise what we're doing the amendment
 
01:52:40.109 --> 01:52:40.119 align:start position:0%
would not would not have done the job so
 
01:52:44.669 --> 01:52:44.679 align:start position:0%
I will uh I will recess the hearing on
 
01:52:47.149 --> 01:52:47.159 align:start position:0%
uh Senate Bill
 
01:52:51.990 --> 01:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
539 and open the hearing on Senate Bill
 
01:52:55.830 --> 01:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
5 47 relative to certain
 
01:52:57.629 --> 01:52:57.639 align:start position:0%
requirements relative to certain
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
requirements relative to cell chip
 
01:53:02.350 --> 01:53:02.360 align:start position:0%
programs somebody's relatives are really
 
01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:08.510 align:start position:0%
programs somebody's relatives are really
good

01:53:12.589 --> 01:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
any and this is good morning morning so
 
01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0%
there's testimony coming around to you
 
01:53:18.669 --> 01:53:18.679 align:start position:0%
did I get a is our pin card oh oh yeah

out of the senate committee with
 
01:55:14.030 --> 01:55:14.040 align:start position:0%

the experience of serving on the board
 
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%

01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
committee you have any questions of
 
01:56:22.589 --> 01:56:22.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative Darby thank you thank you
 
01:56:30.270 --> 01:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um my first question um maybe
 
01:56:31.830 --> 01:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
let me not say it that way my question
 
01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:33.950 align:start position:0%
let me not say it that way my question
is

01:56:33.950 --> 01:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
um paragraph or uh definition for
 
01:56:40.390 --> 01:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
introduces a term called a historic
 
01:56:44.030 --> 01:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
preservation project it says or uh Farm
 
01:56:47.109 --> 01:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
viability program interestingly uh Farm
 
01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
viability program is defined further
 
01:56:51.470 --> 01:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
down but I searched and searched last
 
01:56:53.589 --> 01:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
night for historic preservation project
 
01:56:55.470 --> 01:56:55.480 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's obvious but I can't find
 
01:56:57.750 --> 01:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
the definition and there does seem to be
 
01:57:00.629 --> 01:57:00.639 align:start position:0%
various terms with respect to Historic
 
01:57:03.030 --> 01:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
and preservation in different as areas
 
01:57:04.069 --> 01:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
statute thank you for the question
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
you're correct there is not a definition
 
01:57:09.390 --> 01:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
for historic preservation project
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
proposed or included in the statute as
 
01:57:14.589 --> 01:57:14.599 align:start position:0%
it currently stands um I could look
 
01:57:16.709 --> 01:57:16.719 align:start position:0%
through the existing statute and show
 
01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:20.719 align:start position:0%
you where um elip is authorized to fund
 
01:57:23.310 --> 01:57:23.320 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation of his hisor buildings
 
01:57:25.030 --> 01:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
and structures and that's what we're
 
01:57:28.229 --> 01:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
referring to there um and I'm not sure
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
if that sufficiently addresses your
 
01:57:33.149 --> 01:57:33.159 align:start position:0%
concern I believe it would be in section
 
01:57:36.790 --> 01:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
one of 227 M follow up thank you Mr
 
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
chair I I did see that
 
01:57:43.830 --> 01:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
actually um my I'm a bit pantic about um
 
01:57:46.189 --> 01:57:46.199 align:start position:0%
you know I guess you'd call me a policy
 
01:57:48.990 --> 01:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
uh geek or whatever but um if that's the
 
01:57:50.790 --> 01:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
intent is there any would be be
 
01:57:55.069 --> 01:57:55.079 align:start position:0%
opposition to defining that term no in
 
01:57:56.910 --> 01:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
statute so that just so that's clear
 
01:57:59.030 --> 01:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
what what the intent is okay thank you
 
01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:01.629 align:start position:0%
what what the intent is okay thank you
very

01:58:01.629 --> 01:58:01.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:05.589 --> 01:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
much any other questions representative
 
01:58:08.030 --> 01:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
wolf thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:58:10.669 --> 01:58:10.679 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um you've
 
01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
stricken out and it's hard to read
 
01:58:16.589 --> 01:58:16.599 align:start position:0%
through this in an asked question but uh
 
01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
you struck out the uh word in
 
01:58:23.390 --> 01:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
line 10 I believe it is term
 
01:58:25.709 --> 01:58:25.719 align:start position:0%
easements you explain why you've
 
01:58:27.910 --> 01:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
stricken that
 
01:58:31.550 --> 01:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
out easement interests in as used in the
 
01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
statute refer to Perpetual easements um
 
01:58:38.750 --> 01:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
and so where in this particular section
 
01:58:40.189 --> 01:58:40.199 align:start position:0%
we're talking about easements that will
 
01:58:42.510 --> 01:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
stand over time in perpetuity and the
 
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
term easement wouldn't necessarily apply
 
01:58:48.550 --> 01:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
in that case so in order to understand
 
01:58:50.069 --> 01:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
that we would look through the rest of
 
01:58:51.870 --> 01:58:51.880 align:start position:0%
the statute for other instances where
 
01:58:54.790 --> 01:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
the term easement interest is applied
 
01:58:57.189 --> 01:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
and that always is for easements that
 
01:58:57.199 --> 01:59:00.149 align:start position:0%
and that always is for easements that
are

01:59:00.149 --> 01:59:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:02.589 --> 01:59:02.599 align:start position:0%
Perpetual follow
 
01:59:07.669 --> 01:59:07.679 align:start position:0%
up thank you so does this mean that El
 
01:59:11.069 --> 01:59:11.079 align:start position:0%
chip will no longer Grant term
 
01:59:14.229 --> 01:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
easements uh no it means that when we
 
01:59:16.390 --> 01:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
are referring to easement interest so
 
01:59:18.189 --> 01:59:18.199 align:start position:0%
for example certain obligations of a
 
01:59:20.270 --> 01:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
grant or certain legal requirements
 
01:59:22.069 --> 01:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
would apply to an easement that is per
 
01:59:25.350 --> 01:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
ual that may not apply to a term
 
01:59:27.390 --> 01:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
easement so we would still be able to
 
01:59:30.910 --> 01:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
fund term easements thank
 
01:59:33.870 --> 01:59:33.880 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
01:59:36.669 --> 01:59:36.679 align:start position:0%
questions the second time representative
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you Mr chair um
 
01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:42.950 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you Mr chair um
I

01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:59:45.870 --> 01:59:45.880 align:start position:0%
um you state you I read the commentary
 
01:59:47.550 --> 01:59:47.560 align:start position:0%
the email that was sent as well so I
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
tried to do some background here but I I
 
01:59:52.270 --> 01:59:52.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't quite track it you it mentioned
 
01:59:56.229 --> 01:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
removing the um the need for a qualif
 
01:59:58.870 --> 01:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
qualifying stewardship plan as part of
 
02:00:02.470 --> 02:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
the uh I'm sorry part application but it
 
02:00:04.069 --> 02:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
was still required I was hoping you
 
02:00:06.109 --> 02:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
could just tell me where it's where in
 
02:00:08.750 --> 02:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
statute it's still required as part of
 
02:00:11.790 --> 02:00:11.800 align:start position:0%
the approval um thank you for the
 
02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
question it is not still required in
 
02:00:17.030 --> 02:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
statute the statute now clarifies that
 
02:00:18.990 --> 02:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
the applicant must demonstrate their
 
02:00:21.149 --> 02:00:21.159 align:start position:0%
capacity demonstrating stewardship
 
02:00:23.589 --> 02:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
capacity can be done in a number of ways
 
02:00:25.390 --> 02:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
first and foremost for land conservation
 
02:00:26.830 --> 02:00:26.840 align:start position:0%
through accreditation with the national
 
02:00:28.709 --> 02:00:28.719 align:start position:0%
land trust Alliance but also through
 
02:00:30.990 --> 02:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
past history we request copies of their
 
02:00:33.069 --> 02:00:33.079 align:start position:0%
policies procedures things of that
 
02:00:35.950 --> 02:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
nature um the change is that we don't
 
02:00:38.030 --> 02:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
require that
 
02:00:40.550 --> 02:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
demonstration through an actual plan
 
02:00:43.149 --> 02:00:43.159 align:start position:0%
created for a specific property before
 
02:00:44.750 --> 02:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
they actually receive the
 
02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
fund and then our program what our
 
02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
program rules with a lowercase are um do
 
02:00:52.870 --> 02:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
require that steward Plan before they
 
02:00:54.790 --> 02:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
receive their final
 
02:01:02.030 --> 02:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
you anyone else before representative
 
02:01:07.750 --> 02:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
Darby goes for the third
 
02:01:10.189 --> 02:01:10.199 align:start position:0%
time representative Darby you got the
 
02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
floor oh no representa
 
02:01:15.830 --> 02:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
wol representative wolf for the second
 
02:01:20.109 --> 02:01:20.119 align:start position:0%
time then representative D thank you um
 
02:01:22.510 --> 02:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
you now have the commission of the
 
02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Business and economic
 
02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:26.910 align:start position:0%
Department of Business and economic
Affairs

02:01:26.910 --> 02:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
Affairs
 
02:01:30.189 --> 02:01:30.199 align:start position:0%
being named in here as opposed to
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
somebody else it used to be the office
 
02:01:34.629 --> 02:01:34.639 align:start position:0%
of planning is there some reason that
 
02:01:36.390 --> 02:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
you went to the office of business
 
02:01:38.589 --> 02:01:38.599 align:start position:0%
because I consider that
 
02:01:41.030 --> 02:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
more a department that is trying to
 
02:01:42.870 --> 02:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
generate funds and bring more people to
 
02:01:45.149 --> 02:01:45.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as opposed to natural and
 
02:01:47.629 --> 02:01:47.639 align:start position:0%
cultural resources which I would think
 
02:01:50.189 --> 02:01:50.199 align:start position:0%
would be I I do understand your question
 
02:01:52.149 --> 02:01:52.159 align:start position:0%
although we didn't make the decision the
 
02:01:53.510 --> 02:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
decision was made when the office of
 
02:01:56.310 --> 02:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
State planning was dissolved that seat
 
02:01:59.950 --> 02:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
moved to Bea um however the design from
 
02:02:02.109 --> 02:02:02.119 align:start position:0%
Bea is the director of the office of
 
02:02:04.669 --> 02:02:04.679 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation development so there
 
02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
is there is a tie there um but that was
 
02:02:08.669 --> 02:02:08.679 align:start position:0%
a decision made I Believe by the
 
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
governor's office when that office was
 
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
dis when State planning was dissolved
 
02:02:15.550 --> 02:02:15.560 align:start position:0%
there were a number of Statute changes
 
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
this one just seems to have
 
02:02:19.830 --> 02:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
slipped under the radar and wasn't made
 
02:02:23.629 --> 02:02:23.639 align:start position:0%
at that time there's a lot of them here
 
02:02:26.589 --> 02:02:26.599 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Darby thank you Mr
 
02:02:30.750 --> 02:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
chair this is my final question um the
 
02:02:34.990 --> 02:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
there's a change with respect to um what
 
02:02:37.669 --> 02:02:37.679 align:start position:0%
it can fund um it it quotes another
 
02:02:41.189 --> 02:02:41.199 align:start position:0%
section of statue and it was you know C
 
02:02:43.149 --> 02:02:43.159 align:start position:0%
through F and it changed through a
 
02:02:46.830 --> 02:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
through g g in the in the testimony that
 
02:02:49.149 --> 02:02:49.159 align:start position:0%
was received or in the email that was
 
02:02:50.669 --> 02:02:50.679 align:start position:0%
received I thought it said that there's
 
02:02:53.109 --> 02:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
no change in what it was able to fund
 
02:02:56.390 --> 02:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
but the the bill I didn't understand
 
02:02:58.669 --> 02:02:58.679 align:start position:0%
that statement with respect to the
 
02:03:01.350 --> 02:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
expansion of the you know the sub
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
paragraphs absolutely thank you for the
 
02:03:04.870 --> 02:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
question I'd have to go back and look at
 
02:03:07.830 --> 02:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
the a through G I'm not sure if the C
 
02:03:09.629 --> 02:03:09.639 align:start position:0%
reference originally was a mistake I do
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the full statute I could
 
02:03:13.430 --> 02:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
look that up but the expansion of one
 
02:03:16.149 --> 02:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
bullet point is moving a contribution to
 
02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
a stewardship fund from a later
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
paragraph of the statute and including
 
02:03:23.870 --> 02:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
it in the list of eligible expenses it
 
02:03:25.629 --> 02:03:25.639 align:start position:0%
was an eligible expense but it was
 
02:03:28.629 --> 02:03:28.639 align:start position:0%
referenced later and only as a non-ash
 
02:03:32.270 --> 02:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
expense which as we know when um an
 
02:03:33.790 --> 02:03:33.800 align:start position:0%
organization is fundraising for a
 
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
project they are raising cash to put
 
02:03:38.830 --> 02:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
into an endowment for stewardship so it
 
02:03:42.549 --> 02:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
there was a disconnect in the statute as
 
02:03:42.559 --> 02:03:44.830 align:start position:0%
there was a disconnect in the statute as
previously

02:03:44.830 --> 02:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
previously
 
02:03:47.310 --> 02:03:47.320 align:start position:0%
written and I can look I do have a copy
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
of the FB I can look and see what the C
 
02:04:01.510 --> 02:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:05.390 --> 02:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
I just um from your perspective you
 
02:04:09.189 --> 02:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be increasing what um El would
 
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
be pay be paying for if the intent is to
 
02:04:14.589 --> 02:04:14.599 align:start position:0%
is to keep the the you know the the
 
02:04:16.549 --> 02:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
funds available for the same purposes
 
02:04:18.310 --> 02:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely correct we are trying
 
02:04:20.069 --> 02:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
to Simply clarify it so when the
 
02:04:22.030 --> 02:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
potential applicant reads the list see
 
02:04:25.390 --> 02:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
the entire list okay thank you maybe
 
02:04:27.709 --> 02:04:27.719 align:start position:0%
maybe when I ask you about some language
 
02:04:30.310 --> 02:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
for my other amendment I can ask about
 
02:04:34.470 --> 02:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:38.149 --> 02:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
you anyone else have any questions
 
02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
before we go back to representative wolf
 
02:04:42.310 --> 02:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
I don't see any new
 
02:04:45.470 --> 02:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
hands representative wolf thank you for
 
02:04:48.990 --> 02:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
taking the question on uh bottom of page
 
02:04:52.750 --> 02:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
two you've uh restricted out appraise
 
02:04:54.629 --> 02:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
market value of the
 
02:04:54.639 --> 02:04:57.030 align:start position:0%
market value of the
property

02:04:57.030 --> 02:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:05:01.109 --> 02:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
um and put in a a percentage of the
 
02:05:04.229 --> 02:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
funds that were required for the project
 
02:05:04.239 --> 02:05:05.430 align:start position:0%
funds that were required for the project
now

02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:05:11.430 --> 02:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
if a gift of a historic resource is
 
02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
presented and there's
 
02:05:18.790 --> 02:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
no you can't use that for um
 
02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
funding is that what you're saying this
 
02:05:25.270 --> 02:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
is a it's a seemingly easy question with
 
02:05:27.149 --> 02:05:27.159 align:start position:0%
a very complicated answer but I will do
 
02:05:29.790 --> 02:05:29.800 align:start position:0%
my best the full fair market value of a
 
02:05:32.910 --> 02:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
project of a property being acquired is
 
02:05:35.830 --> 02:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
eligible however if the purchase price
 
02:05:39.030 --> 02:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
is less than that amount the donated
 
02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
value is considered a non-cash
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
contribution to the project so the total
 
02:05:49.310 --> 02:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
cost of the project remains $100 but if
 
02:05:51.870 --> 02:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
$10 in property value were being being
 
02:05:54.390 --> 02:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
donated we consider that a contribution
 
02:05:56.990 --> 02:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
from another source to the project so we
 
02:06:00.750 --> 02:06:00.760 align:start position:0%
won't we will not um reimburse for that
 
02:06:03.790 --> 02:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
donated value but the total project
 
02:06:06.430 --> 02:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
value Remains the full fair market value
 
02:06:08.549 --> 02:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to meet with you uh and
 
02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
go through it I I it's incredibly
 
02:06:13.950 --> 02:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
complicated and that change intends to
 
02:06:16.149 --> 02:06:16.159 align:start position:0%
simplify exactly what you just pointed
 
02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
out so that applicants can understand
 
02:06:23.149 --> 02:06:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
any other questions for our
 
02:06:29.510 --> 02:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
speakers don't see
 
02:06:32.990 --> 02:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
anyone you have your mic
 
02:06:35.549 --> 02:06:35.559 align:start position:0%
on I guess no more questions thank you
 
02:06:37.229 --> 02:06:37.239 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony and if I
 
02:06:39.470 --> 02:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
can remind you if you can fill out a
 
02:06:43.310 --> 02:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
pink card thank you is there anyone else
 
02:06:48.830 --> 02:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
to speak on SB 547 SB
 
02:06:51.310 --> 02:06:51.320 align:start position:0%
547 I'll ask one more time anyone else
 
02:07:01.149 --> 02:07:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
547 who you
 
02:07:13.870 --> 02:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
I we're waiting a moment before we call
 
02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
the next hearing I thank all the people
 
02:07:20.830 --> 02:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
that I'm sure are here for the wake
 
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
surfing uh we're trying to decide about
 
02:07:31.069 --> 02:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:34.629 --> 02:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
heard let me just ask representative har
 
02:07:37.069 --> 02:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could find out if people are
 
02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
feeling pretty much unanimously that we
 
02:07:41.229 --> 02:07:41.239 align:start position:0%
can exec this will we take an informal
 
02:07:43.830 --> 02:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
poll here as as those of you here but
 
02:07:46.709 --> 02:07:46.719 align:start position:0%
the public may not know um although it's
 
02:07:50.229 --> 02:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
not on for exing if the minority and
 
02:07:53.189 --> 02:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
majority leaders say let's exact we can
 
02:07:55.589 --> 02:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
exact this bill but we don't want to cut
 
02:07:57.790 --> 02:07:57.800 align:start position:0%
anyone off for anything that they may
 
02:08:00.549 --> 02:08:00.559 align:start position:0%
wish to do so does anyone have an
 
02:08:04.950 --> 02:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:04.960 --> 02:08:10.270 align:start position:0%
 
bill

02:08:10.270 --> 02:08:10.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:13.549 --> 02:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
547 representative Darby yeah we're
 
02:08:15.950 --> 02:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
talking about the El bill right yes yeah
 
02:08:19.270 --> 02:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
one we just heard right I I think that
 
02:08:20.950 --> 02:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
that one term needs to be CL needs to be
 
02:08:23.790 --> 02:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
added like I like I suggested and I'd
 
02:08:26.709 --> 02:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
like I want to get a clarification
 
02:08:30.189 --> 02:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
on um section
 
02:08:33.750 --> 02:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
three okay guess we
 
02:08:36.390 --> 02:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
won't so in deference to representative
 
02:08:38.669 --> 02:08:38.679 align:start position:0%
Derby we won't EXA this bill so we'll
 
02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
probably be coming back I don't I
 
02:08:43.270 --> 02:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
haven't scheduled next week but we'll
 
02:08:45.069 --> 02:08:45.079 align:start position:0%
come back for this it's not an early
 
02:08:48.189 --> 02:08:48.199 align:start position:0%
bill but we need to get it done um so if
 
02:08:51.629 --> 02:08:51.639 align:start position:0%
there's no one else to testify on SB 547
 
02:08:55.549 --> 02:08:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:57.830 --> 02:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
hearing and I think we're still waiting
 
02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
for the amendment on 539 to correct the
 
02:09:05.229 --> 02:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
amendment that we got so we'll continue
 
02:09:08.030 --> 02:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
since we have uh people to speak in
 
02:09:11.629 --> 02:09:11.639 align:start position:0%

don't think I've ever been in front of
 
02:09:31.310 --> 02:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
this committee before in my seven eight
 
02:09:32.910 --> 02:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
years in the house in the legislature
 
02:09:35.310 --> 02:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
now uh so for the record I'm Senator Tim
 
02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
Lang I'm the state senator from District
 
02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
2 I'm the prime sponsor of SP 431 and I
 
02:09:43.310 --> 02:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate the bipartisan Senate and
 
02:09:44.350 --> 02:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
House members who have helped me
 
02:09:46.750 --> 02:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor this bill um the Senate
 
02:09:48.189 --> 02:09:48.199 align:start position:0%
passed this bill on a
 
02:09:52.189 --> 02:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
bipartisan um Voice vote this bill seeks
 
02:09:53.549 --> 02:09:53.559 align:start position:0%
to address an issue that's come before
 
02:09:55.229 --> 02:09:55.239 align:start position:0%
the legislature time and time again in
 
02:09:57.030 --> 02:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
the past as it relates to the very
 
02:10:00.589 --> 02:10:00.599 align:start position:0%
popular family water sport wake surfing
 
02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
the sport has been around for more than
 
02:10:03.709 --> 02:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
a decade and it's popular among
 
02:10:05.709 --> 02:10:05.719 align:start position:0%
recreational boating families in New
 
02:10:08.229 --> 02:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire some Shore phone owners have
 
02:10:11.629 --> 02:10:11.639 align:start position:0%
sought to restrict or outright ban the
 
02:10:13.589 --> 02:10:13.599 align:start position:0%
sport of wake surfing because they are
 
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
concerned about possible erosion on a
 
02:10:17.950 --> 02:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
shoreline so what does this bill do why
 
02:10:20.069 --> 02:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
are we here this bill is a compromise
 
02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
Bill we were trying to reach a
 
02:10:24.030 --> 02:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable measure recognizing the uh
 
02:10:26.030 --> 02:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
science around shoreline erosion at the
 
02:10:27.750 --> 02:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
same time not looking to do a ban
 
02:10:29.830 --> 02:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
because that's not the New Hampshire way
 
02:10:31.149 --> 02:10:31.159 align:start position:0%
uh so trying to find a reasonable
 
02:10:33.390 --> 02:10:33.400 align:start position:0%
compromise what this bill does is it
 
02:10:35.870 --> 02:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
establishes a 200 foot setback for the
 
02:10:38.830 --> 02:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
people uh participating in wake surfing
 
02:10:40.830 --> 02:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
um its best practices and scientific
 
02:10:42.510 --> 02:10:42.520 align:start position:0%
Studies have shown that a 200 foot
 
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
setback is appropriate and minimally
 
02:10:47.589 --> 02:10:47.599 align:start position:0%
restrictive it is fur it it further
 
02:10:49.549 --> 02:10:49.559 align:start position:0%
pushes back from current boting for
 
02:10:51.790 --> 02:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
regular boting which is 150 F feet so it
 
02:10:54.669 --> 02:10:54.679 align:start position:0%
adds 50 ft um the second provision of
 
02:10:56.629 --> 02:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
the bill is it it it requires an
 
02:10:59.629 --> 02:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
education component on the on the behalf
 
02:11:01.470 --> 02:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
of the Marine Patrol the department of
 
02:11:04.229 --> 02:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
safety to um include the ability for
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
Wake server uh for boers to push the
 
02:11:10.430 --> 02:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
that can push the Wake the surf wake to
 
02:11:12.109 --> 02:11:12.119 align:start position:0%
away into the center of the lake versus
 
02:11:14.470 --> 02:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
the edge of the shore and the department
 
02:11:16.189 --> 02:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
said they have the ability to include
 
02:11:17.910 --> 02:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
this information one of the other things
 
02:11:21.790 --> 02:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
it does is it limits um the boting
 
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
activity to only Lakes over um 50 acres
 
02:11:28.350 --> 02:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
so as I don't have to tell your
 
02:11:29.830 --> 02:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
committee public Body Waters over 10
 
02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
acres are held in the public trust by
 
02:11:35.790 --> 02:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
the state um for all people in the state
 
02:11:37.790 --> 02:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
um to enjoy it's our duty protect all
 
02:11:40.629 --> 02:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
that a the public access as well as both
 
02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
the environmental and econ economy that
 
02:11:45.310 --> 02:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
are important in Hampshire Senate Bill
 
02:11:48.990 --> 02:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
431 seeks that a greater buffer not a
 
02:11:51.350 --> 02:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
ban on wake surfing
 
02:11:52.750 --> 02:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people behind me I'm
 
02:11:54.910 --> 02:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
sure you've got a few dozen cards back
 
02:11:56.790 --> 02:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
there so I will take questions but
 
02:11:58.069 --> 02:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
understand depending on what your
 
02:11:59.430 --> 02:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
questions are there may be way more
 
02:12:01.310 --> 02:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
smarter people behind me to answer very
 
02:12:03.589 --> 02:12:03.599 align:start position:0%
particular questions so I thank you for
 
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony again um I I I'm
 
02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:09.599 align:start position:0%
hoping to put this issue to bed uh so we
 
02:12:10.830 --> 02:12:10.840 align:start position:0%
don't have to keep having the same bill
 
02:12:12.629 --> 02:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
come in over and over again in different
 
02:12:12.639 --> 02:12:15.589 align:start position:0%
come in over and over again in different
forms

02:12:15.589 --> 02:12:15.599 align:start position:0%
forms
 
02:12:18.910 --> 02:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm still reaching for your card
 
02:12:21.910 --> 02:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
sorry it I said
 
02:12:23.629 --> 02:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
remember to do on well after three terms
 
02:12:24.870 --> 02:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
in the house you would think but more
 
02:12:27.950 --> 02:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
and more times I forget in than Senator
 
02:12:29.430 --> 02:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
any questions for the senator
 
02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:30.669 align:start position:0%
any questions for the senator
representative

02:12:30.669 --> 02:12:30.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:12:33.189 --> 02:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
McHugh thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:12:35.310 --> 02:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
Senator thanks for bring Tim hello yeah
 
02:12:36.629 --> 02:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
fellow Tim nice to see you thanks for
 
02:12:39.270 --> 02:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill um did the Senate
 
02:12:42.390 --> 02:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
committee consider the impact or
 
02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
considering like 300 feet or any 300
 
02:12:47.069 --> 02:12:47.079 align:start position:0%
foot restriction instead of 200 or any
 
02:12:48.830 --> 02:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
depth restrictions in the process
 
02:12:50.310 --> 02:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you for the question so
 
02:12:52.950 --> 02:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
again we did look at lots of options uh
 
02:12:57.270 --> 02:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
the outright ban 500t 300 ft again this
 
02:12:59.950 --> 02:12:59.960 align:start position:0%
this bill this U because we amended it
 
02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
um from the original how I originally
 
02:13:03.870 --> 02:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
put it in and so we we did things like
 
02:13:06.390 --> 02:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
50 acres or larger right so one of the
 
02:13:07.669 --> 02:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
things you have to think about while
 
02:13:10.189 --> 02:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
you're discussing this is that as you
 
02:13:12.189 --> 02:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
restrict from the lake Edge you're
 
02:13:13.870 --> 02:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
narrowing the channel That all these
 
02:13:15.350 --> 02:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
boats are going to be acting in so you
 
02:13:18.229 --> 02:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
Inc you almost decrease safety right so
 
02:13:19.790 --> 02:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
it's one of the reasons why if you go
 
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
too far in you're going to create a very
 
02:13:24.030 --> 02:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
narrow channel where the uh the sport is
 
02:13:25.750 --> 02:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
able to do and then you're going to just
 
02:13:27.390 --> 02:13:27.400 align:start position:0%
increase the density of the boats in
 
02:13:29.870 --> 02:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
that area which reduces the safety so
 
02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
taking all of that into consideration
 
02:13:34.709 --> 02:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
the 200 foot uh seemed to be the most uh
 
02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
place where we found consensus again it
 
02:13:38.950 --> 02:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
was a bipartisan vote in the Senate to
 
02:13:41.430 --> 02:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
pass this bill I believe it was four to
 
02:13:44.229 --> 02:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
one out of the committee uh bipartisan
 
02:13:45.669 --> 02:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
02:13:48.990 --> 02:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
you represent Rong yeah thank you Mr
 
02:13:50.430 --> 02:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you senator for taking
 
02:13:52.149 --> 02:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
my question you mentioned in your
 
02:13:55.149 --> 02:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
remarks that the 200 ft was based on
 
02:13:57.790 --> 02:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
several scientific studies or you you
 
02:13:59.430 --> 02:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
plural do do you know what studies those
 
02:14:01.830 --> 02:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
are I did read them I don't remember off
 
02:14:03.510 --> 02:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
the top that who was the ones that did
 
02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
the study but I'm sure there are people
 
02:14:06.069 --> 02:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
behind me that can answer that question
 
02:14:07.709 --> 02:14:07.719 align:start position:0%
for you but I did read the study there
 
02:14:09.270 --> 02:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
was one that was presented to me and we
 
02:14:11.149 --> 02:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
looked at and and had the 200 ft we also
 
02:14:14.270 --> 02:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
looked at the 500 foot again we go back
 
02:14:16.950 --> 02:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
to you're balancing not only the erosion
 
02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
but the safety aspect and so the 200t is
 
02:14:22.470 --> 02:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
where we found that we we allow for both
 
02:14:24.149 --> 02:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
taking into account reducing the
 
02:14:25.790 --> 02:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
shoreline erosion but at the same time
 
02:14:27.229 --> 02:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
not creating a safety Problem by
 
02:14:29.790 --> 02:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
narrowing the the field too much okay
 
02:14:32.589 --> 02:14:32.599 align:start position:0%
followup Mr follow up so um when you
 
02:14:34.229 --> 02:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
were reviewing the studies there was
 
02:14:36.669 --> 02:14:36.679 align:start position:0%
just one for 200 or were there multiple
 
02:14:39.030 --> 02:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
no I read actually I read two and I also
 
02:14:40.709 --> 02:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
but I also read a 300 and I think I read
 
02:14:43.149 --> 02:14:43.159 align:start position:0%
a 500 as well so I read multiple B
 
02:14:45.470 --> 02:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
multiple studies um and but how we got
 
02:14:47.109 --> 02:14:47.119 align:start position:0%
the 200 200 was everybody looking at all
 
02:14:48.750 --> 02:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
of them and deciding this was the
 
02:14:52.430 --> 02:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate action okay thank you
 
02:14:54.149 --> 02:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
representative Derby thank you thank you
 
02:14:55.950 --> 02:14:55.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you senator for taking my
 
02:14:58.510 --> 02:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
question um as I understand it you are
 
02:14:59.830 --> 02:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
represent the Lakes Region as well
 
02:15:02.270 --> 02:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
correct and so I'm wondering if you have
 
02:15:07.069 --> 02:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
received any um any concerns about um
 
02:15:10.470 --> 02:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
erosion or water quality um related to
 
02:15:13.030 --> 02:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
wake surfing from your constituents
 
02:15:14.709 --> 02:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question so yes i' i'
 
02:15:16.390 --> 02:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
I've heard from both sides in The Lakes
 
02:15:17.990 --> 02:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
Region there are people very much in
 
02:15:19.470 --> 02:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
support of this bill and there are
 
02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
people people who don't want us to touch
 
02:15:22.870 --> 02:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
it at all just leave it the way it is
 
02:15:23.870 --> 02:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
and there are people that just want an
 
02:15:25.549 --> 02:15:25.559 align:start position:0%
outright band so I've heard from all
 
02:15:27.270 --> 02:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
spectrums uh relative to this bill as
 
02:15:29.790 --> 02:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor um again I think this
 
02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
bill was a compromise bill it's a way to
 
02:15:34.109 --> 02:15:34.119 align:start position:0%
recognize the shore erosion take some
 
02:15:36.430 --> 02:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
action to protect as our duty of of here
 
02:15:37.790 --> 02:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
in the state is to protect our
 
02:15:39.870 --> 02:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
Waterfront but not make it so
 
02:15:42.669 --> 02:15:42.679 align:start position:0%
restrictive that we impinge upon people
 
02:15:46.310 --> 02:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:48.910 --> 02:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
well anyone else to have a question for
 
02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
the senator
 
02:15:55.390 --> 02:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you Senator thanks
 
02:15:58.189 --> 02:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
guys so as my chair always says we're
 
02:16:00.270 --> 02:16:00.280 align:start position:0%
going to alternate between those opposed
 
02:16:03.750 --> 02:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
and those in favor um speaking in
 
02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
vog good afternoon uh Mr chair and
 
02:16:20.310 --> 02:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
my name is har Vogel I am the senior

lon preservation committee uh I thank
 
02:16:28.229 --> 02:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to voice lpc's
 
02:16:31.229 --> 02:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
opposition to Senate Bill 431 which
 
02:16:32.750 --> 02:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
would set what evidence clearly
 
02:16:35.070 --> 02:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
demonstrates are inadequate limits on
 
02:16:36.910 --> 02:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
wake surfing on New Hampshire

potential impacts to loons we emphasize
 
02:16:50.910 --> 02:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
the following reasons that we oppose
 
02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:51.990 align:start position:0%
the following reasons that we oppose
cill

02:16:51.990 --> 02:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
cill
 
02:16:54.509 --> 02:16:54.519 align:start position:0%
431 the first is that Lon Nest can be
 
02:16:57.110 --> 02:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
destroyed by wave of action loons are
 
02:16:59.309 --> 02:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
adapted to swimming and Diving and
 
02:17:01.150 --> 02:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
rather than walking they move with
 
02:17:03.389 --> 02:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
difficulty on land and therefore they
 
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
always Nest right at the water's edge
 
02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
waves from boat wakes can wash over loon
 
02:17:11.030 --> 02:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
nests causing them to fail in some cases
 
02:17:12.469 --> 02:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
nesting is when loons are most
 
02:17:15.270 --> 02:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and over 40% of New Hampshire
 
02:17:17.230 --> 02:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
Lun nests fail from various causes
 
02:17:19.669 --> 02:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
despite our best efforts to protect them
 
02:17:21.429 --> 02:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
intensive management of nest sites has
 
02:17:23.709 --> 02:17:23.719 align:start position:0%
been needed to continue the hard one and
 
02:17:25.709 --> 02:17:25.719 align:start position:0%
ongoing recovery of loons which remain a
 
02:17:27.790 --> 02:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
threatened species uh in the
 
02:17:30.349 --> 02:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
state we disagree with the 200 foot
 
02:17:32.629 --> 02:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
standard proposed in Senate Bill 431
 
02:17:34.469 --> 02:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
because it is not supported by any
 
02:17:37.110 --> 02:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
reputable study the primary study that
 
02:17:39.110 --> 02:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
recommended that standard which was
 
02:17:40.589 --> 02:17:40.599 align:start position:0%
funded by the national Marine
 
02:17:43.270 --> 02:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturers Association was based on
 
02:17:45.589 --> 02:17:45.599 align:start position:0%
computer models that the authors
 
02:17:48.549 --> 02:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
themselves stated are not accurate at
 
02:17:50.309 --> 02:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
distances of more than three boat
 
02:17:53.469 --> 02:17:53.479 align:start position:0%
lengths and of no value at more than 100
 
02:17:56.469 --> 02:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
ft from the boat their unsubstantiated
 
02:17:58.309 --> 02:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation for the 200t standard is
 
02:18:00.669 --> 02:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
an outlier among other wake surfing
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
studies which recommend minimum
 
02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
protective zones of up to a th000 feet
 
02:18:07.870 --> 02:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
or more wake surfing studies that use
 
02:18:09.830 --> 02:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
actual field measurements site wave
 
02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
heights and wave energy that are
 
02:18:13.629 --> 02:18:13.639 align:start position:0%
significantly greater than other forms
 
02:18:15.509 --> 02:18:15.519 align:start position:0%
of boating so for example water
 
02:18:17.230 --> 02:18:17.240 align:start position:0%
environmental Consultants found that
 
02:18:20.030 --> 02:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
wake surfing produced a greater than 7in
 
02:18:24.629 --> 02:18:24.639 align:start position:0%
high wave at 500 ft distance and a
 
02:18:27.349 --> 02:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
49% increase in wave energy compared to
 
02:18:29.830 --> 02:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
a cruising boat a wave of this height
 
02:18:32.110 --> 02:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
and power would easily swamp many luness
 
02:18:33.389 --> 02:18:33.399 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire which are typically
 
02:18:36.110 --> 02:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
less than 6 Ines above the water
 
02:18:38.790 --> 02:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
line in the Senate testimony for this
 
02:18:40.750 --> 02:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
bill I heard lobbyist say that loons are
 
02:18:42.950 --> 02:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
doing fine in New Hampshire and the real
 
02:18:44.990 --> 02:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
problem for loons is lead fishing lead
 
02:18:47.429 --> 02:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
fishing tackle and I agree that lead
 
02:18:49.309 --> 02:18:49.319 align:start position:0%
tackle continues to kill loons in New
 
02:18:51.030 --> 02:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we've already lost one from
 
02:18:53.589 --> 02:18:53.599 align:start position:0%
tackle this year but loons are facing
 
02:18:55.950 --> 02:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
many threats not just one and wake
 
02:18:57.669 --> 02:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
sports are impacting the recovery of
 
02:19:00.150 --> 02:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
this threatened and much loved species
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
we experienced no growth in Lon paars
 
02:19:04.709 --> 02:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
last year and we had a record number of
 
02:19:06.549 --> 02:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
Nest failures including a record number
 
02:19:09.509 --> 02:19:09.519 align:start position:0%
of failures from flooded nests a 200
 
02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.519 align:start position:0%
foot no wake Sport Zone represents only
 
02:19:13.389 --> 02:19:13.399 align:start position:0%
a token increase in the existing New
 
02:19:15.389 --> 02:19:15.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no wake zone and that
 
02:19:17.790 --> 02:19:17.800 align:start position:0%
historical standard was created over 60
 
02:19:19.910 --> 02:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
years ago long before there was wake
 
02:19:22.509 --> 02:19:22.519 align:start position:0%
surfing on new Hampshire Lakes wake
 
02:19:25.110 --> 02:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
boats and wake surfing are by Design
 
02:19:26.830 --> 02:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
categorically different than the
 
02:19:28.389 --> 02:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
recreational boating that prompted our
 
02:19:31.030 --> 02:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
original no wake regulations the
 
02:19:32.990 --> 02:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
proposed 200 foot distance is not nearly
 
02:19:34.629 --> 02:19:34.639 align:start position:0%
enough to protect lons from those much
 
02:19:36.589 --> 02:19:36.599 align:start position:0%
higher and more powerful
 
02:19:38.509 --> 02:19:38.519 align:start position:0%
waves we're also concerned about
 
02:19:40.870 --> 02:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
shoreline erosion and water quality
 
02:19:42.870 --> 02:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
loons are visual hunters and they need
 
02:19:45.429 --> 02:19:45.439 align:start position:0%
clean clear water to catch fish the
 
02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
potential for wake surfing to increase
 
02:19:49.150 --> 02:19:49.160 align:start position:0%
shoreline erosion and turbidity of our
 
02:19:51.270 --> 02:19:51.280 align:start position:0%

02:19:53.389 --> 02:19:53.399 align:start position:0%

02:19:56.630 --> 02:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
sites and food New Hampshire's 150t no
 
02:19:58.429 --> 02:19:58.439 align:start position:0%
zone is provided an important buffer to
 
02:20:00.550 --> 02:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
protect our shorelines from erosion
 
02:20:02.830 --> 02:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
today a much more significant buffer is
 
02:20:04.830 --> 02:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
needed to guard against a significantly
 
02:20:07.270 --> 02:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
bigger and more energetic waves created
 
02:20:09.830 --> 02:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
by wake surfing we support efforts to
 
02:20:11.550 --> 02:20:11.560 align:start position:0%
provide those needed protections for
 
02:20:13.150 --> 02:20:13.160 align:start position:0%
lakes and loons and we oppose the
 
02:20:15.349 --> 02:20:15.359 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr B
 
02:20:56.870 --> 02:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question yes I actually
 
02:21:00.670 --> 02:21:00.680 align:start position:0%
have two one um you've talked about the
 
02:21:04.110 --> 02:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
danger to loons even with it with 200
 
02:21:06.270 --> 02:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
for their nesting yes um and you've
 
02:21:10.349 --> 02:21:10.359 align:start position:0%
talked about the turbidity of um you
 
02:21:13.270 --> 02:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
know the water that's created from like
 
02:21:15.510 --> 02:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
you know the erosion and loons being
 
02:21:18.830 --> 02:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
unable to look for food um are there any
 
02:21:22.230 --> 02:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
dangers to loons if uh with wake boats
 
02:21:24.710 --> 02:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
just like being in the middle like even
 
02:21:28.590 --> 02:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
you know more than 300 ft from Shore or
 
02:21:30.429 --> 02:21:30.439 align:start position:0%
any of those dangers that you've talked
 
02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
about would they still exist 300 feet
 
02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
from Shore yes thank thank you for the
 
02:21:37.349 --> 02:21:37.359 align:start position:0%
question so um my understanding is that
 
02:21:39.110 --> 02:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
wake boats in the in the action of wake
 
02:21:40.590 --> 02:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
surfing are actually moving fairly
 
02:21:41.910 --> 02:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
slowly that's one of the things that
 
02:21:43.510 --> 02:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
allows them to create these tremendous
 
02:21:46.710 --> 02:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
waves um and and so while we lose loons
 
02:21:48.150 --> 02:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
every year from collisions with
 
02:21:50.990 --> 02:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
motorboats and and jet skis I would
 
02:21:52.750 --> 02:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
expect that there will probably be less
 
02:21:54.790 --> 02:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
of a danger from a wake booat you know
 
02:21:58.190 --> 02:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
moving at that slow speed than from from
 
02:21:59.990 --> 02:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
a motorboat speeding along the surface
 
02:22:01.710 --> 02:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
of of the water there's been some
 
02:22:03.469 --> 02:22:03.479 align:start position:0%
suggestion that these huge wakes can
 
02:22:05.309 --> 02:22:05.319 align:start position:0%
actually separate you know loon chicks
 
02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
from adults and the process of of
 
02:22:09.230 --> 02:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
feeding and cause of separation of
 
02:22:11.910 --> 02:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
family um I think that there might be
 
02:22:13.510 --> 02:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
some truth to that but I'm not sure that
 
02:22:21.150 --> 02:22:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:24.190 --> 02:22:24.200 align:start position:0%
sentive Hoy thank you for taking my
 
02:22:28.150 --> 02:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
question uh have you uh discussed
 
02:22:31.349 --> 02:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
anything relative to the depth of the
 
02:22:35.349 --> 02:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
water that wake boats are being used
 
02:22:37.790 --> 02:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
in uh yes thank you for the for the
 
02:22:39.950 --> 02:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
question and and again my understanding
 
02:22:42.110 --> 02:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
from previous testimony is that in order
 
02:22:44.110 --> 02:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
to create a large wave you actually
 
02:22:46.030 --> 02:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
probably want to be over fairly deep
 
02:22:48.510 --> 02:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
water in terms of of doing that and so I
 
02:22:51.389 --> 02:22:51.399 align:start position:0%
think to to some extent uh wake Surfers
 
02:22:53.830 --> 02:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
may be self- selecting for deeper areas
 
02:22:56.349 --> 02:22:56.359 align:start position:0%
of of the water but I've also heard that
 
02:22:58.389 --> 02:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
the the aspect of the boat and the prop
 
02:23:00.190 --> 02:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
wash can probably reach down a little
 
02:23:02.389 --> 02:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
bit further uh you know into into the
 
02:23:05.830 --> 02:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
depth of of the water as well so um
 
02:23:08.070 --> 02:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
again that's not really my area of of
 
02:23:10.070 --> 02:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
expertise um really at The Loon
 
02:23:12.110 --> 02:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
preservation Committee in terms of loons
 
02:23:14.349 --> 02:23:14.359 align:start position:0%
we are most concerned with the setback
 
02:23:17.349 --> 02:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
you know of of 500 ft you know being an
 
02:23:19.349 --> 02:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
absolute minimum and even at 500 feet
 
02:23:21.469 --> 02:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
we're losing Lun nest you know to to
 
02:23:24.550 --> 02:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
these wakes um every every departure you
 
02:23:27.550 --> 02:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
know every minimizing of that 500 feet
 
02:23:31.590 --> 02:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:35.389 --> 02:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
lost representative Darby thank you and
 
02:23:37.830 --> 02:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
representative um thank you Mr gole for
 
02:23:42.469 --> 02:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh you mentioned um
 
02:23:45.309 --> 02:23:45.319 align:start position:0%
you know reputable studies and so I I
 
02:23:50.230 --> 02:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
also read um the study referred to as um
 
02:23:53.590 --> 02:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh the sorry I have it right here the
 
02:23:55.910 --> 02:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
numerical study of the impact of wake
 
02:23:59.710 --> 02:23:59.720 align:start position:0%
surfing on Inland bodies of water um and
 
02:24:02.550 --> 02:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
it was published by uh a group called
 
02:24:06.590 --> 02:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
the scientific research uh publishing uh
 
02:24:09.750 --> 02:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
organization um which I doing a little
 
02:24:12.349 --> 02:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
research on that seems to be um based
 
02:24:16.190 --> 02:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
out of China and um a paper um
 
02:24:19.990 --> 02:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
publish uh um uh Journal so I was
 
02:24:23.030 --> 02:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
wondering um if what what was the
 
02:24:25.230 --> 02:24:25.240 align:start position:0%
criteria when you discounted that as a
 
02:24:29.030 --> 02:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
non-reputable study yeah so um I have
 
02:24:33.389 --> 02:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
read several um uh responses retorts to
 
02:24:35.550 --> 02:24:35.560 align:start position:0%
to that study roundly criticizing that
 
02:24:38.429 --> 02:24:38.439 align:start position:0%
that study um I think that the um the
 
02:24:40.429 --> 02:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
conclusions from the study do not bear
 
02:24:42.030 --> 02:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
any relation to the 200 foot
 
02:24:44.469 --> 02:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
recommendation and again um when the
 
02:24:46.550 --> 02:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
wave that's produced by that boat you
 
02:24:48.870 --> 02:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
know is is um not accurate at more than
 
02:24:50.910 --> 02:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
three boat lengths and and the authors
 
02:24:53.150 --> 02:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
themselves State you know there is no
 
02:24:55.309 --> 02:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
predictive value to wave height after
 
02:24:57.990 --> 02:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
when you get 100 feet away uh I'm I'm
 
02:24:59.429 --> 02:24:59.439 align:start position:0%
such just not certain how they could
 
02:25:01.590 --> 02:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
come up with a 200 foot you know uh
 
02:25:03.429 --> 02:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
limit from that based on the data it
 
02:25:04.990 --> 02:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
seems that the conclusions that they
 
02:25:07.349 --> 02:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
come are drawn from other studies you
 
02:25:09.070 --> 02:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
know and again these are dubious Francis
 
02:25:10.670 --> 02:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
at all and I believe that I have
 
02:25:12.150 --> 02:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
citations for all of these studies and
 
02:25:14.469 --> 02:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
the testimony that that I provided did
 
02:25:16.710 --> 02:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
an overview you know a meta analysis of
 
02:25:19.469 --> 02:25:19.479 align:start position:0%
all these studies um that's often done
 
02:25:20.910 --> 02:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
in science when there are these
 
02:25:22.710 --> 02:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
apparently contradictory results and
 
02:25:23.830 --> 02:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
what this what the authors are
 
02:25:25.830 --> 02:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
attempting to do is is find out what's
 
02:25:27.950 --> 02:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
the consensus amongst all these studies
 
02:25:30.710 --> 02:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
and which are outliers and and you know
 
02:25:33.630 --> 02:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
the um that study the 200 foot uh
 
02:25:36.269 --> 02:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
reference is clearly an outlier in those
 
02:25:39.309 --> 02:25:39.319 align:start position:0%
studies and and you know um done as you
 
02:25:41.349 --> 02:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
know created as as it is or funded by
 
02:25:43.030 --> 02:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
the wig sport you know industry the
 
02:25:45.710 --> 02:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
Marine manufacturers uh trade I I kind
 
02:25:47.550 --> 02:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
of question the motives one of the
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
things that I found interesting with
 
02:25:50.590 --> 02:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
that study is that throughout that paper
 
02:25:52.630 --> 02:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
if you read it rather than use the term
 
02:25:55.309 --> 02:25:55.319 align:start position:0%
planning they use the term planning and
 
02:25:58.990 --> 02:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
and so I question any um uh uh any
 
02:26:01.230 --> 02:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
critical review of that article before
 
02:26:03.030 --> 02:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
it was published frankly I think that
 
02:26:04.429 --> 02:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
the Publishers ought to be ashamed of
 
02:26:05.830 --> 02:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
themselves for for publishing that it
 
02:26:08.070 --> 02:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
has no scientific value whatsoever thank
 
02:26:09.870 --> 02:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
you very much in my
 
02:26:12.150 --> 02:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
opinion representative Khan did you have
 
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
a question thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:26:17.150 --> 02:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so what
 
02:26:20.590 --> 02:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
is the rule right now uh what is the uh
 
02:26:23.190 --> 02:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
the legislation right now the law I
 
02:26:24.990 --> 02:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
believe it's just um you know that WG
 
02:26:26.469 --> 02:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
sports are like any other boating
 
02:26:29.950 --> 02:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
prohibited within 150 ft of of Shoreline
 
02:26:31.750 --> 02:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding follow up Mr
 
02:26:36.110 --> 02:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
chairman follow up so um so my
 
02:26:37.870 --> 02:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
understanding is each person doing all
 
02:26:39.950 --> 02:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
different thing their own way it's not
 
02:26:42.469 --> 02:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
written exactly what they have to do
 
02:26:45.550 --> 02:26:45.560 align:start position:0%
isn't it better to do this way that we
 
02:26:48.309 --> 02:26:48.319 align:start position:0%
already uh everybody knows what they
 
02:26:53.349 --> 02:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:55.030 --> 02:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
I'm bring it to the
 
02:26:57.190 --> 02:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
discipline I'm not sure that I
 
02:26:59.830 --> 02:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
understand your question the question is
 
02:27:02.870 --> 02:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
like my understanding is is there's no
 
02:27:06.030 --> 02:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
law right now each Surfer doing all
 
02:27:07.710 --> 02:27:07.720 align:start position:0%
different things that whatever they wish
 
02:27:11.790 --> 02:27:11.800 align:start position:0%
or they choose right now if we if the
 
02:27:15.110 --> 02:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
legislation passes 200 ft it'll be more
 
02:27:16.990 --> 02:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
disciplined everybody will know that
 
02:27:20.389 --> 02:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
what they can do or they cannot do yes
 
02:27:22.309 --> 02:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
yes and and thank you for the question
 
02:27:24.630 --> 02:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
and I think I I understand the gist of
 
02:27:27.790 --> 02:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
that and our our um sense is that simply
 
02:27:30.030 --> 02:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
200 feet is is just not at all adequate
 
02:27:32.030 --> 02:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
you know for to protect our our lakes
 
02:27:34.910 --> 02:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
and the original wake zone was was um
 
02:27:37.230 --> 02:27:37.240 align:start position:0%
created long before these these wake
 
02:27:39.110 --> 02:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
boats and and wake surfing H was
 
02:27:41.670 --> 02:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
happening on our lakes in in successive
 
02:27:43.469 --> 02:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
years these have become more powerful
 
02:27:45.389 --> 02:27:45.399 align:start position:0%
they've created larger waves so every
 
02:27:47.429 --> 02:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
year we have it seems like there are new
 
02:27:49.230 --> 02:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
boats that are pushing those envelopes
 
02:27:51.389 --> 02:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
and and limits um I don't think that
 
02:27:52.870 --> 02:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
there's anyone in this room that would
 
02:27:54.790 --> 02:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
argue that our Lakes are are healthier
 
02:27:57.349 --> 02:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
today than they were 50 years ago and
 
02:27:58.670 --> 02:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
you know Lakes have been dealing with
 
02:28:01.550 --> 02:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
wind driven waves for 13,000 years since
 
02:28:03.710 --> 02:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
the glaciers retreated and so the
 
02:28:05.349 --> 02:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
question then is what has happened in
 
02:28:07.429 --> 02:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
the last 50 years to cause this
 
02:28:09.070 --> 02:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
downgrading of our lakes and I think we
 
02:28:11.590 --> 02:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
need to to realize and and lay the blame
 
02:28:13.349 --> 02:28:13.359 align:start position:0%
for that squarely on the cumulative
 
02:28:16.110 --> 02:28:16.120 align:start position:0%
effects of human actions and I think WBS
 
02:28:20.670 --> 02:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
are are one of the more um uh uh radical
 
02:28:25.590 --> 02:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:28.750 --> 02:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
that for a second time Mr Darby yes
 
02:28:30.870 --> 02:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair very very briefly
 
02:28:35.070 --> 02:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
this is lon specific um we talked about
 
02:28:37.469 --> 02:28:37.479 align:start position:0%
Bo um wake boats self- selecting deeper
 
02:28:39.389 --> 02:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
water and definitely I've heard the same
 
02:28:42.670 --> 02:28:42.680 align:start position:0%
testimony um do loons how often do loons
 
02:28:44.910 --> 02:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
choose shallower bodies of water we have
 
02:28:46.950 --> 02:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
lots of bodies of water in this state
 
02:28:49.429 --> 02:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
that have average depths of under 15 ft
 
02:28:52.510 --> 02:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
so how of did lons choose those yeah so
 
02:28:54.230 --> 02:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
loons really typically favor these
 
02:28:56.510 --> 02:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
oligotrophic Lakes these low nutrient
 
02:29:00.269 --> 02:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
deep um Lakes um and so uh I think that
 
02:29:02.670 --> 02:29:02.680 align:start position:0%
in general you will find that loons and
 
02:29:04.550 --> 02:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
and wake boats and and wake surfing
 
02:29:08.070 --> 02:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
overlap to a high extent in New
 
02:29:10.269 --> 02:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire any other questions for the
 
02:29:13.309 --> 02:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
speaker remember we have a lot of
 
02:29:15.870 --> 02:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
speakers thank you Mr vogle appreciate
 
02:29:18.830 --> 02:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
it thank you uh in favor representative
 
02:29:29.790 --> 02:29:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:32.990 --> 02:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon representative my name is
 
02:29:36.230 --> 02:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
representative Linda Tanner I'm from uh
 
02:29:38.389 --> 02:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
Sullivan District 5 which represents the
 
02:29:40.950 --> 02:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
beautiful towns of snipy and Springfield
 
02:29:44.950 --> 02:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
and the wonderful lake of Lake snipy um
 
02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm here and I've spoken
 
02:29:50.510 --> 02:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
before you before um I'm not not a
 
02:29:53.830 --> 02:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
scientist but I uh do recreate on the
 
02:29:58.110 --> 02:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
Lakes uh since I was very young and
 
02:30:00.910 --> 02:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
every place that I go nowadays around
 
02:30:03.710 --> 02:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
the lake of any social event that I go
 
02:30:07.349 --> 02:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
to in my district I hear the concern
 
02:30:10.269 --> 02:30:10.279 align:start position:0%
what are you going to do about wake
 
02:30:13.190 --> 02:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
surfing um it's been an issue that's
 
02:30:14.950 --> 02:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
really come to the
 
02:30:18.670 --> 02:30:18.680 align:start position:0%
Forefront and I want to explain that um
 
02:30:20.309 --> 02:30:20.319 align:start position:0%
and this is probably a simple
 
02:30:23.309 --> 02:30:23.319 align:start position:0%
explanation to scientists but um surfing
 
02:30:25.830 --> 02:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
has traditionally been an ocean sport
 
02:30:28.510 --> 02:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
and it's been an ocean sport because the
 
02:30:31.309 --> 02:30:31.319 align:start position:0%
waves of the ocean have a lot of energy
 
02:30:34.469 --> 02:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
to them have a lot of volume to them and
 
02:30:36.990 --> 02:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
come in quite high and you know we've
 
02:30:39.309 --> 02:30:39.319 align:start position:0%
all seen the surfing out in Maui Beach
 
02:30:41.269 --> 02:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
where they're you know 30 foot waves or
 
02:30:44.830 --> 02:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
100 foot waves um but recently uh and
 
02:30:46.950 --> 02:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
just recently wake boats have been
 
02:30:50.070 --> 02:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
developed and engineered to artificially
 
02:30:53.230 --> 02:30:53.240 align:start position:0%
create those ocean type waves to support
 
02:30:56.990 --> 02:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
surfing on freshwater lakes ponds and
 
02:30:59.750 --> 02:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
rivers uh the major concerns that I've
 
02:31:02.630 --> 02:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
heard from from the people in my area
 
02:31:04.230 --> 02:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
have been the safety of other
 
02:31:07.469 --> 02:31:07.479 align:start position:0%
recreational water uh activities like
 
02:31:10.630 --> 02:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
paddle board Sports uh kaying fishing
 
02:31:13.389 --> 02:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
swimming uh people just on their docks
 
02:31:15.950 --> 02:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
or along the beach as well as the
 
02:31:17.389 --> 02:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
environmental issues you're already
 
02:31:19.910 --> 02:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
hearing about the shoreline um the and
 
02:31:21.990 --> 02:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
and the quality of the
 
02:31:24.750 --> 02:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
lake The increased size and force of
 
02:31:28.469 --> 02:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
these ocean waves uh that are created
 
02:31:31.269 --> 02:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
during wake surfing take a very long
 
02:31:33.429 --> 02:31:33.439 align:start position:0%
distance to dissipate and
 
02:31:38.110 --> 02:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
flatten um a distance of at least 500 ft
 
02:31:40.110 --> 02:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
from Shoreline which I had in my other
 
02:31:43.429 --> 02:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
bill um watercraft and other structures
 
02:31:46.550 --> 02:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
has been suggested by recent studies and
 
02:31:48.670 --> 02:31:48.680 align:start position:0%
and even they've asked as you've heard
 
02:31:51.110 --> 02:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
for even more than that
 
02:31:54.990 --> 02:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
um and that's to lessen the effects on
 
02:31:56.990 --> 02:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
the safety of those using the lake and
 
02:31:59.710 --> 02:31:59.720 align:start position:0%
the lakes are public property they're
 
02:32:01.429 --> 02:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
they're of the state but we also have a
 
02:32:04.429 --> 02:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
responsibility to use them safely and to
 
02:32:07.550 --> 02:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
protect the quality of them I believe
 
02:32:11.070 --> 02:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
the um the industry and the last time I
 
02:32:13.469 --> 02:32:13.479 align:start position:0%
was here to to testify in this bill
 
02:32:16.190 --> 02:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
before you suggested that a 15 foot
 
02:32:19.910 --> 02:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
depth was what they suggest as efficient
 
02:32:22.710 --> 02:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
for operation of the wake surfing um and
 
02:32:24.550 --> 02:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
you can see from the handout that I gave
 
02:32:27.269 --> 02:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
you with the boat tilted the way it is
 
02:32:29.670 --> 02:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
with the power of the of the
 
02:32:32.269 --> 02:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
propellers uh that the boat is always
 
02:32:35.110 --> 02:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
pushing um Force down against the bottom
 
02:32:39.190 --> 02:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
of the lake and if that lake is only 15
 
02:32:41.750 --> 02:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
fet or 10t deep which some of our
 
02:32:44.469 --> 02:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
glacial lakes are in in New Hampshire on
 
02:32:46.309 --> 02:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh around the
 
02:32:48.830 --> 02:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
sides it really turns up the bottom
 
02:32:50.830 --> 02:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
creases to idity which you've heard
 
02:32:53.550 --> 02:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
about turbulence not only disturbing the
 
02:32:55.349 --> 02:32:55.359 align:start position:0%
loons but you can imagine what it does
 
02:32:57.309 --> 02:32:57.319 align:start position:0%
to the bottom it brings all the
 
02:33:01.590 --> 02:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
nutrients to the top um it ruins the
 
02:33:04.750 --> 02:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
habitat for fish beneath the surface um
 
02:33:07.030 --> 02:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
I saw a recent video out in
 
02:33:09.630 --> 02:33:09.640 align:start position:0%
Wisconsin of a
 
02:33:11.830 --> 02:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
underwater scenario where there was a
 
02:33:14.750 --> 02:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
lot of vegetation for fish and a big
 
02:33:16.950 --> 02:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
nice big Pike going through the the
 
02:33:20.110 --> 02:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
weeds and then it shows a wake surfing
 
02:33:21.870 --> 02:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
boat coming through in in their wake
 
02:33:24.510 --> 02:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
surfing mode a lot of turbidity and
 
02:33:26.150 --> 02:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
everything and after it passes and
 
02:33:28.870 --> 02:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
things settle down the picture shows all
 
02:33:32.150 --> 02:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
that habitat leaving and the the
 
02:33:35.990 --> 02:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
turbulence still in the water so I I
 
02:33:40.510 --> 02:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
highly support um some guideline as to
 
02:33:43.110 --> 02:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
increased distance 150 ft from the
 
02:33:45.630 --> 02:33:45.640 align:start position:0%
shoreline is about the distance if
 
02:33:48.510 --> 02:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
you're on water a lot distance between a
 
02:33:51.070 --> 02:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
towboat and a water skier that's about
 
02:33:56.870 --> 02:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
150 ft so the 200 ft is is barely much
 
02:33:59.670 --> 02:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
more 300 fet obviously would be two rope
 
02:34:01.990 --> 02:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
links um away from the
 
02:34:05.230 --> 02:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
shore um and I just think that we need
 
02:34:07.750 --> 02:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
to get something going to keep the
 
02:34:12.190 --> 02:34:12.200 align:start position:0%
quality of our Lakes to help reduce ion
 
02:34:15.389 --> 02:34:15.399 align:start position:0%
bacteria blooms and preserve aquatic
 
02:34:19.070 --> 02:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
habitat for fishing um and if it takes
 
02:34:22.309 --> 02:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
you know some some sort of um compromise
 
02:34:24.389 --> 02:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
let's go for it because we can't afford
 
02:34:27.030 --> 02:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
to prolong the damage and stress on our
 
02:34:29.070 --> 02:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
waterways that compromise the quality
 
02:34:32.070 --> 02:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
and safety of our ponds our Lakes our
 
02:34:34.550 --> 02:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
waterways and I think we need just
 
02:34:36.790 --> 02:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable regulations I'm not asking to
 
02:34:40.269 --> 02:34:40.279 align:start position:0%
ban wake surfing um but I think we need
 
02:34:42.309 --> 02:34:42.319 align:start position:0%
reasonable regulations for wake surfing
 
02:34:44.750 --> 02:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
that will allow for those who live on
 
02:34:48.230 --> 02:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
the lake for those who use the lake to
 
02:34:50.590 --> 02:34:50.600 align:start position:0%
use it safely to share the use of the
 
02:34:53.309 --> 02:34:53.319 align:start position:0%
water to help prevent damage to property
 
02:34:56.510 --> 02:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
wildlife habitat fisheries and maintain
 
02:34:59.349 --> 02:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
our water quality New Hampshire Lakes
 
02:35:01.230 --> 02:35:01.240 align:start position:0%
are an attraction for tourists and home
 
02:35:03.870 --> 02:35:03.880 align:start position:0%
buyers and a large source of income for
 
02:35:06.750 --> 02:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
local economies and it they're
 
02:35:09.510 --> 02:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
irreplaceable fragile and natural
 
02:35:11.870 --> 02:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
resources I urge you to look closely at
 
02:35:14.750 --> 02:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
the bill before you and to work towards
 
02:35:16.910 --> 02:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
a reasonable and workable solution to
 
02:35:19.349 --> 02:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
save our Lakes thank you and I'm open to
 
02:35:19.359 --> 02:35:21.070 align:start position:0%
save our Lakes thank you and I'm open to
questions

02:35:21.070 --> 02:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:35:22.510 --> 02:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
02:35:25.349 --> 02:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
02:35:27.429 --> 02:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
R thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:35:30.190 --> 02:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
representa for taking my question um you
 
02:35:32.349 --> 02:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
just mentioned in your final remark that
 
02:35:36.269 --> 02:35:36.279 align:start position:0%
this would be a solution but um we've
 
02:35:38.790 --> 02:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
heard from the previous speaker that
 
02:35:41.910 --> 02:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's not protective at all so I was
 
02:35:45.230 --> 02:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
wondering do you think if this passes at
 
02:35:47.230 --> 02:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
200 that it might be giving people a
 
02:35:50.750 --> 02:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
false sense that we are improving
 
02:35:54.429 --> 02:35:54.439 align:start position:0%
protections yes I think I you know my my
 
02:35:56.469 --> 02:35:56.479 align:start position:0%
personal opinion is that 200 feet is
 
02:35:58.309 --> 02:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
really going to do nothing other than
 
02:36:02.030 --> 02:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
say okay wake surfing needs some sort of
 
02:36:04.389 --> 02:36:04.399 align:start position:0%
reasonable regulation and at least it's
 
02:36:07.190 --> 02:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
a 50 foot regulation more than regular
 
02:36:10.269 --> 02:36:10.279 align:start position:0%
boats but as far as how that if if
 
02:36:11.750 --> 02:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
you're really concerned about water
 
02:36:13.910 --> 02:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
quality you're really concerned about
 
02:36:16.230 --> 02:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
the safety of people on paddle boards or
 
02:36:19.590 --> 02:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
on kayaks um you're concerned as I am
 
02:36:23.550 --> 02:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
about the fish in the lake um then the
 
02:36:28.150 --> 02:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
200 ft really isn't what you need and
 
02:36:30.230 --> 02:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
recently uh Vermont has gone through
 
02:36:32.830 --> 02:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
quite a review on their lakes and they
 
02:36:34.990 --> 02:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
have posted uh their Lakes now they've
 
02:36:37.070 --> 02:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
gone through rules and everything and
 
02:36:40.630 --> 02:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
they suggest or they require 500 ft and
 
02:36:44.070 --> 02:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
a 20ft depth and the 50 contiguous Acres
 
02:36:46.910 --> 02:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
which was I built my original bill on I
 
02:36:49.950 --> 02:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
think that's probably what we need but
 
02:36:52.429 --> 02:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
as I said you know it's sausage time at
 
02:36:56.309 --> 02:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
the state house and we'll see what comes
 
02:36:58.910 --> 02:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
out representative Khan can you shut off
 
02:37:02.710 --> 02:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
your mic please thank you representative
 
02:37:06.429 --> 02:37:06.439 align:start position:0%
wolf thank you
 
02:37:09.990 --> 02:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
um first question does Maine now have a
 
02:37:12.710 --> 02:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
new regulation I believe they do but I
 
02:37:15.150 --> 02:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly what it is I believe
 
02:37:16.670 --> 02:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
they've just passed
 
02:37:20.309 --> 02:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
one do you know what it is I I do I was
 
02:37:22.190 --> 02:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
hoping you would ask answer for the
 
02:37:25.750 --> 02:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
committee I believe it's 300 ft and 15
 
02:37:28.630 --> 02:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
ft of depth 15t of depth which has been
 
02:37:31.670 --> 02:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
passed by the state of Maine um you
 
02:37:35.990 --> 02:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
think that's a sufficient distance
 
02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.830 align:start position:0%
think that's a sufficient distance
without

02:37:38.830 --> 02:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:37:41.750 --> 02:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
limiting severely the use of weight
 
02:37:46.269 --> 02:37:46.279 align:start position:0%
boats I you know sufficient is a is a
 
02:37:50.230 --> 02:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
kind of a funny word um I'm more
 
02:37:52.469 --> 02:37:52.479 align:start position:0%
concerned about the quality of the lakes
 
02:37:55.630 --> 02:37:55.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm concerned about the people in my
 
02:37:58.030 --> 02:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
the constituents um you live on Lake
 
02:38:00.950 --> 02:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
sunap as well and
 
02:38:04.830 --> 02:38:04.840 align:start position:0%
um I just think that I I grew up water
 
02:38:07.269 --> 02:38:07.279 align:start position:0%
skiing and it was a small Lake that we
 
02:38:11.110 --> 02:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
had a small small long narrow Lake and
 
02:38:13.710 --> 02:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
certainly everybody that used that Lake
 
02:38:16.670 --> 02:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
knew certain times and could see out on
 
02:38:18.230 --> 02:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
the lake when other people were out
 
02:38:20.950 --> 02:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
water skiing and when they had the time
 
02:38:24.269 --> 02:38:24.279 align:start position:0%
to go out and they had an open open spot
 
02:38:27.870 --> 02:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
they went out um so you know people
 
02:38:31.670 --> 02:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
adjust uh recreational boers adjust the
 
02:38:33.590 --> 02:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
the weekends are are kind of crazy on
 
02:38:37.030 --> 02:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
the Lakes but um I don't see this as a
 
02:38:40.469 --> 02:38:40.479 align:start position:0%
as a TR tremendous burden on the wake
 
02:38:40.479 --> 02:38:41.469 align:start position:0%
as a TR tremendous burden on the wake
surfing

02:38:41.469 --> 02:38:41.479 align:start position:0%
surfing
 
02:38:45.750 --> 02:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
Community um to have an area that's that
 
02:38:48.590 --> 02:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
that they can participate in their Sport
 
02:38:51.950 --> 02:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
and still not damage our lakes and and
 
02:38:58.630 --> 02:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:01.750 --> 02:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
damaged representative Darby thank you
 
02:39:04.269 --> 02:39:04.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um thank you representative
 
02:39:06.550 --> 02:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
taner for taking my question um you
 
02:39:08.750 --> 02:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you represent towns with
 
02:39:11.349 --> 02:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
several Lakes um not only Lake sopi but
 
02:39:13.910 --> 02:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
it sounds like smaller Lakes as well are
 
02:39:17.590 --> 02:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
you concerned about um increasing the
 
02:39:21.830 --> 02:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
offset Beyond 200 UND ft such that it
 
02:39:25.349 --> 02:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
would push um push boats in and cause
 
02:39:28.150 --> 02:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
conflict into a smaller channel for
 
02:39:32.710 --> 02:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
example with a 300 foot um depth on on
 
02:39:36.389 --> 02:39:36.399 align:start position:0%
even reasonable sized um you know 500
 
02:39:39.389 --> 02:39:39.399 align:start position:0%
800 acre Lakes would that you know would
 
02:39:41.590 --> 02:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
that cause a conflict based on what
 
02:39:44.910 --> 02:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
you've uh witnessed in your District
 
02:39:47.269 --> 02:39:47.279 align:start position:0%
well I've got to say the conflict has
 
02:39:49.510 --> 02:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
been there's a there's a lake and spring
 
02:39:54.070 --> 02:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
field New Hampshire Lake kuluk um and
 
02:39:56.830 --> 02:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's one of those bowl Lakes where
 
02:39:58.870 --> 02:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
the sides are shallow you know it
 
02:40:01.710 --> 02:40:01.720 align:start position:0%
probably has 25 ft maybe at the most in
 
02:40:05.790 --> 02:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
the center of the lake um and talking to
 
02:40:08.550 --> 02:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
the constituents there what happened was
 
02:40:11.389 --> 02:40:11.399 align:start position:0%
someone came in with with a wake booat
 
02:40:14.309 --> 02:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
wake surfing boat and they went around
 
02:40:15.750 --> 02:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
that Lake and around that Lake and
 
02:40:17.950 --> 02:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
around that Lake and around that Lake
 
02:40:19.910 --> 02:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
and caused a lot of turbulence a lot of
 
02:40:21.990 --> 02:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
plant life came to the top one fellow
 
02:40:23.510 --> 02:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
was telling me that he was trying to put
 
02:40:26.670 --> 02:40:26.680 align:start position:0%
his dock out his swim Dock and he had to
 
02:40:30.070 --> 02:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
fight the vegetation on the lake to to
 
02:40:31.990 --> 02:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
get to where he wanted to put his dock
 
02:40:34.309 --> 02:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
in and he at first he couldn't figure
 
02:40:36.070 --> 02:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
out how it all came up from the bottom
 
02:40:38.349 --> 02:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
and then he realized what happened and
 
02:40:41.750 --> 02:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
on that particular Lake um there was a
 
02:40:44.349 --> 02:40:44.359 align:start position:0%
lot of conflict with the neighbors a lot
 
02:40:46.269 --> 02:40:46.279 align:start position:0%
of conflict with the neighbors to the
 
02:40:48.110 --> 02:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
point where the person with the wake
 
02:40:51.550 --> 02:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
surfing boat left that area um and I
 
02:40:53.630 --> 02:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
think that's a real shame I think that's
 
02:40:55.030 --> 02:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
you know we shouldn't pit neighbor
 
02:40:58.590 --> 02:40:58.600 align:start position:0%
against neighbor um but people that ha
 
02:41:02.590 --> 02:41:02.600 align:start position:0%
that have issues on the lake um you know
 
02:41:04.349 --> 02:41:04.359 align:start position:0%
if that person had stayed in the middle
 
02:41:07.630 --> 02:41:07.640 align:start position:0%
or had not been going around and around
 
02:41:10.670 --> 02:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
in circles to to to do that and maybe a
 
02:41:12.349 --> 02:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
little bit more reasonable in what they
 
02:41:14.910 --> 02:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
did um I think you know things would
 
02:41:16.389 --> 02:41:16.399 align:start position:0%
have been a lot different and a lot
 
02:41:19.670 --> 02:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
different for the lake um sopy has a lot
 
02:41:21.469 --> 02:41:21.479 align:start position:0%
of channels and you know a lot of our
 
02:41:24.190 --> 02:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
Lakes have different Coes and channels
 
02:41:26.389 --> 02:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
and one of the problems at lake sopy is
 
02:41:29.550 --> 02:41:29.560 align:start position:0%
that um the Wake Surfers will often go
 
02:41:33.030 --> 02:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
down a channel and the channels in the
 
02:41:38.269 --> 02:41:38.279 align:start position:0%
lake get very um shallow and so you know
 
02:41:41.230 --> 02:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
I I think you set regulations and I
 
02:41:42.870 --> 02:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
think if people want to wake surve
 
02:41:44.910 --> 02:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to find the areas to wake
 
02:41:49.469 --> 02:41:49.479 align:start position:0%
surf they're going to enjoy it um and
 
02:41:51.710 --> 02:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
not cause the conflict that we have
 
02:41:51.720 --> 02:41:53.429 align:start position:0%
not cause the conflict that we have
right

02:41:53.429 --> 02:41:53.439 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:41:57.150 --> 02:41:57.160 align:start position:0%
now you other questions for the
 
02:41:59.230 --> 02:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
representative seeing none thank you
 
02:42:01.150 --> 02:42:01.160 align:start position:0%
representative representative wolf can
 
02:42:04.550 --> 02:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
you shut off your mic please thank you
 
02:42:07.230 --> 02:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
speaking against Andrea Laro New
 
02:42:25.710 --> 02:42:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:27.550 --> 02:42:27.560 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chair and members of the
 
02:42:29.990 --> 02:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee it's nice to see you all again
 
02:42:32.429 --> 02:42:32.439 align:start position:0%
I'm Andrea Laro president of New
 
02:42:36.429 --> 02:42:36.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lakes we represent about 275
 
02:42:38.830 --> 02:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
local Lake Associations and I'm here
 
02:42:42.870 --> 02:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
today to testify in opposition to this
 
02:42:46.150 --> 02:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
spb 431 as it's written and to request
 
02:42:46.160 --> 02:42:47.230 align:start position:0%
spb 431 as it's written and to request
an

02:42:47.230 --> 02:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:42:49.990 --> 02:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
amendment we request that be amended to
 
02:42:53.150 --> 02:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
include at least a 300t setback and an
 
02:42:55.349 --> 02:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
average lake depth requirement of at
 
02:42:58.349 --> 02:42:58.359 align:start position:0%
least 10 ft these are the minimum
 
02:43:01.110 --> 02:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
Provisions that seem like a fair and
 
02:43:03.230 --> 02:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable compromise and that we are
 
02:43:05.750 --> 02:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
willing to accept at this
 
02:43:10.349 --> 02:43:10.359 align:start position:0%
time so over the F past few months uh we
 
02:43:12.590 --> 02:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
have considered the opposition's
 
02:43:15.469 --> 02:43:15.479 align:start position:0%
concerns and listen to your
 
02:43:17.710 --> 02:43:17.720 align:start position:0%
committee thoughtfully discuss this
 
02:43:19.469 --> 02:43:19.479 align:start position:0%
issue thank you for all the time you
 
02:43:21.790 --> 02:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
have all put into this issue over this
 
02:43:24.910 --> 02:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
session we supported your committee's
 
02:43:28.910 --> 02:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
300 foot setback compromise on HB 1390
 
02:43:31.110 --> 02:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
which unfortunately was not provided an
 
02:43:33.510 --> 02:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be be discussed by the
 
02:43:33.520 --> 02:43:34.469 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be be discussed by the
Full

02:43:34.469 --> 02:43:34.479 align:start position:0%
Full
 
02:43:37.150 --> 02:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
House I know your committee is well
 
02:43:40.950 --> 02:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
versed about why a t 200t setback and no
 
02:43:40.960 --> 02:43:42.190 align:start position:0%
versed about why a t 200t setback and no
depth

02:43:42.190 --> 02:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
depth
 
02:43:44.990 --> 02:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
requirement leaves our health and the
 
02:43:46.710 --> 02:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
health of our lakes and our loons at
 
02:43:50.110 --> 02:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
risk so I'm not going to repeat that
 
02:43:52.269 --> 02:43:52.279 align:start position:0%
so compromise means agreeing to give up
 
02:43:54.349 --> 02:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
something you want if the other side
 
02:43:56.389 --> 02:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
which has a different perspective gives
 
02:43:59.150 --> 02:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
up something it wants we are
 
02:44:02.030 --> 02:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
compromising at a 300t set setback we're
 
02:44:04.070 --> 02:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
giving up 200 feet we started this
 
02:44:07.910 --> 02:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
session supporting a 500t 20 foot depth
 
02:44:10.550 --> 02:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
500t setback and 20ft depth
 
02:44:14.070 --> 02:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
requirement so we're compromising 200 ft
 
02:44:16.830 --> 02:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
here supporting an average lake depth of
 
02:44:19.630 --> 02:44:19.640 align:start position:0%
at least 10 ft instead of a operating
 
02:44:22.510 --> 02:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
depth of 20 ft were compromising we just
 
02:44:25.670 --> 02:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
don't understand how codifying the wake
 
02:44:28.190 --> 02:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
industry's wake responsibly
 
02:44:30.790 --> 02:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
Campaign which recommends a 200 foot
 
02:44:34.030 --> 02:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
setback is a compromise the 200 foot
 
02:44:36.670 --> 02:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
setback recommended by the industry is a
 
02:44:38.790 --> 02:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
generalized setback for wake surfing
 
02:44:40.309 --> 02:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
across the
 
02:44:43.309 --> 02:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
nation experience has shown that this
 
02:44:46.150 --> 02:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
setback is inadequate in New Hampshire
 
02:44:48.150 --> 02:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be here today if the 200
 
02:44:50.269 --> 02:44:50.279 align:start position:0%
foot setback that they're recommending
 
02:44:53.030 --> 02:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
was working New Hampshire's Lakes are
 
02:44:55.790 --> 02:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
LED and depended on for their clean and
 
02:44:58.230 --> 02:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
clear waters We Believe higher standards
 
02:45:00.670 --> 02:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
are required to keep them that way not
 
02:45:02.429 --> 02:45:02.439 align:start position:0%
only are local Lake groups throughout
 
02:45:04.190 --> 02:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
the state advocating for higher
 
02:45:07.429 --> 02:45:07.439 align:start position:0%
standards Sur T States surrounding us
 
02:45:10.389 --> 02:45:10.399 align:start position:0%
are putting in higher standards on April
 
02:45:12.630 --> 02:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
3rd of this year the governor of Maine
 
02:45:15.710 --> 02:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
signed into law a 300t setback and a
 
02:45:19.190 --> 02:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
15ft depth requirement on April 15th the
 
02:45:21.550 --> 02:45:21.560 align:start position:0%
Vermont wake Sports rule went into

effect this includes a 500 foot setback
 
02:45:26.510 --> 02:45:26.520 align:start position:0%

requirement the health of the lake our
 
02:45:30.309 --> 02:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
lakes here in New Hampshire is
 
02:45:32.590 --> 02:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
deteriorating and we know that there are
 
02:45:34.870 --> 02:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of reasons a lot of activities
 
02:45:37.349 --> 02:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
that are contributing to this
 
02:45:39.469 --> 02:45:39.479 align:start position:0%
deterioration we all must lean in and
 
02:45:42.030 --> 02:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
work together and compromise to do what
 
02:45:45.110 --> 02:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
is reasonable and fair and will help
 
02:45:46.830 --> 02:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
stop this
 
02:45:49.389 --> 02:45:49.399 align:start position:0%
degradation so this legislative New
 
02:45:51.030 --> 02:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lakes along with a lot of our
 
02:45:52.630 --> 02:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
partners in this room we've been working
 
02:45:54.870 --> 02:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
on a number of bills a number of bills
 
02:45:57.790 --> 02:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
that are all aimed at at reducing our
 
02:46:00.469 --> 02:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
Collective impact on the deterioration
 
02:46:02.550 --> 02:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
of our Lakes we've worked on septic
 
02:46:04.630 --> 02:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
bills fertilizer bills Shoreland
 
02:46:06.990 --> 02:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
protection act bills and we've worked
 
02:46:08.950 --> 02:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
with stakeholders and stakeholders
 
02:46:10.590 --> 02:46:10.600 align:start position:0%
together were compromising to find
 
02:46:14.230 --> 02:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
Solutions on these issues you would we
 
02:46:15.910 --> 02:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
expect that that should be the same case
 
02:46:18.910 --> 02:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
here on this issue we urge you to
 
02:46:21.389 --> 02:46:21.399 align:start position:0%
continue to support a 300t setback like
 
02:46:24.469 --> 02:46:24.479 align:start position:0%
you did earlier this session and to
 
02:46:27.030 --> 02:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
include a minimum depth requirement
 
02:46:28.990 --> 02:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
average depth requirement of at least 10
 
02:46:32.349 --> 02:46:32.359 align:start position:0%
ft this will help to reduce the erosion
 
02:46:34.750 --> 02:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
and bottom disturbance caused by wake
 
02:46:36.870 --> 02:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
surfing and contributing to the
 
02:46:39.429 --> 02:46:39.439 align:start position:0%
declining health of our Lakes by
 
02:46:41.469 --> 02:46:41.479 align:start position:0%
amending this bill in this way you
 
02:46:44.030 --> 02:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that you value compromise
 
02:46:46.110 --> 02:46:46.120 align:start position:0%
and you value balancing the economy and
 
02:46:48.309 --> 02:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
the health of our Lakes that's all I
 
02:46:50.269 --> 02:46:50.279 align:start position:0%
have I'm to answer any
 
02:46:53.990 --> 02:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for the
 
02:46:56.750 --> 02:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
speaker representative
 
02:47:00.830 --> 02:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you Mr chair um thank you M
 
02:47:03.269 --> 02:47:03.279 align:start position:0%
lamro for uh taking my
 
02:47:05.429 --> 02:47:05.439 align:start position:0%
question um I have a lots but I'm only
 
02:47:07.030 --> 02:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
going to ask one because there's um
 
02:47:07.040 --> 02:47:08.309 align:start position:0%
going to ask one because there's um
thank

02:47:08.309 --> 02:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:47:10.750 --> 02:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
you New Hampshire Lake uh New Hampshire
 
02:47:12.870 --> 02:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
lakes also uh supports the Lakes host
 
02:47:15.670 --> 02:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
program and one of the um one of the
 
02:47:17.990 --> 02:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
provisions of the Senate bill is an
 
02:47:21.429 --> 02:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:23.990 --> 02:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
in speaking to you know Captain D Ley
 
02:47:26.710 --> 02:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
there are opportunities to provide that
 
02:47:29.070 --> 02:47:29.080 align:start position:0%
education but it's but it's limited and
 
02:47:31.070 --> 02:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if New Hampshire Lakes
 
02:47:33.190 --> 02:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
would have any opportunity or the Lakes
 
02:47:35.190 --> 02:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
host program more broadly would have any
 
02:47:39.870 --> 02:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to educate um wake um
 
02:47:42.910 --> 02:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
possible wake Surfers on best practices
 
02:47:44.910 --> 02:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
as they enter and leave
 
02:47:47.070 --> 02:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
Lakes thank you for that question and
 
02:47:49.269 --> 02:47:49.279 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question um yes
 
02:47:51.910 --> 02:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
through our lak host program we staff we
 
02:47:56.070 --> 02:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
have about 500 volunteers 300 employees
 
02:47:59.429 --> 02:47:59.439 align:start position:0%
at about 100 Lakes throughout the state
 
02:48:02.550 --> 02:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
and um we meet and greet boers help them
 
02:48:05.030 --> 02:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
prevent the spread of invasive species
 
02:48:08.269 --> 02:48:08.279 align:start position:0%
and yes we could certainly um help
 
02:48:10.830 --> 02:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
provide information to wake Surfers
 
02:48:14.269 --> 02:48:14.279 align:start position:0%
about uh responsible wake surfing um we
 
02:48:15.830 --> 02:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
would of course talk about the invasive
 
02:48:18.110 --> 02:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
species issue first but then would happy
 
02:48:21.670 --> 02:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:24.670 --> 02:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
education representative R thank you Mr
 
02:48:25.990 --> 02:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:48:28.030 --> 02:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
question and thank you very much for
 
02:48:30.030 --> 02:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
attaching the Vermont and Maine bills
 
02:48:33.230 --> 02:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
it's very helpful um that they've gone
 
02:48:36.389 --> 02:48:36.399 align:start position:0%
to 300 what what was the original
 
02:48:39.950 --> 02:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
distance so in Maine um you know there
 
02:48:41.830 --> 02:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
was a I am not an expert on what
 
02:48:44.830 --> 02:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
happened in Maine I know there was um a
 
02:48:46.790 --> 02:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
lot of of back and forth in there
 
02:48:49.269 --> 02:48:49.279 align:start position:0%
originally our counterpart main Lake
 
02:48:52.469 --> 02:48:52.479 align:start position:0%
Society was also asking for a 500 um and
 
02:48:54.150 --> 02:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
then it wiggled around a little bit and
 
02:48:55.670 --> 02:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
and they landed on
 
02:48:57.830 --> 02:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
300 you don't know what the original
 
02:49:01.110 --> 02:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
distance was um in Maine oh it's 200
 
02:49:03.230 --> 02:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
feet in M it was 200 so they went from
 
02:49:05.349 --> 02:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
200 to 300 this is correct do you know
 
02:49:07.910 --> 02:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
what it was in Vermont sorry Mr it's a
 
02:49:10.429 --> 02:49:10.439 align:start position:0%
third followup but that's
 
02:49:12.750 --> 02:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
okay I should know and I'm embarrassed
 
02:49:14.269 --> 02:49:14.279 align:start position:0%
to say I do not know I don't know if
 
02:49:15.670 --> 02:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
someone in this room knows but I can
 
02:49:17.510 --> 02:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
certainly look into that thank you very
 
02:49:21.150 --> 02:49:21.160 align:start position:0%
much any anyone else representative
 
02:49:24.710 --> 02:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
wolf um thank you and thank you for
 
02:49:28.269 --> 02:49:28.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question sure do you have any
 
02:49:32.309 --> 02:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
idea as to what area amount of area
 
02:49:35.870 --> 02:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
going from 200 to 300 feet would affect
 
02:49:39.389 --> 02:49:39.399 align:start position:0%
on the lakes that is a really great
 
02:49:42.389 --> 02:49:42.399 align:start position:0%
question I do not have the information
 
02:49:44.590 --> 02:49:44.600 align:start position:0%
here um but I believe I have the start
 
02:49:47.269 --> 02:49:47.279 align:start position:0%
of that information at our office and I
 
02:49:50.630 --> 02:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
can um get that to
 
02:49:53.670 --> 02:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you you're welcome any other
 
02:49:56.389 --> 02:49:56.399 align:start position:0%
questions for the speaker seeing none
 
02:49:58.070 --> 02:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank
 
02:50:00.950 --> 02:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
you speak in favor representative Tom
 
02:50:19.670 --> 02:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:23.630 --> 02:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and uh good afternoon
 
02:50:23.640 --> 02:50:30.590 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and uh good afternoon
colleagues

02:50:30.590 --> 02:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:32.590 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:50:32.590 --> 02:50:32.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:50:35.990 --> 02:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm here today to support uh the
 
02:50:37.030 --> 02:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
02:50:41.309 --> 02:50:41.319 align:start position:0%
431 about wake boating uh on our Lakes
 
02:50:44.110 --> 02:50:44.120 align:start position:0%
uh there are definitely serious Environ
 
02:50:47.630 --> 02:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts to both uh humans
 
02:50:50.229 --> 02:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
and Wildlife but I'm going to let others
 
02:50:51.950 --> 02:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
discuss that and you've already heard
 
02:50:54.070 --> 02:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
some of that testimony let me offer you
 
02:50:55.910 --> 02:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
some of my personal experiences and if
 
02:50:58.150 --> 02:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
you could extrapolate that to other
 
02:51:00.070 --> 02:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
property owners that are along the
 
02:51:03.349 --> 02:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
shoreline of lakes I represent London
 
02:51:07.950 --> 02:51:07.960 align:start position:0%
der which has no Lakes however I have a
 
02:51:11.030 --> 02:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
a summer property in in Meredith and
 
02:51:13.630 --> 02:51:13.640 align:start position:0%
have been uh been using that property
 
02:51:15.150 --> 02:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
for several
 
02:51:17.950 --> 02:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
decades uh but let me say clearly that I
 
02:51:19.830 --> 02:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
do understand that the public lands and
 
02:51:21.750 --> 02:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
water are free to be used by everybody
 
02:51:24.150 --> 02:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
in the state but we also have to
 
02:51:26.190 --> 02:51:26.200 align:start position:0%
consider the impact to those abing
 
02:51:27.990 --> 02:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
Property Owners along the
 
02:51:30.349 --> 02:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
Lakes these wake boats that we've been
 
02:51:32.750 --> 02:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
talking about were introduced relatively
 
02:51:35.670 --> 02:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
recently and they Inc they they you make
 
02:51:37.630 --> 02:51:37.640 align:start position:0%
use of an incredible technology that
 
02:51:39.990 --> 02:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
allow wake Surfers to ride the wakes
 
02:51:42.870 --> 02:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
Behind these boats the boats sit very
 
02:51:44.950 --> 02:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
low in the water and can utilize
 
02:51:47.710 --> 02:51:47.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes sophisticated ballast devices
 
02:51:51.510 --> 02:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
to create very large waves sounds like
 
02:51:54.469 --> 02:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
fun but there are consequences these
 
02:51:56.550 --> 02:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
large waves stir up the dirt and
 
02:51:58.990 --> 02:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
turbidity and sediment making the water
 
02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:00.630 align:start position:0%
turbidity and sediment making the water
unswimmable

02:52:00.630 --> 02:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
unswimmable
 
02:52:04.590 --> 02:52:04.600 align:start position:0%
and unusable for
 
02:52:06.830 --> 02:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
consumption uh just for example my
 
02:52:08.429 --> 02:52:08.439 align:start position:0%
grandchildren when they visit me at the
 
02:52:11.309 --> 02:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
lake refuse to swim in the water if a
 
02:52:14.309 --> 02:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
wake Boo's been going around because the
 
02:52:17.830 --> 02:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
water is so dirty uh and the turity is
 
02:52:19.510 --> 02:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:52:21.670 --> 02:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh so much to accommodate them though I
 
02:52:24.910 --> 02:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
had to install a $1,200 sediment
 
02:52:27.710 --> 02:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
filter uh to take the sediment out of
 
02:52:29.870 --> 02:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
the the water because we again we
 
02:52:32.309 --> 02:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
consume the water for the plumbing of
 
02:52:35.870 --> 02:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
the of the cottage and uh we cook in it
 
02:52:38.710 --> 02:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
we use it and uh till very recently we
 
02:52:39.990 --> 02:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
used to drink
 
02:52:42.750 --> 02:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
it uh but and recently I had to pay a
 
02:52:46.190 --> 02:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
contractor $600 to reinforce my Dock at
 
02:52:47.830 --> 02:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
the lake because these wake boats
 
02:52:50.590 --> 02:52:50.600 align:start position:0%
generate such large waves they wash over
 
02:52:53.790 --> 02:52:53.800 align:start position:0%
the the entire Dock and make the dock
 
02:52:56.510 --> 02:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
unstable and last summer for example
 
02:52:58.950 --> 02:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
several docks along the shore of Lake wi
 
02:53:01.910 --> 02:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
basaki were broken up by the waves and
 
02:53:04.750 --> 02:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
there were uh pieces of dock floating in
 
02:53:06.790 --> 02:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
the water which create a terrible Hazard
 
02:53:10.950 --> 02:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
for boers and swimmers alike and God
 
02:53:12.950 --> 02:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
help you if if you enjoy the lake as a
 
02:53:15.870 --> 02:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
kayaker or a paddle boorder the Wake
 
02:53:19.070 --> 02:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
boats uh if present
 
02:53:22.469 --> 02:53:22.479 align:start position:0%
uh render that Recreation unusable and
 
02:53:24.990 --> 02:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
unsafe in conclusion I'm not suggesting
 
02:53:26.389 --> 02:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
that we ban these
 
02:53:28.990 --> 02:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
boats let's just set up some rules so
 
02:53:31.469 --> 02:53:31.479 align:start position:0%
that we may all enjoy the public
 
02:53:33.750 --> 02:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
waterways there's enough room for all
 
02:53:38.190 --> 02:53:38.200 align:start position:0%
parties to enjoy themselves the and when
 
02:53:41.910 --> 02:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
asked why would I support a $200 a 200
 
02:53:46.469 --> 02:53:46.479 align:start position:0%
foot U from the shore a restriction when
 
02:53:48.150 --> 02:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony that that won't do
 
02:53:52.070 --> 02:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
that much much for us two words for you
 
02:53:57.229 --> 02:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
guys baby steps I think that when we're
 
02:54:01.389 --> 02:54:01.399 align:start position:0%
uh encouraging a change that is as by
 
02:54:03.670 --> 02:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
some people's view as radical as we're
 
02:54:05.990 --> 02:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about restrictions here
 
02:54:08.229 --> 02:54:08.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes you have to take the baby
 
02:54:11.710 --> 02:54:11.720 align:start position:0%
steps try it out and come back next year
 
02:54:15.429 --> 02:54:15.439 align:start position:0%
and say that 200 foot limit wasn't
 
02:54:18.590 --> 02:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
enough we need to go to 300 ft or it was
 
02:54:22.389 --> 02:54:22.399 align:start position:0%
okay let's leave it the way it is so I'm
 
02:54:25.309 --> 02:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
happy that you're considering this uh
 
02:54:27.110 --> 02:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
but please remember we have 400
 
02:54:29.550 --> 02:54:29.560 align:start position:0%
colleagues that need to vote on this and
 
02:54:33.150 --> 02:54:33.160 align:start position:0%
if and if they are not convinced and you
 
02:54:36.710 --> 02:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
get um a defeat in the vote then you get
 
02:54:39.710 --> 02:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
nothing so that's why I'm saying baby
 
02:54:43.670 --> 02:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
steps uh try it out see how it works and
 
02:54:46.750 --> 02:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
if it does start to work out then maybe
 
02:54:48.870 --> 02:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
consider increas increasing
 
02:54:51.150 --> 02:54:51.160 align:start position:0%
the uh the limit from the shore and
 
02:54:53.590 --> 02:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps the depth of the water I'm
 
02:54:55.750 --> 02:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
available to take questions if anybody
 
02:54:59.190 --> 02:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
has any sentive R thank you Mr chair and
 
02:55:01.269 --> 02:55:01.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representa good to see you if
 
02:55:03.830 --> 02:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
an amendment came to the floor that did
 
02:55:06.229 --> 02:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
extend it to 300 and had a depth
 
02:55:07.710 --> 02:55:07.720 align:start position:0%
requirement is that something you would
 
02:55:12.309 --> 02:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:14.670 --> 02:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
you representative wolf did you have a
 
02:55:19.670 --> 02:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
question yes that's I put put it on so
 
02:55:25.750 --> 02:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you does 300 foot help the
 
02:55:28.670 --> 02:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
kayaker a 300 foot distance from Shore
 
02:55:32.550 --> 02:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
does it give them an area um does it
 
02:55:34.469 --> 02:55:34.479 align:start position:0%
does it help the kayaker enough that's
 
02:55:36.309 --> 02:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
that would be the question I would think
 
02:55:39.229 --> 02:55:39.239 align:start position:0%
to to consider and maybe not but it's
 
02:55:42.269 --> 02:55:42.279 align:start position:0%
better than 200 feet or better than than
 
02:55:45.710 --> 02:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
150 which is what we kind of have now uh
 
02:55:49.309 --> 02:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
kayakers are uh really at risk in a in
 
02:55:51.190 --> 02:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
the stability of their of their craft
 
02:55:52.950 --> 02:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
when one of these boats comes by with
 
02:55:54.790 --> 02:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
those with these huge
 
02:55:57.229 --> 02:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
waves thank
 
02:56:00.190 --> 02:56:00.200 align:start position:0%
you representative Darby thank you Mr
 
02:56:02.190 --> 02:56:02.200 align:start position:0%
chair very briefly you mentioned that
 
02:56:05.190 --> 02:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
you own property in Meredith what what
 
02:56:07.510 --> 02:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
bay is that near what what uh area that
 
02:56:10.150 --> 02:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
you've seen such turbidity in the water
 
02:56:12.030 --> 02:56:12.040 align:start position:0%
that's in the area of Cummings coold
 
02:56:14.950 --> 02:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
 go um and what what happens if I
 
02:56:16.670 --> 02:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
can if I could elaborate a little bit
 
02:56:18.990 --> 02:56:19.000 align:start position:0%
what happens are people they launch
 
02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:19.710 align:start position:0%
what happens are people they launch
their

02:56:19.710 --> 02:56:19.720 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:56:23.229 --> 02:56:23.239 align:start position:0%
boats and they search around or they
 
02:56:25.190 --> 02:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
already know but they they search around
 
02:56:27.469 --> 02:56:27.479 align:start position:0%
for small Coes because they don't want
 
02:56:29.070 --> 02:56:29.080 align:start position:0%
to be out in the middle of the lake it's
 
02:56:31.110 --> 02:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
too much boat wash and too rough so they
 
02:56:33.389 --> 02:56:33.399 align:start position:0%
find a small Cove and then they
 
02:56:36.030 --> 02:56:36.040 align:start position:0%
basically go in a circle around inside
 
02:56:39.870 --> 02:56:39.880 align:start position:0%
of that Cove and and and recreate with
 
02:56:42.870 --> 02:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
their wake boats the the people that
 
02:56:45.550 --> 02:56:45.560 align:start position:0%
live along that Cove have the the burden
 
02:56:48.870 --> 02:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
of of dealing with the with the uh with
 
02:56:50.630 --> 02:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
the waves from these wake boats in that
 
02:56:54.030 --> 02:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
small Cove until they pack up and go
 
02:56:56.510 --> 02:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
home for the day and that that's part of
 
02:56:58.150 --> 02:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
the issue you think well you're on a big
 
02:57:00.070 --> 02:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
lake lake wi basaki is the biggest lake
 
02:57:02.349 --> 02:57:02.359 align:start position:0%
in the state what what's the big deal
 
02:57:03.830 --> 02:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
but when you're in a when you're in a
 
02:57:03.840 --> 02:57:04.990 align:start position:0%
but when you're in a when you're in a
small

02:57:04.990 --> 02:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
small
 
02:57:08.510 --> 02:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
Cove you're you're immensely impacted by
 
02:57:11.190 --> 02:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
the activity of that Lake in that Cove
 
02:57:16.190 --> 02:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:19.229 --> 02:57:19.239 align:start position:0%
there son of w follow
 
02:57:21.670 --> 02:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
thank you sir and thank you for taking
 
02:57:26.190 --> 02:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
the question um you said that we go in
 
02:57:29.150 --> 02:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
baby steps and I've been told that if
 
02:57:30.510 --> 02:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
you don't make it now you're not going
 
02:57:32.590 --> 02:57:32.600 align:start position:0%
to W with this
 
02:57:35.550 --> 02:57:35.560 align:start position:0%
bill how do you know that the lake is
 
02:57:38.309 --> 02:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
deteriorated in a year when you want to
 
02:57:40.469 --> 02:57:40.479 align:start position:0%
come back with another bill this has
 
02:57:43.110 --> 02:57:43.120 align:start position:0%
taken a long time for the
 
02:57:44.950 --> 02:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
Lakes I
 
02:57:47.710 --> 02:57:47.720 align:start position:0%
mean many many years ago you could see
 
02:57:51.550 --> 02:57:51.560 align:start position:0%
bottom on stie at right 15
 
02:57:55.630 --> 02:57:55.640 align:start position:0%
ft not happening anymore right I I great
 
02:57:58.910 --> 02:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
question uh I would take testimony from
 
02:58:02.710 --> 02:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh Dees see and and pro probably from
 
02:58:05.990 --> 02:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
the Marine Patrol uh what they're seeing
 
02:58:08.910 --> 02:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
but if the technology somehow could
 
02:58:10.910 --> 02:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
support this and I'm a representative so
 
02:58:13.590 --> 02:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
I know you're you're very limited but a
 
02:58:15.229 --> 02:58:15.239 align:start position:0%
great thing to do would be if you could
 
02:58:18.750 --> 02:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
get somebody to take a movie
 
02:58:21.590 --> 02:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
a movie shot uh either with their cell
 
02:58:23.309 --> 02:58:23.319 align:start position:0%
phone or with some
 
02:58:25.510 --> 02:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
equipment uh
 
02:58:29.429 --> 02:58:29.439 align:start position:0%
observe the Wake boats in uh in use and
 
02:58:31.269 --> 02:58:31.279 align:start position:0%
then look at the water look at the
 
02:58:33.030 --> 02:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
quality of the water the turbidity that
 
02:58:34.750 --> 02:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
results from it and if you could show
 
02:58:37.590 --> 02:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
that movie to each other uh the greatest
 
02:58:39.510 --> 02:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
thing would be some type of a field trip
 
02:58:41.150 --> 02:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
if you could do that but I know that's
 
02:58:44.349 --> 02:58:44.359 align:start position:0%
really stretching it but uh uh that's
 
02:58:46.150 --> 02:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
that's my
 
02:58:48.950 --> 02:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
suggestion thank you represent
 
02:58:51.750 --> 02:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
KH thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:58:54.630 --> 02:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
representative taking my question uh we
 
02:58:58.190 --> 02:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
hearing U the bill is for 200 ft and we
 
02:59:01.950 --> 02:59:01.960 align:start position:0%
hearing about 300 ft is there any
 
02:59:04.070 --> 02:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
compromise 250
 
02:59:08.830 --> 02:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
ft uh I'd have to uh you have to get Tim
 
02:59:11.269 --> 02:59:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh Senator Lang back to see as a a
 
02:59:13.309 --> 02:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor if he wanted to change that
 
02:59:16.309 --> 02:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
follow follow up would you vote for 250
 
02:59:18.710 --> 02:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
ft if it is I would would vote for
 
02:59:20.190 --> 02:59:20.200 align:start position:0%
anything that's better than what we got
 
02:59:22.030 --> 02:59:22.040 align:start position:0%
right now thank
 
02:59:26.150 --> 02:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for the
 
02:59:28.469 --> 02:59:28.479 align:start position:0%
representative representative wolf for a
 
02:59:29.950 --> 02:59:29.960 align:start position:0%
second time do you know what the
 
02:59:33.030 --> 02:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
distance is that a ski booat has to be
 
02:59:34.349 --> 02:59:34.359 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:59:37.229 --> 02:59:37.239 align:start position:0%
shore I believe it's I believe I'm not
 
02:59:40.150 --> 02:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
exactly sure I believe it's 150 ft and
 
02:59:42.830 --> 02:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
that's also from other boats too you
 
02:59:46.510 --> 02:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
said at 300 you think it's 300 I don't
 
02:59:49.269 --> 02:59:49.279 align:start position:0%
yeah come around yeah I'm not I'm not
 
02:59:51.910 --> 02:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
exactly sure but I you you may you may
 
02:59:53.710 --> 02:59:53.720 align:start position:0%
have someone behind me that has the
 
02:59:55.150 --> 02:59:55.160 align:start position:0%
answer to
 
02:59:56.990 --> 02:59:57.000 align:start position:0%

03:01:08.349 --> 03:01:08.359 align:start position:0%
year we received numerous complaints
 
03:01:10.990 --> 03:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
every single summer um about the
 
03:01:12.790 --> 03:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
negative impacts of wake
 
03:01:17.229 --> 03:01:17.239 align:start position:0%
surfing we do not support SB 431 because
 
03:01:20.030 --> 03:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
we believe 200 ft is ineffective in
 
03:01:22.110 --> 03:01:22.120 align:start position:0%
reducing the water quality impacts
 
03:01:23.710 --> 03:01:23.720 align:start position:0%
resulting from Wake
 
03:01:26.550 --> 03:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
boats we are not at all against wake
 
03:01:29.550 --> 03:01:29.560 align:start position:0%
surfing we fully appreciate it as a fun
 
03:01:32.630 --> 03:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
family activity and we also appreciate
 
03:01:34.429 --> 03:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
all of the educational efforts that have
 
03:01:36.469 --> 03:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
been undertaken by the water sports
 
03:01:39.229 --> 03:01:39.239 align:start position:0%
industry and other associations but the
 
03:01:41.790 --> 03:01:41.800 align:start position:0%
education aspect is not
 
03:01:44.389 --> 03:01:44.399 align:start position:0%
enough everyone should be able to use
 
03:01:47.110 --> 03:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
the lake some of our supporters say that
 
03:01:49.349 --> 03:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
we are restrict ing one or some of the
 
03:01:51.349 --> 03:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
bill supporters excuse me say that we
 
03:01:53.349 --> 03:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
are restricting one activity over
 
03:01:57.990 --> 03:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
another but this is not true if SB 431
 
03:02:00.590 --> 03:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
passes as it stands it will continue to
 
03:02:03.389 --> 03:02:03.399 align:start position:0%
impact swimmers kayakers and other
 
03:02:03.399 --> 03:02:06.469 align:start position:0%
impact swimmers kayakers and other
non-motorized

03:02:06.469 --> 03:02:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:08.389 --> 03:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
recreationalists again this bill does
 
03:02:10.990 --> 03:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
not at all ban wake surfing will some
 
03:02:14.110 --> 03:02:14.120 align:start position:0%
water bodies be impacted yes of course
 
03:02:15.990 --> 03:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
but I think it's extremely important for
 
03:02:18.670 --> 03:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
each of you to ask yourselves if these
 
03:02:20.910 --> 03:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
activities should even be occurring on
 
03:02:22.429 --> 03:02:22.439 align:start position:0%
these smaller water
 
03:02:24.950 --> 03:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
bodies think of it this way would you
 
03:02:28.630 --> 03:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
race a Ferrari on a gokart track
 
03:02:31.229 --> 03:02:31.239 align:start position:0%
no I ask that you strongly consider
 
03:02:35.070 --> 03:02:35.080 align:start position:0%
amending s sp4 31 to 300 ft with a depth
 
03:02:37.670 --> 03:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
requirement of 10 ft to protect the
 
03:02:40.429 --> 03:02:40.439 align:start position:0%
Ecology of our lakes and as a strong
 
03:02:43.670 --> 03:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
economic driver for our state I would be
 
03:02:45.790 --> 03:02:45.800 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions any
 
03:02:48.830 --> 03:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
questions for our speaker
 
03:02:50.710 --> 03:02:50.720 align:start position:0%

03:02:50.720 --> 03:02:51.990 align:start position:0%

thank

03:02:51.990 --> 03:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:03:10.910 --> 03:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:14.630 --> 03:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
Liberty is it on you have to turn it so
 
03:03:17.910 --> 03:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
the red lights on there you go um hello
 
03:03:20.150 --> 03:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
everyone my name is Ryan Li Liberty I am
 
03:03:22.389 --> 03:03:22.399 align:start position:0%
an eighth grader at Boral school I first
 
03:03:25.190 --> 03:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
started wake wake surfing on vacation
 
03:03:28.469 --> 03:03:28.479 align:start position:0%
back in 2018 when I was 8 my family and
 
03:03:30.269 --> 03:03:30.279 align:start position:0%
I loved it so much we decided to get our
 
03:03:32.950 --> 03:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
own boat our family has gotten into wake
 
03:03:34.349 --> 03:03:34.359 align:start position:0%
surfing and we do a lot of wak surfing
 
03:03:36.590 --> 03:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire Lakes boating and wak
 
03:03:38.110 --> 03:03:38.120 align:start position:0%
surfing has been a way for us to spend
 
03:03:39.950 --> 03:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
time together as a family get off our
 
03:03:42.030 --> 03:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
screens and do the sport we live I am
 
03:03:45.229 --> 03:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
here in support of Senate Bill
 
03:03:47.790 --> 03:03:47.800 align:start position:0%
431 I am here in favor of Senate bill
 
03:03:50.429 --> 03:03:50.439 align:start position:0%
431 because I think this will make wake
 
03:03:52.349 --> 03:03:52.359 align:start position:0%
suring safer without being pushed into
 
03:03:54.870 --> 03:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
the middle I am also for this bill
 
03:03:57.710 --> 03:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
because the restrictions now are 150 ft
 
03:03:58.950 --> 03:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
the restrictions for this bill would
 
03:04:00.990 --> 03:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
only be 50 more feet away from other
 
03:04:03.469 --> 03:04:03.479 align:start position:0%
boats and dogs it doesn't ban us like
 
03:04:05.070 --> 03:04:05.080 align:start position:0%
other bills try
 
03:04:07.550 --> 03:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
to 200 ft would work well on a lot of
 
03:04:09.429 --> 03:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire lakes that I surf on and
 
03:04:10.670 --> 03:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
give everyone enough room to keep
 
03:04:13.590 --> 03:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
everyone safe I think this bill would be
 
03:04:15.389 --> 03:04:15.399 align:start position:0%
good for everyone that lives on the
 
03:04:18.750 --> 03:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
lakes on or for so ERS like me and for
 
03:04:20.229 --> 03:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
everyone else who goes out and enjoys
 
03:04:22.269 --> 03:04:22.279 align:start position:0%
the water I appreciate your time and
 
03:04:24.150 --> 03:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
consideration thank
 
03:04:27.150 --> 03:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
you would you take questions uh yeah
 
03:04:29.830 --> 03:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
sure okay anyone have questions from
 
03:04:32.910 --> 03:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
Miss L Liberty presentative
 
03:04:35.550 --> 03:04:35.560 align:start position:0%
Ryan thank you very much for your um
 
03:04:37.790 --> 03:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you for taking my
 
03:04:40.269 --> 03:04:40.279 align:start position:0%
question do you have any consideration
 
03:04:44.349 --> 03:04:44.359 align:start position:0%
at all to 300 feet um I think for a lot
 
03:04:46.550 --> 03:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
of the lakes that I surf on 300 feet
 
03:04:48.229 --> 03:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:04:53.269 --> 03:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
um too much for like the lakes that I
 
03:04:55.710 --> 03:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
surf on because I surf on lakes that are
 
03:04:57.389 --> 03:04:57.399 align:start position:0%
closer to my
 
03:05:00.950 --> 03:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
area thank you very much excellent job

have any concern about the deterioration
 
03:05:17.030 --> 03:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
of Lake quality have you seen any
 
03:05:20.750 --> 03:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
changes in your years on the
 
03:05:23.630 --> 03:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
lake for um my years on the lake I
 
03:05:25.590 --> 03:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
haven't seen that much of deterioration
 
03:05:29.070 --> 03:05:29.080 align:start position:0%

testimony speaking against Sheila Burke
 
03:06:34.269 --> 03:06:34.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:41.269 --> 03:06:41.279 align:start position:0%

Sheila Burke and yes I head up a uh a
 
03:06:52.630 --> 03:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
large group of kayakers known as
 
03:06:54.710 --> 03:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
kayaking Lakes Region New Hampshire and
 
03:06:57.150 --> 03:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
Beyond we are heading into our fifth
 
03:07:01.510 --> 03:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
season coming up uh and we have roughly
 
03:07:04.349 --> 03:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
200 people in that group we kayak all
 
03:07:07.750 --> 03:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
over New Hampshire also into Vermont
 
03:07:07.760 --> 03:07:08.790 align:start position:0%
over New Hampshire also into Vermont
into

03:07:08.790 --> 03:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
into
 
03:07:11.429 --> 03:07:11.439 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh and sometimes even out
 
03:07:15.030 --> 03:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
to Maine I also sit on the public Waters
 
03:07:18.750 --> 03:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
access Advisory Board uh and I am in the
 
03:07:21.590 --> 03:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
non-motorized Boating chair position
 
03:07:25.309 --> 03:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
there and am a lifelong kayaker 30 years
 
03:07:28.670 --> 03:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
in and Counting so today I thought I
 
03:07:31.150 --> 03:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
would just provide some anecdotal
 
03:07:32.830 --> 03:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
support for some of the commentary
 
03:07:35.469 --> 03:07:35.479 align:start position:0%
that's been made about the safety uh
 
03:07:37.630 --> 03:07:37.640 align:start position:0%
that can be impacted for kayakers when
 
03:07:39.429 --> 03:07:39.439 align:start position:0%
we're talking about wake
 
03:07:39.439 --> 03:07:41.229 align:start position:0%
we're talking about wake
Surfers

03:07:41.229 --> 03:07:41.239 align:start position:0%
Surfers
 
03:07:45.030 --> 03:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
um and and before I go further I just
 
03:07:46.389 --> 03:07:46.399 align:start position:0%
would like to say thank you for hearing
 
03:07:49.269 --> 03:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
my oppos opposition to this bill uh we
 
03:07:51.110 --> 03:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
know that it does not represent a
 
03:07:53.229 --> 03:07:53.239 align:start position:0%
reasonable compromise to preserve and
 
03:07:56.190 --> 03:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
restore the health of our Lakes uh and
 
03:07:57.870 --> 03:07:57.880 align:start position:0%
it should be
 
03:07:57.880 --> 03:07:59.630 align:start position:0%
it should be
amended

03:07:59.630 --> 03:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
amended
 
03:08:02.590 --> 03:08:02.600 align:start position:0%
um as others have said before me you
 
03:08:05.429 --> 03:08:05.439 align:start position:0%
know kayakers do tend to sort of hug the
 
03:08:08.269 --> 03:08:08.279 align:start position:0%
shorelines of a lot of the Lakes um
 
03:08:10.309 --> 03:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
rather than go into that Center Channel
 
03:08:11.830 --> 03:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
where there tends to be lots of boat
 
03:08:14.429 --> 03:08:14.439 align:start position:0%
traffic which can be hazardous uh and
 
03:08:16.910 --> 03:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
with wake surfing out there it can be
 
03:08:22.469 --> 03:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
even more so um also you know I I guess
 
03:08:25.670 --> 03:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
goes without saying that um the
 
03:08:29.110 --> 03:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
shorelines and and uh animal life around
 
03:08:31.550 --> 03:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
the the Lakes as well is impacted as
 
03:08:34.389 --> 03:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
others have said so um anyway my
 
03:08:37.990 --> 03:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
personal story is as I said anecdotal
 
03:08:41.030 --> 03:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
but last season I was pulling my boat up
 
03:08:43.590 --> 03:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
off of uh the water down at cattle
 
03:08:46.070 --> 03:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
Landing Lake winaki which is where I
 
03:08:47.950 --> 03:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
live and
 
03:08:50.070 --> 03:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
um you know without any warning
 
03:08:53.429 --> 03:08:53.439 align:start position:0%
whatsoever a tsunami style wave came
 
03:08:55.670 --> 03:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
sort of you know barreling up from
 
03:08:59.150 --> 03:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
behind me knocked me sideways swamped
 
03:09:02.389 --> 03:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
the boat and necessitated my friends to
 
03:09:04.670 --> 03:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
kind of come forward and help you know
 
03:09:06.870 --> 03:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
put the the water out of the boat help
 
03:09:09.269 --> 03:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
me get right and you know get back on my
 
03:09:10.469 --> 03:09:10.479 align:start position:0%
way and pulling the boat out of the
 
03:09:13.110 --> 03:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
water looking back uh out across the
 
03:09:15.309 --> 03:09:15.319 align:start position:0%
water we saw a wake booat that had been
 
03:09:18.510 --> 03:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
sort of zooming through uh the Catal
 
03:09:21.269 --> 03:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
landing area and bear Island which is a
 
03:09:24.110 --> 03:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
very small kind of you know bottleneck
 
03:09:25.950 --> 03:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
right there it's it's rather deep but
 
03:09:27.269 --> 03:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
someone was zooming through there was
 
03:09:30.349 --> 03:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
and so about 200 feet offshore maybe
 
03:09:32.190 --> 03:09:32.200 align:start position:0%
even a little bit more was where this
 
03:09:34.950 --> 03:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
boat was so this is really just some
 
03:09:38.110 --> 03:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
personal evidence that this kind of wave
 
03:09:41.349 --> 03:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
action really can do some damage I'm not
 
03:09:44.070 --> 03:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
a small person you know and I'm pretty
 
03:09:46.190 --> 03:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
strong but to have been almost knocked
 
03:09:48.830 --> 03:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
over by this wave is actually quite
 
03:09:52.710 --> 03:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
quite um disturbing so you know that's
 
03:09:55.190 --> 03:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
really the story I wanted to share today
 
03:09:57.510 --> 03:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh we know too that others in the group
 
03:09:59.950 --> 03:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
who do the kayaking in other re other
 
03:10:02.750 --> 03:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
regions have commented on the same thing
 
03:10:05.550 --> 03:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
I hear stories all the time about the uh
 
03:10:07.910 --> 03:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
safety concerns that kayakers have when
 
03:10:13.030 --> 03:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
it comes to wake surfing um you know had
 
03:10:16.030 --> 03:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
the um you know had I not been sort of
 
03:10:17.990 --> 03:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
on my feet too with you know what
 
03:10:19.550 --> 03:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
happened at Catal Landing this this
 
03:10:20.710 --> 03:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
incident could have been a lot more
 
03:10:23.349 --> 03:10:23.359 align:start position:0%
serious so really that's it I mean for
 
03:10:25.830 --> 03:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
this reason I am in opposition to this
 
03:10:28.830 --> 03:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
bill um I again believe it should be
 
03:10:31.389 --> 03:10:31.399 align:start position:0%
amended um According to some of the
 
03:10:32.910 --> 03:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
testimony that we've heard from others
 
03:10:36.469 --> 03:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
such as Andrea and uh I realized this is
 
03:10:39.429 --> 03:10:39.439 align:start position:0%
a rather complex problem that's been
 
03:10:41.070 --> 03:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
sort of longstanding there's been a lot
 
03:10:44.309 --> 03:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
of debate so that's all I can add to the
 
03:10:46.229 --> 03:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
discussion today and I would be happy to
 
03:10:48.630 --> 03:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
take some questions if there are
 
03:10:52.870 --> 03:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
any any questions representative Darby
 
03:10:55.150 --> 03:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um as a member of the
 
03:10:57.469 --> 03:10:57.479 align:start position:0%
public water access Advisory Board you
 
03:10:59.870 --> 03:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you recognize the importance of
 
03:11:02.429 --> 03:11:02.439 align:start position:0%
maintaining public access to to our
 
03:11:05.510 --> 03:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
Waters so what do you recommend for
 
03:11:08.550 --> 03:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
sharing you know non-motorized kayaking
 
03:11:10.790 --> 03:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
as well as you know wak surf uh and
 
03:11:12.950 --> 03:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
other motorized uh sports like
 
03:11:15.990 --> 03:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
wakeboarding and water skiing how can
 
03:11:19.269 --> 03:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
those be shared sharing in terms of so
 
03:11:20.990 --> 03:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
everybody so can everybody can enjoy the
 
03:11:25.309 --> 03:11:25.319 align:start position:0%
water yeah yeah uh look I I think if I
 
03:11:27.790 --> 03:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
had my brothers would go the the way of
 
03:11:30.469 --> 03:11:30.479 align:start position:0%
Vermont and Maine you know Vermont as as
 
03:11:32.670 --> 03:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
we've talked about earlier today um
 
03:11:34.790 --> 03:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
happens to have the most restrictive uh
 
03:11:37.389 --> 03:11:37.399 align:start position:0%
wake surfing regulations in the country
 
03:11:39.469 --> 03:11:39.479 align:start position:0%
uh we know that that came about as a lot
 
03:11:42.389 --> 03:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
of Grassroots activity and uh you know
 
03:11:45.389 --> 03:11:45.399 align:start position:0%
took a while to come to the to the four
 
03:11:47.870 --> 03:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
uh but yeah that would be my ideal
 
03:11:50.710 --> 03:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
um but you know this is New Hampshire
 
03:11:52.190 --> 03:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
and we have a whole different style
 
03:11:53.910 --> 03:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
different way of going about business
 
03:11:56.269 --> 03:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
and you know certainly I'm a huge
 
03:11:59.309 --> 03:11:59.319 align:start position:0%
proponent of of increasing maintaining
 
03:12:01.670 --> 03:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
restoring access to all the water bodies
 
03:12:03.070 --> 03:12:03.080 align:start position:0%
across the lake so your question is a
 
03:12:05.950 --> 03:12:05.960 align:start position:0%
very good one representative um you know
 
03:12:08.870 --> 03:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
we we do need to come to some sort of
 
03:12:11.190 --> 03:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
compromise uh solution here I think
 
03:12:13.429 --> 03:12:13.439 align:start position:0%
that's why we're all here today um and
 
03:12:16.190 --> 03:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
to cut to the chase I would be uh
 
03:12:19.229 --> 03:12:19.239 align:start position:0%
personally very gratified if I could see
 
03:12:23.910 --> 03:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
a 300t setback okay with you know some
 
03:12:25.950 --> 03:12:25.960 align:start position:0%
depth requirement there I would leave
 
03:12:28.630 --> 03:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
that to others to decide there's studies
 
03:12:30.229 --> 03:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
that would support you know varying
 
03:12:32.190 --> 03:12:32.200 align:start position:0%
depths we know Vermont is at a 15ot
 
03:12:34.870 --> 03:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
depth that' be ideal uh if that's
 
03:12:37.389 --> 03:12:37.399 align:start position:0%
possible great but 300 ft at a at a
 
03:12:39.750 --> 03:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
minimum for me for as a setback from the
 
03:12:42.990 --> 03:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
shore I think would be a good middle
 
03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:44.630 align:start position:0%
shore I think would be a good middle
ground

03:12:44.630 --> 03:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
ground
 
03:12:47.670 --> 03:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
sure anyone else
 
03:12:49.710 --> 03:12:49.720 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
03:13:09.590 --> 03:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:12.590 --> 03:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
Raymond thank you uh good afternoon the
 
03:13:14.150 --> 03:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
record I'm Steve Raymond of Manchester
 
03:13:16.150 --> 03:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm here today in support
 
03:13:18.630 --> 03:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
of Senate Bill 430 31 thank you for
 
03:13:20.710 --> 03:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
hearing from me I'd like to give you my
 
03:13:22.389 --> 03:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
perspective on the issue of wake boats
 
03:13:24.349 --> 03:13:24.359 align:start position:0%
and water sports based on my unique and
 
03:13:26.150 --> 03:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
relevant personal and professional
 
03:13:28.110 --> 03:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
background I'm a New Hampshire native
 
03:13:29.750 --> 03:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
and since 8 have spent my Summers on
 
03:13:32.070 --> 03:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
Lake winnisquam I grew up water skiing
 
03:13:34.710 --> 03:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
wakeboarding and tubing and uh my love
 
03:13:36.389 --> 03:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
of the lake started at a young age and
 
03:13:38.429 --> 03:13:38.439 align:start position:0%
has never gone away I competed
 
03:13:40.150 --> 03:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
nationally in wakeboarding in my younger
 
03:13:42.030 --> 03:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
years and had the opportunity to share
 
03:13:43.429 --> 03:13:43.439 align:start position:0%
my love of the sport with others and
 
03:13:46.150 --> 03:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
make lifelong friends I've also mentored
 
03:13:47.710 --> 03:13:47.720 align:start position:0%
many children through the years through
 
03:13:50.190 --> 03:13:50.200 align:start position:0%
the sport um I've actually owned a wake
 
03:13:52.670 --> 03:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
booat for 25 years so those who say it's
 
03:13:54.070 --> 03:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
just been around for a few that's
 
03:13:56.710 --> 03:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
inaccurate um wake Boo's been around for
 
03:14:00.110 --> 03:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
25 years or or even a little more about
 
03:14:01.910 --> 03:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
six years ago I started wake surfing as
 
03:14:03.510 --> 03:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
wake surfing is a great sport that can
 
03:14:05.710 --> 03:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
keep you active and healthy um you can
 
03:14:07.389 --> 03:14:07.399 align:start position:0%
experience it with a lot more people
 
03:14:09.190 --> 03:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
because it's less intimidating and it's
 
03:14:11.910 --> 03:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
very easy to learn um my 13-year-old
 
03:14:14.030 --> 03:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
daughter has wakeboarded and wake surf
 
03:14:15.950 --> 03:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
since 5 and absolutely loves her time in
 
03:14:18.150 --> 03:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
the water which we're also Avid paddle
 
03:14:20.190 --> 03:14:20.200 align:start position:0%
boarders so despite again what you've
 
03:14:22.389 --> 03:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
heard um we paddle board every morning
 
03:14:24.070 --> 03:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
on the lake every afternoon we're out
 
03:14:26.229 --> 03:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
there all the time um we love every
 
03:14:27.710 --> 03:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
aspect of our time on in the water
 
03:14:30.790 --> 03:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
whether motorized or non-motorized uh
 
03:14:32.550 --> 03:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
over the past 25 years I've worked
 
03:14:33.990 --> 03:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
exclusively in the environmental
 
03:14:36.110 --> 03:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
remediation industry um which
 
03:14:38.429 --> 03:14:38.439 align:start position:0%
specializes in the cleanup of impacted
 
03:14:41.349 --> 03:14:41.359 align:start position:0%
groundwater um surface water and soil
 
03:14:43.030 --> 03:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
I'm responsible for implementation of
 
03:14:44.349 --> 03:14:44.359 align:start position:0%
those types of projects around the
 
03:14:46.269 --> 03:14:46.279 align:start position:0%
country um many of those projects
 
03:14:48.429 --> 03:14:48.439 align:start position:0%
include restoration of wetlands and
 
03:14:50.550 --> 03:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
shorelines so because of this unique
 
03:14:52.229 --> 03:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
background I understand water related
 
03:14:55.269 --> 03:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
issues that impact our shorelines that
 
03:14:57.150 --> 03:14:57.160 align:start position:0%
are incorrectly being attributed to wake
 
03:14:59.190 --> 03:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
boats um by individuals or groups
 
03:15:02.110 --> 03:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
looking to restrict wake boats I hear
 
03:15:03.550 --> 03:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
opponents that they are concerned about
 
03:15:05.269 --> 03:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
damage to the environment as it pertains
 
03:15:07.469 --> 03:15:07.479 align:start position:0%
to erosion and impacts of private
 
03:15:09.429 --> 03:15:09.439 align:start position:0%
property and that's a major driver for
 
03:15:11.630 --> 03:15:11.640 align:start position:0%
the opposition that we're hearing today
 
03:15:13.590 --> 03:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
what I would hope opponents of wake
 
03:15:14.830 --> 03:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
boating are learning about are the
 
03:15:16.990 --> 03:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
number of other factors that contribute
 
03:15:19.070 --> 03:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
to erosion more than wakeboarding ever
 
03:15:21.389 --> 03:15:21.399 align:start position:0%
could these factors include improper
 
03:15:23.389 --> 03:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
development improper Shoreline
 
03:15:25.870 --> 03:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
improvements vegetation tree removal
 
03:15:29.030 --> 03:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
storm water runoff ice wind and water
 
03:15:31.670 --> 03:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
levels for example ice is a factor that
 
03:15:33.030 --> 03:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
many don't think of because they don't
 
03:15:35.590 --> 03:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
see it or understand it uh ice forms
 
03:15:38.229 --> 03:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
around the rocks in the winter um if
 
03:15:40.389 --> 03:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
water levels fluctuate it will pull
 
03:15:42.710 --> 03:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
rocks off the shore destabilizing the
 
03:15:45.030 --> 03:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
soil above or it can push rocks up onto
 
03:15:48.550 --> 03:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
the shore d destabilizing the soil Below
 
03:15:50.750 --> 03:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
in addition during the Spring thaw ice
 
03:15:53.590 --> 03:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
drifts moving due to Quick melting um or
 
03:15:55.870 --> 03:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
due to wind can pull up or push rocks
 
03:15:58.750 --> 03:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
and soil from the shore in addition to
 
03:16:00.750 --> 03:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
ice damage irrelevant over the past year
 
03:16:02.229 --> 03:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire due to higher than
 
03:16:05.030 --> 03:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
average rainfall and higher water levels
 
03:16:07.189 --> 03:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh erosion resulting from high water and
 
03:16:09.870 --> 03:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
wave action for sustained winds excuse
 
03:16:12.030 --> 03:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
me has caused significant erosion of
 
03:16:14.910 --> 03:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
shorelines in very short periods of time
 
03:16:16.990 --> 03:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
the constant battering of waves at a
 
03:16:19.229 --> 03:16:19.239 align:start position:0%
high velocity and frequency driven by
 
03:16:21.389 --> 03:16:21.399 align:start position:0%
the wind contributes significantly more
 
03:16:23.349 --> 03:16:23.359 align:start position:0%
impact to our shorelines than a wave
 
03:16:26.389 --> 03:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
from a boat can for example a boat wake
 
03:16:28.429 --> 03:16:28.439 align:start position:0%
surfing traveling up and down the lake
 
03:16:31.189 --> 03:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
over a period of time directs waves to a
 
03:16:33.309 --> 03:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
particular spot on Shore for a small
 
03:16:35.429 --> 03:16:35.439 align:start position:0%
fraction of time when the boat is moving
 
03:16:37.670 --> 03:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
right in front of that spot however
 
03:16:39.429 --> 03:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
during a high wind event and even more
 
03:16:42.150 --> 03:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
impactful a high wind in water event
 
03:16:43.910 --> 03:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
waves are directed at the shore for the
 
03:16:45.710 --> 03:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
entire period the wind is blowing in the
 
03:16:47.070 --> 03:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
direction of the shoreline being being
 
03:16:51.269 --> 03:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
impacted as an example um I've included
 
03:16:53.630 --> 03:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
some pictures in my testimony um this is
 
03:16:56.150 --> 03:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
from two recent storm events um in
 
03:16:58.710 --> 03:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
January this year on Lake winnisquam
 
03:17:00.550 --> 03:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
where more than a foot of soil was
 
03:17:01.990 --> 03:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
removed off of the beach and we're
 
03:17:03.590 --> 03:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
hearing this from a lot of homeowners on
 
03:17:05.510 --> 03:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
Lake winnisquam this has nothing to do
 
03:17:07.150 --> 03:17:07.160 align:start position:0%
with wake boats there was no one wake Bo
 
03:17:09.870 --> 03:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
boating in January this year um the high
 
03:17:11.830 --> 03:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
water levels in the Wind It causes
 
03:17:13.790 --> 03:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
significant erosion and these are the
 
03:17:15.950 --> 03:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
factors that you know you know really
 
03:17:17.790 --> 03:17:17.800 align:start position:0%
need to cons considered when hearing
 
03:17:20.269 --> 03:17:20.279 align:start position:0%
this testimony um the argument of
 
03:17:22.229 --> 03:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
restricting wake boats to prevent
 
03:17:24.269 --> 03:17:24.279 align:start position:0%
erosion I believe is being used by
 
03:17:26.030 --> 03:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
opponents as a scare tactic for those
 
03:17:27.790 --> 03:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
who are not familiar with the issue of
 
03:17:30.590 --> 03:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
shoreline erosion on New Hampshire Lakes
 
03:17:32.550 --> 03:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to tell you more or answer
 
03:17:34.830 --> 03:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you for hearing from
 
03:17:36.670 --> 03:17:36.680 align:start position:0%
me today and the time you all taking to
 
03:17:38.870 --> 03:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
learn more about the issues thank you
 
03:17:42.070 --> 03:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:45.070 --> 03:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
Raymond yes representative thank you uh
 
03:17:46.389 --> 03:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
03:17:46.399 --> 03:17:47.590 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
question

03:17:47.590 --> 03:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:17:51.030 --> 03:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
I've um I understand you've been wake
 
03:17:54.870 --> 03:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
boarding um for a long time um and I I
 
03:17:56.870 --> 03:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
was wondering um the this bill talks
 
03:17:59.550 --> 03:17:59.560 align:start position:0%
about wake surfing um and wake boarding
 
03:18:02.550 --> 03:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
is covered um under the the same
 
03:18:06.309 --> 03:18:06.319 align:start position:0%
restrictions as um as water scheme um it
 
03:18:08.670 --> 03:18:08.680 align:start position:0%
it involves holding onto a rope um
 
03:18:12.349 --> 03:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
typically jumping wakes and so I was um
 
03:18:14.550 --> 03:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
I was wondering when I think you said
 
03:18:16.189 --> 03:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
that you've been wake surfing for three
 
03:18:18.510 --> 03:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
years so I'm wondering when or six years
 
03:18:19.830 --> 03:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry so I'm wondering when you got
 
03:18:22.110 --> 03:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
the the Wake boat that allowed sort of
 
03:18:26.070 --> 03:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
the the um the large wakes directly
 
03:18:28.469 --> 03:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
behind the boat which is the definition
 
03:18:29.590 --> 03:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
of wake
 
03:18:31.910 --> 03:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
surfing yeah thank you for your question
 
03:18:33.670 --> 03:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
I I think some of it's a misconception
 
03:18:36.590 --> 03:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
so wake boating you actually want to do
 
03:18:38.150 --> 03:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
something similar to wake surfing you
 
03:18:39.910 --> 03:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
want a large wave because you're using
 
03:18:42.110 --> 03:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
the Wake as a basically a ramp just like
 
03:18:44.030 --> 03:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
if you were going off a ski jump or
 
03:18:47.269 --> 03:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
something like that uh on the slopes um
 
03:18:50.389 --> 03:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
so wake boats have been making larger
 
03:18:52.910 --> 03:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
wakes for years I think the bigger issue
 
03:18:56.070 --> 03:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
now is the popularity of wake surfing um
 
03:18:58.150 --> 03:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
it's so easy for people to do it's a lot
 
03:19:01.110 --> 03:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
of fun it's a great family sport indivi
 
03:19:02.910 --> 03:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
there are more individuals that are
 
03:19:04.950 --> 03:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
getting out there with wake surf boats
 
03:19:07.309 --> 03:19:07.319 align:start position:0%
on the lake the more boats you have the
 
03:19:09.870 --> 03:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
more people doing it you know more
 
03:19:11.830 --> 03:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
people may you know not like what they
 
03:19:14.269 --> 03:19:14.279 align:start position:0%
see but I think that that is what has
 
03:19:16.830 --> 03:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
attracted the attention is just the the
 
03:19:18.870 --> 03:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
quantity of people doing it and just you
 
03:19:21.269 --> 03:19:21.279 align:start position:0%
know our Lakes have gotten busier um you
 
03:19:24.150 --> 03:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:27.990 --> 03:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
Years thank you any other questions
 
03:19:30.750 --> 03:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
representative rang thank you Mr chair
 
03:19:33.429 --> 03:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
03:19:35.030 --> 03:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
you had in your in your written
 
03:19:36.550 --> 03:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
testimony and thank you for providing
 
03:19:38.870 --> 03:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
that you said that you've from what
 
03:19:41.910 --> 03:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
you've read and heard it uh erosion
 
03:19:43.710 --> 03:19:43.720 align:start position:0%
seems to be incorrectly attributed to
 
03:19:45.870 --> 03:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
wake boating can you cite some of those
 
03:19:49.590 --> 03:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
sources um that you know show you know
 
03:19:50.830 --> 03:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
that you've read that wake boating
 
03:19:53.389 --> 03:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't contribute to those issues so I
 
03:19:55.950 --> 03:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm saying my testimony is
 
03:19:58.910 --> 03:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
that you I've I've been involved in
 
03:20:00.990 --> 03:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
these hearings for some years um
 
03:20:02.750 --> 03:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
individuals always come up and they're
 
03:20:04.910 --> 03:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
talking about erosion and erosion being
 
03:20:07.550 --> 03:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
attributed to wake boats my professional
 
03:20:09.870 --> 03:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
experience is in you know what I do what
 
03:20:11.469 --> 03:20:11.479 align:start position:0%
and my time I've spent on the Lakes
 
03:20:13.990 --> 03:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
growing up what I do for work I think
 
03:20:16.910 --> 03:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's a misrepresentation that wake
 
03:20:20.309 --> 03:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
are cusing this shoreline erosion I you
 
03:20:22.229 --> 03:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
know there are so many other factors
 
03:20:24.590 --> 03:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
that contribute to erosion and I think
 
03:20:27.790 --> 03:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
also if you look at any boating in
 
03:20:30.710 --> 03:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
general boats have the ability to make a
 
03:20:32.950 --> 03:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
large wake even non wake boats I mean
 
03:20:35.510 --> 03:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
you go on wiip or cipe or Winn
 
03:20:38.510 --> 03:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
Squam Squam on a weekend there are boats
 
03:20:41.590 --> 03:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
going every which direction boats tubing
 
03:20:45.070 --> 03:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
causing wakes so to to say that that you
 
03:20:47.429 --> 03:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
know now is what's causing these erosion
 
03:20:50.870 --> 03:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
problems I think is what individuals are
 
03:20:53.309 --> 03:20:53.319 align:start position:0%
using because it has an effect right who
 
03:20:54.990 --> 03:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
sits in this room and hears you know
 
03:20:56.630 --> 03:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
erosion and thinks oh who cares about
 
03:20:58.670 --> 03:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
erosion on our Lakes we all care about
 
03:21:01.710 --> 03:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
it I think it's being used as a reason
 
03:21:06.030 --> 03:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
to ban wake boats and not and and
 
03:21:08.670 --> 03:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
not I I guess I guess that's my my
 
03:21:10.309 --> 03:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
feeling and that my my professional
 
03:21:12.189 --> 03:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
opinion you know my my professional
 
03:21:14.710 --> 03:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
experience is that these other factors
 
03:21:16.389 --> 03:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
contribute more you know no one looks at
 
03:21:18.070 --> 03:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
the development all the people that
 
03:21:19.349 --> 03:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
aren't following the shorelands
 
03:21:21.349 --> 03:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
protection act go along all these lakes
 
03:21:22.550 --> 03:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
and look at the development that's
 
03:21:24.950 --> 03:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
occurring there's less soft shorelines
 
03:21:26.590 --> 03:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
there's more rigid shorelines right
 
03:21:28.189 --> 03:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
people build these big retaining walls
 
03:21:30.030 --> 03:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
on their property that doesn't allow
 
03:21:32.389 --> 03:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
waves to actually like lose velocity it
 
03:21:33.870 --> 03:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
just bounces them right back into the
 
03:21:36.110 --> 03:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
lake there's a lot of factors that
 
03:21:38.630 --> 03:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
contribute and um I don't think people
 
03:21:40.950 --> 03:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
are looking at those issues as a whole
 
03:21:43.630 --> 03:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Khan then
 
03:21:46.630 --> 03:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
representative wolf thank you Mr chair
 
03:21:49.870 --> 03:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
Derby can you shut off your mic thanks
 
03:21:51.830 --> 03:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Raymond for taking my
 
03:21:55.349 --> 03:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
question uh question is if you you live
 
03:21:57.110 --> 03:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
show that you live in Manchester
 
03:21:59.550 --> 03:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
newshire and if you live near the lake
 
03:22:02.229 --> 03:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
just say Lake wi nasaki and you are a
 
03:22:04.189 --> 03:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
property owner would you have the same
 
03:22:06.630 --> 03:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
feeling uh that what you are saying
 
03:22:08.950 --> 03:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
because some of the things uh that we
 
03:22:11.830 --> 03:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
are hearing here about the loan
 
03:22:13.910 --> 03:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
preservation you know if you can mention
 
03:22:16.150 --> 03:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
that is the loan is endangered you know
 
03:22:18.590 --> 03:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
in this situation yeah thank you for
 
03:22:20.349 --> 03:22:20.359 align:start position:0%
your question so I am a property owner
 
03:22:23.990 --> 03:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
on Lake winnisquam um my my family has
 
03:22:25.870 --> 03:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
been on the lake I actually was lucky
 
03:22:28.189 --> 03:22:28.199 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough years ago to get my own
 
03:22:30.590 --> 03:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
property in the lake so I do understand
 
03:22:34.389 --> 03:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
um the issues um I remember being as a
 
03:22:36.229 --> 03:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
kid if we saw a loon it was like the
 
03:22:38.269 --> 03:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
greatest thing in the world and now you
 
03:22:40.269 --> 03:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
know we see loons you know quite
 
03:22:43.590 --> 03:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
frequently um he mentioned chicks I can
 
03:22:45.030 --> 03:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
tell you that the people that do water
 
03:22:46.990 --> 03:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
sports on Lake Winn Squad
 
03:22:48.429 --> 03:22:48.439 align:start position:0%
they know when there's chicks and
 
03:22:50.910 --> 03:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
everyone will stop immediately and go by
 
03:22:53.630 --> 03:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
if and go by at no wake speed I can tell
 
03:22:55.269 --> 03:22:55.279 align:start position:0%
you there's a lot of people that just
 
03:22:56.870 --> 03:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
drive their boats around and they will
 
03:22:58.550 --> 03:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
fly right through those chicks like they
 
03:23:01.030 --> 03:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
don't even know they exist I think most
 
03:23:04.110 --> 03:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
water sports enthusiasts are we love the
 
03:23:05.790 --> 03:23:05.800 align:start position:0%
lake that's why we're on the lake we we
 
03:23:08.269 --> 03:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
care for the lake we so you know I I
 
03:23:10.469 --> 03:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
like to think that most are stewards of
 
03:23:13.110 --> 03:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
the lake but just like anything there's
 
03:23:14.750 --> 03:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
individuals that come and they don't
 
03:23:16.950 --> 03:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
follow the rules um they don't know what
 
03:23:18.269 --> 03:23:18.279 align:start position:0%
they're doing they probably shouldn't be
 
03:23:21.510 --> 03:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
out in any boat and a lot of times um
 
03:23:23.429 --> 03:23:23.439 align:start position:0%
that that will you know give a bad wrap
 
03:23:27.429 --> 03:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
to the sport because of you know few bad
 
03:23:30.830 --> 03:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
activ representative wolf thank you Mr
 
03:23:34.269 --> 03:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
chair and uh thank you for taking my
 
03:23:36.950 --> 03:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
question I understand that there are
 
03:23:40.030 --> 03:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
many many factors that are affecting a
 
03:23:43.750 --> 03:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
lake run off from roads run off from
 
03:23:47.550 --> 03:23:47.560 align:start position:0%
gutters in a house um
 
03:23:50.150 --> 03:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
all types of things that affect erosion
 
03:23:53.590 --> 03:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
that affect water quality
 
03:23:57.790 --> 03:23:57.800 align:start position:0%
Etc there he there seems to be quite a
 
03:24:00.830 --> 03:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
difference here of opinion would you
 
03:24:03.670 --> 03:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
think in your professional experience
 
03:24:07.389 --> 03:24:07.399 align:start position:0%
that reducing the distance from Shore
 
03:24:10.550 --> 03:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
would help not completely solve the
 
03:24:13.830 --> 03:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
problem but be a step in the right
 
03:24:16.550 --> 03:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
direction from an erosion standpoint I
 
03:24:18.870 --> 03:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
think not at all I I don't think that
 
03:24:22.309 --> 03:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
would help at all if if you go to any
 
03:24:24.110 --> 03:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
Lake in New Hampshire on a day where we
 
03:24:26.630 --> 03:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
have 20 mph sustained
 
03:24:30.269 --> 03:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
winds and and watch the water pound on
 
03:24:33.030 --> 03:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
the shore and then go watch waves from a
 
03:24:34.469 --> 03:24:34.479 align:start position:0%
wake booat hit the
 
03:24:36.910 --> 03:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
shore it'd be very difficult for me to
 
03:24:38.590 --> 03:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
say wow that's what's contributing to
 
03:24:38.600 --> 03:24:40.070 align:start position:0%
say wow that's what's contributing to
the

03:24:40.070 --> 03:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:24:42.550 --> 03:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
erosion follow up and then
 
03:24:45.750 --> 03:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative l montain i I'm not
 
03:24:47.590 --> 03:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
03:24:50.670 --> 03:24:50.680 align:start position:0%
the natural phenomenon that occur like
 
03:24:53.790 --> 03:24:53.800 align:start position:0%
high winds MH high water levels last
 
03:24:55.830 --> 03:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
summer that we had that were
 
03:24:57.830 --> 03:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
extraordinary and I'm not saying that
 
03:25:02.550 --> 03:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
you stop weights but would you improve
 
03:25:02.560 --> 03:25:03.910 align:start position:0%
you stop weights but would you improve
the

03:25:03.910 --> 03:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:25:07.309 --> 03:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
situation if you did not if you mov the
 
03:25:09.030 --> 03:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
Wake further
 
03:25:12.469 --> 03:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
out I guess in all due respect I don't
 
03:25:14.269 --> 03:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
understand what situation we'd be trying
 
03:25:16.710 --> 03:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
to improve at that point by just moving
 
03:25:20.750 --> 03:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
another 100 ft out okay thank you
 
03:25:22.790 --> 03:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
present BL
 
03:25:26.790 --> 03:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
montain thank you um would you consider
 
03:25:29.830 --> 03:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
it such an imposition to move it another
 
03:25:34.389 --> 03:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
100 feet out to say 300 feet in order to
 
03:25:37.349 --> 03:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps protect people who are trying to
 
03:25:43.710 --> 03:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
swim or paddle or kayak close to the
 
03:25:47.110 --> 03:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
shore so in my case thank you on my case
 
03:25:50.229 --> 03:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
in Lake Winter Squam likely not but on
 
03:25:52.349 --> 03:25:52.359 align:start position:0%
many lakes in New Hampshire yes and
 
03:25:54.510 --> 03:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
there there is a safety Factor like
 
03:25:55.950 --> 03:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
everyone's saying the more you push
 
03:25:58.189 --> 03:25:58.199 align:start position:0%
boats into the middle the more congested
 
03:26:00.790 --> 03:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
that is I mean I I also hear like the
 
03:26:05.229 --> 03:26:05.239 align:start position:0%
safety of kayakers and paddle borders I
 
03:26:07.110 --> 03:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know that many kayakers paddle
 
03:26:09.429 --> 03:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
borders that only hug the shore within
 
03:26:11.670 --> 03:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
you know 20 feet of the shore they like
 
03:26:14.110 --> 03:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
to go across the lake through the lake
 
03:26:17.550 --> 03:26:17.560 align:start position:0%
so I I guess are we going to make a zone
 
03:26:19.990 --> 03:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
for K I mean so when a if a kayaker is
 
03:26:22.349 --> 03:26:22.359 align:start position:0%
out in the middle of the lake it's my
 
03:26:24.429 --> 03:26:24.439 align:start position:0%
job as a motorized boat owner to make
 
03:26:26.030 --> 03:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
sure that I am staying a certain
 
03:26:29.389 --> 03:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
distance away from them so just pushing
 
03:26:31.710 --> 03:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
us more like everyone has to share the
 
03:26:34.030 --> 03:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
water I guess from like a kaying and
 
03:26:36.630 --> 03:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
safety a kaying point I don't see how
 
03:26:38.469 --> 03:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
pushing people further out into the
 
03:26:40.950 --> 03:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
middle makes it any safer unless you're
 
03:26:42.950 --> 03:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
going to tell me that you know kayaks
 
03:26:44.550 --> 03:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
are only going to stay within 50 ft of
 
03:26:46.790 --> 03:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
shore now so that people can wake Boo in
 
03:26:48.710 --> 03:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
the middle of the lake I mean it's a
 
03:26:50.469 --> 03:26:50.479 align:start position:0%
it's a sharing of the resource there's
 
03:26:52.750 --> 03:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
rules in place quite honestly and I'm
 
03:26:54.469 --> 03:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
sure when you talk to Marine Patrol the
 
03:26:56.030 --> 03:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
biggest thing is enforcing the current
 
03:26:59.070 --> 03:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
rules if people follow the rules it's
 
03:27:02.389 --> 03:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
safe and it's protective of of the
 
03:27:07.630 --> 03:27:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:10.910 --> 03:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
don't thank you any other questions
 
03:27:12.510 --> 03:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you for your testimony
 
03:27:16.870 --> 03:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:19.229 --> 03:27:19.239 align:start position:0%
in opposition as written Elizabeth
 
03:27:37.670 --> 03:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:41.269 --> 03:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
Association there we go all right um my
 
03:27:42.630 --> 03:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
name is Elizabeth Harper I'm the
 
03:27:44.349 --> 03:27:44.359 align:start position:0%
executive director of the lake sopy
 
03:27:46.269 --> 03:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
protective Association where a non
 
03:27:48.870 --> 03:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
profit organization that focuses on

preserving and enhancing the

environmental Integrity of the lake sopy
 
03:27:55.469 --> 03:27:55.479 align:start position:0%
Watershed we have over 900 members um
 
03:27:56.990 --> 03:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
before joining lspa I was an
 
03:27:58.910 --> 03:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
environmental science professor at New
 
03:28:01.469 --> 03:28:01.479 align:start position:0%
England college for seven years uh and
 
03:28:02.950 --> 03:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
before that I was a professor of
 
03:28:05.750 --> 03:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
fisheries and wildlife biology at pulsus
 
03:28:08.150 --> 03:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
College in the ader andex um I'm here
 
03:28:10.830 --> 03:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
today to ask you to oppose s SP 431 is
 
03:28:12.750 --> 03:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
written and to consider amending the
 
03:28:15.070 --> 03:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
bill to provide meaningful protection
 
03:28:17.309 --> 03:28:17.319 align:start position:0%
for a shared water
 
03:28:19.349 --> 03:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
resources the environmental impacts
 
03:28:21.150 --> 03:28:21.160 align:start position:0%
caused by wake surfing have devastating
 
03:28:22.830 --> 03:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
long-term consequences that are
 
03:28:24.910 --> 03:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
completely avoidable I think that
 
03:28:26.550 --> 03:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
completely avoidable part is really
 
03:28:28.750 --> 03:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
important we heard a long list of all of
 
03:28:30.229 --> 03:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
the stressors to our lakes in the
 
03:28:32.309 --> 03:28:32.319 align:start position:0%
previous testimony those are absolutely
 
03:28:34.950 --> 03:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
of concern some of those things we can
 
03:28:36.790 --> 03:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
prevent we can control some of them are
 
03:28:38.830 --> 03:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
much more challenging too this is an
 
03:28:41.110 --> 03:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity here to address one of the
 
03:28:44.510 --> 03:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
many issues that threatens our Lakes the
 
03:28:46.550 --> 03:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
200 foot setback proposed by us
 
03:28:48.910 --> 03:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
431 doesn't represent a meaningful
 
03:28:51.070 --> 03:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
compromise the best available science
 
03:28:53.550 --> 03:28:53.560 align:start position:0%
suggests that setbacks of 500 to 1,000
 
03:28:55.990 --> 03:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
ft are needed to mitigate these impacts
 
03:28:57.429 --> 03:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
and that wake surfing should not take
 
03:28:59.389 --> 03:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
place in waters that are less than 20 ft
 
03:29:03.670 --> 03:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
deep anything less than a 300t setback
 
03:29:06.349 --> 03:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
with a 10-ft average depth doesn't
 
03:29:09.229 --> 03:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
provide any meaningful improvement from
 
03:29:12.189 --> 03:29:12.199 align:start position:0%
what we have now 50 ft added to that
 
03:29:13.790 --> 03:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
distance really doesn't provide a
 
03:29:17.670 --> 03:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:20.309 --> 03:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
the study that Fay at all did that has
 
03:29:22.189 --> 03:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
been promoted by the wakes sport
 
03:29:25.910 --> 03:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
industry is widely cited um as
 
03:29:28.429 --> 03:29:28.439 align:start position:0%
justifying that 200 foot setback and
 
03:29:30.229 --> 03:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
it's considered to be exceptionally poor
 
03:29:32.070 --> 03:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
science I won't go into the details
 
03:29:34.229 --> 03:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
Harry vogle did an excellent job of
 
03:29:36.349 --> 03:29:36.359 align:start position:0%

perspective on on that very flawed study
 
03:29:41.550 --> 03:29:41.560 align:start position:0%
the recommendation to limit wake Sports
 
03:29:43.950 --> 03:29:43.960 align:start position:0%
to areas 500 ft from shorelines with
 
03:29:45.870 --> 03:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
depths of 20 ft on bodies of water at
 
03:29:47.469 --> 03:29:47.479 align:start position:0%
least at least 50 acres has been
 
03:29:49.030 --> 03:29:49.040 align:start position:0%

and numerous scientific studies the best
 
03:29:58.110 --> 03:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
science is summarized very well in a
 
03:30:00.550 --> 03:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
thorough literature review of over 50

Natural Resources in July
 
03:30:09.070 --> 03:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
2023 the science is pretty clear in
 
03:30:12.870 --> 03:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
terms of the impacts and what we need to
 
03:30:15.510 --> 03:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
do um I understand that sometimes
 
03:30:17.429 --> 03:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
compromise is necessary but if we're
 
03:30:19.750 --> 03:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
going to make compromises it needs to
 
03:30:22.070 --> 03:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
involve a meaningful Improvement and 200
 
03:30:25.389 --> 03:30:25.399 align:start position:0%
ft doesn't represent that um I won't
 
03:30:26.830 --> 03:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
belabor other points that have already
 
03:30:30.510 --> 03:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
been covered but um I'm happy to answer
 
03:30:32.630 --> 03:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
questions this time I'm going to ask a
 
03:30:35.630 --> 03:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
question thank you for taking it um you
 
03:30:37.710 --> 03:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned 500 feet you mentioned 300
 
03:30:39.950 --> 03:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
feet the bill says 200 feet I know
 
03:30:41.750 --> 03:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
someone's going to ask you so I will
 
03:30:44.349 --> 03:30:44.359 align:start position:0%
would you support a 300
 
03:30:46.870 --> 03:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
foot yeah so would say that we could
 
03:30:49.910 --> 03:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
consider a 300 foot distance to be a
 
03:30:51.910 --> 03:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
meaningful Improvement on our existing
 
03:30:53.710 --> 03:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
regulations I wouldn't say that it's
 
03:30:55.590 --> 03:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
sufficient um but I would say that it
 
03:30:57.590 --> 03:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
would represent a meaningful Improvement
 
03:30:59.309 --> 03:30:59.319 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for the
 
03:31:01.950 --> 03:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
speaker representative Darby and
 
03:31:04.389 --> 03:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
represent um thank you Mr chair um thank
 
03:31:05.630 --> 03:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
03:31:08.870 --> 03:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
question um you you talked early in your
 
03:31:11.469 --> 03:31:11.479 align:start position:0%
testimony about I think you said
 
03:31:14.229 --> 03:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
devastating long-term consequences can
 
03:31:16.870 --> 03:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
you talk about um how the lake would
 
03:31:19.150 --> 03:31:19.160 align:start position:0%
actually repair itself and how long it
 
03:31:21.070 --> 03:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
would take to repair itself if there is
 
03:31:25.229 --> 03:31:25.239 align:start position:0%
no change you know well these things are
 
03:31:27.550 --> 03:31:27.560 align:start position:0%
always complicated but I think the the
 
03:31:28.990 --> 03:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
areas that I'm most concerned about are
 
03:31:31.070 --> 03:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
these small lakes there are small lakes
 
03:31:34.309 --> 03:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
where even one wake booat acting
 
03:31:36.590 --> 03:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
irresponsibly could completely destroy
 
03:31:38.630 --> 03:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
the fish habitat that's available even
 
03:31:42.309 --> 03:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
in just a single season um restoring
 
03:31:45.189 --> 03:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
fish habitat is not simple it's not
 
03:31:45.199 --> 03:31:46.550 align:start position:0%
fish habitat is not simple it's not
inexpensive

03:31:46.550 --> 03:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
inexpensive
 
03:31:49.389 --> 03:31:49.399 align:start position:0%
of you disturb sediment and that can
 
03:31:51.630 --> 03:31:51.640 align:start position:0%
create cyanobacteria blooms that can
 
03:31:55.030 --> 03:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
alter the entire food chain um zop
 
03:31:56.389 --> 03:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
Plankton and phytoplankton are the base
 
03:31:58.750 --> 03:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
of the food chain in these systems when
 
03:32:00.950 --> 03:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
you start to change the nutrient loads
 
03:32:03.429 --> 03:32:03.439 align:start position:0%
of these Lakes it it's not something
 
03:32:05.389 --> 03:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
that just changing your actions in the
 
03:32:08.309 --> 03:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
future can fix they're ecosystems that
 
03:32:11.229 --> 03:32:11.239 align:start position:0%
once Disturbed many times oftentimes
 
03:32:12.790 --> 03:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
can't be returned to their original
 
03:32:12.800 --> 03:32:16.710 align:start position:0%
can't be returned to their original
state

03:32:16.710 --> 03:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:19.870 --> 03:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
followup thank you Mr chair um thanks
 
03:32:23.710 --> 03:32:23.720 align:start position:0%
again um you you referenced the uh um
 
03:32:25.469 --> 03:32:25.479 align:start position:0%
University of Michigan study with over
 
03:32:28.910 --> 03:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
50 sources um can you state how many of
 
03:32:32.550 --> 03:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
those sources claimed that uh 200 ft was
 
03:32:32.560 --> 03:32:39.189 align:start position:0%
those sources claimed that uh 200 ft was
sufficient

03:32:39.189 --> 03:32:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:42.630 --> 03:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
none thank you Mr chair um can you tell
 
03:32:45.189 --> 03:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
me I've been thinking about this since
 
03:32:47.830 --> 03:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
Andre was speaking
 
03:32:52.189 --> 03:32:52.199 align:start position:0%
earlier how long was the 200 foot ban in
 
03:32:54.309 --> 03:32:54.319 align:start position:0%
place in the state of Maine and what
 
03:32:56.870 --> 03:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
precipitated what caused them to rewrite
 
03:32:59.750 --> 03:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
the legislation and to add another 100
 
03:33:01.590 --> 03:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
ft to that
 
03:33:05.630 --> 03:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
law I don't know the length of time um
 
03:33:08.990 --> 03:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
but I think similarly as for many many
 
03:33:10.830 --> 03:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
states and it's not just Maine and and
 
03:33:12.510 --> 03:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
Vermont and you know that have been
 
03:33:14.030 --> 03:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
discussing this or Michigan there's
 
03:33:15.510 --> 03:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
States all over the country that have
 
03:33:17.630 --> 03:33:17.640 align:start position:0%
have lakes that have been concerned and
 
03:33:19.110 --> 03:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
I you know they're hearing the same
 
03:33:20.229 --> 03:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
thing that we are in our Lake
 
03:33:22.429 --> 03:33:22.439 align:start position:0%
Associations a lot of people that are
 
03:33:24.910 --> 03:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about the impacts of these
 
03:33:27.189 --> 03:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
boats environmentally and from a safety
 
03:33:29.870 --> 03:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
perspective and once there's a lot of
 
03:33:31.950 --> 03:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
public concern then there's an interest
 
03:33:34.349 --> 03:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
in diving into the science the way that
 
03:33:35.910 --> 03:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
this works in different states in some
 
03:33:38.269 --> 03:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
states it's you know Department of
 
03:33:40.189 --> 03:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
Natural Resources that's responsible for
 
03:33:42.750 --> 03:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
doing that study and bringing a bill to
 
03:33:44.429 --> 03:33:44.439 align:start position:0%
um to the house in New Hampshire it
 
03:33:46.389 --> 03:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
works a little bit differently
 
03:33:48.590 --> 03:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
um and so it's it's the process is
 
03:33:49.910 --> 03:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
different in different states but in
 
03:33:51.870 --> 03:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
general it's a large number of members
 
03:33:54.830 --> 03:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
of the public raising concerns and then
 
03:33:58.189 --> 03:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
that leads us people in our position to
 
03:33:59.710 --> 03:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
delve into the science and to see what
 
03:34:01.630 --> 03:34:01.640 align:start position:0%
the issue is and then to try to work
 
03:34:03.030 --> 03:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
with folks like you to come up with a
 
03:34:03.040 --> 03:34:05.070 align:start position:0%
with folks like you to come up with a
reasonable

03:34:05.070 --> 03:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
03:34:08.030 --> 03:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
solution representative Ron thank you Mr
 
03:34:09.429 --> 03:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:34:12.510 --> 03:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
question um the previous speaker made
 
03:34:14.510 --> 03:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
some comments that we've heard from many
 
03:34:18.189 --> 03:34:18.199 align:start position:0%
other uh people about that wake boats
 
03:34:21.790 --> 03:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
aren't really a a a relevant contributor
 
03:34:23.790 --> 03:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
to erosion and Shoreline issues that
 
03:34:27.110 --> 03:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
it's ice high water uh wind things like
 
03:34:29.630 --> 03:34:29.640 align:start position:0%
that can what from your scientific
 
03:34:31.429 --> 03:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
perspective and from your role on Lake
 
03:34:34.670 --> 03:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
copy can you comment about the relative
 
03:34:37.429 --> 03:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
um impact wake surfing has relative to
 
03:34:39.389 --> 03:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
those other natural
 
03:34:41.790 --> 03:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
components yeah I mean I think it is
 
03:34:43.269 --> 03:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
really important that we all recognize
 
03:34:45.309 --> 03:34:45.319 align:start position:0%
that there are a huge number of factors
 
03:34:46.990 --> 03:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
all of those things that you listed that
 
03:34:48.870 --> 03:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
can cause erosion and the more
 
03:34:50.389 --> 03:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
development that we have you know just
 
03:34:51.830 --> 03:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
as one of the previous speakers
 
03:34:54.229 --> 03:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
explained um you know the more erosion
 
03:34:57.030 --> 03:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
we do have the what wake boats are doing
 
03:34:59.429 --> 03:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
the the energy and the waves that they
 
03:35:01.229 --> 03:35:01.239 align:start position:0%
can produce they don't always it depends
 
03:35:03.150 --> 03:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
on how they're being used but they can
 
03:35:06.349 --> 03:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
produce wakes that have high energy and
 
03:35:07.990 --> 03:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's not even the height of the
 
03:35:09.710 --> 03:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
Waves that's the issue it's the power
 
03:35:11.950 --> 03:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
it's the energy that's in those waves
 
03:35:13.550 --> 03:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
and the force with which it hits the
 
03:35:16.710 --> 03:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
shoreline and that is at a much higher
 
03:35:18.389 --> 03:35:18.399 align:start position:0%
rate and if you want to dig into the
 
03:35:21.309 --> 03:35:21.319 align:start position:0%
numbers it's it's in that study but um
 
03:35:23.510 --> 03:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
it it's much greater than many of those
 
03:35:25.070 --> 03:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
other impacts it doesn't mean that those
 
03:35:27.189 --> 03:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
other impacts aren't important and don't
 
03:35:29.150 --> 03:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
have have impacts but just because those
 
03:35:31.189 --> 03:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
are are important impacts doesn't mean
 
03:35:32.750 --> 03:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
that weight boats don't cause those
 
03:35:34.349 --> 03:35:34.359 align:start position:0%
problems as
 
03:35:37.229 --> 03:35:37.239 align:start position:0%
well thank you any other
 
03:35:39.550 --> 03:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
03:35:42.389 --> 03:35:42.399 align:start position:0%
thank you you want to just do
 
03:35:46.229 --> 03:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
the want to speak right but do you want
 
03:35:46.239 --> 03:35:46.990 align:start position:0%
the want to speak right but do you want
to

03:35:46.990 --> 03:35:47.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:35:47.000 --> 03:35:50.990 align:start position:0%
to
H

03:35:50.990 --> 03:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:54.590 --> 03:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to temporarily recess
 
03:35:57.630 --> 03:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
and I do have one two like five six more
 
03:35:59.990 --> 03:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
cards but if some of you were here
 
03:36:02.309 --> 03:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
earlier we have an amendment to a PRI
 
03:36:04.710 --> 03:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
bill so we're going to take a temporary
 
03:36:08.429 --> 03:36:08.439 align:start position:0%
recess until we finish the voting on The
 
03:36:10.150 --> 03:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
Pri bill then we're going to immediately
 
03:36:12.070 --> 03:36:12.080 align:start position:0%

copied the house version of the bill
 
03:45:32.910 --> 03:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
originally and cut out all the things
 
03:45:36.630 --> 03:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
about the loan and andn it's available
 
03:45:39.429 --> 03:45:39.439 align:start position:0%
now so you can write it yeah I'll do it
 
03:45:43.590 --> 03:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
so that's already done so no uh we close
 
03:45:45.550 --> 03:45:45.560 align:start position:0%
the hearing on how
 
03:45:47.830 --> 03:45:47.840 align:start position:0%

yours my apologies Mr chairman I was
 
03:46:42.990 --> 03:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
talking to uh captain
 
03:46:45.910 --> 03:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
dunlevy my name is uh John McDonald and
 
03:46:47.469 --> 03:46:47.479 align:start position:0%
I'm the representative from Carol

Hampshire I'm a lifelong resident of uh
 
03:46:55.149 --> 03:46:55.159 align:start position:0%
wolf pretty much since I was about two
 
03:46:57.349 --> 03:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
years old I guess so that's lifelong and
 
03:46:59.269 --> 03:46:59.279 align:start position:0%
I'm in support of this uh this
 
03:47:01.389 --> 03:47:01.399 align:start position:0%
particular Bill SP
 
03:47:04.229 --> 03:47:04.239 align:start position:0%
431 um if you know me I'm also a strong
 
03:47:07.070 --> 03:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
supporter of uh boing safety keeping our
 
03:47:08.790 --> 03:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
legs clean and other the important
 
03:47:10.830 --> 03:47:10.840 align:start position:0%
things that are important to our our
 
03:47:13.910 --> 03:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
Lakes uh I'm not an engineer but I do
 
03:47:15.790 --> 03:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
have some boating experience
 
03:47:17.590 --> 03:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
I graduated from the United States Coast
 
03:47:19.950 --> 03:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
Guard safe boarding school I worked in
 
03:47:22.110 --> 03:47:22.120 align:start position:0%
the marol for many years in fact uh I
 
03:47:24.269 --> 03:47:24.279 align:start position:0%
was one of the people that hired Captain
 
03:47:26.189 --> 03:47:26.199 align:start position:0%
dunlevy so if you're wondering where he
 
03:47:28.030 --> 03:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
got all that knowledge you're looking at
 
03:47:32.790 --> 03:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
it right here uh over my career my law
 
03:47:34.149 --> 03:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement career I've done a lot of
 
03:47:35.429 --> 03:47:35.439 align:start position:0%
issues that have been involved in the
 
03:47:37.950 --> 03:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
boting some that pretty important I was
 
03:47:39.910 --> 03:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
part of uh theing the moing program
 
03:47:42.550 --> 03:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
several years back uh the DB testing for
 
03:47:45.510 --> 03:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
boats uh the rafting rules and regul Rel
 
03:47:47.670 --> 03:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
basaki and probably one of the most
 
03:47:49.830 --> 03:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
important ones the ski craft which was
 
03:47:52.710 --> 03:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
the old jet skis and uh I went all over
 
03:47:55.070 --> 03:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
the state putting signs up prohibiting
 
03:47:57.830 --> 03:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
signs and also did a public hearings on
 
03:47:59.870 --> 03:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
approximately 30 bodies of water
 
03:48:02.070 --> 03:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
throughout the state uh I would go up on
 
03:48:03.510 --> 03:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
the state police plane hang out the
 
03:48:04.790 --> 03:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
window and take pictures of the lake
 
03:48:07.110 --> 03:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
with a with a camera it's pretty cool
 
03:48:08.349 --> 03:48:08.359 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that I learned
 
03:48:09.870 --> 03:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
from that whole program the ski craft
 
03:48:14.269 --> 03:48:14.279 align:start position:0%
one is uh how important education is uh
 
03:48:15.990 --> 03:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
you hardly ever hear any problems with
 
03:48:17.870 --> 03:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
jet Skys anymore and that's all due to
 
03:48:19.830 --> 03:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
education and I was impressed and one of
 
03:48:22.790 --> 03:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
the reason I co-signed this bill was uh
 
03:48:24.429 --> 03:48:24.439 align:start position:0%
some of the factors that are contained
 
03:48:26.990 --> 03:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
within it uh the most important one is
 
03:48:27.000 --> 03:48:28.149 align:start position:0%
within it uh the most important one is
probably

03:48:28.149 --> 03:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
probably
 
03:48:30.870 --> 03:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh the one that says uh less than 50
 
03:48:33.750 --> 03:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
acres I believe that section right there
 
03:48:35.429 --> 03:48:35.439 align:start position:0%
will probably eliminate around 800
 
03:48:36.750 --> 03:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
bodies of water in the state of New
 
03:48:38.510 --> 03:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from having this type of
 
03:48:40.990 --> 03:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
activity conducted on them uh if you get
 
03:48:42.870 --> 03:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
rid of that bill they're still open to
 
03:48:45.229 --> 03:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
these type of activities uh another one
 
03:48:47.189 --> 03:48:47.199 align:start position:0%
that I support is the 200 ft of the
 
03:48:48.630 --> 03:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
shoreline of the dock we've heard a lot
 
03:48:50.950 --> 03:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
of talk about that it should be 300 it
 
03:48:53.710 --> 03:48:53.720 align:start position:0%
should be 500 uh New Hampshire is not
 
03:48:55.309 --> 03:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
the only state that's considering 200
 
03:48:57.950 --> 03:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
feet I think it's also uh Georgia
 
03:49:00.189 --> 03:49:00.199 align:start position:0%
Tennessee and South Carolina have a 200
 
03:49:02.550 --> 03:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
foot limit and then the most important
 
03:49:04.389 --> 03:49:04.399 align:start position:0%
one again is is the education part of it
 
03:49:05.790 --> 03:49:05.800 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Safety standing
 
03:49:07.950 --> 03:49:07.960 align:start position:0%
up and moving forward with uh providing
 
03:49:10.630 --> 03:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
education programs uh I know over the
 
03:49:13.910 --> 03:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
past year or so two years I usually go
 
03:49:15.670 --> 03:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
on to some of my local Mariners just to
 
03:49:17.910 --> 03:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
say hi and I've seen a lot of
 
03:49:21.229 --> 03:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
displays uh put on the Marin pushing the
 
03:49:24.269 --> 03:49:24.279 align:start position:0%
200t rule uh with Panthers and handouts
 
03:49:26.070 --> 03:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
and those things aren't cheap they
 
03:49:28.349 --> 03:49:28.359 align:start position:0%
didn't have to do that uh I would say
 
03:49:30.110 --> 03:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
they probably all the me put together
 
03:49:32.469 --> 03:49:32.479 align:start position:0%
probably close to $100,000 they put in
 
03:49:34.469 --> 03:49:34.479 align:start position:0%
education and I just don't think that
 
03:49:37.149 --> 03:49:37.159 align:start position:0%
we've given them enough time to get the
 
03:49:41.070 --> 03:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
word out about the 200 fet uh also in
 
03:49:44.830 --> 03:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
the uh my lustrious Creo on Lin basaki I
 
03:49:48.429 --> 03:49:48.439 align:start position:0%
was a captain of a a tourbo 65t TBO that
 
03:49:50.910 --> 03:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
was just recently sold and we go out
 
03:49:52.950 --> 03:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
every day and I can tell you about a Lon
 
03:49:55.429 --> 03:49:55.439 align:start position:0%
nest and around that loon nest every day
 
03:49:56.550 --> 03:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
there's on a nice sunny day there's
 
03:49:58.269 --> 03:49:58.279 align:start position:0%
probably 60 boats anchored around that
 
03:50:00.750 --> 03:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
lon's Nest so I don't think we can blame
 
03:50:03.189 --> 03:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
this all on Wake boats on that type of
 
03:50:03.199 --> 03:50:04.830 align:start position:0%
this all on Wake boats on that type of
activity

03:50:04.830 --> 03:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
activity
 
03:50:08.149 --> 03:50:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh I you've talked a lot about Vermont
 
03:50:10.830 --> 03:50:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh that is the strictest uh law in the
 
03:50:13.670 --> 03:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
in the United States at the present time
 
03:50:16.389 --> 03:50:16.399 align:start position:0%
there are only 32 bodies of water in the
 
03:50:19.030 --> 03:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
entire state of amont that can use have
 
03:50:21.309 --> 03:50:21.319 align:start position:0%
that type of activity all the other ones
 
03:50:24.670 --> 03:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
are banned just by the infl of that law
 
03:50:26.630 --> 03:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
um so I'd ask you to support this this
 
03:50:29.349 --> 03:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
bill uh don't change it let it go
 
03:50:30.710 --> 03:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
through Let It Go through for a couple
 
03:50:32.870 --> 03:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
years see how it works uh you know give
 
03:50:34.189 --> 03:50:34.199 align:start position:0%
the people the opportunity to get
 
03:50:36.830 --> 03:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
educated uh I would add if you're going
 
03:50:38.750 --> 03:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
to do an amendment do not put a depth
 
03:50:40.309 --> 03:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
requirement that's going to be
 
03:50:42.309 --> 03:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
impossible to prove in court if you give
 
03:50:44.870 --> 03:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
somebody a ticket uh none of the maps
 
03:50:46.590 --> 03:50:46.600 align:start position:0%
are accurate and it's just like getting
 
03:50:48.269 --> 03:50:48.279 align:start position:0%
a speeding ticket you're going to have
 
03:50:49.630 --> 03:50:49.640 align:start position:0%
to prove that you're certified to use
 
03:50:52.229 --> 03:50:52.239 align:start position:0%
the radar and the radar is certified and
 
03:50:54.110 --> 03:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
you can't prove depth by just bringing a
 
03:50:57.110 --> 03:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
map a liquin masaki a Squam a sunabe and
 
03:50:58.550 --> 03:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know showing that that depth on
 
03:51:01.870 --> 03:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
the map uh a lot of folks aren't aware
 
03:51:03.830 --> 03:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
of what we've got for depths on some of
 
03:51:08.349 --> 03:51:08.359 align:start position:0%
our Lakes uh Lake Quin basaki is 44,400
 
03:51:12.389 --> 03:51:12.399 align:start position:0%
Acres Squam Lake is 6,790 Acres Newfound
 
03:51:15.149 --> 03:51:15.159 align:start position:0%
lake is 4,450 Acres
 
03:51:16.830 --> 03:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
Lake witer Squam is
 
03:51:21.630 --> 03:51:21.640 align:start position:0%
4,237 acres and sop is 4,130 acres and
 
03:51:24.389 --> 03:51:24.399 align:start position:0%
then it drops down the next win's oopy
 
03:51:26.309 --> 03:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
uh Lake Wentworth great East Lake Conway
 
03:51:29.429 --> 03:51:29.439 align:start position:0%
Lake Mary meeting Moma Bo Lake uh Silver
 
03:51:31.830 --> 03:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
Lake Province Lake and then Walky W is
 
03:51:36.110 --> 03:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
at 928 Acres uh so we've still got some
 
03:51:37.710 --> 03:51:37.720 align:start position:0%
pretty good size lakes and I can't
 
03:51:40.269 --> 03:51:40.279 align:start position:0%
believe that uh this particular activity
 
03:51:43.030 --> 03:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
is damaging the uh the shoreline uh the
 
03:51:45.229 --> 03:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
way everyone is accusing of
 
03:51:48.070 --> 03:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh I guess the last thing I'll say is uh
 
03:51:50.990 --> 03:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
Dees uh I see their responsibility of
 
03:51:53.429 --> 03:51:53.439 align:start position:0%
protecting our shorelines and our lakes
 
03:51:55.550 --> 03:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
and on the letter that I got um they're
 
03:51:57.830 --> 03:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
staying neutral and it seems that
 
03:52:01.070 --> 03:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
they're okay with the 200 foot uh limit
 
03:52:04.110 --> 03:52:04.120 align:start position:0%
on the boats and uh again I I respect
 
03:52:05.469 --> 03:52:05.479 align:start position:0%
thees and I would think that if there
 
03:52:08.149 --> 03:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
was a problem with erosion pollution the
 
03:52:10.630 --> 03:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
environment on the Lakes they'd stay up
 
03:52:12.510 --> 03:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
step up and say yeah this is the problem
 
03:52:16.429 --> 03:52:16.439 align:start position:0%
got to address it thank you
 
03:52:18.269 --> 03:52:18.279 align:start position:0%
are there any questions by members of
 
03:52:18.279 --> 03:52:19.550 align:start position:0%
are there any questions by members of
the

03:52:19.550 --> 03:52:19.560 align:start position:0%

Mr chair and thank you representative
 
03:52:27.469 --> 03:52:27.479 align:start position:0%
for taking my question we've heard
 
03:52:30.469 --> 03:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
testimony um from a few people that 200
 
03:52:33.030 --> 03:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
feet is not protective and there is a
 
03:52:36.389 --> 03:52:36.399 align:start position:0%
suggestion to go to amend the bill to
 
03:52:39.309 --> 03:52:39.319 align:start position:0%
extend it to 300 feet if that Amendment
 
03:52:41.189 --> 03:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
came through would it be one you would
 
03:52:46.309 --> 03:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
support on the floor no thank you
 
03:52:48.630 --> 03:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
rep repres representative Darby thank
 
03:52:50.189 --> 03:52:50.199 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you representative

McDonald for taking my question um with
 
03:52:54.630 --> 03:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
respect to education um and best
 
03:52:59.110 --> 03:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
practices do you think that um that
 
03:53:00.910 --> 03:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
environmental imp potential
 
03:53:02.309 --> 03:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts could be
 
03:53:04.750 --> 03:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
considered in terms of the impacts and
 
03:53:04.760 --> 03:53:07.510 align:start position:0%
considered in terms of the impacts and
the

03:53:07.510 --> 03:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:10.149 --> 03:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
education yes they should I'm I'm
 
03:53:11.550 --> 03:53:11.560 align:start position:0%
positive they probably still do I've
 
03:53:12.990 --> 03:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
been done voting education for a while
 
03:53:14.790 --> 03:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure they must address the safe
 
03:53:16.550 --> 03:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
wakes the distance of the wakes the
 
03:53:19.309 --> 03:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
damage of the wakes and things like that
 
03:53:22.269 --> 03:53:22.279 align:start position:0%
yes thank you the
 
03:53:26.590 --> 03:53:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:31.550 --> 03:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
ltin um thank you given um how important
 
03:53:33.790 --> 03:53:33.800 align:start position:0%
the education is um will you be
 
03:53:37.070 --> 03:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
advocating for more um educational funds
 
03:53:41.389 --> 03:53:41.399 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Safety for this
 
03:53:45.269 --> 03:53:45.279 align:start position:0%
purpose uh yes I would um and also so
 
03:53:46.990 --> 03:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
when I we need more people to do
 
03:53:49.710 --> 03:53:49.720 align:start position:0%
education every law enforcement job is
 
03:53:51.550 --> 03:53:51.560 align:start position:0%
suffering because they can't hire police
 
03:53:53.910 --> 03:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
officers uh the time when I first
 
03:53:57.229 --> 03:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
started with Marine Patrol which was
 
03:54:00.950 --> 03:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
1977 we had 75 officers and now I think
 
03:54:03.229 --> 03:54:03.239 align:start position:0%
they're down to 14 or 15 so we've got to
 
03:54:05.550 --> 03:54:05.560 align:start position:0%
really try to attract uh more more
 
03:54:07.710 --> 03:54:07.720 align:start position:0%
people for enforcement of the laws you
 
03:54:09.550 --> 03:54:09.560 align:start position:0%
can pass all the laws you want but if
 
03:54:11.070 --> 03:54:11.080 align:start position:0%
you don't have anyone to enforce them
 
03:54:15.590 --> 03:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:18.590 --> 03:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
followup then will be you be advocating
 
03:54:21.110 --> 03:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
in the next budget to increase the
 
03:54:24.630 --> 03:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
funding for Marine Patrol officers and
 
03:54:29.550 --> 03:54:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:31.870 --> 03:54:31.880 align:start position:0%
okay is there any other questions by
 
03:54:33.429 --> 03:54:33.439 align:start position:0%
members of the committee they seeing
 
03:54:35.590 --> 03:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much thank you for
 
03:54:35.600 --> 03:54:36.550 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much thank you for
your

03:54:36.550 --> 03:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:54:39.309 --> 03:54:39.319 align:start position:0%
time I would also
 
03:54:43.070 --> 03:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh ask the committee members to restrict
 
03:54:45.149 --> 03:54:45.159 align:start position:0%
their questions to the contents of the
 
03:54:48.670 --> 03:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
bill and not uh somebody else's opinion
 
03:54:51.149 --> 03:54:51.159 align:start position:0%
on whatever you uh you know whether you
 
03:54:53.870 --> 03:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
like the stars or not who do you like on
 
03:54:58.590 --> 03:54:58.600 align:start position:0%
the next uh the next election
 
03:55:01.389 --> 03:55:01.399 align:start position:0%
uh is
 
03:55:04.790 --> 03:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:08.070 --> 03:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
York in
 
03:55:14.550 --> 03:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:16.830 --> 03:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
you can't be outside well I'll call the
 
03:55:16.840 --> 03:55:18.670 align:start position:0%
you can't be outside well I'll call the
next

03:55:18.670 --> 03:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
next
 
03:55:23.269 --> 03:55:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:31.550 --> 03:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:36.429 --> 03:55:36.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:39.590 --> 03:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
feeling um thank you I'm uh having me
 
03:55:42.309 --> 03:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
here allow me to speak um my name is
 
03:55:46.710 --> 03:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
Frank lame um uh I'm a homeowner on uh
 
03:55:48.870 --> 03:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
new in Newbury on Lake sopy I've been
 
03:55:51.670 --> 03:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
there for 20 years I'm also on the board
 
03:55:53.910 --> 03:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
of the lake sopy protective
 
03:55:56.710 --> 03:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
Association and I'm also the business
 
03:55:58.870 --> 03:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
and industries rep in business and
 
03:56:01.070 --> 03:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
industry associations representative to
 
03:56:03.750 --> 03:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
the Lakes management advisory Council
 
03:56:05.590 --> 03:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
and I would like to point out that the
 
03:56:09.149 --> 03:56:09.159 align:start position:0%
Lakes management advisories committee uh
 
03:56:12.830 --> 03:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
endorsed uh representative Tanner's bill
 
03:56:15.710 --> 03:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
with the 500 foot that back in the 20ft
 
03:56:19.269 --> 03:56:19.279 align:start position:0%
depth I'm a business owner and I been
 
03:56:21.389 --> 03:56:21.399 align:start position:0%
that way for 35 years and I'm Pro
 
03:56:24.710 --> 03:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
business and um for the Boating industry
 
03:56:27.349 --> 03:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
and the Marine trades but I think we
 
03:56:29.830 --> 03:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
have to uh get wake boats and uh wake
 
03:56:33.149 --> 03:56:33.159 align:start position:0%
surfing in particular uh within strong
 
03:56:37.590 --> 03:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
limits so that they uh can um coexist
 
03:56:40.309 --> 03:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
with us I have friends with wake boats
 
03:56:42.469 --> 03:56:42.479 align:start position:0%
and they follow rules and uh they stay
 
03:56:44.030 --> 03:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
away from the shore and it works out
 
03:56:44.040 --> 03:56:44.750 align:start position:0%
away from the shore and it works out
fine

03:56:44.750 --> 03:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
fine
 
03:56:49.189 --> 03:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
line um I would say that uh the report
 
03:56:51.750 --> 03:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
from the Marine industry presented uh
 
03:56:54.550 --> 03:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
from everything I've seen and heard is
 
03:56:58.309 --> 03:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
not valid uh the state biologist David
 
03:57:00.750 --> 03:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
Nells did testify during the Senate
 
03:57:03.149 --> 03:57:03.159 align:start position:0%
portion of this and did find that the
 
03:57:04.830 --> 03:57:04.840 align:start position:0%
Minnesota study was the most
 
03:57:07.830 --> 03:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and the most uh
 
03:57:10.469 --> 03:57:10.479 align:start position:0%
detailed um I wanted to point out one
 
03:57:13.309 --> 03:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
other thing and that's the cob bacteria
 
03:57:15.469 --> 03:57:15.479 align:start position:0%
in the state which is increasing uh
 
03:57:17.469 --> 03:57:17.479 align:start position:0%
Again David Neils is right on top of
 
03:57:20.309 --> 03:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
that and uh we've had a lot of blooms in
 
03:57:22.710 --> 03:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
the last few years and why are we while
 
03:57:25.429 --> 03:57:25.439 align:start position:0%
are we complaining about erosion and
 
03:57:28.349 --> 03:57:28.359 align:start position:0%
turning things up uh it basically turns
 
03:57:31.070 --> 03:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
up the nutrients phosphorus nitrogen
 
03:57:33.229 --> 03:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
that get trapped in that soil that's at
 
03:57:35.269 --> 03:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the lake and when it does
 
03:57:37.870 --> 03:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
it feeds things and cob bacteria is one
 
03:57:39.990 --> 03:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
of the strong things it does it does
 
03:57:42.389 --> 03:57:42.399 align:start position:0%
feed so I think that's something has
 
03:57:44.229 --> 03:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
been brought up and I wanted to put it
 
03:57:47.750 --> 03:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
put there um I don't think this you
 
03:57:49.830 --> 03:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
should look at this as an argument of us
 
03:57:52.229 --> 03:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
against them it's uh what we're trying
 
03:57:54.590 --> 03:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
to do is responsible voting and come up
 
03:57:57.309 --> 03:57:57.319 align:start position:0%
with rules that can satisfy both parties
 
03:58:00.269 --> 03:58:00.279 align:start position:0%
uh I have no problem I'm a sailor and I
 
03:58:01.870 --> 03:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
really don't like going across their big
 
03:58:04.990 --> 03:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
wakes but that's my problem okay I I can
 
03:58:07.790 --> 03:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
live with it as long as we follow rules
 
03:58:10.830 --> 03:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm for the 500t setback and I'm for
 
03:58:14.110 --> 03:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
the 24th depth regulation um thank for
 
03:58:16.550 --> 03:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
listening and I'll take any questions
 
03:58:19.429 --> 03:58:19.439 align:start position:0%
okay any questions by members of the
 
03:58:22.590 --> 03:58:22.600 align:start position:0%
committee representative R thank you Mr
 
03:58:24.670 --> 03:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
chair um and thank you for taking my
 
03:58:26.389 --> 03:58:26.399 align:start position:0%
question your last comment said you
 
03:58:28.990 --> 03:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
supported the 500 foot setback and I
 
03:58:31.590 --> 03:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
think 20 foot depth um this bill is
 
03:58:35.750 --> 03:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
about 200 foot setback um with no depth
 
03:58:38.469 --> 03:58:38.479 align:start position:0%
and so would you do you support this or
 
03:58:41.590 --> 03:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
a greater distance I I support a greater
 
03:58:44.389 --> 03:58:44.399 align:start position:0%
distance than 200 ft
 
03:58:48.870 --> 03:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:52.110 --> 03:58:52.120 align:start position:0%
ft any other questions seeing none thank
 
03:59:01.149 --> 03:59:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:04.990 --> 03:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:06.950 --> 03:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
bill John
 
03:59:17.070 --> 03:59:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:18.469 --> 03:59:18.479 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
03:59:20.830 --> 03:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is John Wally you
 
03:59:23.710 --> 03:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
probably remember that by now um I was
 
03:59:25.389 --> 03:59:25.399 align:start position:0%
going to read this to you but that's
 
03:59:26.910 --> 03:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
going to be really boring and it's being
 
03:59:29.030 --> 03:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
passed around and I feel as though my
 
03:59:30.469 --> 03:59:30.479 align:start position:0%
experience on the water has a lot of
 
03:59:33.070 --> 03:59:33.080 align:start position:0%
value to this conversation so um I'm
 
03:59:35.910 --> 03:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
going to start off with 200 uh we are in
 
03:59:37.389 --> 03:59:37.399 align:start position:0%
support of 200 it seems to be this
 
03:59:39.269 --> 03:59:39.279 align:start position:0%
confusion of who's supporting 200 and
 
03:59:41.309 --> 03:59:41.319 align:start position:0%
supporting 500 and 300 and I don't know
 
03:59:43.110 --> 03:59:43.120 align:start position:0%
but the Marine trades Association
 
03:59:44.910 --> 03:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
supports 200 feet
 
03:59:46.990 --> 03:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
uh I want to point out that boating as a
 
03:59:50.030 --> 03:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
whole also has safe passage 150 ft we
 
03:59:52.070 --> 03:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
can all agree upon that correct and
 
03:59:53.590 --> 03:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
boats Don't just run across the
 
03:59:56.189 --> 03:59:56.199 align:start position:0%
shoreline at 150 fet from Shore they go
 
03:59:57.870 --> 03:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
out in the middle they go in different
 
03:59:59.309 --> 03:59:59.319 align:start position:0%
places they go to dinner they do all
 
04:00:01.830 --> 04:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
these different things just like 200
 
04:00:04.389 --> 04:00:04.399 align:start position:0%
feet will do it creates a new minimum
 
04:00:07.349 --> 04:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
standard but people and in my position
 
04:00:08.910 --> 04:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
as a person that works at the marinas
 
04:00:10.750 --> 04:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
it's my job to teach people about their
 
04:00:13.229 --> 04:00:13.239 align:start position:0%
boats how to operate them correctly best
 
04:00:16.389 --> 04:00:16.399 align:start position:0%
practices and what not so we preach hey
 
04:00:17.990 --> 04:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
go further from Shore if you have the
 
04:00:19.990 --> 04:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity but not everybody has that
 
04:00:22.149 --> 04:00:22.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity some Blakes are smaller some
 
04:00:25.830 --> 04:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
LS are bigger some are stuck in Coes and
 
04:00:28.830 --> 04:00:28.840 align:start position:0%
200 fet as far as they can go our goal
 
04:00:31.349 --> 04:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
with this bill is to never have somebody
 
04:00:33.670 --> 04:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
be banned or restricted from their lake
 
04:00:35.070 --> 04:00:35.080 align:start position:0%
that is the number one goal of the nire
 
04:00:36.550 --> 04:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
Marine TR Association it's not to sell
 
04:00:38.670 --> 04:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
boats anything is a people have boats
 
04:00:40.590 --> 04:00:40.600 align:start position:0%
and have the right to go boting support
 
04:00:42.910 --> 04:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
that 200 fet again is a standard is a
 
04:00:44.750 --> 04:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
minimum people will surf at 300 feet
 
04:00:46.030 --> 04:00:46.040 align:start position:0%
they'll surf at 400 feet they'll surf at
 
04:00:47.990 --> 04:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
1,000 feet they'll put their waves and
 
04:00:49.269 --> 04:00:49.279 align:start position:0%
focus them away from the shoreline
 
04:00:51.030 --> 04:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
because we teach them that every person
 
04:00:53.189 --> 04:00:53.199 align:start position:0%
that buys a boat gets an orientation and
 
04:00:55.189 --> 04:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
the time in the boat it teaches them
 
04:00:55.199 --> 04:00:56.309 align:start position:0%
the time in the boat it teaches them
best

04:00:56.309 --> 04:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
best
 
04:00:58.590 --> 04:00:58.600 align:start position:0%
practices um we've heard a lot about
 
04:01:00.309 --> 04:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
water Clarity today also and I'm going
 
04:01:02.269 --> 04:01:02.279 align:start position:0%
to tell you a little story uh I've Had
 
04:01:05.030 --> 04:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
The Good Fortune to live um on the water
 
04:01:07.710 --> 04:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
my mother and had a property water and
 
04:01:09.630 --> 04:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
my goal when I was a kid was to run off
 
04:01:12.189 --> 04:01:12.199 align:start position:0%
my dock as fast as I possibly could dive
 
04:01:13.550 --> 04:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
into the water and swim as far as I
 
04:01:16.189 --> 04:01:16.199 align:start position:0%
could under W my eyes open last summer
 
04:01:18.269 --> 04:01:18.279 align:start position:0%
in about July there was a significant
 
04:01:20.950 --> 04:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
rain event and I was at my mom's house
 
04:01:22.389 --> 04:01:22.399 align:start position:0%
thought I'd do the same thing ran off
 
04:01:23.990 --> 04:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
our dock soon as far as I could open my
 
04:01:26.229 --> 04:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
water and the minute my eyes opened up
 
04:01:27.149 --> 04:01:27.159 align:start position:0%
it was
 
04:01:29.670 --> 04:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
brown Alton Bay is very clear that's
 
04:01:31.910 --> 04:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
what her home is exceptionally Clear
 
04:01:34.550 --> 04:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
Water it was brown I didn't know where I
 
04:01:38.269 --> 04:01:38.279 align:start position:0%
was there was the rain event bark mulch
 
04:01:40.110 --> 04:01:40.120 align:start position:0%
dirt everything washed into Al Bay and
 
04:01:42.550 --> 04:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
ALT Bay was brown for two weeks and
 
04:01:44.349 --> 04:01:44.359 align:start position:0%
during those two weeks of that same time
 
04:01:46.110 --> 04:01:46.120 align:start position:0%
there was a significant cob bacteria
 
04:01:48.630 --> 04:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
Bloom at the end of Alton Bay at a place
 
04:01:50.269 --> 04:01:50.279 align:start position:0%
called downing's Landing which is a boat
 
04:01:52.550 --> 04:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
ramp and basically at end of all Bay is
 
04:01:54.750 --> 04:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
a funnel there's a river that feeds into
 
04:01:56.830 --> 04:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
it it's all hilly and the all comes down
 
04:01:57.990 --> 04:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
so all that
 
04:02:00.070 --> 04:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
sedimentation fertilizer whatever you
 
04:02:02.389 --> 04:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
want to call it ran into this no wake
 
04:02:04.309 --> 04:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
zone which is about 400 feet long and
 
04:02:05.950 --> 04:02:05.960 align:start position:0%
created a c of bacteria Bloom there's no
 
04:02:08.269 --> 04:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
wake surfing in that area it's a no wake
 
04:02:11.149 --> 04:02:11.159 align:start position:0%
zone so my point is this is that if
 
04:02:12.910 --> 04:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
there's no wake surfing boats you can't
 
04:02:14.670 --> 04:02:14.680 align:start position:0%
point to a wake surf boat and saying
 
04:02:16.229 --> 04:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
that it caused a bloom at the end of
 
04:02:18.590 --> 04:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
Alton Bay Where The Boat Ramp was and
 
04:02:20.309 --> 04:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
didn't also cause the whole lake or
 
04:02:23.070 --> 04:02:23.080 align:start position:0%
Alton Bay I should say to turn brown I
 
04:02:24.790 --> 04:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
mean it was brown brown like that wall
 
04:02:26.309 --> 04:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
you couldn't
 
04:02:28.429 --> 04:02:28.439 align:start position:0%
see so those are the things I want to
 
04:02:30.670 --> 04:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
point on today funny little story at the
 
04:02:33.910 --> 04:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
end of this my daughter loves loons and
 
04:02:36.269 --> 04:02:36.279 align:start position:0%
my dad passed away in 2008 he was the
 
04:02:38.550 --> 04:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
sole or one of the primary sponsors of
 
04:02:40.630 --> 04:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
the education of Border safety back in
 
04:02:43.870 --> 04:02:43.880 align:start position:0%
2000 I'm going to guess I probably 1997
 
04:02:46.389 --> 04:02:46.399 align:start position:0%
and I was 16 years old so we joke about
 
04:02:49.070 --> 04:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
my dad being reincarnated as a loon so
 
04:02:50.910 --> 04:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
one day we were out wake surfing my
 
04:02:52.349 --> 04:02:52.359 align:start position:0%
daughter fell and we're kind of hanging
 
04:02:54.070 --> 04:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
around she's Gathering herself to get up
 
04:02:55.670 --> 04:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
again and all of a sudden the loom pops
 
04:02:57.830 --> 04:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
up next to our boat wanted to see what
 
04:02:59.110 --> 04:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
was going on we all kind of laughed and
 
04:03:01.750 --> 04:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
said oh there scle mic so loons seemed
 
04:03:04.710 --> 04:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
to be you know smart creatures this one
 
04:03:06.590 --> 04:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
came right up to us and looked at our
 
04:03:09.189 --> 04:03:09.199 align:start position:0%
Bel and said hey this looks like fun
 
04:03:11.710 --> 04:03:11.720 align:start position:0%
maybe that's ironic I don't know um
 
04:03:14.990 --> 04:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
again we we support this bill 20 feet is
 
04:03:16.910 --> 04:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
a great minimum standard allow the New
 
04:03:18.590 --> 04:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Marine trades to continue to
 
04:03:21.229 --> 04:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
preach our wake responsibly campaign
 
04:03:22.990 --> 04:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
educate consumers and do all the things
 
04:03:25.070 --> 04:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
that we've done since 1996 that b
 
04:03:26.750 --> 04:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
education has improved and all the
 
04:03:27.950 --> 04:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
things that can happen better for our
 
04:03:29.950 --> 04:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
Lakes let's not make it worse let's that
 
04:03:31.469 --> 04:03:31.479 align:start position:0%
make it restrictive I love people to
 
04:03:33.349 --> 04:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
have fun with their families and both
 
04:03:37.389 --> 04:03:37.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:40.950 --> 04:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
you any questions by members of the
 
04:03:43.590 --> 04:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
committee representative Derby followed
 
04:03:43.600 --> 04:03:44.229 align:start position:0%
committee representative Derby followed
by

04:03:44.229 --> 04:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:03:46.269 --> 04:03:46.279 align:start position:0%
representative thank thank you Mr chair
 
04:03:48.510 --> 04:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um for taking my question
 
04:03:51.309 --> 04:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
there's been some criticism about the um
 
04:03:53.790 --> 04:03:53.800 align:start position:0%
about the Marine trade study and so I
 
04:03:55.870 --> 04:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
was um wondering if you wanted to
 
04:03:59.110 --> 04:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
respond with criticism about the other
 
04:04:01.269 --> 04:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
studies reference for example by the UN
 
04:04:04.070 --> 04:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
University of Michigan study or um
 
04:04:06.110 --> 04:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
responses to the criticism of the Marine
 
04:04:07.550 --> 04:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
trade study itself you want to give any
 
04:04:09.389 --> 04:04:09.399 align:start position:0%
feedback on that again this isn't the
 
04:04:11.910 --> 04:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
Marine trade study um we're all going to
 
04:04:13.830 --> 04:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
have an opinion on this we're all all
 
04:04:15.309 --> 04:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
going to poke holes in this study and
 
04:04:16.630 --> 04:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
that study and someone's going to say
 
04:04:17.750 --> 04:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
the sky is blue today but someone's
 
04:04:19.910 --> 04:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
going to say the clouds are out too um I
 
04:04:20.870 --> 04:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
think we're all working for the same
 
04:04:22.710 --> 04:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
goal you know we want to find a balance
 
04:04:24.790 --> 04:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
we want to find a compromise 200 feet we
 
04:04:25.990 --> 04:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
are compromising the state of New
 
04:04:28.269 --> 04:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has 150 foot setback or a safe
 
04:04:30.269 --> 04:04:30.279 align:start position:0%
passage some things have none let's just
 
04:04:31.710 --> 04:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
imagine that right now in the state of
 
04:04:33.670 --> 04:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we had a zero safe passes
 
04:04:35.750 --> 04:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
off well 200 feet is a pretty good
 
04:04:37.269 --> 04:04:37.279 align:start position:0%
balance right everyone can they want to
 
04:04:39.630 --> 04:04:39.640 align:start position:0%
complain it's only 50 feet it's only 50
 
04:04:40.870 --> 04:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
feet because we have a safe passage of
 
04:04:43.830 --> 04:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
150 Florida has zero for my knowledge so
 
04:04:46.550 --> 04:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
200 ft is a great compromise you know
 
04:04:49.149 --> 04:04:49.159 align:start position:0%
people wanted to say last in
 
04:04:51.990 --> 04:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
2022 uh there was a bill that was
 
04:04:53.149 --> 04:04:53.159 align:start position:0%
focused on
 
04:04:55.710 --> 04:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
250 and then I think that same week if I
 
04:04:57.110 --> 04:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
recall correctly the Minnesota study
 
04:04:59.389 --> 04:04:59.399 align:start position:0%
came out and threw that out the window
 
04:05:02.590 --> 04:05:02.600 align:start position:0%
and everyone to amend 250 to 500 you
 
04:05:04.710 --> 04:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
know next year could be a th in two
 
04:05:07.229 --> 04:05:07.239 align:start position:0%
years it could be a 2,000 now with the
 
04:05:08.469 --> 04:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
Marine trades feels as though we're
 
04:05:10.269 --> 04:05:10.279 align:start position:0%
compromising at 200 regardless of the
 
04:05:13.269 --> 04:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
150t safe passage again that was passed
 
04:05:16.030 --> 04:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
long time go but big boats have been on
 
04:05:17.670 --> 04:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
these Lakes for a long time I welcome
 
04:05:19.070 --> 04:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
anyone to come to Silver Sands Marina
 
04:05:20.149 --> 04:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take you out and give
 
04:05:21.870 --> 04:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
you a tour over the lake and see our one
 
04:05:23.510 --> 04:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
of the 60 foot boats it's a privately
 
04:05:25.590 --> 04:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
own boat uh the 40 foot boats people
 
04:05:27.990 --> 04:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
live on in our Marina uh the Sophie sea
 
04:05:29.389 --> 04:05:29.399 align:start position:0%
the DOR sea
 
04:05:32.269 --> 04:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
their commercial tourism boats to go out
 
04:05:34.030 --> 04:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
those throw the biggest lake around if
 
04:05:35.670 --> 04:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
you go behind any one of those for the
 
04:05:37.149 --> 04:05:37.159 align:start position:0%
afternoon you're going to
 
04:05:39.469 --> 04:05:39.479 align:start position:0%
find people with jet skis and personal
 
04:05:42.389 --> 04:05:42.399 align:start position:0%
watercraft jumping those waves they make
 
04:05:44.149 --> 04:05:44.159 align:start position:0%
the biggest wave on the lake
 
04:05:47.349 --> 04:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:49.710 --> 04:05:49.720 align:start position:0%
wave for a
 
04:05:52.149 --> 04:05:52.159 align:start position:0%
followup thank you Mr chair I was
 
04:05:54.469 --> 04:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
wondering if um if your group has done
 
04:05:58.149 --> 04:05:58.159 align:start position:0%
any analysis on the difference between
 
04:06:01.550 --> 04:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
for example 200 and 300 feet and the um
 
04:06:04.269 --> 04:06:04.279 align:start position:0%
and any lakes that would
 
04:06:07.030 --> 04:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
not allow wake surfing because of that
 
04:06:09.630 --> 04:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
additional 100 feet we have not okay
 
04:06:09.640 --> 04:06:11.710 align:start position:0%
additional 100 feet we have not okay
thank

04:06:11.710 --> 04:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:06:18.590 --> 04:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
you any anyone else questions seeing
 
04:06:24.429 --> 04:06:24.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:28.149 --> 04:06:28.159 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr Welling and thank you
 
04:06:32.870 --> 04:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I don't think it's an
 
04:06:37.030 --> 04:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
issue of whether wake Vats cause
 
04:06:40.630 --> 04:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
erosion I think it's an
 
04:06:46.670 --> 04:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:49.910 --> 04:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
that could you expand on your question
 
04:06:51.429 --> 04:06:51.439 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer I just don't quite
 
04:06:53.670 --> 04:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
understand if you're we you going sorry
 
04:06:53.680 --> 04:06:55.070 align:start position:0%
understand if you're we you going sorry
I

04:06:55.070 --> 04:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:06:57.550 --> 04:06:57.560 align:start position:0%
don't what is your opinion on the
 
04:07:02.830 --> 04:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
various causes is each cause create
 
04:07:02.840 --> 04:07:04.469 align:start position:0%
various causes is each cause create
more

04:07:04.469 --> 04:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:07:07.710 --> 04:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
turbidity more more ground stuff that
 
04:07:11.189 --> 04:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
you couldn't see sure I mean that's the
 
04:07:14.469 --> 04:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
question is is it incremental
 
04:07:16.469 --> 04:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
is the Wake boat going to cause some
 
04:07:18.510 --> 04:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
erosion how could it not in some
 
04:07:20.790 --> 04:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
capacity just like a boat just like
 
04:07:22.189 --> 04:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
someone pulling an anchor just like
 
04:07:23.830 --> 04:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
someone like we we had a conversation
 
04:07:26.309 --> 04:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
about this at one point you know uh if
 
04:07:28.670 --> 04:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
you pull into a dock at a reasonable
 
04:07:29.950 --> 04:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
amount of speed on a rough day and you
 
04:07:31.910 --> 04:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
got to kind of set your boat between the
 
04:07:33.550 --> 04:07:33.560 align:start position:0%
two dock posts or whatnot and you got to
 
04:07:35.070 --> 04:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
put it in reverse you're going to turn
 
04:07:36.790 --> 04:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
the bottom up I mean it's just how the
 
04:07:39.149 --> 04:07:39.159 align:start position:0%
water is if you liveing a dock that has
 
04:07:40.429 --> 04:07:40.439 align:start position:0%
10 feet of water you're not going to do
 
04:07:41.590 --> 04:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
it if you have a dock that has three
 
04:07:43.870 --> 04:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
feet of water you're going to have some
 
04:07:46.269 --> 04:07:46.279 align:start position:0%
some sem of sediment that's going to get
 
04:07:48.070 --> 04:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
churned up whether it's sand or pine
 
04:07:50.469 --> 04:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
needles or leaves or or anything we had
 
04:07:52.990 --> 04:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
a customer years ago uh we worked on
 
04:07:54.710 --> 04:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
this boat put it in the water and he
 
04:07:57.429 --> 04:07:57.439 align:start position:0%
took it home and he called this irate my
 
04:08:00.189 --> 04:08:00.199 align:start position:0%
boat's overheating again and boat's cool
 
04:08:01.830 --> 04:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
water from the inside of the lake
 
04:08:04.429 --> 04:08:04.439 align:start position:0%
through their engines well as it
 
04:08:05.710 --> 04:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
happened and all he did was turned his
 
04:08:05.720 --> 04:08:07.189 align:start position:0%
happened and all he did was turned his
boat

04:08:07.189 --> 04:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
boat
 
04:08:10.990 --> 04:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
on he pulled all these Dead Leaves From
 
04:08:14.109 --> 04:08:14.119 align:start position:0%
The Bottom up into his
 
04:08:17.070 --> 04:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
call the intake of his boat it clogged
 
04:08:19.189 --> 04:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
the intake it didn't allow fresh water
 
04:08:21.910 --> 04:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
to cool the engine so we were fixing it
 
04:08:24.870 --> 04:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
again and he hadn't gone anywhere
 
04:08:27.149 --> 04:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
because the sediment or the leaves or
 
04:08:29.870 --> 04:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to say it was clogged
 
04:08:32.429 --> 04:08:32.439 align:start position:0%
this motor so there's always going to be
 
04:08:34.950 --> 04:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
some aspect of erosion whether it's wind
 
04:08:36.630 --> 04:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
driven waves that we talked about in the
 
04:08:40.269 --> 04:08:40.279 align:start position:0%
past um boats
 
04:08:42.910 --> 04:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
waves there's a multitude of things and
 
04:08:44.790 --> 04:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
the PIN
 
04:08:46.670 --> 04:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
less than I would say I'm I'm I'm
 
04:08:48.510 --> 04:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
estimating so bear with me on this one
 
04:08:49.550 --> 04:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
don't go look it up because I don't know
 
04:08:52.349 --> 04:08:52.359 align:start position:0%
if it's even be found but this less than
 
04:08:54.189 --> 04:08:54.199 align:start position:0%
2% of our boting registrations in the
 
04:08:56.469 --> 04:08:56.479 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that awakes our
 
04:08:58.750 --> 04:08:58.760 align:start position:0%
boats it's not a lot I mean it sounds
 
04:09:01.670 --> 04:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
like it nothing but it's it's not a lot
 
04:09:03.510 --> 04:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
and there's 98% of other boats out there
 
04:09:06.109 --> 04:09:06.119 align:start position:0%
that are doing other things it's like
 
04:09:07.429 --> 04:09:07.439 align:start position:0%
when you drive a cart on the road I mean
 
04:09:08.910 --> 04:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
an 18-wheeler is going to do more damage
 
04:09:11.590 --> 04:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
to a road than a passenger car it weighs
 
04:09:14.030 --> 04:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
more this is something to think
 
04:09:16.990 --> 04:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
about follow up all right for follow up
 
04:09:18.790 --> 04:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
but that I want to see this go back and
 
04:09:21.750 --> 04:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
forth back and forth this is fun right
 
04:09:24.790 --> 04:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
okay one more round okay go
 
04:09:28.109 --> 04:09:28.119 align:start position:0%
ahead what is a safe passage with a
 
04:09:29.349 --> 04:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
water ski
 
04:09:31.590 --> 04:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
boat safe passeng with the water ski B
 
04:09:33.990 --> 04:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
you're telling is 150 feet from Shore to
 
04:09:35.269 --> 04:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
the best of my
 
04:09:37.670 --> 04:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge now water skier from my
 
04:09:39.630 --> 04:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
understanding can drop the rope and they
 
04:09:41.950 --> 04:09:41.960 align:start position:0%
need to be also set 150 ft from Shore
 
04:09:45.189 --> 04:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
personal or SK craft two passengers or
 
04:09:47.030 --> 04:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
one passenger required in the C Hamshire
 
04:09:50.149 --> 04:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
be 300t from Shore
 
04:09:52.550 --> 04:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
um is that the right answer I don't know
 
04:09:53.630 --> 04:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
that's what I've been told that's how
 
04:09:55.790 --> 04:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
I've read it for years because it's one
 
04:09:57.670 --> 04:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
of the questions well I guess you 150
 
04:09:59.349 --> 04:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
thief from a dock or from a raft or from
 
04:10:00.910 --> 04:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
Shore it's when everything's in the
 
04:10:03.469 --> 04:10:03.479 align:start position:0%
water a person in the water now expands
 
04:10:06.109 --> 04:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
the 150 foot setback for off a
 
04:10:09.870 --> 04:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
Shore I believe that
 
04:10:14.030 --> 04:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
the distance from Shore to water ski
 
04:10:16.550 --> 04:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
has to be 300 ft I believe you're
 
04:10:19.229 --> 04:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
incorrect but we can look that up we
 
04:10:24.990 --> 04:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
have we have if just I I'm driving for
 
04:10:27.830 --> 04:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
the question all right if that is in
 
04:10:31.670 --> 04:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
fact correct how does that impact wake
 
04:10:34.309 --> 04:10:34.319 align:start position:0%
quats if that is in fact correct when
 
04:10:35.790 --> 04:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make this some statement
 
04:10:37.469 --> 04:10:37.479 align:start position:0%
that we don't know the answer to that
 
04:10:39.710 --> 04:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
question but if it's impact and quick
 
04:10:41.910 --> 04:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
and wake boats are they're all Breaking
 
04:10:44.950 --> 04:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
the Law if that is correct at 300 ft
 
04:10:47.429 --> 04:10:47.439 align:start position:0%
because if that is the law water skiing
 
04:10:49.630 --> 04:10:49.640 align:start position:0%
tubing anyone but if we have safe
 
04:10:52.670 --> 04:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
passenger in 150 feet is a safe passage
 
04:10:57.710 --> 04:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
I believe 150 is the actual law maybe be
 
04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
done leaving sorry about that maybe he
 
04:11:02.590 --> 04:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:05.189 --> 04:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
fars that's how I've treated it 150 ft
 
04:11:05.199 --> 04:11:05.990 align:start position:0%
fars that's how I've treated it 150 ft
from

04:11:05.990 --> 04:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:11:09.710 --> 04:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
sh haven't been pulled over
 
04:11:15.030 --> 04:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
yet are is your uh okay shut your light
 
04:11:17.710 --> 04:11:17.720 align:start position:0%
representative rum thank you Mr chair
 
04:11:19.109 --> 04:11:19.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Wally for taking my
 
04:11:21.550 --> 04:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
question um several people have
 
04:11:24.070 --> 04:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
testified today that they consider this
 
04:11:26.189 --> 04:11:26.199 align:start position:0%
bill to be baby steps and that that was
 
04:11:27.910 --> 04:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
the word I believe uh representative
 
04:11:31.990 --> 04:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
Dolan used like let's let's pass it see
 
04:11:34.630 --> 04:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
how it goes and if we need to change it
 
04:11:37.830 --> 04:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
if in the future if this bill passes and
 
04:11:39.750 --> 04:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's shown that we need a greater
 
04:11:41.990 --> 04:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
distance from Shore to be protective of
 
04:11:44.229 --> 04:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
the environment and to Lear bons would
 
04:11:47.790 --> 04:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
you support that I'm going to speak to
 
04:11:51.030 --> 04:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
the 200 foot stepback is how we stand
 
04:11:52.750 --> 04:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
okay that's what we support again
 
04:11:54.229 --> 04:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
because we do not want to see
 
04:11:57.510 --> 04:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
restrictions or bans I question to how
 
04:12:01.469 --> 04:12:01.479 align:start position:0%
do we establish a need for it because
 
04:12:02.630 --> 04:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
the people that don't want to have a
 
04:12:05.510 --> 04:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
wake boat on the lake now at 200 300
 
04:12:07.910 --> 04:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
500,000 feet aren't going to be happy
 
04:12:10.870 --> 04:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
with 200 next week if this passes it's
 
04:12:16.590 --> 04:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:20.750 --> 04:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions
 
04:12:22.870 --> 04:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
seeing all right I'm wondering if we're
 
04:12:25.590 --> 04:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
gonna have an opportunity to ask um
 
04:12:28.510 --> 04:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
Captain D leevy questions yes who
 
04:12:31.870 --> 04:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
Captain D Ley questions uh if he if if
 
04:12:33.630 --> 04:12:33.640 align:start position:0%
he wishes to
 
04:12:37.149 --> 04:12:37.159 align:start position:0%
speak okay I mean I will ask him if he
 
04:12:40.550 --> 04:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak if he doesn't then he
 
04:12:43.670 --> 04:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to
 
04:12:47.030 --> 04:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
like but since he's grabbing
 
04:12:49.510 --> 04:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
a you guys finish the car let's finish
 
04:12:53.590 --> 04:12:53.600 align:start position:0%

name is Tim Dunley I come before you
 
04:14:18.790 --> 04:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
today representing the Marine Patrol and
 
04:14:20.510 --> 04:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh I sense that there are some questions
 
04:14:22.790 --> 04:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh the department of safety uh is taking
 
04:14:24.349 --> 04:14:24.359 align:start position:0%
the position of being neutral on this
 
04:14:26.830 --> 04:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
bill uh but I am happy to any answer any
 
04:14:29.269 --> 04:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
technical questions you may have if uh
 
04:14:31.750 --> 04:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
you wish all
 
04:14:34.790 --> 04:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
right representative Derby for a
 
04:14:34.800 --> 04:14:37.429 align:start position:0%
right representative Derby for a
technical

04:14:37.429 --> 04:14:37.439 align:start position:0%
technical
 
04:14:40.189 --> 04:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
question do you believe I have only
 
04:14:41.870 --> 04:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
technical questions thank you so much Mr
 
04:14:44.349 --> 04:14:44.359 align:start position:0%
J thank you you uh Captain D Ley for
 
04:14:48.269 --> 04:14:48.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question um can you explain
 
04:14:53.790 --> 04:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
how the best practices for the um uh
 
04:14:56.710 --> 04:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
that's referenced in the uh Senate bill
 
04:15:01.550 --> 04:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
will be um will be determined um how
 
04:15:03.750 --> 04:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
they how public will be educated about
 
04:15:06.870 --> 04:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
them and the ability for public input in
 
04:15:09.469 --> 04:15:09.479 align:start position:0%
determining those best
 
04:15:11.910 --> 04:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
practices well certainly uh best
 
04:15:13.229 --> 04:15:13.239 align:start position:0%
practices are going to be considered
 
04:15:15.990 --> 04:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
from a safety perspective for our course
 
04:15:18.389 --> 04:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh if we have laws to enforce we will we
 
04:15:20.469 --> 04:15:20.479 align:start position:0%
will uh educate the public on the laws
 
04:15:23.429 --> 04:15:23.439 align:start position:0%
that exist uh we talk about best
 
04:15:25.070 --> 04:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
practices when it comes to loading a
 
04:15:27.510 --> 04:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
boat at the boat ramp best practices
 
04:15:30.309 --> 04:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
when it comes to uh Designated Drivers
 
04:15:31.910 --> 04:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
and and the consumption of alcohol there
 
04:15:34.870 --> 04:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
are many examples of best practices so
 
04:15:37.790 --> 04:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh we are doing that now um from a
 
04:15:40.070 --> 04:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
general perspective uh if there is a
 
04:15:42.070 --> 04:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
specific law that needs to be enforced
 
04:15:43.269 --> 04:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
uh and that the public needs to be
 
04:15:46.189 --> 04:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
informed of that'll be included in our
 
04:15:49.830 --> 04:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
curriculum if that answers your
 
04:15:53.349 --> 04:15:53.359 align:start position:0%
question I I didn't thank you very much
 
04:15:57.229 --> 04:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear the can I follow apologies
 
04:15:59.790 --> 04:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair I didn't hear the part is
 
04:16:01.590 --> 04:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
there any opportunity for public input
 
04:16:01.600 --> 04:16:02.790 align:start position:0%
there any opportunity for public input
to

04:16:02.790 --> 04:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:16:05.670 --> 04:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
that there is uh but that that leaves
 
04:16:07.469 --> 04:16:07.479 align:start position:0%
the department of safety sort of in a
 
04:16:10.070 --> 04:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
conundrum if if the public in general is
 
04:16:11.950 --> 04:16:11.960 align:start position:0%
disagreeing about what those practices
 
04:16:14.590 --> 04:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
are um um so we will look at it with an
 
04:16:16.790 --> 04:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
eye towards safety uh if it comes down
 
04:16:18.710 --> 04:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
to that would be my guess and in any
 
04:16:20.590 --> 04:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
direction that the commissioner's office
 
04:16:25.990 --> 04:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:30.429 --> 04:16:30.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:32.830 --> 04:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
time I thought this was only second but
 
04:16:35.830 --> 04:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr okay um first two and a
 
04:16:38.269 --> 04:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
half times I was wondering if you could
 
04:16:43.750 --> 04:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
comment on um evaluating the distance of
 
04:16:48.189 --> 04:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
200 versus 300 feet both by um you know
 
04:16:50.710 --> 04:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
the recreational boater that has to try
 
04:16:53.990 --> 04:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
to comply with this law as well as by
 
04:16:55.710 --> 04:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol that would have to enforce
 
04:16:55.720 --> 04:16:58.070 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol that would have to enforce
the

04:16:58.070 --> 04:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:00.750 --> 04:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
law uh distance judging distances is
 
04:17:02.349 --> 04:17:02.359 align:start position:0%
part of our not only our officer
 
04:17:05.309 --> 04:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
training but part of our public courses
 
04:17:07.790 --> 04:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
um the 150 foot distance which many of
 
04:17:10.309 --> 04:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
you have been hearing about uh we we
 
04:17:12.109 --> 04:17:12.119 align:start position:0%
actually if the weather is conducive to
 
04:17:13.389 --> 04:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
it we actually take our students out
 
04:17:16.429 --> 04:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
into a parking lot we stretch out a a
 
04:17:19.710 --> 04:17:19.720 align:start position:0%
line a rope that is 150 ft so that the
 
04:17:22.550 --> 04:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
students can see those distances uh
 
04:17:25.830 --> 04:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
we'll do it at 75 ft um the public is
 
04:17:29.469 --> 04:17:29.479 align:start position:0%
often times reminded that the majority
 
04:17:31.510 --> 04:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
of the ski lines the toll lines that you
 
04:17:34.429 --> 04:17:34.439 align:start position:0%
buy in the marinas to water ski is 75 ft
 
04:17:37.189 --> 04:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
in length unless it's been altered um
 
04:17:41.469 --> 04:17:41.479 align:start position:0%
for traditional water skiing um 150 ft
 
04:17:43.149 --> 04:17:43.159 align:start position:0%
is half a football field if you've
 
04:17:45.590 --> 04:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
played soccer or played football uh
 
04:17:48.070 --> 04:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
you've been out on these fields you have
 
04:17:50.910 --> 04:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
a rough idea about how how long they are
 
04:17:52.269 --> 04:17:52.279 align:start position:0%
and if you've done any wind Sprints
 
04:17:54.710 --> 04:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
under a coach that takes advantage of
 
04:17:57.189 --> 04:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
that you know the distance fairly well
 
04:17:58.870 --> 04:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh a person oftentimes is very familiar
 
04:18:00.149 --> 04:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
with the length of their boat as well
 
04:18:02.189 --> 04:18:02.199 align:start position:0%
when they go to pull into a town dock
 
04:18:03.510 --> 04:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
it's like pulling your car into a
 
04:18:05.469 --> 04:18:05.479 align:start position:0%
parking lot at the grocery store you
 
04:18:06.910 --> 04:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
know what kind of width you need for
 
04:18:08.710 --> 04:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
your vehicle you know what kind of
 
04:18:10.349 --> 04:18:10.359 align:start position:0%
length you needed to town do for your
 
04:18:12.830 --> 04:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
boat and if you know your boat's 25 ft
 
04:18:14.910 --> 04:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
well then you know you're looking at six
 
04:18:19.349 --> 04:18:19.359 align:start position:0%
both lengths to get to 150 ft um our
 
04:18:21.469 --> 04:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol curriculum includes
 
04:18:23.830 --> 04:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
something as basic as a line it also
 
04:18:27.670 --> 04:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
includes laser radar uh we do Boat tobo
 
04:18:29.830 --> 04:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
Boat to shore dock to Boat Boat to swim
 
04:18:33.670 --> 04:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
float all those uh measurements are um
 
04:18:36.349 --> 04:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
included in our curriculum uh we have
 
04:18:40.830 --> 04:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
the 150t distance for um General boating
 
04:18:42.990 --> 04:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
at greater than Headway speed from dock
 
04:18:45.790 --> 04:18:45.800 align:start position:0%
rafts swim floats moing fields and the
 
04:18:48.189 --> 04:18:48.199 align:start position:0%
shoreline and we have a distance of 300
 
04:18:50.510 --> 04:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
ft from Shore for the operation of a ski
 
04:18:52.830 --> 04:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
craft a ski craft is the two person
 
04:18:52.840 --> 04:18:53.790 align:start position:0%
craft a ski craft is the two person
personal

04:18:53.790 --> 04:18:53.800 align:start position:0%
personal
 
04:18:55.750 --> 04:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
watercraft um and we include those
 
04:19:02.030 --> 04:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:06.790 --> 04:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
well okay you have one I I very um Mr
 
04:19:08.710 --> 04:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
chair I very much appreciate this I
 
04:19:10.429 --> 04:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
promise this will be my I think my last
 
04:19:13.469 --> 04:19:13.479 align:start position:0%
question of the day um I was wondering
 
04:19:15.910 --> 04:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
if you could explain to the committee
 
04:19:19.309 --> 04:19:19.319 align:start position:0%
the difference between wake surfing and
 
04:19:22.590 --> 04:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
wake boarding and um how wake boarding
 
04:19:24.990 --> 04:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
is covered in current
 
04:19:27.750 --> 04:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
statute uh the the difference between
 
04:19:30.269 --> 04:19:30.279 align:start position:0%
the two uh from a safety perspective
 
04:19:31.670 --> 04:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
requires the same
 
04:19:34.510 --> 04:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
equipment um wake boarding is something
 
04:19:36.109 --> 04:19:36.119 align:start position:0%
that typically you're attached to the
 
04:19:39.030 --> 04:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
boat with a rope a toe line and wake
 
04:19:41.469 --> 04:19:41.479 align:start position:0%
surfing you do not uh but the safety
 
04:19:44.469 --> 04:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
equipments that is required for the the
 
04:19:48.109 --> 04:19:48.119 align:start position:0%
surfer or the border is is the same life
 
04:19:56.790 --> 04:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:56.800 --> 04:19:58.670 align:start position:0%
 
thing

04:19:58.670 --> 04:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:20:00.590 --> 04:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
all thank you so much for the rest of
 
04:20:02.710 --> 04:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
the year no more
 
04:20:06.670 --> 04:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:06.680 --> 04:20:08.710 align:start position:0%
 
one

04:20:08.710 --> 04:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:20:11.710 --> 04:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
um someone else wake surfing is in
 
04:20:13.790 --> 04:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
statute and wake boarding is not in
 
04:20:16.109 --> 04:20:16.119 align:start position:0%
Statue so how is wake boarding covered
 
04:20:18.910 --> 04:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
um in Statue I understand your question
 
04:20:20.910 --> 04:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
it's a good one uh wake boarding uh
 
04:20:22.349 --> 04:20:22.359 align:start position:0%
falls under the definition of water
 
04:20:24.590 --> 04:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
skiing where uh the term that's used in
 
04:20:26.149 --> 04:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
statute is a pertinence that's being
 
04:20:28.670 --> 04:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
towed by the boat uh and so therefore
 
04:20:30.750 --> 04:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
it's covered by the general term of
 
04:20:30.760 --> 04:20:35.109 align:start position:0%
it's covered by the general term of
water

04:20:35.109 --> 04:20:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:38.670 --> 04:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
skiing all right uh representative wolf
 
04:20:40.590 --> 04:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
you have a question thank you thank you
 
04:20:43.309 --> 04:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
C has to do with length of skiing
 
04:20:46.510 --> 04:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
SK ski what does it have to do with the
 
04:20:51.590 --> 04:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
skiing how far does ski ski ski skcraft
 
04:20:54.590 --> 04:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
operating you said have to be 300 feet
 
04:20:57.070 --> 04:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
from Shore yes sir before they can go
 
04:21:00.109 --> 04:21:00.119 align:start position:0%
greater than Headway speed yes
 
04:21:00.119 --> 04:21:01.750 align:start position:0%
greater than Headway speed yes
sir

04:21:01.750 --> 04:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
sir
 
04:21:06.790 --> 04:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:09.870 --> 04:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
sir all
 
04:21:12.550 --> 04:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
right this isn't a this isn't a question
 
04:21:13.870 --> 04:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
for Derby is
 
04:21:16.790 --> 04:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
it okay I'm just making
 
04:21:19.229 --> 04:21:19.239 align:start position:0%
certain I should know the answer to this
 
04:21:22.389 --> 04:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
Captain dunlevy but with your response
 
04:21:24.630 --> 04:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
to to representive wolves about they
 
04:21:28.109 --> 04:21:28.119 align:start position:0%
have to be three water skiers and I
 
04:21:30.429 --> 04:21:30.439 align:start position:0%
guess border you know the the surf
 
04:21:33.630 --> 04:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
borders have to be 300 feet from Shore
 
04:21:37.149 --> 04:21:37.159 align:start position:0%
until unless they're under Headway speed
 
04:21:40.070 --> 04:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
and is Headway speed defined that's
 
04:21:43.109 --> 04:21:43.119 align:start position:0%
defined as going
 
04:21:45.710 --> 04:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
you can't you you you can moving forward
 
04:21:49.030 --> 04:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
without having to use steerage is that
 
04:21:53.070 --> 04:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
correct um you're close uh respectfully
 
04:21:55.870 --> 04:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
uh Headway speed is the slowest speed
 
04:21:57.990 --> 04:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
that you can travel with your boat and
 
04:22:00.590 --> 04:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
maintain safe steerage not to go over
 
04:22:02.309 --> 04:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
six miles per hour so it and it's
 
04:22:04.389 --> 04:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
synonymous with the term no
 
04:22:08.950 --> 04:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
wake okay is Headway speed right follow
 
04:22:13.149 --> 04:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
up Mr chair so all right this is it okay
 
04:22:15.550 --> 04:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
my last question of it has specifically
 
04:22:19.830 --> 04:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
to do with this bill all right so if a
 
04:22:25.229 --> 04:22:25.239 align:start position:0%
wake boat is Towing someone okay but
 
04:22:29.070 --> 04:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
they'd have to be 300 feet from Shore
 
04:22:31.590 --> 04:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
unless they're not creating a
 
04:22:34.269 --> 04:22:34.279 align:start position:0%
wake not a wake booat a ski craft which
 
04:22:37.550 --> 04:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
is a jet ski oh okay the two person ski
 
04:22:40.830 --> 04:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
craft is defined as um a two-person
 
04:22:43.590 --> 04:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
device I got you uh most people call Jet
 
04:22:46.070 --> 04:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
Skis yeah a ski craft is not a boat
 
04:22:47.990 --> 04:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
towing water
 
04:22:53.070 --> 04:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
skiers oh okay that's good to know all
 
04:22:56.109 --> 04:22:56.119 align:start position:0%
right any other further questions no
 
04:22:57.590 --> 04:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for your
 
04:23:02.429 --> 04:23:02.439 align:start position:0%
time and thank you and uh Miss Rick is
 
04:23:02.439 --> 04:23:04.710 align:start position:0%
time and thank you and uh Miss Rick is
it

04:23:04.710 --> 04:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:04.720 --> 04:23:07.269 align:start position:0%
 
Tuttle

04:23:07.269 --> 04:23:07.279 align:start position:0%
Tuttle
 
04:23:18.870 --> 04:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:22.109 --> 04:23:22.119 align:start position:0%
I'm here representing myself basically
 
04:23:25.229 --> 04:23:25.239 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to think that I represent a
 
04:23:28.910 --> 04:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
large and growing group of kayakers uh
 
04:23:28.920 --> 04:23:29.750 align:start position:0%
large and growing group of kayakers uh
I've

04:23:29.750 --> 04:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
I've
 
04:23:34.950 --> 04:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
been kayaking for 36 years now 1988 I
 
04:23:37.910 --> 04:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
first started and uh I would never go
 
04:23:42.550 --> 04:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
back to any other craft it's uh and in
 
04:23:45.870 --> 04:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
that time I've seen a lot of uh problems
 
04:23:50.109 --> 04:23:50.119 align:start position:0%
out on the water and um when I read the
 
04:23:56.469 --> 04:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:00.389 --> 04:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
a of a bad experience I had but uh that
 
04:24:04.269 --> 04:24:04.279 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with this bill but um
 
04:24:08.429 --> 04:24:08.439 align:start position:0%
my my biggest problem with this bill is
 
04:24:12.870 --> 04:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
in the safety aspect of it uh the safety
 
04:24:16.590 --> 04:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
aspect we're looking at presently 150 ft
 
04:24:19.030 --> 04:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
if I'm not mistaken and they want to
 
04:24:21.830 --> 04:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
take it to 200 feet uh representative
 
04:24:24.109 --> 04:24:24.119 align:start position:0%
wolf I'm sorry he left uh he had a
 
04:24:26.590 --> 04:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
question earlier on from somebody else
 
04:24:28.950 --> 04:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
that asked him would it make a
 
04:24:32.309 --> 04:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
difference safety-wise to add 50 feet to
 
04:24:35.189 --> 04:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
this bill and initially you think 50
 
04:24:38.229 --> 04:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
feet is nothing therefore no it
 
04:24:40.750 --> 04:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't make any difference but
 
04:24:43.510 --> 04:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
there's a big butt in there any
 
04:24:46.870 --> 04:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
additional distance would help kayakers
 
04:24:49.510 --> 04:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
because it's not the initial boat going
 
04:24:51.790 --> 04:24:51.800 align:start position:0%
by that we're worried about most of the
 
04:24:54.429 --> 04:24:54.439 align:start position:0%
time it is the fact that that wake
 
04:24:58.149 --> 04:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
follows that boat maybe a few minutes
 
04:24:59.830 --> 04:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
maybe five minutes
 
04:25:02.630 --> 04:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
later and if you're not prepared for it
 
04:25:05.830 --> 04:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
it sneaks up on you big time and when
 
04:25:08.109 --> 04:25:08.119 align:start position:0%
that happens you can easily be thrown
 
04:25:11.309 --> 04:25:11.319 align:start position:0%
right over when that happens you're in
 
04:25:14.229 --> 04:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
big de big deep trouble literally deep
 
04:25:16.229 --> 04:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
trouble because you have to rescue
 
04:25:17.750 --> 04:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
yourself and you have to rescue your
 
04:25:20.149 --> 04:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
boat and you have to rescue the contents
 
04:25:22.950 --> 04:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
of it um I was speak from experience
 
04:25:25.469 --> 04:25:25.479 align:start position:0%
that way because I had a boat go past me
 
04:25:27.830 --> 04:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
once at a close
 
04:25:30.910 --> 04:25:30.920 align:start position:0%
distance and he did not slow down it
 
04:25:34.149 --> 04:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
swamped my boat 2third full of water and
 
04:25:36.429 --> 04:25:36.439 align:start position:0%
luckily I'm a wildlife photographer so I
 
04:25:37.710 --> 04:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
carry around a couple of thousand
 
04:25:39.510 --> 04:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of gear in my boat at any
 
04:25:43.429 --> 04:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
given time luckily I had put my camera
 
04:25:46.309 --> 04:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
and lens into my dry bag less than 5
 
04:25:46.319 --> 04:25:47.950 align:start position:0%
and lens into my dry bag less than 5
minutes

04:25:47.950 --> 04:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
04:25:50.070 --> 04:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
earlier without that I would have been
 
04:25:54.750 --> 04:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
out 2,000 bucks so in that respect I am
 
04:25:59.349 --> 04:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
I'm very uh sensitive to the safety
 
04:26:02.510 --> 04:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
aspect of it so I want to see more
 
04:26:05.149 --> 04:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
distance I would support this bill if it
 
04:26:08.269 --> 04:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
went to 300 feet I think I've seen I've
 
04:26:11.790 --> 04:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of uh uh people asking that
 
04:26:11.800 --> 04:26:13.030 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of uh uh people asking that
question

04:26:13.030 --> 04:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:26:15.550 --> 04:26:15.560 align:start position:0%
and I think that makes a
 
04:26:19.149 --> 04:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
difference but likewise if we don't make
 
04:26:21.469 --> 04:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
a change to that bill if we don't
 
04:26:22.990 --> 04:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
increase that
 
04:26:25.710 --> 04:26:25.720 align:start position:0%
distance the well I think everybody
 
04:26:28.109 --> 04:26:28.119 align:start position:0%
agrees now that
 
04:26:31.910 --> 04:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh climate change is a factor so if we
 
04:26:35.070 --> 04:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
wait two years storms get worse look at
 
04:26:38.070 --> 04:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
the storms we had on the coast this year
 
04:26:39.550 --> 04:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
no doubt those were some of the worst
 
04:26:43.750 --> 04:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
storms we've ever suffered in the state
 
04:26:45.790 --> 04:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
if that happens two years from now how
 
04:26:47.910 --> 04:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
bad are they going to be and if we don't
 
04:26:50.870 --> 04:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
make those increases to the distance how
 
04:26:53.790 --> 04:26:53.800 align:start position:0%
bad is the erosion going to be how bad
 
04:26:56.349 --> 04:26:56.359 align:start position:0%
is the safety aspect going to be of
 
04:26:59.429 --> 04:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
people that have houses near those lines
 
04:27:03.950 --> 04:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
the red Lakes are not often um really
 
04:27:07.550 --> 04:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
subject to the uh the storm surges that
 
04:27:09.950 --> 04:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
we got at the coast but the fact is you
 
04:27:11.630 --> 04:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
get a heavy enough storm and you get
 
04:27:14.670 --> 04:27:14.680 align:start position:0%
enough wind yes it will blow it in and
 
04:27:17.389 --> 04:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
that comes in my next uh my second of
 
04:27:21.630 --> 04:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
two concerns people are saying well it's
 
04:27:25.750 --> 04:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh it's a factor of a storm comes up and
 
04:27:28.070 --> 04:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
if you have a really bad storm then
 
04:27:31.309 --> 04:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
that's a force of nature yes it is
 
04:27:34.670 --> 04:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
nature will recover from its own storms
 
04:27:39.870 --> 04:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
but if we don't give nature a choice of
 
04:27:41.990 --> 04:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
or a chance to be able to recover from
 
04:27:44.349 --> 04:27:44.359 align:start position:0%
the those storms we're just going to
 
04:27:45.830 --> 04:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
continue to go
 
04:27:48.910 --> 04:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
downhill what I mean by that is during
 
04:27:51.590 --> 04:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
the winter months we have sever storms
 
04:27:54.630 --> 04:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
during the during the severe storms
 
04:27:57.309 --> 04:27:57.319 align:start position:0%
they're mostly during the winter
 
04:28:00.790 --> 04:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
and very little is growing you look at
 
04:28:05.109 --> 04:28:05.119 align:start position:0%
the growth uh plant life and animal life
 
04:28:09.750 --> 04:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
it's in recess we'll say come summertime
 
04:28:13.910 --> 04:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
it starts to grow back if it grows back
 
04:28:16.149 --> 04:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
that's great it's recovering from the
 
04:28:18.269 --> 04:28:18.279 align:start position:0%
damage that the winter
 
04:28:20.830 --> 04:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
created if we continue to have more
