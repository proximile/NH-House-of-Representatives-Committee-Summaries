um exactly exactly
 
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 align:start position:0%
um we're here to look at parts of House
 
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 that um the chair of Finance has
 
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 align:start position:0%

part is
 
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
the group two pension
 
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 align:start position:0%
reform which we will we have some data
 
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
here there's the oplc section which I
 
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
have copies coming um they're up
 
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
um they're being produced
 
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 align:start position:0%
upstairs and um in one section on the
 
00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 align:start position:0%
it's section 10 on the board of tax and
 
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
land appeals
 
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
that there's also section
 
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
26 which is on Department of
 
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.270 align:start position:0%
26 which is on Department of
administrative

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
Services it's a very small
 
00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
they're both pretty tiny right those are
 
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 align:start position:0%
very tiny but they are related to our
 
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
what pages are they on do you know they
 
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 align:start position:0%
are on the house bill two document they
 
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 align:start position:0%
are on well section
 
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
10 is on page 42 and section 26 is on
 
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.670 align:start position:0%
10 is on page 42 and section 26 is on
page

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
67 and the oplc is on SE it's on page 71
 
00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I'm getting copies of 71 on
 
00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:28.150 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I'm getting copies of 71 on
yeah

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
um I could make copies of my copies if
 
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
that helps um of those those two pages
 
00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
yeah it's up to you
 
00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:43.479 align:start position:0%
hello um yeah that could you that would
 
00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:49.150 align:start position:0%
hello um yeah that could you that would
help

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.909 align:start position:0%
 
because

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:55.670 align:start position:0%
because
have

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
yes all
 
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
right yeah those those other sections
 
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.550 align:start position:0%
 
small

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
so Mr Greenland you were so good enough
 
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120 align:start position:0%
as to jump into this uh hunk of
 
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
words could you
 
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:28.879 align:start position:0%
us pop up and uh use the mic they've got
 
00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:30.919 align:start position:0%
the fans turn turned on high around in
 
00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:41.430 align:start position:0%
the fans turn turned on high around in
this

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
room so what I did with this and I um I
 
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
went through and made um the language in
 
00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
the group two section um more digestible
 
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:54.280 align:start position:0%
and kind of was able to compare um
 
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
current language to the proposed
 
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
language and um highlighted the changes
 
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.029 align:start position:0%
language and um highlighted the changes
throughout

00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:00.039 align:start position:0%
throughout
 
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
and also listed the effective dates just
 
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
so they're all in one place okay so what
 
00:08:09.869 --> 00:08:09.879 align:start position:0%
uh what's changing that's
 
00:08:12.749 --> 00:08:12.759 align:start position:0%
important it looked to me as the one one
 
00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
thing is that they very clearly
 
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
separated the calculations for group one
 
00:08:18.749 --> 00:08:18.759 align:start position:0%
and group
 
00:08:21.629 --> 00:08:21.639 align:start position:0%
two yes they made that
 
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
more defined
 
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.149 align:start position:0%
more defined
and

00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
summary what Madam chair what how are
 
00:08:55.949 --> 00:08:55.959 align:start position:0%
you uh since this is kind of a
 
00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
discussion meeting how are you how do
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
you want to handle this I think anybody
 
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
who has something to contribute ought to
 
00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:05.079 align:start position:0%
say something representative Leon for
 
00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
example to say something thank you madam
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
chair um knowing that um House Bill 727
 
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
is included in the this the budget bill
 
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
I went through to compare the language
 
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
that we had and the bill is introduced
 
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
just to see if there were any changes um
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
there's two that actually were included
 
00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
in the amendment that representative
 
00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
foot brought to us but they're pretty
 
00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
significant to the calculation um I just
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
want to highlight those I guess we can
 
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
see those on page seven of the changes
 
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
it has the for the purposes of this
 
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
calculation that section which is
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
removed from current law um that still
 
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
existed in the language of 727 as it was
 
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
introduced and as it went to um get the
 
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:48.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal note so I want to make sure that
 
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
we are not underfunding it um if that
 
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
was not included in the calculation for
 
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
727 and when we get to okay so so that
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
one says that that limits
 
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.350 align:start position:0%
one says that that limits
the

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
average extra and special Duty over
 
00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
seven years of service yes rather than
 
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
over three years of
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
service which is um an anti-s spiking
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
provision to prevent people from uh
 
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
artificially inflating their pension yes
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
if they're working it over seven
 
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
years that's they're probably been
 
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
working that their whole career um but
 
00:10:29.069 --> 00:10:29.079 align:start position:0%
it removes that language from the bill
 
00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
because because that part is deleted oh
 
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
so that is not in House Bill too that
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
would be potentially a very significant
 
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
financial impact and I want to make sure
 
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
that if we move forward on this we're
 
00:10:40.829 --> 00:10:40.839 align:start position:0%
not underfunding this so we need to
 
00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
understand the financial
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
cost okay um and then okay so so that's
 
00:10:48.269 --> 00:10:48.279 align:start position:0%
being deleted do we want to address each
 
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
one of these one at a time or do you
 
00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:51.399 align:start position:0%
want I think so that's that's a concern
 
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
so the historical context of this is the
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
this was put back to the language that
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
existed that these people were hired
 
00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.870 align:start position:0%
existed that these people were hired
under

00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
that that's all that does it is it just
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
restores that back to the original
 
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
language the changes that were made to
 
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:09.160 align:start position:0%
that were done
 
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
um if if you notice the 09
 
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
date on there so there
 
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.509 align:start position:0%
date on there so there
is

00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:19.519 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
um prior prior to that the retirement
 
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
system did not separate that out so they
 
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
can't even look at that data the data
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
right the reportable data that occurred
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
was just whole number
 
00:11:36.509 --> 00:11:36.519 align:start position:0%
data right
 
00:11:36.519 --> 00:11:39.509 align:start position:0%
data right
so

00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
not the the intent of the legislation is
 
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
to put things back to the conditions to
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
which people had when they were hired so
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
that's what this does in essence all
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
right but it still requires keeping
 
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.069 align:start position:0%
right but it still requires keeping
track

00:11:56.069 --> 00:11:56.079 align:start position:0%
track
 
00:11:59.949 --> 00:11:59.959 align:start position:0%
of um
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
ah it doesn't have the exclusion for
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
extra and special
 
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
Duty right correct yep correct that's
 
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:11.720 align:start position:0%
how that read in Statute in RSA 100a
 
00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
retroactively all right so this one this
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
one is is something that
 
00:12:28.509 --> 00:12:28.519 align:start position:0%
that adds cost because it uh allows
 
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
essentially limited amounts of extra and
 
00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:33.399 align:start position:0%
special duty pay well I don't think this
 
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
restricts the the quantity of that it
 
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
just it just changes the way they look
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
at it no if you're deleting this the
 
00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.670 align:start position:0%
at it no if you're deleting this the
that

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
section the the the first sentence just
 
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
says average earnable compensation
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
during three years of
 
00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839 align:start position:0%
service highest three years of service
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
let me make sure I'm on the right page
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
with you I'm on page seven of
 
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
gotcha and if this the second sentence
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
is being deleted MH then that says that
 
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
your highest three years of service can
 
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:13.240 align:start position:0%
include as much
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
special special duty pay as
 
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.389 align:start position:0%
special special duty pay as
um

00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:23.839 align:start position:0%
um as you can work you can still do that
 
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
you can do that right now and it would
 
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
apply to your pension yeah
 
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
no right
 
00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:37.310 align:start position:0%
no right
now

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
um if you're working say 10% special
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
Duty your whole
 
00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
career if you tried to work 50% your
 
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:54.759 align:start position:0%
10% I don't know how I don't know how
 
00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
you get that cuz as a if you were hired
 
00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
before 200 11 you extra detail and
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
overtime counts towards it if you were
 
00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
hired after 2011 it does not so that
 
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
there's no restriction as to the amount
 
00:14:12.749 --> 00:14:12.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:15.079 align:start position:0%
work it's just the way they calculate
 
00:14:17.749 --> 00:14:17.759 align:start position:0%
that that total over agreement period of
 
00:14:21.389 --> 00:14:21.399 align:start position:0%
time but that is something
 
00:14:25.749 --> 00:14:25.759 align:start position:0%
to limit over time or to limit
 
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
artificially padding your pension by
 
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
working extra and overtime and special
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
duty pay in your last year or
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
so I mean I mean I understand why it was
 
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
put in there but it was it's part of the
 
00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:42.519 align:start position:0%
retroactive action that was taken so
 
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
that's why it's being
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
was yes okay represent myam um thank you
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand you're
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
telling me that right now you can work
 
00:14:59.749 --> 00:14:59.759 align:start position:0%
however much you want so it sounds like
 
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
you're saying that this language doesn't
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
apply but the language says that you're
 
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
limited to those last three years
 
00:15:07.629 --> 00:15:07.639 align:start position:0%
looking like prior service as far as
 
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
your extra Duty and special Duty um does
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
that limit currently exist or is somehow
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
there a work around depends on when you
 
00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:16.759 align:start position:0%
got hired I'm speaking specifically to
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
those that are hired in this section
 
00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
where you deleted this cap on on uh last
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
three years of service extra and special
 
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
duty pay um if you look the members who
 
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
attained bested prior to 2012 mhm um
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
removing for the purposes of the
 
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
calculation the special Duty and the 3
 
00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:36.279 align:start position:0%
years um that have to look like the
 
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
seven years prior so that you're not
 
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
working extra hours is that actually
 
00:15:42.309 --> 00:15:42.319 align:start position:0%
followed or are we somehow not following
 
00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
the current letter of the law We are
 
00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
following the law your interpretation is
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
just not accurate the inclusion in
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
the the annual a average annual
 
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
compensation for extra and special Duty
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
in those three years shall not exceed
 
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
the average annual amount of
 
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
compensation for extra and special Duty
 
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
paid to the member over the member's
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
last seven years of service right that's
 
00:16:07.829 --> 00:16:07.839 align:start position:0%
a math calculation it does not restrict
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
who can work and when they can work or
 
00:16:11.309 --> 00:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
how much it does is how much of it
 
00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:15.959 align:start position:0%
applies to your uh average final
 
00:16:19.309 --> 00:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
compensation yeah that would
 
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
um correct that well that could that
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
could be be significant I have a
 
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
personal friend who was a fireman in San
 
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
Francisco and he told us year before he
 
00:16:31.309 --> 00:16:31.319 align:start position:0%
retired that we weren't going to see him
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
for the next year CU he was going to be
 
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
working all the overtime and all the
 
00:16:38.189 --> 00:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
weekends and all the extra shifts he
 
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:42.440 align:start position:0%
could get MH and he did he got twice as
 
00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:44.360 align:start position:0%
normal more than twice as normal pay
 
00:16:46.269 --> 00:16:46.279 align:start position:0%
that year and it and it all and it
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
bumped up his pension significantly and
 
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
that's what this is trying to stop so
 
00:16:54.509 --> 00:16:54.519 align:start position:0%
what happened in 2011 is they remove the
 
00:16:54.519 --> 00:16:56.150 align:start position:0%
what happened in 2011 is they remove the
the

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:59.069 --> 00:16:59.079 align:start position:0%
um the extra and special duties been
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
completely removed out totally it's not
 
00:17:04.029 --> 00:17:04.039 align:start position:0%
it counts for zero if you were hired
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
after July 1 of 11 so that's that's been
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
and that is followed absolutely followed
 
00:17:11.309 --> 00:17:11.319 align:start position:0%
right it's just the folks that were
 
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
prior to that that was not the premise
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
to which they were hired under and since
 
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
this is a pension repair bill that is
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
part of that okay because I'm I'm
 
00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
concerned that that's got
 
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
more um I mean yes it it it goes into
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
the calcul
 
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
and the the actuaries have fun deciding
 
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
what it is but if we take this out it
 
00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.270 align:start position:0%
what it is but if we take this out it
still

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
allows artificial pumping up of the
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
pension by working in the last three
 
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
years three years is a long time I mean
 
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
you could make the argument you could do
 
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
it for seven I mean it's that's why
 
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
that's why in 2011 with the with the
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
overhaul they took them the those jobs
 
00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:01.039 align:start position:0%
if you will were removed completely out
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
right right there's they don't count for
 
00:18:04.149 --> 00:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
anything anymore as a matter of fact
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
when they were depending on who you are
 
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:07.480 align:start position:0%
if you were hired after 2011 you
 
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
actually get paid more to do extra in
 
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
special Duty because they're not taking
 
00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
12% out of that okay they actually get
 
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
the newer people get paid more so um but
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
that's been in effect for 14 years now
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
and and is absolutely followed this just
 
00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
this is just like I said handling a
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
change that applied retroactively so
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
that okay representative BR just so that
 
00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
we can set a base for this discussion
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
with my so last year we put together
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
436 and we worked really hard on that
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
bill and then there was a committee a
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
joint committee put together to address
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
all the concerns that we had and my
 
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
understanding is that that culmination
 
00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
of those agreements were put into this
 
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
in-house Bill two this house bill two
 
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
but it's in-house Bill 2 now get us to
 
00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
where we were going in House Bill 36
 
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:09.640 align:start position:0%
which was supposed to be a repair
 
00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.669 align:start position:0%
which was supposed to be a repair
pension

00:19:11.669 --> 00:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
pension
 
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:14.039 align:start position:0%
Bill if you're asking me if the language
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
is exact it's
 
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
95% exact y it's very very close it's
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
not it's not quite as the same um
 
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.950 align:start position:0%
not it's not quite as the same um
different

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
Governor you know different AB different
 
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.510 align:start position:0%
Governor you know different AB different
political

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
political
 
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:32.200 align:start position:0%
abilities here with that but it's it's
 
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
virtually the same in its
 
00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:49.270 align:start position:0%
virtually the same in its
premise

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
okay follow so to my understanding that
 
00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
we're doing we're basically reviewing
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 which is going to be
 
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
discussed in division one just because
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
we are the Edna as a committee we would
 
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
have heard the bill had it been part of
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
had it been
 
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
um if it hadn't been in if it hadn't
 
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
been put in House Bill too we'd be
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
hearing this bill and I believe the bill
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
that representative foot put in that we
 
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
retained oh House Bill 57 something
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
727 is being retained by us because it's
 
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.230 align:start position:0%
727 is being retained by us because it's
essentially

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
this right and we just want to see what
 
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
comes out of the sausage machine at the
 
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
end of the budget 727 does contain a
 
00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
typo bys that will be brought up shortly
 
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
all right represent and this is one of
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
the differences between 727 as
 
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
introduced I know that we had that bill
 
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
and retained it but because we're the
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
policy committee I want to make
 
00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:55.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely sure that we know what was
 
00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
presented to us and discussed and what
 
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
is different and and this sentence was
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
not deleted in the bill that was
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
presented to us the one that had the
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it was in the amendment so
 
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
that was changed in the amendment and
 
00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
the other typo that we're going to bring
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
up as well um was in the amendment but
 
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
not in the fiscal note and I'm just
 
00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
highly concerned that if we fix it but
 
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:18.200 align:start position:0%
don't fund it properly we're still going
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
to be behind the eightball and that's
 
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
the last thing I want to have happen
 
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
because if we're the policy committee
 
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
and we're supposed to be speaking about
 
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
this and we let and we don't let them
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
know that the policy is different than
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
that that had the fiscal note we're
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
going to be setting the finance
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
committee up to fail and that wouldn't
 
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:35.720 align:start position:0%
be fair did we get a hard fiscal note on
 
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
727 we got an
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
explanation from we didn't get a I don't
 
00:21:43.149 --> 00:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
think we have fiscal note do you think
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
so okay I'm going to step out somewhere
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
there is a fiscal note I believe that
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
division one has it and it's something
 
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
like 25 it's 25 27 million well that the
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
bill appropriates 27 million but what
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
the gentleman from the retirement system
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
said was somewhere in the 23
 
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
range but he had I spoke with him um at
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
least well let me see it must have been
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
a week and a half ago and he had just
 
00:22:14.669 --> 00:22:14.679 align:start position:0%
sent the information to the LBA so they
 
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
have the information for the fiscal
 
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
note based on hb2 no no based on
 
00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
727 so we should probably call we could
 
00:22:28.909 --> 00:22:28.919 align:start position:0%
probably get I can't imagine they
 
00:22:31.269 --> 00:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
haven't finished it by now no they they
 
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:33.640 align:start position:0%
haven't done much of anything on this uh
 
00:22:35.269 --> 00:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note for
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
727 is a
 
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
revised what about the it's from uh
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
February 26 so it was
 
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:49.240 align:start position:0%
just yes a week after a week ago so and
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
for um it's 27 million for each of three
 
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh appropriated in the bill the language
 
00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
of the bill there that's what the fiscal
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
note says if the appropriation and the
 
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal note are exact then the person
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
who came up with that number in 727
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
should be given a round of applause for
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
being the first one to get it right
 
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
exactly right like ever well they claim
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
the nhrs
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
actuary um would be adjusting
 
00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
there's if I might add when I spoke to
 
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
Mr Kavanaugh after he had submitted the
 
00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:55.559 align:start position:0%
information to the LBA he did confirm 27
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
million to me so that does make sense
 
00:24:02.909 --> 00:24:02.919 align:start position:0%
right and because of the 27 million
 
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
funding it's uh the net cost is a
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
decrease for police and flat for
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
fire because of the money that was
 
00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
system but that's the if you look at the
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
analysis the pension system assumes the
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
annual 275 appropriation so they're
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
basing it off
 
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
of off of
 
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
that well their analysis assumes it's
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
coming that much is coming in right so
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
they're they're looking at the Delta
 
00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:45.039 align:start position:0%
which is uh no change for employees a
 
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
decrease that wouldn't be changing 3%
 
00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
for police decrease and 0.003% increase
 
00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
for fire and which is a couple hundred
 
00:25:00.389 --> 00:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
28 for the state oh yeah and a decrease
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
for this for the localities of 270,000
 
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
so it's a much smaller number than 27
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
million because it's actually a
 
00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:19.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919 align:start position:0%
employer um but I do want to note that
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is based off of the copy
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
that had the typos so we'll need to make
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
sure that we know what the actual cost
 
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
is um
 
00:25:33.789 --> 00:25:33.799 align:start position:0%
yes right
 
00:25:33.799 --> 00:25:36.750 align:start position:0%
yes right
okay

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
citech beyond the scope of this but I
 
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
think it's worth to mention people could
 
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
buy time couldn't they yes well we're
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
going to be hearing what that window was
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
closed 14 years ago no no no no I know
 
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
there's another window there's another
 
00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
provision for buying time I look I know
 
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
two people in Salem that have okay only
 
00:26:00.029 --> 00:26:00.039 align:start position:0%
two way you can do it you can be in the
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
PE score and buy time or you can buy
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
military time I'm I'm telling you what
 
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
happened Steve I'm telling you what
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
happened and my question is they pay
 
00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:12.039 align:start position:0%
they paid big money to buy time look I
 
00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
don't know the provision I'm telling you
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
it's a fact okay can tell me about the
 
00:26:18.909 --> 00:26:18.919 align:start position:0%
pre anything you like I'm telling you
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
two people I know of my the concern that
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
I have is some of those people who have
 
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
done this and we can pull hair about you
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
know exactly what provision it was are
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
going to be coming back and saying hey I
 
00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
paid off my student loan early how come
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
forgiveness doesn't do me any good will
 
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
they want some of their money back and
 
00:26:42.269 --> 00:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
they have a claim if this is restored in
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
my view but that's beyond the scope of
 
00:26:47.549 --> 00:26:47.559 align:start position:0%
this but don't be surprised if you hear
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
that complaint the the conditions all I
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
the conditions for purchase time that I
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
remember was at 2 and a
 
00:26:57.789 --> 00:26:57.799 align:start position:0%
half% I do remember that part of it so
 
00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:00.200 align:start position:0%
if you were were in that tiered
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
section it all purchase time was at the
 
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
same rate
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
that yeah that's uh I mean I I'm not
 
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
sure what type of argument they would
 
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:14.200 align:start position:0%
make with that but it didn't buy you
 
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
time another day like it didn't move
 
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
your calendar date
 
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
it all right well I think yeah it's
 
00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
beond this is the kind of stuff that we
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
clearly have to iron out so that we have
 
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
one story that that fits all the facts
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
if we can get get that to happen and and
 
00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:38.039 align:start position:0%
and we've agreed that that's what it is
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
and so forth so we don't go into this
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
with the with the rest of the legisl
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
because so um it won't go well if we're
 
00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
if we don't have it all ired up all
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
this this limitation on how
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
much compensation for extra special Duty
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
into into the retirement calculation is
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
being in House Bill 2 it takes it out of
 
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh out of the law and it would affect
 
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.990 align:start position:0%
uh out of the law and it would affect
only

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
only
 
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
those group
 
00:28:18.669 --> 00:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
a yeah anybody hired after July 1 of 11
 
00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%
like I said they it doesn't even no no
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
no it it's vested status prior to 2012 I
 
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
ERS and it's and it's current and in
 
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
current law there's a limit on how much
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
um extra Duty and special Duty they can
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
work that applies toward their
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
pension and I'm curious how many of um
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
of that group is still working and is in
 
00:28:56.669 --> 00:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
that window of years where they would
 
00:28:59.909 --> 00:28:59.919 align:start position:0%
have the potential to do this and do the
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
rational thing which is to take
 
00:29:03.389 --> 00:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
advantage of increasing their extra and
 
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
special duty pay if they're able to get
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
more retirement pay because that's
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
rational yeah yeah that number um was in
 
00:29:14.909 --> 00:29:14.919 align:start position:0%
a chart that we got because keep in mind
 
00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
that the the the the chart that was
 
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
given out years ago um can only go down
 
00:29:24.269 --> 00:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
it can't go up yeah well there that that
 
00:29:27.789 --> 00:29:27.799 align:start position:0%
was uh 13 years ago so there's people
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
who would at this point have at least 23
 
00:29:33.509 --> 00:29:33.519 align:start position:0%
years of service okay so yeah so the
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
chart that was given to us
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
um this is
 
00:29:43.149 --> 00:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
probably I screenshotted this in
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
2023 and that group
 
00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799 align:start position:0%
was at the time 344 fire and 516 police
 
00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:54.039 align:start position:0%
but that's where the majority of the
 
00:29:57.509 --> 00:29:57.519 align:start position:0%
retirements have come from since then so
 
00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
that number is got to be pretty small
 
00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
now I mean that
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
was that was a couple years
 
00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:05.519 align:start position:0%
ago so that was
 
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
800ish total and we've had at least 1300
 
00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
retire it's at least since
 
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
then yeah several hundred so that that
 
00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:20.360 align:start position:0%
is going to suck up the vast majority of
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
that 800 ex yeah except that of course
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
those people still working at um
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
with with with that much service are
 
00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:33.799 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly the the high paid people and
 
00:30:36.789 --> 00:30:36.799 align:start position:0%
uh yeah typically um your Chief level
 
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
officers are not hourly folks so extra
 
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
and special duty is not in their
 
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
Universe they don't work
 
00:30:49.149 --> 00:30:49.159 align:start position:0%
those ah okay well that's uh fine I
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
still think I want to to flag it as I'm
 
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
not quite sure we've got that funded we
 
00:30:59.710 --> 00:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
don't unless somebody objects I think
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
that's just a concern that we want the
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
actuaries to look at to see if that will
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
make a difference it's I don't think
 
00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
we're objecting to taking it out it just
 
00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:12.799 align:start position:0%
it's a concern for
 
00:31:12.799 --> 00:31:17.470 align:start position:0%
it's a concern for
finance

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
okay okay and the other issue that you
 
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
saw um yes the other one is on page 13
 
00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:25.559 align:start position:0%
of the packet that was prepared um it
 
00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
had in the current law it talks about
 
00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:31.799 align:start position:0%
the lower percentage for and then um
 
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
after the 15 years it's um a higher
 
00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
percentage um after 15 years of
 
00:31:38.269 --> 00:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
creditable service it's
 
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
2.5% so that act after 15 years was not
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
included in the original text of 727 so
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
it was not included in the fiscal note
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
for that um that may actually have a
 
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
much more significant impact on the
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal note um and because it the
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
language of 727 had it limited at that
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
2.1 through those different numbers
 
00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:02.200 align:start position:0%
throughout the bill I want to make sure
 
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
that we are not underfunding this and
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
that this is included in the fiscal no
 
00:32:07.629 --> 00:32:07.639 align:start position:0%
as well um because that has the
 
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
potential to be a pretty significant
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
difference in cost and we don't want to
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
fix things without actually fixing the
 
00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
money so I just want clarification so
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
pres Leon are you saying that on page
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
13 where it says the annuity multiplier
 
00:32:26.269 --> 00:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
applied to cred credible service Beyond
 
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
15 years of credible service shall be
 
00:32:32.629 --> 00:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
2.5% and in 727 it says
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
2.1 um I'm saying that in the draft of
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
727 yeah it dropped that um after 15
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
years of creditable service that part
 
00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:44.200 align:start position:0%
was removed from the bill and so that
 
00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
has a pretty significant impact so when
 
00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:49.519 align:start position:0%
the drafters at OS drafted it they
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
didn't use current law oh I cuz that had
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
passed last session that's what I
 
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
thought right so this would already be
 
00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
there this was this this in House Bill 2
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
is not a change it's current law it's is
 
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
current law but but she's right if they
 
00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
if they didn't do the actuary with that
 
00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
in there then that that would make the
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
actuary incorrect maybe that's why the
 
00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
actuary is different than what you think
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
it is so we should defin yeah I agree
 
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
except I think it's different based on
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
what his verbal discussion was with us
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
okay at the time so we so we think that
 
00:33:24.269 --> 00:33:24.279 align:start position:0%
the proposed change is what's actually
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
in current
 
00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
law okay but we want to make sure it's
 
00:33:31.389 --> 00:33:31.399 align:start position:0%
included in the in the fiscal note or
 
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
financial okay
 
00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:38.200 align:start position:0%
that's you have and having had this
 
00:33:40.269 --> 00:33:40.279 align:start position:0%
discussion if this issue comes up which
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
it's very likely to do then we will know
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
exactly what we've done and why we did
 
00:33:48.509 --> 00:33:48.519 align:start position:0%
it yeah and that it's right and then we
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
don't have to go through it in front of
 
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
body in your Himel on page 40 with the
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
current law just it's on page 40 so it's
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
on okay the current law is on page 40
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
yep just if you're referencing
 
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
if okay so so this should this is not
 
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
actually not a change although although
 
00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
if we think about this though if h i it
 
00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:17.960 align:start position:0%
would have to see how they ran that then
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
because that was
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
funded that change was funded two years
 
00:34:27.869 --> 00:34:27.879 align:start position:0%
ago completely funded so if if they run
 
00:34:27.879 --> 00:34:29.310 align:start position:0%
ago completely funded so if if they run
that

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
actuary right so with this one we will
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
we'll have to explain it that this is it
 
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
should already be funded it's not a
 
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
change corre but make sure you're not
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
double counting yes and my big concern
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
with it is because at the rates in 727
 
00:34:50.109 --> 00:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
as it was introduced it actually would
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
have led to a lower amount for them so I
 
00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
recognize that it was already funded but
 
00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
this may have found money because it
 
00:34:59.710 --> 00:34:59.720 align:start position:0%
didn't have those additional 15 years of
 
00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
creditable service I just want to make
 
00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
sure that um that the numbers are
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
correct because this the language in 727
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
that they were looking at for the cost
 
00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
didn't include anything about the the
 
00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
the remaining the years after 15 years
 
00:35:16.829 --> 00:35:16.839 align:start position:0%
of credible service and that would be at
 
00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
a higher percentage rate I I wish the
 
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
retirement system guy was here to ask
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
that question
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
because they're they run off of this so
 
00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm talking about the language of
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
the law that we had that would be
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
different that but if the actuaries are
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
doing it I I'd like to see that we don't
 
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:38.200 align:start position:0%
know if they caught that or not that's
 
00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
all yes we will just flag it as a
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
question U because it it looks like the
 
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
people doing writing House Bill two
 
00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:48.200 align:start position:0%
weren't entirely sure what the current
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
law was no the people that wrote House
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 knew what the current law was
 
00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
that's why it's correct 727 ol left
 
00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
screwed that up
 
00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:04.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else have an issue that uh
 
00:36:15.069 --> 00:36:15.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
discuss so I just have a question for so
 
00:36:20.309 --> 00:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
the one the issue that we just discussed
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
was the second issue with okay that's
 
00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
well we have a second uh so does
 
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
everybody who needs to know know that CJ
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
Gerard died unexpectedly this weekend
 
00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
and there's going to be a
 
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
his casket is going to be transported
 
00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:04.359 align:start position:0%
this afternoon from the state house so
 
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:07.720 align:start position:0%
anybody who was influenced who was
 
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.309 --> 00:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
that that's from Senate president's
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
you and specifically it says at 4:00
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
people are meeting in front of the arch
 
00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
State House arch in order to honor him
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
for the those who are here just I didn't
 
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
you I can interrupt leave
 
00:37:39.309 --> 00:37:39.319 align:start position:0%
at that's
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
fine by the way it's not often you get
 
00:37:46.589 --> 00:37:46.599 align:start position:0%
out if you put I
 
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
exactly all right
 
00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
so and then the the rest of it is
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
2034 which at which time I hope none of
 
00:38:04.589 --> 00:38:04.599 align:start position:0%
us are sitting
 
00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
here well maybe representative log might
 
00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.829 align:start position:0%
here well maybe representative log might
be

00:38:08.829 --> 00:38:08.839 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
okay so let's represent sellers just
 
00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.349 align:start position:0%
okay so let's represent sellers just
okay

00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
yeah and it has an explicit definition
 
00:38:40.309 --> 00:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
of vested which I think
 
00:38:43.069 --> 00:38:43.079 align:start position:0%
is important because it's been assumed
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
while

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:53.010 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:56.030 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:39:02.109 --> 00:39:02.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.589 --> 00:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
um it's also that definition of vested
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
is for 10 years this also has a a
 
00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
um a restriction that calculations of
 
00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
earnable compensation and average final
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
compensation shall not be reduced after
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
3 years of service I don't know how
 
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
you'd ever enforce that because most
 
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
people will observed
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
retire um what that means is that the
 
00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
legislature is restricted from making
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
changes after three years to those two
 
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
sections so in in the sense of a like as
 
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
Maine and Vermont do it with a five-year
 
00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:52.839 align:start position:0%
vesting right that
 
00:39:56.109 --> 00:39:56.119 align:start position:0%
locks that in at 5 years in Maine well
 
00:39:58.109 --> 00:39:58.119 align:start position:0%
rhod Island Vermont and Maine what this
 
00:40:00.309 --> 00:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
does is it kind of splits the baby if
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
you will because at in those States at
 
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
fiveyear vesting you're entitled to a
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
benefit yeah here this says no you're
 
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
going to still have to do the 10 years
 
00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
like we've always
 
00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:13.720 align:start position:0%
presumed but at three years the
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
legislature can't start hacking it back
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of a you get a little there
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
but you still got to do the 10 year so
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
this this in and of itself has zero
 
00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact because it presumes the
 
00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:27.400 align:start position:0%
current yeah the current way we are
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
operate but
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
it it's an attempt to restrict future
 
00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
legislators and that's always a risky
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
business so I'll just flag it that
 
00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
that's I mean every every program in the
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
country that has some sort of the word
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
vested and it restricts at some point
 
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
right so you you could easily say that's
 
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
at 10 years if if we're going to make an
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
argument about vesting at 10 years then
 
00:40:56.589 --> 00:40:56.599 align:start position:0%
we'll am I'll amend this we'll get this
 
00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
amended to have 5-year
 
00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
vesting I mean that's and it will throw
 
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
a huge financial cost on top of it this
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
just this gives it kind of the split
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
here where there's no Financial
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
allocation that's tied to it at 10 years
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
because we presume that but to give 10
 
00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:18.079 align:start position:0%
years of your life in
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
return okay I I think that's another one
 
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
we just want to flag it to finance and
 
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
say um it restricts the legislature from
 
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
screwing around with how with those
 
00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
calculations which in general is a good
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
thing and also keep in mind that was
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
also in 436
 
00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
verbatim that's not a that's not a
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
change a current change that was that
 
00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
was in
 
00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
436 uh and it and what and it and what
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
happened with it it with 436 yeah house
 
00:41:53.309 --> 00:41:53.319 align:start position:0%
Bo 436 passed with a veto proof majority
 
00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
in the house and it went over to the
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
Senate and the Senate decided to turn
 
00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
turn it into a $50 million
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
Appropriations Bill to fund pension
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
debt ah which
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
failed in the house when it came back
 
00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:13.720 align:start position:0%
over I remember that
 
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
right all right I I think that's
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
something that we ought to at least
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
mention to the to finance that that may
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
be a
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
concern in the sense that well if the
 
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
Senate didn't care for it uh we got a
 
00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
whole different group of people running
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
now all right any other concerns
 
00:42:51.549 --> 00:42:51.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:51.559 --> 00:42:54.870 align:start position:0%
 
points

00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
okay we'll see okay
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
and Jackie you've got some uh other
 
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
sections right which do you want first
 
00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:06.200 align:start position:0%
the whichever okay let's do the oplc
 
00:43:08.549 --> 00:43:08.559 align:start position:0%
since I believe the oplc people are here
 
00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
okay oh yes
 
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
start okay I don't think we're uh
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
actually talking about Canon Mountain
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
Tramway or the
 
00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:46.100 align:start position:0%
uh or the
 
00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:47.710 align:start position:0%
uh or the
[Music]

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
uh starting off with the with the
 
00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:53.150 align:start position:0%
uh starting off with the with the
mechanical

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.910 align:start position:0%

00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
00:43:57.970 --> 00:43:57.980 align:start position:0%
so this transfer
 
00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:00.430 align:start position:0%
so this transfer

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
um I know they've been they haven't been
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
entirely comfortable in oplc do you want
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
anything to say about that y happy to
 
00:44:30.829 --> 00:44:30.839 align:start position:0%
speak briefly to that so just for the
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
record Deana jurus executive director
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
oplc and with me is attorney attorney
 
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
Nicholas fry so the proposal in hb2 as
 
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
it stands presently is to move there are
 
00:44:44.549 --> 00:44:44.559 align:start position:0%
currently nine positions there are five
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
what they we would call mechanical
 
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
inspectors so that includes Plumbing gas
 
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
Fitters um and heating
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
installers um that and then the four
 
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
electrical inspectors
 
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:01.720 align:start position:0%
so the those inspector positions
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
transitioned from the fire Marshall's
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
office to the oplc when the boards and
 
00:45:08.349 --> 00:45:08.359 align:start position:0%
the licensing function was
 
00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
transferred um I think not at the risk
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
of not specifically addressing other
 
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
legislation but I think this body has
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
heard of there's licensing and
 
00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
credentialing and then there's
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
programming or other services that are
 
00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:24.839 align:start position:0%
offered and sometimes um they're very
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
intermingled and uh separate that
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
licensing function out sometimes things
 
00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
that are more programmatic get kind of
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
dragged along with the licensing
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
function and so I think the the
 
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
calculation here was this really is a
 
00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
public protection they're the
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
inspections that they are doing are not
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
of specific facilities so just to give
 
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
you a sense the office does employ
 
00:45:47.589 --> 00:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
specific inspectors who go and inspect
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
pharmacies because those are licensed by
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
the office as you can imagine
 
00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
electricians plumbers are all over the
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
state and Residences and Commercial
 
00:45:59.230 --> 00:45:59.240 align:start position:0%
places so there's no actual place to
 
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
inspect so it's more um it's the public
 
00:46:05.069 --> 00:46:05.079 align:start position:0%
safety aspect of Code Enforcement
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
ensuring that they're they're doing the
 
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
work appropriately um there's a lot
 
00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
connected especially with the gas
 
00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
Fitters and um carbon monoxide which is
 
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
been um there's been a few higher
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
profile cases of that so these
 
00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:18.440 align:start position:0%
inspectors are providing that Public
 
00:46:21.309 --> 00:46:21.319 align:start position:0%
Safety piece and really that function
 
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
fits within the fire Marshall's mission
 
00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
of you know we want electricians to be
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
complying with the code so that there
 
00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
are not fires in buildings um and so
 
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
that function had kind of been I would
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
say not quite dragged over but had moved
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
over with the board when really the
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
credentialing of professionals is a
 
00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:40.760 align:start position:0%
separate thing than this than the work
 
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
that they're doing and so the estimation
 
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:45.640 align:start position:0%
was the Fire Marshals is the one that in
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
the middle of the night see needs a
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
license to look at some critical issue
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
with the carbon monoxide The Lure office
 
00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
is 8 to four and we're you know we're
 
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
moving paperwork around so that was kind
 
00:46:59.630 --> 00:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
of the distinction there okay I have a a
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
question about it are the inspectors
 
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
paid from the plumbing gas fitter and uh
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
electricians license fees or are they
 
00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
separately funded they're currently paid
 
00:47:13.309 --> 00:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
at the oplc just has won all license
 
00:47:15.309 --> 00:47:15.319 align:start position:0%
fees from boards go into one fund so
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
they're currently paid out of that fund
 
00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:19.720 align:start position:0%
which consists exclusively of money from
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
licensees from fees so it is not a one
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
to one right so you're transferring nine
 
00:47:28.109 --> 00:47:28.119 align:start position:0%
positions and I don't see that there's a
 
00:47:28.119 --> 00:47:30.069 align:start position:0%
positions and I don't see that there's a
funding

00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
transfer no okay so you're the Fire
 
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
Marshall is expected to pick up the uh
 
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding the governor's
 
00:47:40.589 --> 00:47:40.599 align:start position:0%
office in their
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
proposal they there was an understanding
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
that it would be General funds in the
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
department of safety and that was that
 
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
yep I just want to make sure that's
 
00:47:58.750 --> 00:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
perfectly clear yes of CC
 
00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:01.720 align:start position:0%
who inspects the lifts at Canon
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
Mountain that's also the department of
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
safety yeah there's a actually a Tramway
 
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
passenger safety board over at the
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
department of safety
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
yes processed many an appointment to
 
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
that use the
 
00:48:20.349 --> 00:48:20.359 align:start position:0%
rope okay it's not as far to drop all
 
00:48:23.069 --> 00:48:23.079 align:start position:0%
right so that's a um
 
00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
represent I'm sorry um I'm just trying
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
to understand what you're saying so all
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
right now all these inspectors have a
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
license and they are underneath they are
 
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
part of the oplc infrastructure right
 
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
and when you say they're paid by oplc
 
00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
are we talking about the work that they
 
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:46.040 align:start position:0%
do in inspecting these facilities they
 
00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
their state employees that their their
 
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
paycheck is yes yep okay I got it okay
 
00:48:55.549 --> 00:48:55.559 align:start position:0%
thank you so I understand thank you yep
 
00:48:58.030 --> 00:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
yes follow up so they would still follow
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
their licensing Pro um process would
 
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
still be under OPC that is the current
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
proposal does not make any change to the
 
00:49:10.789 --> 00:49:10.799 align:start position:0%
board or the licensing function just
 
00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
those positions moving to safety to the
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
fire Marshall's office yep so no change
 
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
to the license got it yep thank you
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
okay that makes sense we just want to
 
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that we know that safety knows
 
00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:24.030 align:start position:0%
make sure that we know that safety knows
to

00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
uh have pay for nine people plus travel
 
00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:32.200 align:start position:0%
yes okay and we are actively I'm sure
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
that you know the agencies over the
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
weekend received the fiscal not
 
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
worksheet request for hb2 so there
 
00:49:39.549 --> 00:49:39.559 align:start position:0%
should be more robust financial
 
00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
information coming um and we're
 
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
obviously included in that request and
 
00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
that'll be reflected there yeah no no
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
we're we're fine we just want to make
 
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's open and everybody knows about
 
00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
okay the same with the electrical
 
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
inspectors that is correct which is fine
 
00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:57.309 align:start position:0%
inspectors that is correct which is fine
okay

00:49:57.309 --> 00:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:49:59.069 --> 00:49:59.079 align:start position:0%
all right anybody have any issues with
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
that other than making sure the the the
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:14.349 --> 00:50:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
inspections so you're adding a
 
00:50:19.589 --> 00:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
definition for
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
shop which is uh probably
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
right all I don't what have they got
 
00:50:37.789 --> 00:50:37.799 align:start position:0%
there there's
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
schools no actually you're not you're
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
not apparently licensing the school it's
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
changing to licensing the curriculum is
 
00:51:02.589 --> 00:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
that correct on page 73 near the top
 
00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
Roman uh
 
00:51:07.109 --> 00:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
7 I'm sorry the page numbering is
 
00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:09.160 align:start position:0%
different on the different printouts um
 
00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
no doubt no doubt it's
 
00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
looking it's changing from light
 
00:51:28.789 --> 00:51:28.799 align:start position:0%
criteria for licensing and approval of
 
00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:32.440 align:start position:0%
schools and their curriculum to criteria
 
00:51:37.069 --> 00:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
curriculum which which is not at all the
 
00:51:39.839 --> 00:51:40.870 align:start position:0%
curriculum which which is not at all the
same

00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
thing it's it implies that there's no
 
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
approval of the school as a whole
 
00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
because you took out I see okay
 
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
yes yes so the the as proposed this
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
would not include the school facility
 
00:51:57.839 --> 00:52:00.829 align:start position:0%
would not include the school facility
being

00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:00.839 --> 00:52:03.150 align:start position:0%
 
inspected

00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:03.160 align:start position:0%
inspected
 
00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
but um but it also implies that you
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
school not criteria
 
00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:18.200 align:start position:0%
for because the
 
00:52:20.589 --> 00:52:20.599 align:start position:0%
and was a condition of both things if
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
you take the word and out no it's
 
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
not right it's not at all the same thing
 
00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:30.440 align:start position:0%
well I'm happy to look at that it was
 
00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
not a proposal to eliminate a license
 
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
all right that was or that I will say
 
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
that was not the intent so good is it
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
that's a a significant change that I yes
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
no that was not the intent I apologize
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
so so it's it's to eliminate the
 
00:52:48.359 --> 00:52:51.030 align:start position:0%
so so it's it's to eliminate the
facility

00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:52:53.309 --> 00:52:53.319 align:start position:0%
inspections or
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
actually I don't think I don't know if
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
you need any CH there at all if you you
 
00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:04.589 --> 00:53:04.599 align:start position:0%
criteria yes
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
let we will have to get back with a
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation to include or to not
 
00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
exclude the licensing of a school
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
because that was not the intent okay yep
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
well that's uh we'll leave that ball in
 
00:53:20.349 --> 00:53:20.359 align:start position:0%
your cour thank you attorney fry will be
 
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
right on
 
00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
it whatever you say I hope you heard
 
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:27.190 align:start position:0%
it whatever you say I hope you heard
that

00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
I saw him he did he did he heard the
 
00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.510 align:start position:0%
I saw him he did he did he heard the
smirk

00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
smirk
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
too all right so exemptions admit
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
standards for operation health and
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
safety uh represent gr thank you I'd
 
00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
like to go back to the definition of
 
00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:48.680 align:start position:0%
shop because I looked at the RSA 313a
 
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:51.880 align:start position:0%
colon one and we have a definition for
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
barber shop so I how does that
 
00:54:00.109 --> 00:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
shop means Barbershop I'm trying to are
 
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
we saying then if you go back to
 
00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:05.720 align:start position:0%
Barbershop is defined in section three
 
00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:06.950 align:start position:0%
Barbershop is defined in section three
of

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:09.640 align:start position:0%
that I haven't had the chance to go back
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
through the rest of it but why are we
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
adding this
 
00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
definition because there's also a
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
Salon I say 13 A1 yeah if you look at 13
 
00:54:28.829 --> 00:54:28.839 align:start position:0%
A1 section three barbering there's
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
Barber Shop means bar yeah and then
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
later on there's a definition for
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
Salon which is mobile Barber Shop is
 
00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
defined in Roman 11 Salon is Roman 12
 
00:54:46.589 --> 00:54:46.599 align:start position:0%
right and barber shop is
 
00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:49.720 align:start position:0%
three right so this just says we're
 
00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:52.599 align:start position:0%
we're being we're using shop as a as a
 
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
term to apply to all of those things yes
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
represent and um on 3113 d19 there is
 
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:03.880 align:start position:0%
shop ler so that may be to clarify what
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
the meaning of shop and Shop liur is
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
okay as long as we're not conflicting
 
00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
ourselves thank you I was trying to
 
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
understand it myself that's when I found
 
00:55:15.549 --> 00:55:15.559 align:start position:0%
that part so that's where shop licensing
 
00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:23.029 --> 00:55:23.039 align:start position:0%
colon9 that was updated um July 15th of
 
00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:25.000 align:start position:0%
2023 so I don't know if that was part of
 
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
the large process wait a
 
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
313 a19 oh a19 okay yes we we change
 
00:55:37.870 --> 00:55:37.880 align:start position:0%
things then all 19 yes shop
 
00:55:40.109 --> 00:55:40.119 align:start position:0%
lure uh to
 
00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:44.680 align:start position:0%
maintain uhuh okay yeah fine so it's
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
shop is just shorthand we can handle I
 
00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
think we can handle
 
00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
that um and that defines for maintain a
 
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
salon barber shop or Mar mobile barber
 
00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
shop so that's consistent with a new
 
00:55:55.599 --> 00:55:56.990 align:start position:0%
shop so that's consistent with a new
definition

00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
definition
 
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
okay okay that could be simplified being
 
00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
shop means anything at all pretty close
 
00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
yeah any facility that needs to be
 
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
inspected for initial licensure would be
 
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
included in that yep okay and all right
 
00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
so then there's a new Roman
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
14 uh what onetime certification
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
programs are the equivalent an AA
 
00:56:25.029 --> 00:56:25.039 align:start position:0%
certificate that me or exceeds 10 hours
 
00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
and is earned in barbering cosmetology
 
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
manicuring or Aesthetics for the purpose
 
00:56:33.549 --> 00:56:33.559 align:start position:0%
of operating a shop or
 
00:56:33.559 --> 00:56:36.190 align:start position:0%
of operating a shop or
school

00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:36.200 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
so so that says that uh somewhere you've
 
00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
got to be talking
 
00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
about the user
 
00:56:49.549 --> 00:56:49.559 align:start position:0%
certificate yes so if you again we have
 
00:56:52.109 --> 00:56:52.119 align:start position:0%
different page numbers but in the
 
00:56:54.029 --> 00:56:54.039 align:start position:0%
section that is amending
 
00:56:57.069 --> 00:56:57.079 align:start position:0%
313-a 19
 
00:56:57.079 --> 00:56:58.870 align:start position:0%
313-a 19
Roman

00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
Roman
 
00:57:02.829 --> 00:57:02.839 align:start position:0%
2 ah there's the section there so
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
the the statute as proposed contemplates
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
that there could be another course in
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
the universe that would provide the same
 
00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:13.720 align:start position:0%
level of training and it the previous
 
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
section you referenced that Roman 14
 
00:57:18.029 --> 00:57:18.039 align:start position:0%
would put the onus on the board to
 
00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:19.880 align:start position:0%
create rules just to determine what
 
00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
others may be encapsulated as to not
 
00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:24.440 align:start position:0%
prescribe the only one
 
00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:27.400 align:start position:0%
course would meet that qualification
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:30.789 align:start position:0%
okay so
that

00:57:30.789 --> 00:57:30.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
um meets all the
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
requirements and there's
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
a for an inspection conducted on initial
 
00:57:44.589 --> 00:57:44.599 align:start position:0%
lure or for an inspection conducted upon
 
00:57:46.829 --> 00:57:46.839 align:start position:0%
initial licenser and the licenser has
 
00:57:46.839 --> 00:57:50.069 align:start position:0%
initial licenser and the licenser has
their

00:57:50.069 --> 00:57:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:59.950 --> 00:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
I it
 
00:58:03.309 --> 00:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
would there are a lot of words
 
00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
there I wonder if there could be fewer
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
words to say the same thing in that
 
00:58:11.309 --> 00:58:11.319 align:start position:0%
specifically um Roman 2B so I guess
 
00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:13.240 align:start position:0%
actually representative Pearson was so
 
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
kind as to give me the copy so I am on
 
00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
Page 75 in your packet there right all
 
00:58:20.309 --> 00:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:58:23.789 --> 00:58:23.799 align:start position:0%
um so that if I read this correctly it
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
says that when you do an inspection upon
 
00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
initial lure
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
which you can do it differently if the
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
leny has the certificate is that correct
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
yes so the proposal be uh in hb2 is that
 
00:58:41.829 --> 00:58:41.839 align:start position:0%
a a shop owner so again shop is our
 
00:58:44.349 --> 00:58:44.359 align:start position:0%
short hand for any facility owner that
 
00:58:45.549 --> 00:58:45.559 align:start position:0%
falls under this
 
00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction they have two options
 
00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%
everyone will have an inspection for
 
00:58:49.839 --> 00:58:51.270 align:start position:0%
everyone will have an inspection for
initial

00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
initial
 
00:58:54.349 --> 00:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
lure and then they can choose to either
 
00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:57.640 align:start position:0%
get the lifetime sanitation training
 
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
certificate there or they could choose
 
00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
the current process which is that they
 
00:59:04.349 --> 00:59:04.359 align:start position:0%
have an inspection upon
 
00:59:08.349 --> 00:59:08.359 align:start position:0%
initial a licensure they have a routine
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
inspection the next year and then they
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
have an inspection for their renewal of
 
00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
their license in which would be after 2
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
years so presently a
 
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
shop is getting an inspection every year
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
the initial the
 
00:59:26.589 --> 00:59:26.599 align:start position:0%
routine renewal routine
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
renewal routine and so on because that
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
that seems a little excessive so
 
00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
that I would agree with that assessment
 
00:59:38.029 --> 00:59:38.039 align:start position:0%
and this this policy says maybe we don't
 
00:59:40.829 --> 00:59:40.839 align:start position:0%
need it maybe the safety and sanitation
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
would provide some public protection and
 
00:59:45.029 --> 00:59:45.039 align:start position:0%
to say that they've had the adequate
 
00:59:46.589 --> 00:59:46.599 align:start position:0%
training they're certified in that way
 
00:59:50.109 --> 00:59:50.119 align:start position:0%
if they can demonstrate it then the
 
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
office instead of going every year could
 
00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:55.720 align:start position:0%
respond if a complaint came in against a
 
00:59:58.430 --> 00:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
shop or a shop owner an inspection could
 
01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
be done in response to a complaint to
 
01:00:03.789 --> 01:00:03.799 align:start position:0%
verify that they're in compliance with
 
01:00:05.789 --> 01:00:05.799 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that the language here says
 
01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
that because this implies that there's a
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
different initial lure inspection if
 
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
you've got that certificate it doesn't
 
01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:20.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:23.839 align:start position:0%
whatever Madam chair I'm not I'm not
 
01:00:26.829 --> 01:00:26.839 align:start position:0%
really in favor of having people go in
 
01:00:28.029 --> 01:00:28.039 align:start position:0%
if there's a complaint because if
 
01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
there's a complaint it's already an
 
01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
issue right I don't I we don't have to I
 
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
don't know what the criteria is but I
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
agree with the chair that this doesn't
 
01:00:40.589 --> 01:00:40.599 align:start position:0%
say what you just said so that no the if
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
you look on the next page the Roman five
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
is new and it says it's the obligation
 
01:00:50.549 --> 01:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
of any individual who runs a shop to
 
01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
ensure the shop maintains compliance
 
01:00:55.549 --> 01:00:55.559 align:start position:0%
with with rules and and failure to
 
01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
maintain compliance is conduct
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
sufficient to support dis disciplinary
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
proceedings so that if there is a
 
01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:05.039 align:start position:0%
complaint or there is some reason for
 
01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:08.680 align:start position:0%
the board to initiate an
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
investigation um you can go in and
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
expect and do anything but where does it
 
01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:15.880 align:start position:0%
say that
 
01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
the um that you have multiple
 
01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:22.839 align:start position:0%
inspections of a of a barber
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
shop I mean is that in statute or is
 
01:01:29.549 --> 01:01:29.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to that I'm
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm 80% sure that would be C
 
01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
incurrent rule in the PLC 400s I don't
 
01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:40.039 align:start position:0%
know that the annual inspection is
 
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
currently in law if you're looking at
 
01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
this it um it talks about a you get an
 
01:01:47.359 --> 01:01:48.870 align:start position:0%
this it um it talks about a you get an
inspection

01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't say you get an inspection
 
01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
except at
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say anywhere about
 
01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
inspections attorney fry is going to
 
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
pull up the current statute to see if
 
01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
there's any if I may I do remember a
 
01:02:09.549 --> 01:02:09.559 align:start position:0%
conversation with um some of the oplc
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
inspectors that we had testified before
 
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
us that if I'm not mistaken the
 
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
inspections are done every two
 
01:02:22.349 --> 01:02:22.359 align:start position:0%
years but oh there are only a few
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
inspectors and because they are also the
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
same ones that are investig getting the
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
complaints it's a stretch that they do
 
01:02:32.349 --> 01:02:32.359 align:start position:0%
it every two years okay so what it says
 
01:02:37.109 --> 01:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
is sanitary if you look at Roman 313 a21
 
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
Roman 3 sanitary inspections of all
 
01:02:42.190 --> 01:02:42.200 align:start position:0%
salar barber shops and schools shall be
 
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
made at least once a year so that is in
 
01:02:47.269 --> 01:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
current law yep so we we really
 
01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
recommend you delete that as well okay
 
01:02:54.829 --> 01:02:54.839 align:start position:0%
because if you're going to do it on
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
initial lure and when you think there's
 
01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:01.559 align:start position:0%
a need for it or you're doing an
 
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
investigation you you don't want to have
 
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.910 align:start position:0%
investigation you you don't want to have
routine

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
inspections I got a question for you yes
 
01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
I think and for you
 
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
D the annual inspections that are
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
occurrent in current law right that are
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
occurring yeah what are they finding in
 
01:03:22.589 --> 01:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
those annual inspections are they pretty
 
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
much routine not a big deal are we
 
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
finding problems
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
like what is what is the current status
 
01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
what is the current result of those
 
01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:33.150 align:start position:0%
what is the current result of those
annual

01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:33.160 align:start position:0%
annual
 
01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
inspections the the office is in a a
 
01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
slight well not a slight there's an
 
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
adjustment of the procedure on the on
 
01:03:44.589 --> 01:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
the half of the office about how these
 
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
inspections are completed um so we're
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
moving towards a model and they have
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
started to roll out where they're going
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
in for inspections and the shops have an
 
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity if deficiency are identified
 
01:03:59.710 --> 01:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
to have a a deficiency correction plan
 
01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:02.599 align:start position:0%
to rectify it and and then move forward
 
01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:05.240 align:start position:0%
there so the there are deficiencies that
 
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
are identified I don't I could maybe get
 
01:04:10.109 --> 01:04:10.119 align:start position:0%
you like a generalized report of what
 
01:04:12.190 --> 01:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
they're finding but it it's generally
 
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
cleanliness these inspections are
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
lasting some of
 
01:04:18.549 --> 01:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
them none of them are more than an hour
 
01:04:19.870 --> 01:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
and that would be like quite a large
 
01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
Salon with a number of people there so
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
they're not um
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
there basic sanitation I mean I I don't
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
want to get into details about
 
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
fingernails and Combs and hair on the
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
floor but that's the type of that's the
 
01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:35.480 align:start position:0%
type of I won't go to a barber shop that
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't have hair on the floor because
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
it means they're not
 
01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
working well if your barber shop has
 
01:04:42.269 --> 01:04:42.279 align:start position:0%
hair on the floor and inspector comes
 
01:04:44.309 --> 01:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
they may be written up for that so they
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
ought to at least a br swing a broom by
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
every few people but I think that what
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do you you have to
 
01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
repeal uh that Clause that says they
 
01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
inection yes I I agree with you all
 
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
right the intent how do we feel
 
01:05:11.309 --> 01:05:11.319 align:start position:0%
about going from requiring annual
 
01:05:16.029 --> 01:05:16.039 align:start position:0%
inspections to saying when necessary or
 
01:05:16.039 --> 01:05:16.950 align:start position:0%
inspections to saying when necessary or
or

01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
triggered we got a definition for when
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
necessary and
 
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:24.200 align:start position:0%
triggered it's in uh I don't have a copy
 
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
of that I gave it to her so I'm
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
oh we've got some spares here pass this
 
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.190 align:start position:0%
oh we've got some spares here pass this
but

01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
down it says that um it doesn't talk
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
about it it says that the board can take
 
01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action against any
 
01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
licy all right uh the shop owner or
 
01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
manager must maintain compliance with
 
01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:50.990 align:start position:0%
manager must maintain compliance with
this

01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.430 align:start position:0%
this
chapter

01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
so gu
 
01:05:58.829 --> 01:05:58.839 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be doing that now I
 
01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
mean all this basically if you're a shop
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
owner you are supposed to be keeping you
 
01:06:05.269 --> 01:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
know you're supposed to be doing that so
 
01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
this to me just States the obvious but
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
then I have a concern with I understand
 
01:06:13.269 --> 01:06:13.279 align:start position:0%
that maybe once a year is a lot
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
considering how many but at the same
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
time just leaving it to when there's a
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
concern or when there's a problem to me
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
that the the import of an inspection if
 
01:06:26.829 --> 01:06:26.839 align:start position:0%
I remember speaking with the inspector
 
01:06:26.839 --> 01:06:27.910 align:start position:0%
I remember speaking with the inspector
was

01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
that um it
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
triggers Corrections and it and most of
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
the corrections have to do with hygiene
 
01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:38.200 align:start position:0%
and so it's important to trigger those
 
01:06:40.829 --> 01:06:40.839 align:start position:0%
things before somebody actually gets an
 
01:06:44.269 --> 01:06:44.279 align:start position:0%
infection right so maybe we you know we
 
01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
extend it I have a concern just
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
eliminating it and this to me um
 
01:06:54.789 --> 01:06:54.799 align:start position:0%
is Section Five where is the obligation
 
01:06:57.269 --> 01:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
of the individual ual I think it's their
 
01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
obligation anyway but um it should be
 
01:07:02.349 --> 01:07:02.359 align:start position:0%
yes so to me that's stating the obvious
 
01:07:04.269 --> 01:07:04.279 align:start position:0%
but if we need to put it in
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
law you know that seems I think we would
 
01:07:11.710 --> 01:07:11.720 align:start position:0%
want to say that you know if if it if
 
01:07:14.829 --> 01:07:14.839 align:start position:0%
any inspection finds something there
 
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
shall be a follow-up inspection I mean
 
01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:19.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's what you really want is to
 
01:07:21.309 --> 01:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
is to concentrate on the places that
 
01:07:21.319 --> 01:07:22.430 align:start position:0%
is to concentrate on the places that
have

01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
problems would that well you want to
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
have some kind of a modality I mean
 
01:07:29.269 --> 01:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
obviously we know that the owner has the
 
01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility right clearly or or if
 
01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
they they have somebody else who's the
 
01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
manager then it's the manager's
 
01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
responsibility but there's a
 
01:07:40.510 --> 01:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility in law I'm sure I can't
 
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
believe it isn't uh to that cleanliness
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
be maintained and you want to have some
 
01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
kind of a modality so if there's a
 
01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:51.640 align:start position:0%
complaint or a problem that they can
 
01:07:56.109 --> 01:07:56.119 align:start position:0%
address that because once a year
 
01:07:58.870 --> 01:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
well you you know lots of businesses you
 
01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
you see them and they're constantly
 
01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
cleaning but as as Steve said uh if
 
01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
there's not hair on the floor they're
 
01:08:11.349 --> 01:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
not open you know because you just can't
 
01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
operated but you have to clean it up on
 
01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
a regular basis so that the place is
 
01:08:18.030 --> 01:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
clean at the beginning of the
 
01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
day so if if if the inspection routine
 
01:08:24.189 --> 01:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
of this yearly thing is in rules is it
 
01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
in rules yes it's also so in statute it
 
01:08:28.829 --> 01:08:28.839 align:start position:0%
is in statute oh it's in statute okay
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
that was the a21 Roman 3 okay and that
 
01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
requires an annual inspection and I
 
01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:40.759 align:start position:0%
believe the point is that you want to um
 
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
do fewer than annual you and you want to
 
01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:45.759 align:start position:0%
concentrate on the dirty places and I I
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
do think if we're um I'm sorry we're
 
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the PDF from the website of
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
hb2 but I think so so section
 
01:08:57.070 --> 01:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
202 it's actually a repeal and reenact
 
01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:57.829 align:start position:0%
202 it's actually a repeal and reenact
of

01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:09:02.110 --> 01:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
a21 only to include Romans 1 and two and
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
Ro they are where's that that text so
 
01:09:10.269 --> 01:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:14.799 align:start position:0%
text oh I you see so it it is a repeal
 
01:09:18.269 --> 01:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
on page 75 a total rewrite M so that
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay okay at the time of initial and
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
initially okay this calls for
 
01:09:32.799 --> 01:09:35.709 align:start position:0%
initially okay this calls for
annually

01:09:35.709 --> 01:09:35.719 align:start position:0%
annually
 
01:09:38.309 --> 01:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
um or for an
 
01:09:41.149 --> 01:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
investigation unless the certificate
 
01:09:44.110 --> 01:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
right the health certificate has been so
 
01:09:46.829 --> 01:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
achieved would B anually be more
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:55.149 --> 01:09:55.159 align:start position:0%
annually okay the lovely word by anal
 
01:09:55.159 --> 01:09:55.830 align:start position:0%
annually okay the lovely word by anal
yes

01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
every two years or twice a year that's
 
01:10:02.910 --> 01:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
it I think that makes sense that that we
 
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
you only do a routine you do a routine
 
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
inspection sometime in the licensing
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
period And if necessary do it
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
again if you've got um issues all
 
01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
right yes thank you for noticing that
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
that's a repeal and replace so that so
 
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
you're doing away with it then what
 
01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
we're not no we're saying that they
 
01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
sanitary inspections at the time of
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
initial lure and by annually thereafter
 
01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
gotcha unless you have a certificate
 
01:10:41.189 --> 01:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:44.830 --> 01:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
investigation now do we want to have
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
something to reference a frequency
 
01:10:48.669 --> 01:10:48.679 align:start position:0%
change if there are violations or does
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
the oplc have the authority to say okay
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
we found a significant problem we'll be
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
back in 3 months we'll be back every six
 
01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
months that would be in the rule that'd
 
01:10:59.070 --> 01:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
be rules yeah LLC already has authority
 
01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
to inspect anything upon its own
 
01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
initiative perfect so we would not
 
01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:04.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily even need a complaint to
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
respond to we don't make a habit of just
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
chasing people around uh but we do have
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
the authority if a concern arose yeah
 
01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
okay and uh there's a You're repealing
 
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
The Apprentice registration
 
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
apprenticeships the section
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
that it says um Apprentice registration
 
01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
and certificates but it actually is it's
 
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
a repeal of a section about providing a
 
01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
social security number ah uh only Roman
 
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
Roman five yep so it says they shall not
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
be required to provide a social security
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
number as a prerequisite for obtaining a
 
01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
certificate which is uh in a direct
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
conflict to RSA 310 which is requires a
 
01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
social security number for any
 
01:11:52.629 --> 01:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
credential from the office in federal
 
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
law okay so we that's say all right so
 
01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship okay that that's not a
 
01:12:08.270 --> 01:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
then guess it would be a big deal if it
 
01:12:14.629 --> 01:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
stayed well eventually yeah
 
01:12:18.189 --> 01:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
okay just for from a procedural
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
standpoint are we going to make comments
 
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
to division one based on this discussion
 
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
and and you will be assembling that and
 
01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
doing that who's doing that okay yes
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
because um they've going to go be going
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
through it but we have um so at the
 
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
moment we got a couple of red flags and
 
01:12:39.629 --> 01:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
some minor and some changes here with
 
01:12:42.669 --> 01:12:42.679 align:start position:0%
the uh the inspections
 
01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
okay the one other thing it might be
 
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
worth including in a note if I may is
 
01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
there there is pending legislation in
 
01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
the Senate to change the number of hours
 
01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
required for some of these uh license
 
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
types so I I guess I would just want to
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
be mindful of when we're overlapping in
 
01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
those dates because there is a proposal
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
um but we're not going to make changes
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
based on a Senate bill that hasn't come
 
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
over to the house yet so when you see it
 
01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
I guess you could be mindful of that we
 
01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
will take a look at it and make sure
 
01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
that the effective dates are appropriate
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you that's that's the easiest
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
think and what else and I think
 
01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:30.270 align:start position:0%
think and what else and I think
the

01:13:30.270 --> 01:13:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
um couple of years ago we had a bill to
 
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
allow some school some
 
01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship for lure and that doesn't
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:48.270 align:start position:0%
 
there

01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
okay are there do you have rules for
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
um petition for exemptions from the
 
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists we will look that up for
 
01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
you presently don't have that off the
 
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh because at the moment it's got 1500
 
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.629 --> 01:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship but yeah so for specific
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
to cosmetologists that's 313
 
01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
11 right so that is an either
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
or okay yep and but Roman 2 has got a u
 
01:14:40.669 --> 01:14:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:43.629 --> 01:14:43.639 align:start position:0%
exemption anyway we'll uh when we get we
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
can take that back that okay okay all
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
right anyone else up the sitech where is
 
01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
it's in the Roman it's in the definition
 
01:15:04.350 --> 01:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
section it is um 13 terrific I just want
 
01:15:08.990 --> 01:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
to know that it is yes a dedicated
 
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
program the purpose of teaching
 
01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:13.400 align:start position:0%
cosmetology manicuring barbering or
 
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
Aesthetics okay good it's pretty broad
 
01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:21.430 align:start position:0%
Aesthetics okay good it's pretty broad
represent

01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:23.629 --> 01:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
Bailey can you turn your microphone on
 
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
so we can hear you going back to page 73
 
01:15:31.229 --> 01:15:31.239 align:start position:0%
I aren't there 24s the new bolded one
 
01:15:34.510 --> 01:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
and the old conditions and standards one
 
01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
sorry yes aren't there two item
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
14s conditions and standards and then
 
01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
the new B you're so
 
01:15:45.870 --> 01:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
right thank you for catching that put
 
01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
that in there just to see if anybody
 
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
everybody knows our rooman
 
01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
numerals I I'll just mention that to
 
01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
finance and I think they can be trusted
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
take care of it thank you I would not
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
attorney fry is right on it they do have
 
01:16:32.629 --> 01:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
rules it's B A
 
01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
r35.1 applying for an exemption okay so
 
01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
that's so that if somebody comes in
 
01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:41.960 align:start position:0%
with uh one couple of classes in the
 
01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
school and then some apprenticeship
 
01:16:45.950 --> 01:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
hours you
 
01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
can yes it does appear that um they
 
01:16:50.990 --> 01:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
could be updated because one of the
 
01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
requirements is if they've registered as
 
01:16:57.149 --> 01:16:57.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:59.629 --> 01:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
1989 probably you don't have very many
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
apprentices left who did
 
01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
that fair fair point
 
01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
okay here I have a question
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
yeah I just read this on so this is
 
01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:13.239 align:start position:0%
after the
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
um the this the section that we looked
 
01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
on for the initial lure and B anual on
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
the next
 
01:17:26.110 --> 01:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
paragraph which is section three page 75
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
five it talks about the board may take
 
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action rather than
 
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:46.590 --> 01:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
policy oh okay right yes it is so I
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
think that's to give them more
 
01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
flexibility yes it would it would allow
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
other disciplinary rather than just
 
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
revoking it that there there's other
 
01:17:57.510 --> 01:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
sanctions other mechanisms under 31012
 
01:17:59.390 --> 01:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
that they right but then wouldn't it say
 
01:18:02.830 --> 01:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
may revoke or take disciplinary action I
 
01:18:04.669 --> 01:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
would say revocation would be included
 
01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
in the Slate of options of disciplinary
 
01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
action you okay as long as that okay I
 
01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
mean the goal is compliance right
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
obviously we're trying to work with them
 
01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
to right so hit hitting revoke right out
 
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
of the gate I think is is like it's
 
01:18:22.709 --> 01:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
better to turning it up to 11 right away
 
01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
if you get what I'm saying I just want
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we have got that
 
01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:27.790 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we have got that
flagged

01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
flagged
 
01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:41.790 --> 01:18:41.800 align:start position:0%
right a a new section on operating a
 
01:18:41.800 --> 01:19:00.270 align:start position:0%
right a a new section on operating a
school

01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:01.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:19:01.390 --> 01:19:01.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
so a school has an
 
01:19:07.149 --> 01:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
inspection on initial
 
01:19:10.990 --> 01:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
lure but it doesn't necessarily
 
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
look oh no yes School you you may
 
01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
inspect and sanitary inspections are
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
um jumping back to the disciplinary
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
licensing disciplinary actions I looked
 
01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
and in that um the larger statute for
 
01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
oplc 310 the sanctions include
 
01:19:39.070 --> 01:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
revocation of a license so that just
 
01:19:44.669 --> 01:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:58.390 align:start position:0%
 
all

01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
right all right so we have a couple
 
01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
of um comments on the pension section
 
01:20:09.629 --> 01:20:09.639 align:start position:0%
mostly to make sure that Finance
 
01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:11.800 align:start position:0%
understands what the current law is and
 
01:20:13.629 --> 01:20:13.639 align:start position:0%
what the changes are and they've they've
 
01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
properly accounted for the the
 
01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:18.390 align:start position:0%
properly accounted for the the
costs

01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
um and on the rest of them the um
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
lure again we want to make we don't
 
01:20:30.149 --> 01:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
object to relocating the inspectors we
 
01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure everyone involved
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
knows what the costs
 
01:20:36.669 --> 01:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
are and then
 
01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:41.310 align:start position:0%
for uh
cosmetologist

01:20:41.310 --> 01:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist
 
01:20:44.189 --> 01:20:44.199 align:start position:0%
um director jurius will tell us about
 
01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
the licensing and approval of schools
 
01:20:48.189 --> 01:20:48.199 align:start position:0%
and curriculum because I don't think
 
01:20:52.270 --> 01:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
that that says what um what you want to
 
01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:55.550 align:start position:0%
that that says what um what you want to
say

01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
we'll get Roman
 
01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:59.229 align:start position:0%
we'll get Roman
15

01:20:59.229 --> 01:20:59.239 align:start position:0%
15
 
01:20:59.239 --> 01:21:01.430 align:start position:0%
15
established

01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
established
 
01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.629 align:start position:0%
established
and

01:21:03.629 --> 01:21:03.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh under on page
 
01:21:08.910 --> 01:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
75 Roman
 
01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:12.709 align:start position:0%
75 Roman
2

01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
um and I I think that the second that
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
little B paragraph is
 
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry which are you talking about
 
01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
the page 76 page
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
75 there's the about the shop um gets a
 
01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
getting a shop license the board will
 
01:21:48.669 --> 01:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
um meet all the requirements and the
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
rules and have an inspection on the
 
01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
initial licenser and it doesn't and
 
01:21:58.990 --> 01:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
the initial inspection is not different
 
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
if the if they've got that certificate
 
01:22:03.629 --> 01:22:03.639 align:start position:0%
is it or do you tend it to
 
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
be what my understanding of that is
 
01:22:10.030 --> 01:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
everybody gets an initial licensure and
 
01:22:13.870 --> 01:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
if you've got that OSHA certificate
 
01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
then it gives you if you don't have the
 
01:22:19.149 --> 01:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
OSHA certificate then you're going to
 
01:22:22.510 --> 01:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
get an inspection by annually no that I
 
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
don't think you need it here because the
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
the new section on sanitary inspections
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
which is on page
 
01:22:35.310 --> 01:22:35.320 align:start position:0%
77 shall be made at the just pointing in
 
01:22:38.070 --> 01:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
inspections at the time of initial Lure
 
01:22:44.830 --> 01:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
certificate or when there's an where
 
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
there's an investigation that's needed
 
01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
to be uh I'm sorry I must be blind I
 
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
don't see that on page 77
 
01:22:58.430 --> 01:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
it's uh Roman two inspectors oh I see
 
01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
all shops and
 
01:23:04.149 --> 01:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
schools so why do we have that there and
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
then have it
 
01:23:09.070 --> 01:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
again I don't see that we need it I
 
01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
think we I think we don't want to do the
 
01:23:13.310 --> 01:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
change on page
 
01:23:17.070 --> 01:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
75 because that they meet all the
 
01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:20.639 align:start position:0%
requirements in the rules and then it
 
01:23:23.070 --> 01:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
and this the inspection is in the
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
rules I think
 
01:23:31.709 --> 01:23:31.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:36.990 --> 01:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
nicely I well I think the portion in on
 
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.550 align:start position:0%
nicely I well I think the portion in on
page

01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
77 it refers back to the portion on page
 
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
75 so it's incomplete if you don't ah
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
okay it does yes personent
 
01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
a19 19- a which is on page
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:11.229 --> 01:24:11.239 align:start position:0%
yes all right I think we this we need to
 
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
figure out where we call out that
 
01:24:18.830 --> 01:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
certificate and um the exemption is in
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
so there should be a second reference in
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
on page 77 to to call it out for
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:43.310 --> 01:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
right I have a question on the um new on
 
01:24:46.750 --> 01:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
New on the operating school section is
 
01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
this meant to expand or what is it
 
01:24:52.590 --> 01:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
what's the what's the objective of this
 
01:24:57.390 --> 01:24:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
I think the the idea of 19a operating a
 
01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
school is to have it kind of par the
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
inspection and approval process to
 
01:25:08.109 --> 01:25:08.119 align:start position:0%
parallel that of a shop so I think it
 
01:25:10.350 --> 01:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
just brings it more into into parity to
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
say that to to say that the onus is
 
01:25:16.590 --> 01:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
on right you know the applicant these
 
01:25:18.149 --> 01:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
are things that we assumed were were
 
01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
there all along and you're just putting
 
01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
them into statute
 
01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
yes is that right I I believe so yes I I
 
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
will double check for you and I do I do
 
01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
think there are um you have a case
 
01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
before you of language that was drafted
 
01:25:35.109 --> 01:25:35.119 align:start position:0%
and then a few decisions were made and
 
01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
adjustments were made but perhaps not by
 
01:25:40.270 --> 01:25:40.280 align:start position:0%
the attorney with the most direct
 
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
knowledge of where things could fit and
 
01:25:46.030 --> 01:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
so I we we could Supply some language to
 
01:25:48.629 --> 01:25:48.639 align:start position:0%
try to clean it up for you in terms of
 
01:25:52.590 --> 01:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
so just so we understand the the ask is
 
01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
to change it to a by annual so once
 
01:25:59.950 --> 01:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
within every 2 years inspection or the
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
OSHA certificate for every shop and
 
01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
school okay or end with the re the
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
option of invest inspecting any shop
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
that the board believes needs it and
 
01:26:17.109 --> 01:26:17.119 align:start position:0%
with as few words as possible in in as
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
few places as possible okay yes okay so
 
01:26:24.350 --> 01:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll make sure that they know that
 
01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:25.070 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll make sure that they know that
there's

01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
some new words expected on this we like
 
01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
we'd probably like to see it too
 
01:26:33.629 --> 01:26:33.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely well we will send it to the
 
01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
chairs of both committees how's that
 
01:26:40.590 --> 01:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
okay we'll deal with that all right and
 
01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
then there's one other section on the
 
01:26:44.990 --> 01:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
there's I have a small section on the
 
01:26:47.310 --> 01:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
tax and land appeals and then there's
 
01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
three pages on the D Department of
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
administrative services so I'm passing
 
01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
out the the easy one for first all right
 
01:27:11.229 --> 01:27:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:14.350 --> 01:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
appeals it's section 10 of the handout
 
01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
which is Page 42 so it's section
 
01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:22.950 align:start position:0%
which is Page 42 so it's section
10

01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
ah and and what it does it changes their
 
01:27:31.709 --> 01:27:31.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
appraiser to such clerical and Technical
 
01:27:39.310 --> 01:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
staff as may be necessary I mean they're
 
01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:47.870 --> 01:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
position and they're also eliminating
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:57.950 --> 01:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to figure out what the
 
01:28:00.030 --> 01:28:00.040 align:start position:0%
result of will be of
 
01:28:05.070 --> 01:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
that well instead of having a specific
 
01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
appraiser they'll
 
01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:09.990 align:start position:0%
appraiser they'll
have

01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:28:14.709 --> 01:28:14.719 align:start position:0%
mean that sounds like they need to have
 
01:28:17.950 --> 01:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
at least one person who is knowledgeable
 
01:28:21.870 --> 01:28:21.880 align:start position:0%
about appraising and U the value of
 
01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:24.950 align:start position:0%
about appraising and U the value of
property

01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:28.229 --> 01:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
staff I agree I
 
01:28:43.709 --> 01:28:43.719 align:start position:0%
think just the board hire what they need
 
01:28:43.719 --> 01:28:45.830 align:start position:0%
think just the board hire what they need
okay

01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:56.350 --> 01:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
okay then the same thing with the clerk
 
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
instead of a a clerk appointed by the
 
01:29:08.030 --> 01:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:10.189 --> 01:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
necessary those of us who were here last
 
01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
we remember that we went at border of
 
01:29:15.109 --> 01:29:15.119 align:start position:0%
tax and land appeals in very fundamental
 
01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
ways and it it had kind of been on it
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
running its own shop for quite a long
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
time without much review and there were
 
01:29:26.109 --> 01:29:26.119 align:start position:0%
some deficiencies in the way they were
 
01:29:28.750 --> 01:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
set up so this is an attempt I think to
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
clean it up and give them more leeway
 
01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
but not specif yes and it looks in the
 
01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:37.070 align:start position:0%
but not specif yes and it looks in the
next

01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
section they're saying that the
 
01:29:47.070 --> 01:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
um their hearings instead of being in
 
01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:48.629 align:start position:0%
um their hearings instead of being in
the

01:29:48.629 --> 01:29:48.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
I mean that's where it is it's right
 
01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
there next to the Dr building very close
 
01:30:04.390 --> 01:30:04.400 align:start position:0%
anyway uh to the Dr building and right
 
01:30:06.629 --> 01:30:06.639 align:start position:0%
but current law says that each hearing
 
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
shall be held in the county in which the
 
01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
Declaration is filed so this this says
 
01:30:15.950 --> 01:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
we'll keep you guys right here in
 
01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
conquer right which is probably an
 
01:30:21.109 --> 01:30:21.119 align:start position:0%
improvement represent Lam and it also
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
allows the electronic or telephonic
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
means um to participate in the
 
01:30:27.070 --> 01:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
compensation hearing so that allows
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
people to not have to travel as far
 
01:30:31.149 --> 01:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
either within their County or that's
 
01:30:34.270 --> 01:30:34.280 align:start position:0%
making up for not having it convenient
 
01:30:36.270 --> 01:30:36.280 align:start position:0%
but having it's like the doctor doesn't
 
01:30:38.709 --> 01:30:38.719 align:start position:0%
make house calls anymore you go to the
 
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
doctor the doctor doesn't come to you
 
01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:42.470 align:start position:0%
doctor the doctor doesn't come to you
and

01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
that they're they are a very important
 
01:30:48.149 --> 01:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
entity as opposed to otherwise you got
 
01:30:51.109 --> 01:30:51.119 align:start position:0%
to file in Superior Court right
 
01:30:54.109 --> 01:30:54.119 align:start position:0%
right all right so still have that
 
01:30:56.669 --> 01:30:56.679 align:start position:0%
option but Board of tax and land appeals
 
01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
is specialized in board and tax and land
 
01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
appeals yeah so so the the question is
 
01:31:06.830 --> 01:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
this appears to be saying do it in
 
01:31:10.350 --> 01:31:10.360 align:start position:0%
conquered participate
 
01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
electronically and do we think that's a
 
01:31:16.590 --> 01:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable change to make I think so
 
01:31:19.709 --> 01:31:19.719 align:start position:0%
yeah okay as long yeah as long as that
 
01:31:21.109 --> 01:31:21.119 align:start position:0%
electronic part is there because if you
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
live in Coos it's two hours yeah no
 
01:31:30.030 --> 01:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
okay so so that is a change but we're
 
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:42.629 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:31:42.629 --> 01:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:46.510 --> 01:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
y all right so this will save on travel
 
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
for for the board and for the
 
01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:51.950 align:start position:0%
for for the board and for the
petitioners

01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
petitioners
 
01:32:00.669 --> 01:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
yes exactly all right so we're we're
 
01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
good with
 
01:32:04.679 --> 01:32:08.950 align:start position:0%
good with
that

01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:12.149 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:32:12.149 --> 01:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
no okay are we going to the next section
 
01:32:16.390 --> 01:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
so the next section is the Department of
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
administrative services and it's three
 
01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
pages and we had a problem collating it
 
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to hand you one page at a
 
01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:26.950 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to hand you one page at a
time

01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:32.990 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
well we're we're all perfectly capable
 
01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:43.870 align:start position:0%
well we're we're all perfectly capable
of

01:32:43.870 --> 01:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:59.950 --> 01:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:03.870 --> 01:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:13.109 --> 01:33:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
the okay anybody can fill unfunded
 
01:33:25.310 --> 01:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
positions provided they don't go over
 
01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:27.030 align:start position:0%
positions provided they don't go over
their

01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
budget I think
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
deal we're focusing on the department of
 
01:33:46.109 --> 01:33:46.119 align:start position:0%
administrative Services yes yeah we I I
 
01:33:48.510 --> 01:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
think uh resources is looking at the
 
01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:51.430 align:start position:0%
think uh resources is looking at the
wetlands

01:33:51.430 --> 01:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:55.109 --> 01:33:55.119 align:start position:0%
Council any
 
01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
yeah well they it's it's under Das
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:18.510 --> 01:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:21.430 --> 01:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
anybody they raised the amount that can
 
01:34:24.750 --> 01:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
be spent without
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
prior approval of fiscal fiscal
 
01:34:31.229 --> 01:34:31.239 align:start position:0%
committee from 50,000 to
 
01:34:35.109 --> 01:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
100,000 which is probably this is for
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
Grants and um Federal
 
01:34:43.390 --> 01:34:43.400 align:start position:0%
benefits so I think that's not not $1000
 
01:34:47.709 --> 01:34:47.719 align:start position:0%
for sorry $100,000 for these types of of
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
projects isn't really I'm not going to
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
worry about it okay
 
01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
this is what they did with the executive
 
01:34:57.629 --> 01:34:57.639 align:start position:0%
Council a couple years ago when they
 
01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
went from 5,000 to 10,000 right and then
 
01:35:03.709 --> 01:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
they may have moved up again ah and then
 
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
on transfers within accounting units
 
01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
within their
 
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
department requires the approval of the
 
01:35:13.870 --> 01:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner of administrative
 
01:35:21.109 --> 01:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:24.629 --> 01:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
100,000 all right I'm just wondering
 
01:35:27.629 --> 01:35:27.639 align:start position:0%
about so in underneath Bridge House
 
01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
special accounts they're established
 
01:35:32.149 --> 01:35:32.159 align:start position:0%
there is hereby established in the State
 
01:35:34.350 --> 01:35:34.360 align:start position:0%
Treasury the bridges House special
 
01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:35.590 align:start position:0%
Treasury the bridges House special
account

01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
fund and it says they change it from the
 
01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
funds may be comprised of the governor
 
01:35:43.950 --> 01:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
is authorized to expect to accept public
 
01:35:47.070 --> 01:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
funds gifts grants which shall be used
 
01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
for the purpose and care of bridge
 
01:35:54.990 --> 01:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
houses mhm so is that something
 
01:35:57.430 --> 01:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
that let's see if that that exists
 
01:36:00.189 --> 01:36:00.199 align:start position:0%
already it might right and I'm just
 
01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
wondering if why are we changing it to
 
01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
the governor as opposed to the funds May
 
01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
is that they because typically if you're
 
01:36:11.109 --> 01:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
accepting funds there has to be a ve
 
01:36:13.950 --> 01:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle by which you accept those funds
 
01:36:17.310 --> 01:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
there has to be a approval process this
 
01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:19.149 align:start position:0%
there has to be a approval process this
doesn't

01:36:19.149 --> 01:36:19.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:36:24.109 --> 01:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
um this doesn't say who who is currently
 
01:36:27.229 --> 01:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
authorized for Roman line it doesn't
 
01:36:29.629 --> 01:36:29.639 align:start position:0%
look like there is because it says the
 
01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
funds May comprise of so there's there
 
01:36:34.990 --> 01:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
isn't anyone who's authorized to accept
 
01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
them and I guess they're saying that the
 
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
governor the question huh
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think there's a this is deals
 
01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
with the bridges house this is one
 
01:36:47.790 --> 01:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
building one particular building over in
 
01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
East conquer the bridges house and so it
 
01:36:53.669 --> 01:36:53.679 align:start position:0%
should be it should be capitalized
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
should be capitalized every time it's
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
used in the paragraph I think because
 
01:37:01.070 --> 01:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
this is not about has nothing to do with
 
01:37:03.629 --> 01:37:03.639 align:start position:0%
Bridges no not at all this is all about
 
01:37:05.149 --> 01:37:05.159 align:start position:0%
the Bridge's
 
01:37:08.669 --> 01:37:08.679 align:start position:0%
house okay so that's
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
nine 4-9
 
01:37:21.709 --> 01:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
section we don't have an RSA 4-9 oh wait
 
01:37:28.990 --> 01:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
is ah there is in fact a 4 49- S which
 
01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
account and it doesn't say who's
 
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
authorized to accept or so that's I
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:51.910 --> 01:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
up it's already there okay but I guess
 
01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
um you're right representative
 
01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
we should capitalize Bridge's house
 
01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
because that's confusing it makes it
 
01:38:00.629 --> 01:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
looks like well I mean it could be
 
01:38:03.830 --> 01:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
misread and but the thing is and and
 
01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
since and putting the governor in charge
 
01:38:09.229 --> 01:38:09.239 align:start position:0%
of it is is a wise thing instead of
 
01:38:12.270 --> 01:38:12.280 align:start position:0%
putting it then you got to decide who's
 
01:38:15.669 --> 01:38:15.679 align:start position:0%
going to who's going to run this thing
 
01:38:17.870 --> 01:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
yeah and there's currently nobody
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
authorized so yeah we want somebody okay
 
01:38:22.150 --> 01:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:24.830 align:start position:0%
that's fine
[Music]

01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:38:30.229 --> 01:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
governor and then on the next
 
01:38:37.149 --> 01:38:37.159 align:start position:0%
paragraph it says that the anybody who
 
01:38:41.390 --> 01:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
gets federal funds shall set aside the
 
01:38:43.390 --> 01:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
indirect cost
 
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
portion except the the commissioner of
 
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
administrative Services May wave
 
01:38:59.589 --> 01:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:01.470 --> 01:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not really clear what they
 
01:39:03.950 --> 01:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
specifically can wave if it's the entire
 
01:39:06.669 --> 01:39:06.679 align:start position:0%
section 124 which has to do with federal
 
01:39:09.629 --> 01:39:09.639 align:start position:0%
funds or if it's more specifically just
 
01:39:12.229 --> 01:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
to the audits of federal grants because
 
01:39:14.750 --> 01:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
if we're able to just change what we're
 
01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:16.360 align:start position:0%
doing on federal funds based on one
 
01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
person that seems like a pretty big
 
01:39:20.109 --> 01:39:20.119 align:start position:0%
policy choice but if this is just around
 
01:39:25.310 --> 01:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:30.350 --> 01:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
it so we want to know how big the
 
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
12416 say it does say audit audits of
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
federal grants fund set aside and it's
 
01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
just a a requirement under this
 
01:39:59.950 --> 01:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:04.189 --> 01:40:04.199 align:start position:0%
fund it yeah okay so we that's perfectly
 
01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
normal we
 
01:40:09.189 --> 01:40:09.199 align:start position:0%
um I think looking at this there has to
 
01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
be some provision for a waiver because I
 
01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
mean if the amount set aside is more
 
01:40:16.669 --> 01:40:16.679 align:start position:0%
than you actually need to pay for
 
01:40:19.310 --> 01:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
compliance cost then you don't want that
 
01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
money just sitting in account yeah away
 
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
yeah if this is uh the so when you look
 
01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
at the titles on the section there's
 
01:40:30.189 --> 01:40:30.199 align:start position:0%
audits of federal grants it has 16 17 18
 
01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
19 so if this would just mean that
 
01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:34.639 align:start position:0%
subdivision and not all of 124 that's
 
01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
fine I just trying to make sure I'm
 
01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
parsing the language correctly because
 
01:40:40.669 --> 01:40:40.679 align:start position:0%
whether or not a grant is to do gun
 
01:40:42.669 --> 01:40:42.679 align:start position:0%
confiscation that's against ours or
 
01:40:44.189 --> 01:40:44.199 align:start position:0%
something else that would be a different
 
01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
political issue I would just be
 
01:40:47.790 --> 01:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
concerned if it was a larger part but if
 
01:40:49.589 --> 01:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
this is just about the Audits and that
 
01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
sounds like that might be the correct
 
01:40:53.470 --> 01:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
reading I'm fine with it I just rather
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
raise a flag that may may not mean
 
01:40:58.310 --> 01:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
anything then let something go by yeah
 
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
so you're forgiven yeah they're talking
 
01:41:03.109 --> 01:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
about the Audits and that all funds set
 
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
aside shall be credited to a separate
 
01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
account and used only for the audit and
 
01:41:13.229 --> 01:41:13.239 align:start position:0%
the LBA will do the
 
01:41:13.239 --> 01:41:15.149 align:start position:0%
the LBA will do the
audit

01:41:15.149 --> 01:41:15.159 align:start position:0%
audit
 
01:41:19.149 --> 01:41:19.159 align:start position:0%
uhuh all right so yeah I think
 
01:41:21.750 --> 01:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
the if they're talking about the waiver
 
01:41:25.070 --> 01:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
they may say we don't need to AIT it is
 
01:41:26.669 --> 01:41:26.679 align:start position:0%
I can't believe that they say they don't
 
01:41:30.270 --> 01:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
need to audit it so I'm I'm not sure
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
what what the point of that section is
 
01:41:35.030 --> 01:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
there's a just to be
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
consistent uh before we were
 
01:41:40.510 --> 01:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
capitalizing Bridge's house and in the
 
01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
paragraph below we're capitalizing
 
01:41:45.870 --> 01:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
administrative services but then we get
 
01:41:48.390 --> 01:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
lower down in the paragraph after that
 
01:41:50.990 --> 01:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
it's not capitalized as commissioner of
 
01:41:53.490 --> 01:41:53.500 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:59.870 align:start position:0%
administrative services
[Music]

01:41:59.870 --> 01:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:02.910 --> 01:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
H well I think we can let administrative
 
01:42:06.270 --> 01:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
Services capitalize or not but the
 
01:42:08.470 --> 01:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
bridges house we specifically want to
 
01:42:11.070 --> 01:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
capitalize it so it's not confused with
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
things that go over rivers could we add
 
01:42:15.990 --> 01:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
the word the in front of Bridge's house
 
01:42:18.109 --> 01:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
it is called the brid's well in here it
 
01:42:21.229 --> 01:42:21.239 align:start position:0%
just says Bridges house but if if it was
 
01:42:24.750 --> 01:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
just the bridges house it in the text I
 
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
think that would be a good
 
01:42:29.589 --> 01:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
change I I see is hereby established in
 
01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
the State treas Treasury the bridges
 
01:42:34.109 --> 01:42:34.119 align:start position:0%
House special account fund both in the
 
01:42:36.510 --> 01:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
title and in the first line of that text
 
01:42:38.229 --> 01:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
oh just at the very beginning it just
 
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
says Bridges House special account I
 
01:42:42.510 --> 01:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
didn't I wasn't really reading Beyond
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
okay but yeah that just from a I mean I
 
01:42:48.510 --> 01:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
in Inc I just put it in quotes on my
 
01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
paper just so I knew it wasn't didn't
 
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with Bridges
 
01:42:56.510 --> 01:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
all right we'll we'll point that out
 
01:42:58.350 --> 01:42:58.360 align:start position:0%
it's easy if you remember that that's
 
01:42:59.910 --> 01:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
what we have that passes for a
 
01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:01.750 align:start position:0%
what we have that passes for a
Governor's

01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
Governor's
 
01:43:04.709 --> 01:43:04.719 align:start position:0%
Mansion yes as a matter of fact I've
 
01:43:07.550 --> 01:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
been to events there that's uh that's
 
01:43:12.189 --> 01:43:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
there you couldn't call it a
 
01:43:17.790 --> 01:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
mansion if you've ever been there it's a
 
01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:19.830 align:start position:0%
mansion if you've ever been there it's a
very

01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:21.470 align:start position:0%
very
plain

01:43:21.470 --> 01:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
plain
 
01:43:25.229 --> 01:43:25.239 align:start position:0%
limited but no the governors basically
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
don't use it okay so the capital project
 
01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:37.149 --> 01:43:37.159 align:start position:0%
uh they'll report quarterly and annually
 
01:43:40.510 --> 01:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
okay which is I think that's that not
 
01:43:46.870 --> 01:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.270 --> 01:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
anything um it does have the combined
 
01:43:50.790 --> 01:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
reports go to annually instead of
 
01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
quarterly but that I don't see a
 
01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
particular reason to say that there's a
 
01:43:57.629 --> 01:43:57.639 align:start position:0%
problem with that
 
01:44:01.350 --> 01:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
yeah because they're giving uh
 
01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:54.669 --> 01:44:54.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:58.910 --> 01:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
ah so the on the uh Support
 
01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:00.589 align:start position:0%
ah so the on the uh Support
Services

01:45:00.589 --> 01:45:00.599 align:start position:0%
Services
 
01:45:04.390 --> 01:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
the um the Surplus distribution
 
01:45:07.390 --> 01:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
section should only have a capital
 
01:45:10.149 --> 01:45:10.159 align:start position:0%
reserve of 3 months
 
01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
operation instead of
 
01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:20.830 --> 01:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
that I think combining that with making
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
it continually appropriated in on
 
01:45:25.870 --> 01:45:25.880 align:start position:0%
lapsing um just helps to sort of smooth
 
01:45:29.149 --> 01:45:29.159 align:start position:0%
it over time it seems reasonable to me m
 
01:45:29.159 --> 01:45:30.669 align:start position:0%
it over time it seems reasonable to me m
okay

01:45:30.669 --> 01:45:30.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
yeah well will the I would imagine that
 
01:45:36.709 --> 01:45:36.719 align:start position:0%
the depart that the commissioner will be
 
01:45:39.830 --> 01:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
there to weigh in on this
 
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
right uh yeah because I really think
 
01:45:48.070 --> 01:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
that they would know better than we yeah
 
01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:50.629 align:start position:0%
that they would know better than we yeah
on

01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:55.109 --> 01:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:57.070 --> 01:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
the other thing too is at three months
 
01:46:00.270 --> 01:46:00.280 align:start position:0%
is this you could be in the middle of a
 
01:46:02.830 --> 01:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
project well this is the uh Surplus
 
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
distribution section this I think this
 
01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
is the white
 
01:46:09.310 --> 01:46:09.320 align:start position:0%
Farm yeah white we on Clinton Street
 
01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:10.510 align:start position:0%
Farm yeah white we on Clinton Street
yeah

01:46:10.510 --> 01:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:46:13.589 --> 01:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
um yeah Whit's Farm is
 
01:46:16.589 --> 01:46:16.599 align:start position:0%
um I've been there many
 
01:46:16.599 --> 01:46:20.270 align:start position:0%
um I've been there many
times

01:46:20.270 --> 01:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:21.910 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:46:25.629 --> 01:46:25.639 align:start position:0%
that tool of money that they generate
 
01:46:29.550 --> 01:46:29.560 align:start position:0%
right from the auctions and whatnot um
 
01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
go depending on what their auctioning
 
01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
some of that is
 
01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
local um municipalities use whites farm
 
01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
right for Surplus equipment as well so
 
01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:43.679 align:start position:0%
um this is just to cause them to dump
 
01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
that fund into the general
 
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
fund more four times a year instead of
 
01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
two I mean that's well no it's um
 
01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
the the the
 
01:46:59.830 --> 01:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
fund is continually appropriating and
 
01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
non-lps um so I think it it would have a
 
01:47:07.229 --> 01:47:07.239 align:start position:0%
uh you know every time it goes above a
 
01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars or $5 millionar or
 
01:47:11.629 --> 01:47:11.639 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that's when it gets
 
01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
sucked to the general fund okay so this
 
01:47:16.390 --> 01:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
is but at current
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
time it says allow the accumulation of a
 
01:47:20.430 --> 01:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
working capital reserve equal to the
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
cost of six months
 
01:47:24.430 --> 01:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
operation of the distribution Surplus
 
01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:29.350 align:start position:0%
operation of the distribution Surplus
distribution

01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:32.229 --> 01:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
section I would imagine that that
 
01:47:34.589 --> 01:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
operation's fairly consistent I would
 
01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
think over there they're
 
01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
not you know adjusting employees and
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
things of that nature in a short amount
 
01:47:43.950 --> 01:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
of time
 
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's so and Whit's Farm is a it's just
 
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:48.950 align:start position:0%
it's so and Whit's Farm is a it's just
an

01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
old just an old building is all it
 
01:47:56.990 --> 01:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
I yeah I mean their expenses are pretty
 
01:48:02.910 --> 01:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
consistent you know yeah think so they
 
01:48:05.310 --> 01:48:05.320 align:start position:0%
won't don't need to have a whole lot of
 
01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:07.589 align:start position:0%
won't don't need to have a whole lot of
uh

01:48:07.589 --> 01:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
um but I have a question on this if if
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
well their expenses may be predictable
 
01:48:24.109 --> 01:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
but what about the source of their
 
01:48:27.149 --> 01:48:27.159 align:start position:0%
income is that predictable as well no
 
01:48:29.589 --> 01:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
not at all so that's probably why having
 
01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
a a 3mon window may be
 
01:48:37.149 --> 01:48:37.159 align:start position:0%
risky well no it's the way I I think
 
01:48:39.149 --> 01:48:39.159 align:start position:0%
this is is the what they figure out
 
01:48:42.830 --> 01:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
three months operating income yeah and
 
01:48:45.189 --> 01:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
when their bank account goes over over
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
that they suck it into the general fund
 
01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%
okay and that's just to make sure they
 
01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
don't don't go too low so when you
 
01:48:56.669 --> 01:48:56.679 align:start position:0%
attach the the term
 
01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
date it's it means that at the end of
 
01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
the budget cycle they don't empty it out
 
01:49:12.910 --> 01:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
they leave it at the um the working
 
01:49:14.310 --> 01:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
capital of
 
01:49:18.149 --> 01:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
it so but but they don't because every
 
01:49:19.950 --> 01:49:19.960 align:start position:0%
three months they're going
 
01:49:22.950 --> 01:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
to right I mean that's no I think
 
01:49:25.390 --> 01:49:25.400 align:start position:0%
they're going to keep if they go for a
 
01:49:28.030 --> 01:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars a month to run the place
 
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
M they'll keep their Bank their account
 
01:49:32.990 --> 01:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
at $3
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
million and whenever it goes up because
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
they they just sold an excavator to your
 
01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
town or whatever that's when it gets
 
01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:41.149 align:start position:0%
town or whatever that's when it gets
sucked

01:49:41.149 --> 01:49:41.159 align:start position:0%
sucked
 
01:49:44.310 --> 01:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
in it's not I don't think it's on a no
 
01:49:47.149 --> 01:49:47.159 align:start position:0%
and and I think the word is continually
 
01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
so it's continually appropriated non
 
01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
lapsing it's continuously non-lps that's
 
01:49:56.350 --> 01:49:56.360 align:start position:0%
how I read that so it's it's always got
 
01:49:59.149 --> 01:49:59.159 align:start position:0%
the three months Reserve so they'll so
 
01:50:01.229 --> 01:50:01.239 align:start position:0%
in essence they'll establish a value to
 
01:50:03.270 --> 01:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
that and then when they hit the ceiling
 
01:50:05.470 --> 01:50:05.480 align:start position:0%
it just then it just starts coming over
 
01:50:09.589 --> 01:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
I think so yeah okay I think that's all
 
01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
righty and there's a new paragraph which
 
01:50:17.149 --> 01:50:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
ominous they can use any money they have
 
01:50:22.109 --> 01:50:22.119 align:start position:0%
to pay penalties fines interests or
 
01:50:23.669 --> 01:50:23.679 align:start position:0%
other costs
 
01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
imposed on the state by the retirement
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:32.189 align:start position:0%
 
IRS

01:50:32.189 --> 01:50:32.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:34.750 --> 01:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
which well that LE that lends itself to
 
01:50:37.750 --> 01:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions it does it sounds
 
01:50:40.149 --> 01:50:40.159 align:start position:0%
like they're expecting some
 
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
yeah I would love a historical
 
01:50:45.790 --> 01:50:45.800 align:start position:0%
perspective on what IRS and retirement
 
01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
system finds they have paid well
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
especially the next sentence when you
 
01:50:53.669 --> 01:50:53.679 align:start position:0%
include that right the department will
 
01:50:55.589 --> 01:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
seek concurrence with the Department of
 
01:50:58.270 --> 01:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
Justice I don't really
 
01:51:01.390 --> 01:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
understand I mean that's so the the only
 
01:51:03.149 --> 01:51:03.159 align:start position:0%
findes under the retirement system that
 
01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
that an agency would do is if they
 
01:51:09.390 --> 01:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
violate like the 150% rule as an example
 
01:51:14.589 --> 01:51:14.599 align:start position:0%
right they would pay but there's there's
 
01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
really there's other than that they have
 
01:51:20.910 --> 01:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
a duty to report within a within a 180
 
01:51:22.589 --> 01:51:22.599 align:start position:0%
days of retirement that sort of thing
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
but it's not as far as fines by the
 
01:51:28.709 --> 01:51:28.719 align:start position:0%
retirement system it's there's virtually
 
01:51:32.069 --> 01:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
same with the IRS I mean the uh payroll
 
01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
processing ought to take care of uh that
 
01:51:36.069 --> 01:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:51:38.790 --> 01:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
thing so unless unless the governor is
 
01:51:41.189 --> 01:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
expecting to be audited yeah represent
 
01:51:45.709 --> 01:51:45.719 align:start position:0%
Howard yeah um I'm just wondering uh if
 
01:51:47.589 --> 01:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
there have been any situations where
 
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
people have uh fully exhausted all of
 
01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:00.270 --> 01:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
uh for what for I just in terms of uh
 
01:52:02.310 --> 01:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
this this new section just because it is
 
01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
a new section I'm just wondering if
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
anybody has gone through uh the current
 
01:52:12.109 --> 01:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
appeal process and exhausted all of
 
01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
their um
 
01:52:17.589 --> 01:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
I I've never heard of it yeah and I I
 
01:52:20.510 --> 01:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
can't imagine that the the state
 
01:52:24.189 --> 01:52:24.199 align:start position:0%
government is normally uh
 
01:52:27.229 --> 01:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
um you know failing to
 
01:52:31.629 --> 01:52:31.639 align:start position:0%
withhold retirement funds or federal
 
01:52:33.510 --> 01:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
taxes or
 
01:52:35.870 --> 01:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
whatever okay all right thank you or
 
01:52:38.350 --> 01:52:38.360 align:start position:0%
even you know late
 
01:52:42.069 --> 01:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:45.510 --> 01:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
reporting I mean it's not well the very
 
01:52:47.950 --> 01:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
fact that it's a brand new paragraph
 
01:52:50.229 --> 01:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
yeah suggests to me that it's there for
 
01:52:53.189 --> 01:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
a specific reason and that we should
 
01:52:55.270 --> 01:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
find out what that reason is because it
 
01:52:58.709 --> 01:52:58.719 align:start position:0%
does say you know uh any any relevant
 
01:53:01.950 --> 01:53:01.960 align:start position:0%
appeal process and then down at the
 
01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
bottom Das will see concurrence prior to
 
01:53:09.709 --> 01:53:09.719 align:start position:0%
processing any such payment so they're
 
01:53:12.030 --> 01:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
they they don't have a free hand you
 
01:53:15.310 --> 01:53:15.320 align:start position:0%
have something represent yeah so 10816
 
01:53:17.069 --> 01:53:17.079 align:start position:0%
is the section that involves fines
 
01:53:19.830 --> 01:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
within the retirement system um there is
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
a $25 a day for non-comp with the data
 
01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:24.310 align:start position:0%
a $25 a day for non-comp with the data
reporting

01:53:24.310 --> 01:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
01:53:26.790 --> 01:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
paragraphs that are in
 
01:53:29.149 --> 01:53:29.159 align:start position:0%
a16 um including data that was not
 
01:53:30.790 --> 01:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
timely remitted or data that cannot be
 
01:53:33.069 --> 01:53:33.079 align:start position:0%
processed at the time designated by the
 
01:53:35.550 --> 01:53:35.560 align:start position:0%
board that was
 
01:53:37.990 --> 01:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
done I was in the house when that was
 
01:53:40.669 --> 01:53:40.679 align:start position:0%
added so that was I think mostly for
 
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
small towns that came in late right so I
 
01:53:45.069 --> 01:53:45.079 align:start position:0%
don't think the state's going to be
 
01:53:48.109 --> 01:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
likely to be in on yeah I mean that
 
01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
again that that of course a16 covers all
 
01:53:52.149 --> 01:53:52.159 align:start position:0%
the political subdivisions as well as
 
01:53:56.550 --> 01:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:00.030 --> 01:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
um that's like really the only other the
 
01:54:02.189 --> 01:54:02.199 align:start position:0%
only other one is is uh any employer who
 
01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
fails to provide within 30 days a
 
01:54:05.910 --> 01:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
written request of information required
 
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
for the proper Administration that that
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
finds a little bigger that's that's
 
01:54:11.430 --> 01:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
basically you saying I'm we're not going
 
01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
to play nice with you but that's $200 a
 
01:54:18.390 --> 01:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
day but again that's like it so I I with
 
01:54:21.109 --> 01:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
modern computer payroll systems and all
 
01:54:24.910 --> 01:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
that why would especially giant red
 
01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
flags to me like what is the state not
 
01:54:29.629 --> 01:54:29.639 align:start position:0%
doing that it's supposed to be doing to
 
01:54:36.189 --> 01:54:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:38.830 --> 01:54:38.840 align:start position:0%
Bailey this is no this is about state
 
01:54:40.830 --> 01:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
agencies and then realize they've done
 
01:54:43.790 --> 01:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
that in error and want to pay the town
 
01:54:45.790 --> 01:54:45.800 align:start position:0%
back the state wouldn't do that though
 
01:54:46.870 --> 01:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
that would be handled that it's a
 
01:54:48.550 --> 01:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
retirement system is a retirement this
 
01:54:51.870 --> 01:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
isn't the retirement system yeah this is
 
01:54:55.870 --> 01:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
fine from the retirement system right if
 
01:54:58.750 --> 01:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
they find someone in but that would be
 
01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:00.719 align:start position:0%
the retirement system doing the finding
 
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
not the state yeah the state wouldn't
 
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
get involved in any right suits between
 
01:55:07.589 --> 01:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
the retirement system and the town
 
01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
because it says imposed on the state of
 
01:55:11.589 --> 01:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so this is has nothing to
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
do with local subdivisions at all I have
 
01:55:14.750 --> 01:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
no knowledge I was just trying to
 
01:55:17.390 --> 01:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
speculate how they could be
 
01:55:20.790 --> 01:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
losing say what the hell is this for and
 
01:55:23.109 --> 01:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
what kind of a uh
 
01:55:27.550 --> 01:55:27.560 align:start position:0%
audit or um what kind of penalties fines
 
01:55:29.470 --> 01:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
are you expecting to have to pay because
 
01:55:33.270 --> 01:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:36.510 --> 01:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
like yeah and what I mean we get the I I
 
01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
mean I can thumb through the annual
 
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
report at some point soon to see if
 
01:55:42.790 --> 01:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
there's a listing of of revenue from the
 
01:55:45.990 --> 01:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
retirement system from fines but I can't
 
01:55:48.750 --> 01:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
imagine it's it's not very big it can't
 
01:55:50.910 --> 01:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
be big at
 
01:55:53.390 --> 01:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
Allon um I I just wanted to make sure
 
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
nobody here has any idea what it would
 
01:55:58.350 --> 01:55:58.360 align:start position:0%
be it doesn't seem like we would it it
 
01:56:00.589 --> 01:56:00.599 align:start position:0%
looks to me as though somebody is
 
01:56:04.669 --> 01:56:04.679 align:start position:0%
expecting to pay massive fines or
 
01:56:07.310 --> 01:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
interest to either the retirement system
 
01:56:08.350 --> 01:56:08.360 align:start position:0%
or the
 
01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:10.189 align:start position:0%
or the
IRS

01:56:10.189 --> 01:56:10.199 align:start position:0%
IRS
 
01:56:14.229 --> 01:56:14.239 align:start position:0%
and I find it difficult to
 
01:56:16.470 --> 01:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
believe that what that that the state
 
01:56:19.149 --> 01:56:19.159 align:start position:0%
would be screwed up on that right it's
 
01:56:22.270 --> 01:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
not like this there's new special requ
 
01:56:25.310 --> 01:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
requirements this year the guilty flee
 
01:56:29.709 --> 01:56:29.719 align:start position:0%
where none pursueth very likely yeah I
 
01:56:32.229 --> 01:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
mean the IRS will come come after you if
 
01:56:34.350 --> 01:56:34.360 align:start position:0%
you file late but
 
01:56:36.870 --> 01:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh I can't believe the state doesn't
 
01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
know know when to uh when to
 
01:56:43.669 --> 01:56:43.679 align:start position:0%
file they haven't changed the dates in
 
01:56:46.950 --> 01:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
years this this section I was included
 
01:56:49.790 --> 01:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
by the governor's
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
office what does she know that we don't
 
01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
is the question that I've got on that
 
01:56:57.189 --> 01:56:57.199 align:start position:0%
one B me there's lots of things she
 
01:56:59.950 --> 01:56:59.960 align:start position:0%
knows what does she know about fines to
 
01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:00.150 align:start position:0%
knows what does she know about fines to
the

01:57:00.150 --> 01:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:01.470 align:start position:0%
the
[Music]

01:57:01.470 --> 01:57:01.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:57:04.229 --> 01:57:04.239 align:start position:0%
IRS yeah that's
 
01:57:07.390 --> 01:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
a either that or somebody got audited
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:14.990 --> 01:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
that's I find that hard to believe
 
01:57:16.510 --> 01:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
because we would I would have imagine we
 
01:57:17.669 --> 01:57:17.679 align:start position:0%
would have heard this would have been
 
01:57:18.629 --> 01:57:18.639 align:start position:0%
something that would have been
 
01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
publicized right hell so the fact that
 
01:57:23.950 --> 01:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
it's so
 
01:57:27.149 --> 01:57:27.159 align:start position:0%
and the words are are carefully chosen
 
01:57:29.629 --> 01:57:29.639 align:start position:0%
as well does it mean failure to report
 
01:57:31.109 --> 01:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
by the retirement system is them going
 
01:57:34.229 --> 01:57:34.239 align:start position:0%
hey we didn't get your numbers what's up
 
01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
but IRS is a whole another animal here
 
01:57:40.470 --> 01:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:44.189 --> 01:57:44.199 align:start position:0%
letter I wonder if they're anticipating
 
01:57:47.109 --> 01:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
something changing because of
 
01:57:50.870 --> 01:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
Doge auditing new things the only so I
 
01:57:53.350 --> 01:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
looked this up as we've been
 
01:57:56.470 --> 01:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
talking um apparently so a school
 
01:57:58.390 --> 01:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
district in New Hampshire did get fined
 
01:58:02.950 --> 01:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
by the IRS for uh not providing health
 
01:58:05.790 --> 01:58:05.800 align:start position:0%
insurance in compliance with the
 
01:58:09.069 --> 01:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
ACA um that wasn't the state but I don't
 
01:58:11.109 --> 01:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
know if they're anticipating something
 
01:58:14.470 --> 01:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
like that but yeah I the state does
 
01:58:16.390 --> 01:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
provide health insurance and I know I've
 
01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:17.189 align:start position:0%
provide health insurance and I know I've
been

01:58:17.189 --> 01:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:58:21.629 --> 01:58:21.639 align:start position:0%
getting um I had the employee insurance
 
01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
and they send me a note every year that
 
01:58:25.669 --> 01:58:25.679 align:start position:0%
I comply with the ACA because I'm
 
01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
covered with the with health insurance
 
01:58:31.310 --> 01:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
so unless there's something funny like
 
01:58:33.510 --> 01:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
you say that's
 
01:58:35.709 --> 01:58:35.719 align:start position:0%
unanticipated they're expecting a change
 
01:58:38.830 --> 01:58:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:46.750 --> 01:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:49.189 --> 01:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
right okay so I'll
 
01:58:52.189 --> 01:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
go I'll go go talk with the chair
 
01:58:55.950 --> 01:58:55.960 align:start position:0%
division one over over dinner or
 
01:58:59.149 --> 01:58:59.159 align:start position:0%
something and and get this get these
 
01:59:01.310 --> 01:59:01.320 align:start position:0%

uh

01:59:28.350 --> 01:59:28.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
um the commission on the state flag
 
01:59:38.310 --> 01:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
that's 211 I think uh 525 which is the
 
01:59:40.830 --> 01:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
uh DEA and heart of hearing which we
 
01:59:44.030 --> 01:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
forgot to retain last last week and any
 
01:59:46.950 --> 01:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
other bills that are ready
 
01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
so we're actually in extremely good good
 
01:59:52.990 --> 01:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
shape because after next
 
01:59:54.990 --> 01:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
week we will
 
01:59:58.830 --> 01:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
meet once I think to exec any bills that
 
02:00:02.629 --> 02:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
we don't exec this next week so nothing
 
02:00:05.709 --> 02:00:05.719 align:start position:0%
tomorrow tomorrow's Tuesday we don't do
 
02:00:07.390 --> 02:00:07.400 align:start position:0%
we don't work on
 
02:00:10.870 --> 02:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays for those that are new to Edna
 
02:00:13.310 --> 02:00:13.320 align:start position:0%
this is not the normal work of this I'm
 
02:00:16.669 --> 02:00:16.679 align:start position:0%
in the legislature I always do Bel
 
02:00:18.910 --> 02:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
suspenders yes thank you representative
 
02:00:23.430 --> 02:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
Schmid but actually after uh
 
02:00:26.069 --> 02:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
uh representative Barry threatened to
 
02:00:27.870 --> 02:00:27.880 align:start position:0%
fight me over whether we could meet on
 
02:00:29.109 --> 02:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays or
 
02:00:31.350 --> 02:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
Wednesdays we don't do anything on
 
02:00:34.390 --> 02:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays my money was on
 
02:00:38.149 --> 02:00:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:40.750 --> 02:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
behind I have to say the setup is nice
 
02:00:42.310 --> 02:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
we can actually see each other better
 
02:00:43.790 --> 02:00:43.800 align:start position:0%
maybe we can go to the single rooms
 
02:00:45.750 --> 02:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
although then we're going offsite next
 
02:00:49.390 --> 02:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
year so yeah yes the double the double
 
02:00:52.709 --> 02:00:52.719 align:start position:0%
room is not nearly as conducive to
 
02:00:55.310 --> 02:00:55.320 align:start position:0%

02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:56.149 align:start position:0%
