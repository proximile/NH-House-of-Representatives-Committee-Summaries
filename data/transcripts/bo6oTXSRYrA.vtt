00:24:59.590 --> 00:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
if I had a clerk I would ask the clerk
 
00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:07.340 align:start position:0%
to call the roll
 
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:11.159 align:start position:0%

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
but uh I think we have enough to at
 
00:25:42.289 --> 00:25:42.299 align:start position:0%
least begin our discussion
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
um representative yes if I may I did see
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
that counselor John Williams ex officio
 
00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
has been on the subcommittee as well is
 
00:25:51.169 --> 00:25:51.179 align:start position:0%
that true
 
00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
at least it's on the list here
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%

please join us at the table we don't
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:09.529 --> 00:26:09.539 align:start position:0%
you can sit up here with the big boys
 
00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
well thank you thank you very much but
 
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:13.740 align:start position:0%
for uh total transparency and
 
00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:16.919 align:start position:0%
clarification uh originally I had work
 
00:26:21.409 --> 00:26:21.419 align:start position:0%
in um uh with the uh formation group on
 
00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
um uh subcommittee for the HHS oversight
 
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
committee so originally I was tagged
 
00:26:30.409 --> 00:26:30.419 align:start position:0%
with ex-officio working with this group
 
00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:33.059 align:start position:0%
however my recollection and I just can't
 
00:26:36.049 --> 00:26:36.059 align:start position:0%
bring up my uh internet computer right
 
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799 align:start position:0%
now but I believe that represent Pearson
 
00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:40.940 align:start position:0%
did make a final selection of course um
 
00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
approving the appointment of
 
00:26:45.649 --> 00:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
Representative Jeffrey soloway as the
 
00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
chair of the committee I don't believe I
 
00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
made the final cut for this group
 
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:51.720 align:start position:0%

careful review by the members of that
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
for self-solved but for whatever reason
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been resolved I was on
 
00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:37.930 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been resolved I was on
vacation

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:37.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
with all due respect I think what I'd
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
like to do is to let this meeting go on
 
00:32:48.049 --> 00:32:48.059 align:start position:0%
for another 25 minutes 11 o'clock where
 
00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:50.460 align:start position:0%
we are rather than moving and taking the
 
00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
time to do that and we will then
 
00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:54.490 align:start position:0%
time to do that and we will then
um

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:54.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
reschedule our meetings for something
 
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
all cooler times mode
 
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
folks who control those systems haven't
 
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
fully done that yet okay with my partial
 
00:33:18.889 --> 00:33:18.899 align:start position:0%
understanding okay well thank you for
 
00:33:21.889 --> 00:33:21.899 align:start position:0%
the help in better shape
 
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
okay I will ask the representatives in
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
attendance to stop breaking up the
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
furniture and dropping matches on the
 
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.909 align:start position:0%
furniture and dropping matches on the
wood

00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
wood
 
00:33:31.919 --> 00:33:37.850 align:start position:0%
wood
okay

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
uh with your kind permission I would
 
00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
suggest that uh we meet for another 25
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
minutes and call it a day
 
00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:56.220 align:start position:0%
um and I'm hoping that by this afternoon
 
00:33:59.630 --> 00:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
things will have warmed up so
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
um you have on page two of this document
 
00:34:05.389 --> 00:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
a number of
 
00:34:05.399 --> 00:34:07.329 align:start position:0%
a number of
tasks

00:34:07.329 --> 00:34:07.339 align:start position:0%
tasks
 
00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:10.919 align:start position:0%
for the subcommittee
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
taking a look at definitions of
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
biomarker testing review of studies on
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
the current status and I've had
 
00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
conversations with representative Woods
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
in this regard and I'm hoping that he
 
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
will share his wisdom with us and you
 
00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:33.020 align:start position:0%
have the rest of the uh
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
uh directives to the task force in I
 
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
think in front of you
 
00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:42.530 align:start position:0%
think in front of you
so

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
um I I wonder if
 
00:34:50.169 --> 00:34:50.179 align:start position:0%
perhaps representative woods and
 
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
representatives Merchant
 
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
could give us
 
00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
just a brief few words on their own
 
00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:00.300 align:start position:0%
areas of expertise and their own point
 
00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:02.540 align:start position:0%
of view
 
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
just for a matter of a few minutes
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:20.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
I had intended
 
00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
obviously you you know representative
 
00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
gay that our first obligation is to
 
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
listen to testimony from the public
 
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
that we that they are our constituents
 
00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
however the public has not shown up
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
um therefore we can go forward with our
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
deliberations but as a general operating
 
00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.329 align:start position:0%
deliberations but as a general operating
principle

00:35:47.329 --> 00:35:47.339 align:start position:0%
principle
 
00:35:50.089 --> 00:35:50.099 align:start position:0%
um I give preference to the public
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
so given that we are here
 
00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:56.220 align:start position:0%
and I have not by the way appointed a
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
clerk at this point and I think I'm
 
00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
going to serve as my own clerk for the
 
00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.589 align:start position:0%
going to serve as my own clerk for the
moment

00:36:00.589 --> 00:36:00.599 align:start position:0%
moment
 
00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:04.740 align:start position:0%
um and given the problem of temperature
 
00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
I would say let's begin our
 
00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.510 align:start position:0%
I would say let's begin our
deliberations

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
deliberations
 
00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:10.940 align:start position:0%
take What notes we can
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:23.589 align:start position:0%
 
alone

00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
our disability hope for an hour and a
 
00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:31.430 align:start position:0%
our disability hope for an hour and a
chance

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
My Hope was to go to noon
 
00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.770 align:start position:0%
My Hope was to go to noon
um

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
but if we take the time to move over
 
00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:48.119 --> 00:36:51.470 align:start position:0%
 
if

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
best determined by me and the goal of
 
00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:57.180 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee is to look at
 
00:36:58.849 --> 00:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
introducing legislation for next year
 
00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
correct yes sir
 
00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:01.970 align:start position:0%
correct yes sir
so

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
in reviewing the goals that were
 
00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:08.220 align:start position:0%
outlined on page two is it really
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
fundamentally for this committee not
 
00:37:13.609 --> 00:37:13.619 align:start position:0%
to do the work of the task force but to
 
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
ensure we have the framework for
 
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
legislation to create the task work to
 
00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:19.079 align:start position:0%
get the work done
 
00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
we're it but so if we're doing the work
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
of the task force then why do we need
 
00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
legislation are we trying I'm trying to
 
00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
get to is well we we are sequentially
 
00:37:37.849 --> 00:37:37.859 align:start position:0%
supposed to investigate to determine
 
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
if legislation is needed okay
 
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
and our recommendation will be to the
 
00:37:47.569 --> 00:37:47.579 align:start position:0%
oversight committee suggesting yes we
 
00:37:49.849 --> 00:37:49.859 align:start position:0%
need legislation in these areas I
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
did you want to speak okay yeah I I
 
00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.870 align:start position:0%
did you want to speak okay yeah I I
think

00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:02.220 align:start position:0%
following up on reps of gay
 
00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
it would be critical for us at least for
 
00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:07.740 align:start position:0%
myself to hear from the experts out in
 
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
the field I mean I have my own knowledge
 
00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
base along with many of us here
 
00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
but it's going to be a snapshot or a
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
small part of a very long continuum so I
 
00:38:19.609 --> 00:38:19.619 align:start position:0%
think trying to round out future
 
00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:22.140 align:start position:0%
meetings if we can is to as much as
 
00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:23.270 align:start position:0%
meetings if we can is to as much as
possible

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
ask those out in the audience to come
 
00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
prepare to provide us with testimony
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
about why we need to have the
 
00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
um we have president with us
 
00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:36.950 align:start position:0%
um we have president with us
um

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh Peg Clifford from Medicaid
 
00:38:42.589 --> 00:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
what I think has a great deal to offer
 
00:38:45.069 --> 00:38:45.079 align:start position:0%
would you want to hear from her first
 
00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
I think she has a lot to offer I don't
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
take for a long time she's very much
 
00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable in this area because of
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and things she does but I also
 
00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:56.220 align:start position:0%
think we need to hear from the
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
providers themselves as well as the
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
pharmacy community and also I think we
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
can reach out to miss menahan to the
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
hospital community and find out what's
 
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
available within that around many of
 
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
these are going to be providers I think
 
00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
one of the constraints with providers is
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
of course patient care they're they're
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
busy like all of us and it's trying to
 
00:39:16.849 --> 00:39:16.859 align:start position:0%
find a doc at a time so we can publish
 
00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839 align:start position:0%
the times going forth that people can
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
try to free up the time to be your from
 
00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.010 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
Ms Clifford Miss minahan
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
would you wish to present testimony at
 
00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.790 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:39:41.089 --> 00:39:41.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:41.099 --> 00:39:52.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:54.660 align:start position:0%
so I was not planning on testifying
 
00:39:56.569 --> 00:39:56.579 align:start position:0%
today but I'd be happy to do so at a
 
00:39:59.390 --> 00:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
future meeting excellent thank you let
 
00:40:01.609 --> 00:40:01.619 align:start position:0%
me ask the same question of Ms minnehan
 
00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
representing the hospital Association
 
00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone Paula Monahan

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
um actually reached out to a cancer
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
specialist at Wentworth Douglas who Dr
 
00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:19.140 align:start position:0%
soloway excuse me representative soloway
 
00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:23.180 align:start position:0%
is aware and I believe doc Dr
 
00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:25.089 align:start position:0%
is aware and I believe doc Dr
arula

00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:25.099 align:start position:0%
arula
 
00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
mahadivan will is willing and able to
 
00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
participate in the task force I just I
 
00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:32.220 align:start position:0%
don't think he was just able to
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
participate today but he's very
 
00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:36.180 align:start position:0%
interested in this so I think you're
 
00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:38.579 align:start position:0%
right representative Merchant we do need
 
00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
specialists in this area because this is
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
a very specialized area and I would
 
00:40:46.849 --> 00:40:46.859 align:start position:0%
defer to um to
 
00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
um Dr mahadivan from the cancer center
 
00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:52.740 align:start position:0%
at the Seacoast Cancer Center at
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
Wentworth Douglas but I hope hopefully
 
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
he can come at a future meeting I also
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
know the medical society had a couple
 
00:41:02.089 --> 00:41:02.099 align:start position:0%
individuals that were also interested in
 
00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
in testifying so I think and I believe
 
00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
believe you have two more meetings
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
scheduled so normally yes I believe so
 
00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
hopefully one of those meetings we could
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
have someone from the medical society
 
00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
have their representative as well but I
 
00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
agree that it would be really helpful to
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
also have like you said the pharmacists
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
um speak as well to this because it's
 
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
just so it's just such an important and
 
00:41:28.849 --> 00:41:28.859 align:start position:0%
specialized area that they would I mean
 
00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:31.140 align:start position:0%
I know have interest as well thank you
 
00:41:35.089 --> 00:41:35.099 align:start position:0%
you're welcome Mr chair are we bound
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
by certain rules in other words can we
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
as a subcommittee have testimony done
 
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
remotely I'm just thinking about the
 
00:41:47.089 --> 00:41:47.099 align:start position:0%
provider's time so they can talk to us
 
00:41:49.849 --> 00:41:49.859 align:start position:0%
remotely versus being here in person
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
I thank you for the question I had
 
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
assumed that we would be on Zoom it
 
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
turns out that we do not use zoom we use
 
00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:04.460 align:start position:0%
another uh product
 
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
that uh broadcast out but I don't
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
believe broadcast back in so we will
 
00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
have to find out how to do that I've
 
00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
been in contact with Christina Dyer who
 
00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:19.079 align:start position:0%
is normally our staff person however she
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
is out with covet it was that kind of
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
week last week
 
00:42:28.609 --> 00:42:28.619 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for your patience so
 
00:42:28.619 --> 00:42:29.510 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for your patience so
um

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
what we can't do is record votes coming
 
00:42:37.849 --> 00:42:37.859 align:start position:0%
in over media the voting has to be here
 
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
but I believe that we can receive
 
00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
testimony and I would certainly want to
 
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
do that if I can add parenthetically I
 
00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
have lined up
 
00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
three other people to testify I'll go
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
over that just briefly one of them is uh
 
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
Dr Joseph drabic he is just recently
 
00:43:05.809 --> 00:43:05.819 align:start position:0%
chief of Hematology Oncology at Penn
 
00:43:08.809 --> 00:43:08.819 align:start position:0%
State Medical Center in Hershey and he
 
00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:11.540 align:start position:0%
comes from a research perspective
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
he's very very well published researcher
 
00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
the other person is also from
 
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania Dr Leah cream
 
00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:23.900 align:start position:0%
she is an oncologist
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
and has won a clinical oncologist of the
 
00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:30.980 align:start position:0%
Year award Awards in Pennsylvania
 
00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
trained at Dartmouth Hitchcock and she
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
represents a patient point of view she
 
00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
is very much a clinician the third
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
person that I have lined up is a former
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
CFO of an organization a private
 
00:43:48.599 --> 00:43:49.930 align:start position:0%
CFO of an organization a private
organization

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:49.940 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial organization which
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
markets individual testing genetic
 
00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:57.609 align:start position:0%
markets individual testing genetic
testing

00:43:57.609 --> 00:43:57.619 align:start position:0%
testing
 
00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
and that person
 
00:44:00.119 --> 00:44:01.809 align:start position:0%
and that person
um

00:44:01.809 --> 00:44:01.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
has some insights into the nature of
 
00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:09.060 align:start position:0%
organizations that do this kind of uh
 
00:44:11.809 --> 00:44:11.819 align:start position:0%
testing uh who they charge how they get
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
reimbursed and what happens to the money
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
so I have those three lined up and we'll
 
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
try to get that done over Zoom
 
00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:23.510 align:start position:0%
try to get that done over Zoom
okay

00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
um that said
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
um I believe you have indicated
 
00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant that you would
 
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
prefer a longer period of time to
 
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
testify is that correct rather than
 
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
speaking today
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
um representative Woods
 
00:44:44.329 --> 00:44:44.339 align:start position:0%
um I just was going to make a couple of
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
you asked for a couple of comments I
 
00:44:50.589 --> 00:44:50.599 align:start position:0%
said I would be uh brief and I would be
 
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
he defined act being brief academically
 
00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
meant he could at 45 minutes
 
00:45:02.809 --> 00:45:02.819 align:start position:0%
I said I could be brief very brief and
 
00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:05.220 align:start position:0%
less than 45 minutes I can do that
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
anytime uh Mr chair so uh your your call
 
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh I I must tell you I I believe that uh
 
00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:16.740 align:start position:0%
representative gay and others have uh
 
00:45:18.829 --> 00:45:18.839 align:start position:0%
come here today and I would like to
 
00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
accomplish something and I I must say
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
I'm most anxious to hear your comments
 
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
and I have some questions for you uh
 
00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
after your comments if that's okay
 
00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:42.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
uh I'm noted for uh trying to look at
 
00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
things from the 30 000 foot perspective
 
00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
uh but also uh I'll offer that my
 
00:45:53.329 --> 00:45:53.339 align:start position:0%
perspective is one with my physics
 
00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:55.740 align:start position:0%
background and graduate work in
 
00:45:57.970 --> 00:45:57.980 align:start position:0%
biophysics and molecular dynamics of
 
00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
maintained some interest in some of the
 
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
work that's in the Nano field and and
 
00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
looking at the overall my my perspective
 
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
is that a Precision medicine is just a
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
March in the development of medicine my
 
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
great great grandfather was a
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
self-taught horseback doctor in the
 
00:46:24.370 --> 00:46:24.380 align:start position:0%
plains of Texas
 
00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:26.700 align:start position:0%
no hospitals
 
00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
and then they built these structures
 
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
called hospitals and probably put him
 
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
out of business
 
00:46:34.609 --> 00:46:34.619 align:start position:0%
and we've developed from there from
 
00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
Physicians then we decided that we
 
00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:38.339 align:start position:0%
needed someone to do the specialty
 
00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:41.180 align:start position:0%
cutting so we've got you know
 
00:46:43.849 --> 00:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
Physicians and surgeons and and now we
 
00:46:43.859 --> 00:46:46.210 align:start position:0%
Physicians and surgeons and and now we
have

00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:46.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
4721 I picked a number
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
specialist surgeons uh and each of those
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh like I say I'm a repeating surgeon um
 
00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
but I
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
specialize rather than just surgery
 
00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
Orthopedics but I do upper extremity and
 
00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
more specialized I do hand surgery and
 
00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
jokingly say I only do the left hand
 
00:47:13.309 --> 00:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
um but that so what we're looking at
 
00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
from my perspective is the natural March
 
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
of medicine and what we are as a society
 
00:47:23.809 --> 00:47:23.819 align:start position:0%
the science is really outstripped our
 
00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
ability to appreciate and understand and
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
properly apply the technology and what
 
00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
we're doing here is struggling to try
 
00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:35.940 align:start position:0%
and figure out you know what is the best
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
way to apply it and apply it directly
 
00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
and appropriately
 
00:47:41.569 --> 00:47:41.579 align:start position:0%
and we've seen in the past what we have
 
00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:42.839 align:start position:0%
not done so well
 
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
an example in this legislature
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
was a bone marrow transplants for breast
 
00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:50.030 align:start position:0%
was a bone marrow transplants for breast
cancer

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
there was a huge human cry
 
00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
that this was the thing to do
 
00:47:58.550 --> 00:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
and in fact it won the day and this body
 
00:48:00.829 --> 00:48:00.839 align:start position:0%
passed legislation saying that insurance
 
00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
companies had to pay for it
 
00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
well within six months of Passage it
 
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
found that in fact the people that were
 
00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:10.980 align:start position:0%
naysayers were correct that in fact
 
00:48:12.829 --> 00:48:12.839 align:start position:0%
there was no role for bone marrow
 
00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
before that there is the Leia Trill
 
00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:20.460 align:start position:0%
those of you old enough to remember the
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
leotril Fiasco a cancer treatment and
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
how could you deny these poor kids
 
00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
treatment I can go to Mexico and get it
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
for 10 bucks and we can't get it here
 
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
well then it turns out within another
 
00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
six months found out that wasn't the
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
thing to do either
 
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
so we're struggling and in fact we're
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
not doing so well at times
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
so I view this
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
body this committee as to one of their
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
roles is to look at what we're asking is
 
00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
it appropriate and which ones or
 
00:48:57.650 --> 00:48:57.660 align:start position:0%
individual ones are appropriate or not
 
00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
and then we can ask ourselves uh it's
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
available how can we make it accessible
 
00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
and of course availability does not
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
equal accessible
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
and that's where the pinch is going to
 
00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.790 align:start position:0%
and that's where the pinch is going to
come

00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:09.800 align:start position:0%
come
 
00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
technologically it can be very complex
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
and I give the example of
 
00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:20.300 align:start position:0%
the one that we saw early on
 
00:49:23.809 --> 00:49:23.819 align:start position:0%
probably the earliest of misuse of
 
00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:27.260 align:start position:0%
Technology you may recall
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
when splitting the atom was discovered
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
oh my goodness look at this we can split
 
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
the atom
 
00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
and look at all the energy we can get
 
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
out of that we can we can run all kinds
 
00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:40.140 align:start position:0%
of things with all this energy
 
00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
well some dark person decided you know
 
00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
what I can make a bomb out of this too
 
00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839 align:start position:0%
and we're still struggling with the dark
 
00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:55.740 align:start position:0%
so we as we progress along we want to
 
00:49:58.130 --> 00:49:58.140 align:start position:0%
ask ourselves you know what are the
 
00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
downsides of what we're doing
 
00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
one of the next biggest one in medicine
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
was the genome ah now we can cure
 
00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.690 align:start position:0%
was the genome ah now we can cure
everything

00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:08.700 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
well I guess what maybe we can make uh
 
00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
designer babies too
 
00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
maybe that's not so good so that wasn't
 
00:50:22.329 --> 00:50:22.339 align:start position:0%
we're still dealing with that struggle
 
00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:24.300 align:start position:0%
crispr came along
 
00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:27.660 align:start position:0%
we can modify genetics
 
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
and I I'm I'm telling Berkeley the
 
00:50:36.109 --> 00:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
founder of crispr was from Berkeley and
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's where I did my physics she was
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
not there at the time but uh uh at any
 
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
rate the long and the short of it um
 
00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
we're still struggling with that
 
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
where is it appropriate and not and the
 
00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
technology is is developing so there's a
 
00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
variety of forms of of crispr of the
 
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
getting even further down to the
 
00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:04.220 align:start position:0%
molecular level
 
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
you may or may not be aware that there
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
was a famous problem in biology called
 
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
the protein folding problem
 
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
now proteins are made of amino acids
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
sort of lined up lined up just like in
 
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
our DNA string of molecules proteins are
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
a string of amino acids
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
and they're lined up like beads on a
 
00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:28.250 align:start position:0%
and they're lined up like beads on a
necklace

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
necklace
 
00:51:30.349 --> 00:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
but they they the proteins that don't
 
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
stay like a string they fold into a
 
00:51:34.849 --> 00:51:34.859 align:start position:0%
particular configuration
 
00:51:37.069 --> 00:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
and that's how they do their activity in
 
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
in that configuration
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
and a huge amounts of effort have been
 
00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:47.460 align:start position:0%
exerted to figure out that configuration
 
00:51:50.089 --> 00:51:50.099 align:start position:0%
because now you can make a pharmacist
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
can come along and design a medication
 
00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
to fit that configuration
 
00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
or a vaccine to fit the configuration of
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
a virus
 
00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:04.740 align:start position:0%
so the configuration is really crucial
 
00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:07.140 align:start position:0%
in proteins it was called the protein
 
00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
folding problem
 
00:52:11.569 --> 00:52:11.579 align:start position:0%
and we used X-ray crystallography
 
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
to decide what that configuration looked
 
00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:16.010 align:start position:0%
to decide what that configuration looked
like

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
well that is trust me
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
is extremely difficult
 
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
well just recently within the last year
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
and it was um Google through a program
 
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
called Alpha fold
 
00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:41.390 align:start position:0%
called Alpha fold
two

00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
designed a program
 
00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:44.940 align:start position:0%
and there was a contest an international
 
00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:46.790 align:start position:0%
and there was a contest an international
contest

00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
contest
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
who could take the string of beads of
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
amino acids and predict
 
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
what the protein looks like
 
00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
and they got better and better and and
 
00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
Google with Alpha fold one the first
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
round and the second round
 
00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
and most recently
 
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
they have predicted
 
00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:11.700 align:start position:0%
with 100 basically one hundred percent
 
00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:14.089 align:start position:0%
with 100 basically one hundred percent
accuracy

00:53:14.089 --> 00:53:14.099 align:start position:0%
accuracy
 
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
well now the X-ray crystallographers are
 
00:53:22.849 --> 00:53:22.859 align:start position:0%
out of work
 
00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:24.780 align:start position:0%
so to speak
 
00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
but what does that mean
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
knowing the configuration of proteins
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
because proteins are what make
 
00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:35.460 align:start position:0%
uh the fine-tuning of what makes every
 
00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
they're enzymes and we know Pro enzymes
 
00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
are proteins
 
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
and a lot of our medications very subtly
 
00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
change what an enzyme looks like to make
 
00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
it work or not work
 
00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
if you know the structure of it
 
00:53:58.730 --> 00:53:58.740 align:start position:0%
okay just by plugging it into a computer
 
00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:02.220 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist then say whoa this is a
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
piece of cake man can I do this with
 
00:54:08.089 --> 00:54:08.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:10.609 --> 00:54:10.619 align:start position:0%
where the rubber meets the road is with
 
00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
that kind of potential
 
00:54:16.609 --> 00:54:16.619 align:start position:0%
you can now take blood from anybody you
 
00:54:16.619 --> 00:54:18.349 align:start position:0%
you can now take blood from anybody you
want

00:54:18.349 --> 00:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
look at their proteins
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
and decide what the configuration what
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
what the deficiency is
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
and potentially how to correct it
 
00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
but as you might guess
 
00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
a lot of I'm for those who can't see I'm
 
00:54:38.569 --> 00:54:38.579 align:start position:0%
I guess we don't have video but I'm
 
00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
rubbing my fingers like money you hand
 
00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:42.970 align:start position:0%
rubbing my fingers like money you hand
surgeon

00:54:42.970 --> 00:54:42.980 align:start position:0%
surgeon
 
00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:45.300 align:start position:0%
money money money it takes a lot of
 
00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:47.210 align:start position:0%
money money money it takes a lot of
money

00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:47.220 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
um and that's where we were trying to
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
meet you know our technology is getting
 
00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
tremendously expensive
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
but it's tremendously personalized and
 
00:54:59.150 --> 00:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
for the term used in this committee
 
00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:01.130 align:start position:0%
for the term used in this committee
precise

00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
precise
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
is truly Precision medicine because it
 
00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:06.660 align:start position:0%
is indeed
 
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
looking at you as an individual
 
00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
personalized and that's one of the terms
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
that came out
 
00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
in the late 70s instead of precision
 
00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:19.380 align:start position:0%
medicine was personalized medicine and
 
00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
was a term that's used and that's gone
 
00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:24.660 align:start position:0%
by the boards at this juncture
 
00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:25.609 align:start position:0%
by the boards at this juncture
um

00:55:25.609 --> 00:55:25.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:28.549 --> 00:55:28.559 align:start position:0%
but that's the track we're taking from
 
00:55:31.069 --> 00:55:31.079 align:start position:0%
the my great great grandfather horseback
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
doctor to now being able to predict
 
00:55:37.549 --> 00:55:37.559 align:start position:0%
through a computer you know what I may
 
00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
or may not need
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
but there comes our role here from my
 
00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
perspective that indeed what we have to
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
do is is to try and ferret out
 
00:55:51.770 --> 00:55:51.780 align:start position:0%
you know what is legitimate science
 
00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
and what is legitimately applied
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
contrary to Lone marrow transplants for
 
00:56:00.349 --> 00:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
breast cancer
 
00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:03.180 align:start position:0%
we want to be able to Step Beyond the
 
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
emotional content
 
00:56:07.790 --> 00:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
and look at the objective content
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
and once we've decided on the objective
 
00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
content then we can make the assessment
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
of what are the kinds of things that we
 
00:56:18.109 --> 00:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
need to be doing to make it happen
 
00:56:18.119 --> 00:56:19.849 align:start position:0%
need to be doing to make it happen
properly

00:56:19.849 --> 00:56:19.859 align:start position:0%
properly
 
00:56:22.849 --> 00:56:22.859 align:start position:0%
and that's how I view our charge
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
and I think I held it under 45 so I beat
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
that academic standard of 45 minutes
 
00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
um are there questions before I ask my
 
00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:49.309 align:start position:0%
um are there questions before I ask my
questions

00:56:49.309 --> 00:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:53.270 align:start position:0%
seeing none
representative

00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
uh I have a question that I will ask you
 
00:57:00.170 --> 00:57:00.180 align:start position:0%
and I will ask all of our other
 
00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:03.349 align:start position:0%
and I will ask all of our other
presenters

00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:06.599 align:start position:0%
the gold standard
 
00:57:12.069 --> 00:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
for the application of any intervention
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
is the clinical trial
 
00:57:20.569 --> 00:57:20.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
um and that and the clinical study is
 
00:57:27.250 --> 00:57:27.260 align:start position:0%
designed to determine if an intervention
 
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
is effective and What proportion of the
 
00:57:36.049 --> 00:57:36.059 align:start position:0%
time it is effective
 
00:57:39.549 --> 00:57:39.559 align:start position:0%
to your knowledge have there been
 
00:57:42.349 --> 00:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
clinical trials
 
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
of preventive of precision medicine
 
00:57:49.309 --> 00:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
and how does it Shape Up
 
00:57:51.370 --> 00:57:51.380 align:start position:0%
oh there's
 
00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
there's been a number of Trials some
 
00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
with animals and some uh with
 
00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:57.650 align:start position:0%
with animals and some uh with
individuals

00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
um you may have heard early on uh that
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
uh some of the the genetic modification
 
00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
occurred and Hopkins ran into a problem
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
uh with a young man and I've forgotten
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
he had a um a muscle disorder and then
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
details of Escape me but again the side
 
00:58:18.970 --> 00:58:18.980 align:start position:0%
effects so yes there have been
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
to be more specific there have been a
 
00:58:25.609 --> 00:58:25.619 align:start position:0%
number of study in mice being able to
 
00:58:25.619 --> 00:58:28.190 align:start position:0%
number of study in mice being able to
identify

00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
identify
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
cancer cells specifically prostate
 
00:58:34.849 --> 00:58:34.859 align:start position:0%
cancer cells and tart and looking at
 
00:58:37.450 --> 00:58:37.460 align:start position:0%
their surface configuration
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
designing a specific molecule that will
 
00:58:44.329 --> 00:58:44.339 align:start position:0%
attach to that surface antigen
 
00:58:47.289 --> 00:58:47.299 align:start position:0%
and then I have the
 
00:58:50.809 --> 00:58:50.819 align:start position:0%
active moiety or the active part of that
 
00:58:53.569 --> 00:58:53.579 align:start position:0%
molecule once it's attached able to
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
enter the cell
 
00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
okay so it's all only entering a cancer
 
00:58:58.260 --> 00:58:59.690 align:start position:0%
okay so it's all only entering a cancer
cell

00:58:59.690 --> 00:58:59.700 align:start position:0%
cell
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
and release its medication and kill only
 
00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:03.839 align:start position:0%
the cancer cells
 
00:59:07.089 --> 00:59:07.099 align:start position:0%
so those are the kinds of
 
00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:10.140 align:start position:0%
specific studies that have been done
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
again those the ones I'm familiar with
 
00:59:14.569 --> 00:59:14.579 align:start position:0%
are in mice but similar studies are in
 
00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:17.460 align:start position:0%
progress in another a number of areas I
 
00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
have not been able to keep up with a
 
00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:21.670 align:start position:0%
have not been able to keep up with a
clinical

00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
studies that may have used molecular
 
00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:26.270 align:start position:0%
studies that may have used molecular
Dynamics

00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
Dynamics
 
00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:26.990 align:start position:0%
Dynamics
um

00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:29.410 --> 00:59:29.420 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we will be able to hear
 
00:59:34.690 --> 00:59:34.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
if I may follow that up
 
00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:41.940 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to be very cautious in my
 
00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:43.250 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to be very cautious in my
question

00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:59:47.089 --> 00:59:47.099 align:start position:0%
I don't hear you saying
 
00:59:51.069 --> 00:59:51.079 align:start position:0%
yes at this point there have been
 
00:59:55.930 --> 00:59:55.940 align:start position:0%
clinical trials of uh
 
01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
genotyping and Drug matching
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
that give us a very focused view of how
 
01:00:08.329 --> 01:00:08.339 align:start position:0%
effective the approach is compared to
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
traditional interventions
 
01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
is that a reasonable statement the
 
01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:16.740 align:start position:0%
answer is yes and the reason I
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
um would hesitate is because the
 
01:00:21.289 --> 01:00:21.299 align:start position:0%
complexity that's involved in terms of
 
01:00:25.569 --> 01:00:25.579 align:start position:0%
the typical I'll say typical
 
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
standard is the the double-blind studies
 
01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:32.700 align:start position:0%
okay that's the typical okay what we're
 
01:00:36.250 --> 01:00:36.260 align:start position:0%
talking about here is not mass data okay
 
01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:38.940 align:start position:0%
and generalized data but we're talking
 
01:00:41.809 --> 01:00:41.819 align:start position:0%
about specific and therefore the Cadre
 
01:00:44.089 --> 01:00:44.099 align:start position:0%
of people you're interacting with is
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
very very small
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
and we also know from the standpoint of
 
01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:51.660 align:start position:0%
complexity that in fact these organisms
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
that were are
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
diagnoses that were working with are
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
very very
 
01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:00.890 align:start position:0%
very very
um

01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
niche in terms of their characteristics
 
01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
and as with any medication we don't know
 
01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
there's no way to get a good handle on
 
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
some of the molecular dynamics that will
 
01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.950 align:start position:0%
some of the molecular dynamics that will
occur

01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
occur
 
01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
given you know that may be addressed in
 
01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:21.660 align:start position:0%
other words you may conf find out the
 
01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:24.900 align:start position:0%
configuration of an enzyme design a
 
01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:25.910 align:start position:0%
configuration of an enzyme design a
medication

01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
medication
 
01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.289 align:start position:0%
medication
but

01:01:27.289 --> 01:01:27.299 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:29.220 align:start position:0%
find out that the medication that you
 
01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:31.250 align:start position:0%
find out that the medication that you
design

01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
design
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
runs into problems with some other
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
aspect of the physiology an example I
 
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
give is when we had uh penicillin
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
it first came out
 
01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:44.940 align:start position:0%
okay it looked good in the petri dish
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
and the application to humans by God
 
01:01:49.809 --> 01:01:49.819 align:start position:0%
terrible everybody
 
01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:52.140 align:start position:0%
killed people
 
01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:53.210 align:start position:0%
killed people
well

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:53.220 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
turns out it wasn't the penicillin it
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
was the actual carrier moiety molecules
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
are made up of two parts one is a part
 
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
that holds on to the molecule you want
 
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:07.380 align:start position:0%
to use and that carries it into the
 
01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
biologic system
 
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
and it gets released and does its
 
01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:14.220 align:start position:0%
activity well you got this other part
 
01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:16.140 align:start position:0%
running around and you may be allergic
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
to that and that's what happened with
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
Penicillin so everybody ran into
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
problems with Penicillin he said oh we
 
01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
can't use it well they designed another
 
01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
carrier moiety
 
01:02:27.770 --> 01:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
and carried it in okay
 
01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
and that brings us to how medications
 
01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
are reviewed medications are reviewed
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
from a
 
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
a a standard first of all it has to be
 
01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
pharmacist comes up with a chemical
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
number one it has passed mustard that in
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
fact they can make it chemically pure
 
01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:48.660 align:start position:0%
they can reproduce in other way they can
 
01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
make the chemical correctly
 
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
but not a lot of that sounds kind of
 
01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
silly but when you have a chemical
 
01:02:57.770 --> 01:02:57.780 align:start position:0%
reaction there are certain side
 
01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
reactions that go on and contaminate
 
01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
can contaminate your batch it's got to
 
01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
be pure
 
01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
so that's number one
 
01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
number two it has to be biologically
 
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
active well in other words
 
01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:15.839 align:start position:0%
um it's got to be something that the the
 
01:03:17.569 --> 01:03:17.579 align:start position:0%
system that you're introducing it to
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't have like the moiety with
 
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
Penicillin react to so you may get the
 
01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:24.770 align:start position:0%
Penicillin react to so you may get the
chemical

01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:24.780 align:start position:0%
chemical
 
01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
and yes you can make it pure
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
but the biologic system the human being
 
01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:31.980 align:start position:0%
says I don't like it
 
01:03:34.849 --> 01:03:34.859 align:start position:0%
so that's the second standard that you
 
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
have to have with the FDA when you look
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
for approval the third it has to be
 
01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
physiologically active
 
01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:45.900 align:start position:0%
okay in other words I can make it pure
 
01:03:47.809 --> 01:03:47.819 align:start position:0%
secondly I can make it biologically
 
01:03:47.819 --> 01:03:49.250 align:start position:0%
secondly I can make it biologically
compatible

01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
compatible
 
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
okay it gets in fine but then does
 
01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.990 align:start position:0%
okay it gets in fine but then does
nothing

01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:55.549 --> 01:03:55.559 align:start position:0%
okay it doesn't do what it's supposed to
 
01:03:55.559 --> 01:03:56.630 align:start position:0%
okay it doesn't do what it's supposed to
do

01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
so yes you can design it to fit that
 
01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:01.730 align:start position:0%
so yes you can design it to fit that
enzyme

01:04:01.730 --> 01:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
enzyme
 
01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:04.140 align:start position:0%
by mathematics
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
but by the time you go through and make
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
it pure
 
01:04:10.450 --> 01:04:10.460 align:start position:0%
and compatible with the biologic system
 
01:04:14.829 --> 01:04:14.839 align:start position:0%
it may not be physiologically active
 
01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
so they're those are the three steps
 
01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:20.099 align:start position:0%
when you have to consider so we can't
 
01:04:22.089 --> 01:04:22.099 align:start position:0%
consider just making
 
01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
intellectually making the molecule
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
and applying it in a Precision fashion
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
our biologic systems sometimes are more
 
01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:32.700 align:start position:0%
complex than that and don't allow that
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
to work and that's where the clinical
 
01:04:36.370 --> 01:04:36.380 align:start position:0%
trials come in
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
uh and so we're sort of back to where we
 
01:04:43.309 --> 01:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
started from we can't use a standard
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
approach because we can't use
 
01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
double-blind studies it's just nuts that
 
01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
is the gold standard so what we're
 
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
trying to do is to proceed in a
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
scientific manner
 
01:04:57.650 --> 01:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
along lines that that don't allow us to
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
use what has been the gold standard the
 
01:05:02.089 --> 01:05:02.099 align:start position:0%
double-plane study because I mean there
 
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
may not be enough people with a
 
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
particular diagnosis to make it you
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
can't make a double blind
 
01:05:11.569 --> 01:05:11.579 align:start position:0%
just not going to happen so those are
 
01:05:13.849 --> 01:05:13.859 align:start position:0%
the some of the I'm sort of wandering
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
into separate areas but hopefully this
 
01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
has been instructional
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
so people understand the complexity not
 
01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
physiologically complex but also the
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
other complexities that that we're
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
facing when we make these decisions
 
01:05:30.289 --> 01:05:30.299 align:start position:0%
I would agree with what you're saying Dr
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
Woods um representative Woods one of the
 
01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
challenges that
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
we have on the horizon is that when we
 
01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:38.510 align:start position:0%
we have on the horizon is that when we
had

01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:05:41.089 --> 01:05:41.099 align:start position:0%
chemicals drugs
 
01:05:43.609 --> 01:05:43.619 align:start position:0%
they came from a chemical
 
01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
it was easier to make it pure to achieve
 
01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:49.260 align:start position:0%
the goals you're talking about also we
 
01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
had clinical trials because we had an N
 
01:05:52.730 --> 01:05:52.740 align:start position:0%
of many
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
when you get to personalized medication
 
01:05:56.809 --> 01:05:56.819 align:start position:0%
down to precise medication you're down
 
01:05:58.730 --> 01:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
to an N of a few
 
01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:00.299 align:start position:0%
so to your point it's gonna be very
 
01:06:02.329 --> 01:06:02.339 align:start position:0%
difficult to use that standard having a
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
clinical trial which you're trying to
 
01:06:06.109 --> 01:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
carry out something across a population
 
01:06:08.569 --> 01:06:08.579 align:start position:0%
of hundreds of thousands versus
 
01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
population of maybe 100
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be a real challenge
 
01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:13.980 align:start position:0%
I think for all of us is how do we
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
identify the process
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
in order to achieve that goal
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be thinking
 
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
differently it's going to be pulling a
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
lot of folks together and trying to talk
 
01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
about it what I concern myself with
 
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
and this is back to building awareness
 
01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
as well as access
 
01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
and this is a quadri we talked about
 
01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
this earlier with the attorney Williams
 
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
and also with permisses Clifford
 
01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
is how as a society we're going to pay
 
01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
for this
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
a good example that is when we had
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
hepatitis C
 
01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
and they came out with a true cure of
 
01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
hepatitis A
 
01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:54.770 align:start position:0%
hepatitis A
phenomenal

01:06:54.770 --> 01:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
phenomenal
 
01:06:57.170 --> 01:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
but how do you price it because if all
 
01:06:59.329 --> 01:06:59.339 align:start position:0%
of a sudden you're the person in the
 
01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
business model and you're trying to
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
have a revenue stream coming in over
 
01:07:06.650 --> 01:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
multiple years
 
01:07:08.329 --> 01:07:08.339 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden you lose those
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
multiple years of Revenue
 
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
how do you price the product in the
 
01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.010 align:start position:0%
how do you price the product in the
market

01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:07:15.529 --> 01:07:15.539 align:start position:0%
for society to benefit from it
 
01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
so it goes back into I think what you
 
01:07:19.309 --> 01:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
talked about before is
 
01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
how do we pay for it in a lot of ways it
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
may end up costing us less money
 
01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:28.140 align:start position:0%
in the long run but in the short run it
 
01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:29.690 align:start position:0%
in the long run but in the short run it
hurts

01:07:29.690 --> 01:07:29.700 align:start position:0%
hurts
 
01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing with sickle cell
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
anemia you're having now with gene
 
01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
therapy you can fix it
 
01:07:37.730 --> 01:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
but how do you
 
01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
price it in the market in such a way
 
01:07:45.170 --> 01:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
that you can recover all the r d because
 
01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
you only have one
 
01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
shot at it
 
01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:50.220 align:start position:0%
versus somebody's you're going to have
 
01:07:53.329 --> 01:07:53.339 align:start position:0%
therapy for multiple years
 
01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:55.799 align:start position:0%
if I might
 
01:07:58.130 --> 01:07:58.140 align:start position:0%
if I might
 
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
um again this what I call I get to what
 
01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
I have referred to in committee is with
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
global dollars
 
01:08:10.849 --> 01:08:10.859 align:start position:0%
um if you can solve problem a you will
 
01:08:13.970 --> 01:08:13.980 align:start position:0%
have a return on an investment of
 
01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:15.049 align:start position:0%
have a return on an investment of
X

01:08:15.049 --> 01:08:15.059 align:start position:0%
X
 
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
if you incorporate
 
01:08:19.849 --> 01:08:19.859 align:start position:0%
the use of a to begin with is what
 
01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
you're what you're referring to
 
01:08:24.769 --> 01:08:24.779 align:start position:0%
the difficulty the the people that
 
01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
benefit may not be the people okay that
 
01:08:32.150 --> 01:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
you first note and example I give from
 
01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:33.289 align:start position:0%
you first note and example I give from
Orthopedics

01:08:33.289 --> 01:08:33.299 align:start position:0%
Orthopedics
 
01:08:33.299 --> 01:08:35.050 align:start position:0%
Orthopedics
is

01:08:35.050 --> 01:08:35.060 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
arthroscopic surgery we all know
 
01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
arthroscopic surgery and probably
 
01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
everybody in the rooms had arthroscopic
 
01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:42.910 align:start position:0%
everybody in the rooms had arthroscopic
surgery

01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
surgery
 
01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
at any rate if you had a had a knee
 
01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
problem in the late 60s
 
01:08:52.849 --> 01:08:52.859 align:start position:0%
when I started my training if you needed
 
01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
your meniscus out you
 
01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
first of all you didn't do much with it
 
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
well you go to physical therapy and you
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
do this and you work along with it and
 
01:09:05.450 --> 01:09:05.460 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah if you really had to take
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
it out
 
01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
um okay but if you're admitted to the
 
01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:13.259 align:start position:0%
hospital maybe for two or three days a
 
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
big incision uh with the risks of
 
01:09:17.329 --> 01:09:17.339 align:start position:0%
infection as well higher than
 
01:09:17.339 --> 01:09:19.430 align:start position:0%
infection as well higher than
arthroscopy

01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
arthroscopy
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
um and the long and short of it uh by
 
01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
that time the arthritis has probably
 
01:09:25.849 --> 01:09:25.859 align:start position:0%
already set in you may miss the last
 
01:09:28.269 --> 01:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
five to ten years of your work life
 
01:09:32.269 --> 01:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
and more likely to have a total joint
 
01:09:32.279 --> 01:09:33.189 align:start position:0%
and more likely to have a total joint
Etc

01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
arthroscopy you can prevent that in a
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
number of instances
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
and prevent the arthritis and so the
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
workforce you you gain that so Society
 
01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
gets back
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
okay no hospitalization
 
01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
back to work not in six weeks but in
 
01:09:58.729 --> 01:09:58.739 align:start position:0%
sometimes just a day or two
 
01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
um may not need the total joint another
 
01:10:04.209 --> 01:10:04.219 align:start position:0%
added cost through the Medicare program
 
01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
uh and maybe won't need the facility
 
01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
needs for a rehab
 
01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
as well so there's a huge benefit
 
01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
that is not realized other than up front
 
01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
where you pay for the arthroscopy
 
01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:21.900 align:start position:0%
um and as a consequence when we look at
 
01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:23.390 align:start position:0%
um and as a consequence when we look at
this

01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
um we we there's no way to figure in
 
01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
there's no way for our health system to
 
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
look at Global dollars
 
01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
because we have fragmented Health Care
 
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
system so part of it focuses back on our
 
01:10:37.490 --> 01:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
Healthcare System in general
 
01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
but harking back to this how are we
 
01:10:42.649 --> 01:10:42.659 align:start position:0%
going to pay for this because there is
 
01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
open Forum here uh in town he came and
 
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
asked him how could how do you justify
 
01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
six hundred thousand dollars for the hep
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
C vaccination he says well you do
 
01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
realize that we're providing a benefit
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
to society
 
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
I mean if you cure this he's not missing
 
01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
work okay that's benefit to the employer
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
multiple multiple multiple
 
01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:12.679 align:start position:0%
hospitalization in the course of hep C
 
01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
hospitals are benefiting tremendously
 
01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
um you may not need a liver transplant
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
down the road I mean this is huge I mean
 
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
we're we are saving millions and
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars
 
01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
so therefore we feel we can justify
 
01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
you know as contributing to saving all
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
this money that the six hundred thousand
 
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
dollars is well Justified
 
01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
however I'll just offer my counter to
 
01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:38.450 align:start position:0%
however I'll just offer my counter to
that

01:11:38.450 --> 01:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
I said well I don't I'm not too sure I
 
01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:42.780 align:start position:0%
understand your reasoning just because
 
01:11:46.189 --> 01:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
you can doesn't mean you do it or can
 
01:11:49.450 --> 01:11:49.460 align:start position:0%
I said I'm a hand surgeon and I've
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
reattached maybe a hundred hands and
 
01:11:54.050 --> 01:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
arms not here in rush in Concord but at
 
01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:55.490 align:start position:0%
arms not here in rush in Concord but at
Rochester

01:11:55.490 --> 01:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
Rochester
 
01:11:57.709 --> 01:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:00.659 align:start position:0%
uh one particular lady a severed hand
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
dominant hand
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
workers comp
 
01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:05.570 align:start position:0%
workers comp
um

01:12:05.570 --> 01:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:08.209 --> 01:12:08.219 align:start position:0%
back to work in three months not the
 
01:12:10.189 --> 01:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
same job but also taking care of her
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
invalent husband at that point
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
so I said again this was in 70
 
01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
6 I think something like that
 
01:12:23.209 --> 01:12:23.219 align:start position:0%
um for the team that took 19 to 20 hours
 
01:12:29.689 --> 01:12:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.669 --> 01:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
I said workers comp
 
01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
okay had she lost her dominant hand pays
 
01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
a lump sum to pay it depending upon what
 
01:12:40.729 --> 01:12:40.739 align:start position:0%
part is missing and for a dominant hand
 
01:12:42.649 --> 01:12:42.659 align:start position:0%
to be missing permanently in her age
 
01:12:44.570 --> 01:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
group she was only 40 something years
 
01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:45.590 align:start position:0%
group she was only 40 something years
old

01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
old
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
I said let's just pick a number let's
 
01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:48.900 align:start position:0%
say that she would have gotten a lump
 
01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
sum through workers comp of a million
 
01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:51.530 align:start position:0%
sum through workers comp of a million
bucks

01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
bucks
 
01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:53.930 align:start position:0%
bucks
compensation

01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:55.370 align:start position:0%
compensation
so

01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:58.850 --> 01:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
I saved uh or a team not me it was about
 
01:13:00.770 --> 01:13:00.780 align:start position:0%
a 23 hour operation
 
01:13:03.890 --> 01:13:03.900 align:start position:0%
so I saved the system maybe a million
 
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
dollars there
 
01:13:05.159 --> 01:13:07.910 align:start position:0%
dollars there
so

01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
maybe 250 000 would have been reasonable
 
01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:14.630 align:start position:0%
maybe 250 000 would have been reasonable
fee

01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
he said well here's my card why don't we
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
talk about this next time you're in New
 
01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:19.850 align:start position:0%
talk about this next time you're in New
York

01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
York
 
01:13:21.890 --> 01:13:21.900 align:start position:0%
was his response
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
but this is we have to think about
 
01:13:26.209 --> 01:13:26.219 align:start position:0%
global dollars we have to think about
 
01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
how we and I'm talking about globally
 
01:13:32.330 --> 01:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
weak how do we as the pharmacy industry
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
look at our profit margin and what is
 
01:13:36.770 --> 01:13:36.780 align:start position:0%
our contribution
 
01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:40.020 align:start position:0%
to society and surgeons the same way I
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
mean I'm talking about I mean they have
 
01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
to say you know um
 
01:13:44.930 --> 01:13:44.940 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:13:48.130 --> 01:13:48.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:52.130 --> 01:13:52.140 align:start position:0%
I would encourage this task force that
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
we our legislation that creates the task
 
01:13:57.649 --> 01:13:57.659 align:start position:0%
force to include in broaden
 
01:13:59.810 --> 01:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
the composition of the task force to
 
01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
include those from the insurance
 
01:14:04.729 --> 01:14:04.739 align:start position:0%
industry possibly those from the
 
01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
business community that are either in
 
01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals or in this space because
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
I think we need to really understand
 
01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
from their point of view the economics
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
of it if we're trying to ensure that we
 
01:14:19.729 --> 01:14:19.739 align:start position:0%
build awareness and build access a lot
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
of the access is going to be predicated
 
01:14:22.669 --> 01:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
upon the ability
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
for somebody to pay the bill
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
and when you get down to that point in
 
01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
time stick when you get down to
 
01:14:31.610 --> 01:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
personalized medicine or Precision
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
medicine and you have a cohort of many
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
many covered lives in a plan
 
01:14:39.890 --> 01:14:39.900 align:start position:0%
but you only have one or two individuals
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
within 100 000 that are going to benefit
 
01:14:42.890 --> 01:14:42.900 align:start position:0%
for something that cost six hundred
 
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars it's going to hit the
 
01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
premium so therefore how do we as a
 
01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
society how does the business Community
 
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
how do we work with them collectively to
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
ensure that all the work we're doing
 
01:14:55.729 --> 01:14:55.739 align:start position:0%
actually becomes achievable for the
 
01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:01.850 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:15:01.850 --> 01:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:12.370 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:15:12.370 --> 01:15:12.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:16.610 --> 01:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
way to address you thank you Mr chairman
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
I guess it would be Mr chairman okay all
 
01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr chairman
 
01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
um and this is not exactly a question
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
but it's an observation uh recently in
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
the last two years with all the pandemic
 
01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:33.900 align:start position:0%
and the treatments and practices
 
01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
this idea of changing our view on what
 
01:15:41.630 --> 01:15:41.640 align:start position:0%
constitutes the equivalence to a
 
01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
clinical trial
 
01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
became a very apparent because if
 
01:15:49.130 --> 01:15:49.140 align:start position:0%
somebody is at risk of dying
 
01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
are you really going to do a clinical
 
01:15:54.189 --> 01:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
trial and deny some people a treatment
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm glad this issue is coming up
 
01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
because it's
 
01:16:04.669 --> 01:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
it's a new world you know ethically how
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
do you do a clinical trial I'd help them
 
01:16:09.770 --> 01:16:09.780 align:start position:0%
think ethically you can when somebody's
 
01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
life is on the line and you have a
 
01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:13.790 align:start position:0%
life is on the line and you have a
treatment

01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
that you think works
 
01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
um so that's one little thing that needs
 
01:16:21.950 --> 01:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
to be ironed out here
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
when you determine whether the treatment
 
01:16:26.570 --> 01:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
is effective
 
01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:27.890 align:start position:0%
is effective
um

01:16:27.890 --> 01:16:27.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to point out that
 
01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
that's one little one little thing that
 
01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:34.860 align:start position:0%
we're discussing here
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh everything you've said right now
 
01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
makes really good sense and we certainly
 
01:16:42.169 --> 01:16:42.179 align:start position:0%
if we're going to do a thorough job we
 
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
do need to put the the money people here
 
01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
to say how how it affects everybody else
 
01:16:51.890 --> 01:16:51.900 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:53.270 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
candid

01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
candid
 
01:16:58.010 --> 01:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
with the discussion we're talking about
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
money associated with something that but
 
01:17:05.330 --> 01:17:05.340 align:start position:0%
really bottom line that's what it comes
 
01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
down to and
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
um and it comes to the question of
 
01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
what's the potential for industry
 
01:17:15.709 --> 01:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
funding to research this have having
 
01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
a member of the pharmaceutical Community
 
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
as a part of my family and I part of an
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
r d organization I know that they do
 
01:17:27.050 --> 01:17:27.060 align:start position:0%
work on products that never come to
 
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
Market and coming from the computer
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
industry I knew that we spent millions
 
01:17:35.689 --> 01:17:35.699 align:start position:0%
of dollars on products that never came
 
01:17:39.410 --> 01:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
to Market and and part of part of the
 
01:17:42.729 --> 01:17:42.739 align:start position:0%
question here is where we may have
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
individuals that have a need that's
 
01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
currently solved by a very expensive
 
01:17:53.149 --> 01:17:53.159 align:start position:0%
process and products is
 
01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
should we be challenging the industry
 
01:18:00.169 --> 01:18:00.179 align:start position:0%
and and their money
 
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
to find ways to
 
01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
address this issue
 
01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
maybe in ways that we haven't even
 
01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
thought of currently instead of putting
 
01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
financial burden on the patient or even
 
01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
on their insurance is to go back to the
 
01:18:25.630 --> 01:18:25.640 align:start position:0%
industry and say can you put money into
 
01:18:29.450 --> 01:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
investigating this to determine are
 
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
there more than one or more than a
 
01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:33.300 align:start position:0%
hundred people
 
01:18:35.810 --> 01:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
considering that we may be looking at
 
01:18:37.850 --> 01:18:37.860 align:start position:0%
our Market here in the U.S and maybe
 
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
Europe but it could be much broader than
 
01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:40.910 align:start position:0%
Europe but it could be much broader than
that

01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
and and for us to in to to put get
 
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
someone from industry to talk with us on
 
01:18:52.209 --> 01:18:52.219 align:start position:0%
this topic but uh it's also
 
01:18:56.450 --> 01:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
the realization is that currently
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
people are working on products that may
 
01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
never come to Market and they are
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
spending millions of dollars on these
 
01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:05.810 align:start position:0%
spending millions of dollars on these
products

01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
products
 
01:19:07.729 --> 01:19:07.739 align:start position:0%
um with the goal of
 
01:19:10.189 --> 01:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
maybe bringing it to a clinical trial
 
01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
that would in fact prove that the
 
01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
product doesn't address the need anyways
 
01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
so uh that that's my question I have
 
01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:22.860 align:start position:0%
another question for this committee is
 
01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
is do we have specific dates in which we
 
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
need to come up with what we're
 
01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:32.820 align:start position:0%
discussing here and
 
01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
uh if I can respond to that
 
01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:38.290 align:start position:0%
uh if I can respond to that
um

01:19:38.290 --> 01:19:38.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
I foolishly
 
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
promised chairman Pearson that we would
 
01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
wrap this up by the end of November
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
I suspect I will live to regret that
 
01:19:52.679 --> 01:19:59.709 align:start position:0%
I suspect I will live to regret that
statement

01:19:59.709 --> 01:19:59.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I I think that the goal is
 
01:20:06.410 --> 01:20:06.420 align:start position:0%
to develop a
 
01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:08.209 align:start position:0%
to develop a
LSR

01:20:08.209 --> 01:20:08.219 align:start position:0%
LSR
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
that we can introduce in November we may
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
be able to hit that goal and then at
 
01:20:14.570 --> 01:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
that point in time it would transition
 
01:20:18.290 --> 01:20:18.300 align:start position:0%
from this body to another body to become
 
01:20:20.450 --> 01:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
the actual task force I think this is
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
really kind of setting the stage to
 
01:20:23.570 --> 01:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
create the LSR
 
01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:26.699 align:start position:0%
and then from there to hopefully get it
 
01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
into place
 
01:20:29.810 --> 01:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
or maybe if you're thinking about having
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
it become a permanent
 
01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of the oversight committee
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
which we could do without creating an
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
LSR that would be the decision of the
 
01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
chair thank you
 
01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:43.970 align:start position:0%
chair thank you
um

01:20:43.970 --> 01:20:43.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:51.300 align:start position:0%
um recently sometime in the last 10
 
01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:54.860 align:start position:0%
years I read about the junk bond King
 
01:20:58.250 --> 01:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
who and I can't remember his name but he
 
01:21:00.770 --> 01:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
was in prison because he had ripped off
 
01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:02.030 align:start position:0%
was in prison because he had ripped off
people

01:21:02.030 --> 01:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:21:05.450 --> 01:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
he came up yeah when you think of it say
 
01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:06.590 align:start position:0%
he came up yeah when you think of it say
it

01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:21:10.189 --> 01:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
um he discovered because he insisted on
 
01:21:13.010 --> 01:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
getting an uh physical after he got out
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
of prison he insisted on a um
 
01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
what is the test for prostate cancer
 
01:21:22.729 --> 01:21:22.739 align:start position:0%
a PSA yeah and the doctor kept saying
 
01:21:24.410 --> 01:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
You're So Young You couldn't possibly
 
01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
have it well he insisted and he had like
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
stage three
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
without any symptoms
 
01:21:34.669 --> 01:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
um and so he became he used some of his
 
01:21:36.590 --> 01:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh creative
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
thought to go to conferences where he
 
01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
wasn't a medical person you were
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a certified doctor to be
 
01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:46.980 align:start position:0%
there but he kind of faked it and used
 
01:21:50.630 --> 01:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
his mother's maiden name and went and
 
01:21:54.169 --> 01:21:54.179 align:start position:0%
got the attention of everybody there by
 
01:21:58.970 --> 01:21:58.980 align:start position:0%
his in absolutely heartfelt uh appeal to
 
01:22:00.890 --> 01:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
do research
 
01:22:04.490 --> 01:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
and to share that research he found
 
01:22:07.149 --> 01:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
money got more people to contribute it
 
01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
to pay to pay for research but it also
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
meant that if you accepted the money you
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
gave a report every year you didn't wait
 
01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
until you had a marketable product and
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
that way and it was successful and that
 
01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
way they piggybacked on each other so
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
you went and contributed what you had
 
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
learned in that year
 
01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
even though you really was hoping you
 
01:22:34.729 --> 01:22:34.739 align:start position:0%
could keep developing it and end up
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
making a lot of money this way the
 
01:22:40.729 --> 01:22:40.739 align:start position:0%
research was much faster because when
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
everybody contributed what they had
 
01:22:46.130 --> 01:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
learned everybody else could use that
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
in their own research and so they had
 
01:22:51.530 --> 01:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
much more success so I'm just throwing
 
01:22:53.689 --> 01:22:53.699 align:start position:0%
this out there because I hope that
 
01:22:57.010 --> 01:22:57.020 align:start position:0%
anything that we promote
 
01:22:59.630 --> 01:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
also promotes
 
01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there's a two-bit word for it
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
but it means that you're contributing
 
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
and you're Building Together
 
01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
much faster than everybody going off on
 
01:23:12.490 --> 01:23:12.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:17.689 --> 01:23:17.699 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a brief less than 45
 
01:23:20.689 --> 01:23:20.699 align:start position:0%
minutes closing statement and I'd like
 
01:23:22.669 --> 01:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
to adjourn this meeting because I'm
 
01:23:22.679 --> 01:23:24.470 align:start position:0%
to adjourn this meeting because I'm
freezing

01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
freezing
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
um it's it and I want to go outside to
 
01:23:28.189 --> 01:23:28.199 align:start position:0%
warm up
 
01:23:28.199 --> 01:23:29.570 align:start position:0%
warm up
um

01:23:29.570 --> 01:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
I I would like to say
 
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
I spent
 
01:23:36.530 --> 01:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
the majority of my career teaching
 
01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:38.390 align:start position:0%
the majority of my career teaching
epidemiology

01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
epidemiology
 
01:23:42.290 --> 01:23:42.300 align:start position:0%
at undergraduate and graduate levels
 
01:23:44.689 --> 01:23:44.699 align:start position:0%
um I if I recall I'm not positive this
 
01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
but I believe that Ms minnehan who is
 
01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
not present in the room so I can say
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
this uh suffered through my epidemiology
 
01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:53.689 align:start position:0%
this uh suffered through my epidemiology
class

01:23:53.689 --> 01:23:53.699 align:start position:0%
class
 
01:23:53.699 --> 01:23:54.830 align:start position:0%
class
um

01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:57.709 --> 01:23:57.719 align:start position:0%
in in my teaching
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
what I taught was that the succession of
 
01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:02.689 align:start position:0%
what I taught was that the succession of
studies

01:24:02.689 --> 01:24:02.699 align:start position:0%
studies
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
case control studies cohort studies were
 
01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:08.470 align:start position:0%
case control studies cohort studies were
always

01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
always
 
01:24:13.490 --> 01:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
good at generating hypotheses but the
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
clinical trial was the gold standard
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
and only when you had succeeded at the
 
01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:21.800 align:start position:0%
clinical trial
 
01:24:24.890 --> 01:24:24.900 align:start position:0%
did you let us say go to the bank on an
 
01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:26.530 align:start position:0%
did you let us say go to the bank on an
intervention

01:24:26.530 --> 01:24:26.540 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
01:24:30.169 --> 01:24:30.179 align:start position:0%
and as I listened to today's testimony
 
01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
it begins to occur to me that the
 
01:24:38.450 --> 01:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
clinical trial is no longer the adequate
 
01:24:40.450 --> 01:24:40.460 align:start position:0%
gold standard there are other
 
01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:42.010 align:start position:0%
gold standard there are other
imperatives

01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:42.020 align:start position:0%
imperatives
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
in tracking the success of interventions
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
that we have to use
 
01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:51.850 align:start position:0%
that we have to use
and

01:24:51.850 --> 01:24:51.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
our world of uh epidemiologic
 
01:25:00.410 --> 01:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
investigation has changed I am now an
 
01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:01.570 align:start position:0%
investigation has changed I am now an
Antiquity

01:25:01.570 --> 01:25:01.580 align:start position:0%
Antiquity
 
01:25:04.610 --> 01:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
and would no longer be effective at
 
01:25:06.709 --> 01:25:06.719 align:start position:0%
teaching that class
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I have heard today
 
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
which I think is terribly important
 
01:25:14.890 --> 01:25:14.900 align:start position:0%
two parts
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
one is that we are looking at outcomes
 
01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
for individual patients and outcomes for
 
01:25:24.890 --> 01:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
our population as a whole and they may
 
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
be very different
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
the final comment that I want to make is
 
01:25:35.689 --> 01:25:35.699 align:start position:0%
a piggyback to representative Woods
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
observation that in many cases we're
 
01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
looking at wider impact broader impacts
 
01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:48.260 align:start position:0%
than we see in an individual case
 
01:25:52.729 --> 01:25:52.739 align:start position:0%
uh for example we now have uh trials
 
01:25:56.810 --> 01:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
going on on a medication to slow the
 
01:25:59.810 --> 01:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
advance of Alzheimer's disease
 
01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:02.940 align:start position:0%
one has to realize that the Alzheimer's
 
01:26:07.490 --> 01:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
patient represents a cost not just to
 
01:26:11.689 --> 01:26:11.699 align:start position:0%
the patient but to the family as well
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
to the entire household in some cases to
 
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
the community if a person needs daycare
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
it needs to be under memory care unit
 
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
and so forth and in that case it is
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
possible that the slope
 
01:26:31.370 --> 01:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
the slowing of the advance of the
 
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
disease actually costs more than simply
 
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
letting it run its course
 
01:26:42.110 --> 01:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
I will tell one anecdote it comes
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
courtesy of uh Dr Jack Fox who was at
 
01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
the time that I knew him the chairman of
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
Neurology at Rush Medical Center in
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
Chicago he's currently the dean of Rush
 
01:27:00.050 --> 01:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
medical school and he talked about
 
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
a family coming to him and saying well
 
01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
you know Mom has Alzheimer's and we want
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
your advice as to whether to provide her
 
01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
and his recommendation was
 
01:27:22.490 --> 01:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
I would not recommend it
 
01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
and his reasoning was that Mom was an
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
extreme burden on the Family
 
01:27:31.610 --> 01:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
a financial burden
 
01:27:34.610 --> 01:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
uh members of the family could not go
 
01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
out to work
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
um this was a disease for which we did
 
01:27:42.050 --> 01:27:42.060 align:start position:0%
not have an effective treatment
 
01:27:46.189 --> 01:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
it was ultimately a terminal disease
 
01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
and the impact the financial and
 
01:27:53.570 --> 01:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:56.209 --> 01:27:56.219 align:start position:0%
would be diminished
 
01:28:00.050 --> 01:28:00.060 align:start position:0%
were mom to develop influenza and
 
01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:01.370 align:start position:0%
were mom to develop influenza and
pneumonia

01:28:01.370 --> 01:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
pneumonia
 
01:28:02.990 --> 01:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
and perish
 
01:28:06.890 --> 01:28:06.900 align:start position:0%
it's a chilling chilling thought
 
01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
and yet it is the sort of thought that
 
01:28:11.689 --> 01:28:11.699 align:start position:0%
we have to process in this committee
 
01:28:11.699 --> 01:28:13.550 align:start position:0%
we have to process in this committee
so

01:28:13.550 --> 01:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
um with that I would like to thank you
 
01:28:20.090 --> 01:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
all profoundly for your patience under
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
duress in this cold cold room thank you
 
01:28:27.770 --> 01:28:27.780 align:start position:0%
for and I'm I must tell you that as
 
01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
difficult as it has been in terms of our
 
01:28:33.649 --> 01:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
temperature environment this has been
 
01:28:37.129 --> 01:28:37.139 align:start position:0%
extremely extremely rewarding in terms
 
01:28:40.129 --> 01:28:40.139 align:start position:0%
of opening up our awareness of the
 
01:28:43.610 --> 01:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
issues in Precision medicine and I thank
 
01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
you all for putting up with the duress
 
01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:51.540 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes I might uh did you want to
 
01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:55.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:55.139 --> 01:28:57.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:28:57.229 --> 01:28:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:57.239 --> 01:28:58.370 align:start position:0%
 
a

01:28:58.370 --> 01:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:29:00.649 --> 01:29:00.659 align:start position:0%
this is going to get interesting
 
01:29:02.810 --> 01:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
if the if this is going to happen every
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
Monday morning
 
01:29:07.930 --> 01:29:07.940 align:start position:0%
I'm not meeting on Mondays
 
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
and I why don't we representative gay
 
01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
thank you I will get a hold of Christina
 
01:29:18.649 --> 01:29:18.659 align:start position:0%
Dyer who's our staffer and suggest to
 
01:29:21.950 --> 01:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
her that we change our meeting days to a
 
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
day when the heat's on
 
01:29:27.050 --> 01:29:27.060 align:start position:0%
um that uh we can't let this happen
 
01:29:28.729 --> 01:29:28.739 align:start position:0%
again I've got a meeting this afternoon
 
01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's you know very important meeting
 
01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:32.810 align:start position:0%
that's you know very important meeting
and

01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
just can't put up with this I can't
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
imagine that any state in the Union
 
01:29:41.090 --> 01:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
operates this way so
 
01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll see if I can change that okay
 
03:05:54.849 --> 03:05:54.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:57.410 --> 03:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:06:00.830 --> 03:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
this opens the hearing
 
03:06:04.130 --> 03:06:04.140 align:start position:0%
and I do not know where the chair Pro
 
03:06:06.950 --> 03:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
tem is but I'm the chair of oversight so
 
03:06:08.870 --> 03:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open the meeting and that's
 
03:06:11.030 --> 03:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
a good way of making sure he'll show up
 
03:06:13.429 --> 03:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
in about 20 seconds
 
03:06:16.790 --> 03:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
the hope that I have as chairman of
 
03:06:18.650 --> 03:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
oversight and that I have for this
 
03:06:21.769 --> 03:06:21.779 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is that we find a way to be
 
03:06:21.779 --> 03:06:22.990 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is that we find a way to be
appropriately

03:06:22.990 --> 03:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
03:06:26.389 --> 03:06:26.399 align:start position:0%
transparent when it comes to Serious
 
03:06:29.090 --> 03:06:29.100 align:start position:0%
medical mistakes
 
03:06:31.010 --> 03:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my wife is a family
 
03:06:33.170 --> 03:06:33.180 align:start position:0%
practice physician
 
03:06:36.889 --> 03:06:36.899 align:start position:0%
and we know that sometimes when a claim
 
03:06:39.530 --> 03:06:39.540 align:start position:0%
is made against a physician this
 
03:06:39.540 --> 03:06:41.690 align:start position:0%
is made against a physician this
frivolous

03:06:41.690 --> 03:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
frivolous
 
03:06:43.849 --> 03:06:43.859 align:start position:0%
some insurance companies say it's
 
03:06:46.250 --> 03:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
cheaper to settle the claim by giving
 
03:06:48.410 --> 03:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
them a small amount of money to make
 
03:06:52.670 --> 03:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
them go away than it is to fight it we
 
03:06:54.830 --> 03:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
would win but it's more expensive so
 
03:06:56.690 --> 03:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
we'll settle
 
03:06:58.969 --> 03:06:58.979 align:start position:0%
but then there's a black mark that goes
 
03:07:01.730 --> 03:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
against that physician who knows if
 
03:07:04.429 --> 03:07:04.439 align:start position:0%
there's just something listed as a
 
03:07:07.849 --> 03:07:07.859 align:start position:0%
malpractice situation whether it was
 
03:07:10.730 --> 03:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
to the level of criminal negligence or
 
03:07:14.150 --> 03:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
to the level of frivolity or what
 
03:07:17.690 --> 03:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
My Hope Is that eventually we are able
 
03:07:20.330 --> 03:07:20.340 align:start position:0%
to have a mechanism of reporting
 
03:07:20.340 --> 03:07:21.610 align:start position:0%
to have a mechanism of reporting
where

03:07:21.610 --> 03:07:21.620 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:07:24.710 --> 03:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
Physicians and hospitals that are either
 
03:07:26.990 --> 03:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
totally innocent or
 
03:07:29.750 --> 03:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
the mistakes that were made are the kind
 
03:07:31.429 --> 03:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
of mistakes that are made because we're
 
03:07:31.439 --> 03:07:32.450 align:start position:0%
of mistakes that are made because we're
human

03:07:32.450 --> 03:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
human
 
03:07:34.809 --> 03:07:34.819 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand protect the public
 
03:07:39.769 --> 03:07:39.779 align:start position:0%
by making sure that those whose level of
 
03:07:42.410 --> 03:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
performance is horrid where colleagues
 
03:07:46.910 --> 03:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
complain those people are known for what
 
03:07:49.309 --> 03:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
they did wrong whether it goes to a
 
03:07:52.790 --> 03:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
court trial or not that was the hope
 
03:07:55.309 --> 03:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
that I had when I put this subcommittee
 
03:07:57.469 --> 03:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
together and I'm hoping over the next
 
03:08:01.190 --> 03:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
three weeks of meetings that is what we
 
03:08:03.290 --> 03:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
will find a vehicle to do
 
03:08:05.630 --> 03:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
uh with that I would like to call on
 
03:08:08.389 --> 03:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
other members of the committee if you
 
03:08:08.399 --> 03:08:10.490 align:start position:0%
other members of the committee if you
would

03:08:10.490 --> 03:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:08:10.500 --> 03:08:11.510 align:start position:0%
would
um

03:08:11.510 --> 03:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:13.370 --> 03:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
share with us what you would like to see
 
03:08:26.030 --> 03:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:27.889 --> 03:08:27.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:08:27.899 --> 03:08:29.990 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

03:08:29.990 --> 03:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:32.690 --> 03:08:32.700 align:start position:0%
I'm a draftee so I didn't come with any
 
03:08:35.330 --> 03:08:35.340 align:start position:0%
preconceived notions I want very much to
 
03:08:39.170 --> 03:08:39.180 align:start position:0%
listen to what folks who have been
 
03:08:42.230 --> 03:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
involved in the process have to say and
 
03:08:44.389 --> 03:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
then I'll figure out where I want to go
 
03:08:46.670 --> 03:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
with it after that but I thank you okay
 
03:08:48.710 --> 03:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
I was hoping for more because I'm in the
 
03:08:50.570 --> 03:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
same situation at the present I'm trying
 
03:08:53.389 --> 03:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
to put together a schedule in my mind as
 
03:08:57.769 --> 03:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
we speak anyone else on the committee
 
03:09:01.010 --> 03:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
who might like to speak representative
 
03:09:04.130 --> 03:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
Jess Edwards uh thank you Mr chair I I
 
03:09:07.550 --> 03:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
I'd say that um
 
03:09:10.010 --> 03:09:10.020 align:start position:0%
my objective here not having a
 
03:09:12.250 --> 03:09:12.260 align:start position:0%
background in how our Board of Medicine
 
03:09:15.950 --> 03:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
reports uh is to learn a lot and if
 
03:09:18.050 --> 03:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
we're going to come up with any uh
 
03:09:20.450 --> 03:09:20.460 align:start position:0%
legislation I'd like us to make sure
 
03:09:23.750 --> 03:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
that we follow a disciplined Ready Aim
 
03:09:23.760 --> 03:09:24.730 align:start position:0%
that we follow a disciplined Ready Aim
Fire

03:09:24.730 --> 03:09:24.740 align:start position:0%
Fire
 
03:09:28.910 --> 03:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
perspective where uh before we start to
 
03:09:31.250 --> 03:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
go down the road of any changes in
 
03:09:33.050 --> 03:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
legislation that we really make sure
 
03:09:35.389 --> 03:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
that we understand do we have a problem
 
03:09:37.309 --> 03:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
or not if there's if there's not really
 
03:09:40.370 --> 03:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
a problem Beyond perception we ought to
 
03:09:42.889 --> 03:09:42.899 align:start position:0%
handle that differently than if there is
 
03:09:45.650 --> 03:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
a real issue that you know maybe Maine
 
03:09:47.990 --> 03:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
or Vermont or Massachusetts or somebody
 
03:09:50.150 --> 03:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
does it better than us and it's an issue
 
03:09:52.849 --> 03:09:52.859 align:start position:0%
of procedures and policies but but I
 
03:09:54.889 --> 03:09:54.899 align:start position:0%
don't I don't I don't even want to start
 
03:09:57.130 --> 03:09:57.140 align:start position:0%
down that unless
 
03:10:01.130 --> 03:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
we can conclude that there's an actual
 
03:10:03.110 --> 03:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
problem that we're attempting to solve
 
03:10:04.969 --> 03:10:04.979 align:start position:0%
and then these are problem-solving
 
03:10:07.250 --> 03:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
skills after that but anyone on the
 
03:10:08.929 --> 03:10:08.939 align:start position:0%
committee wish to speak to what the
 
03:10:14.870 --> 03:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:17.090 --> 03:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
03:10:19.370 --> 03:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my name is Jim
 
03:10:19.380 --> 03:10:20.290 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my name is Jim
Murphy

03:10:20.290 --> 03:10:20.300 align:start position:0%
Murphy
 
03:10:23.389 --> 03:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
I have practice in medicine for 40 years
 
03:10:25.309 --> 03:10:25.319 align:start position:0%
and I would agree with you with the
 
03:10:27.349 --> 03:10:27.359 align:start position:0%
understanding that we would like to
 
03:10:28.910 --> 03:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
understand first the process going
 
03:10:31.610 --> 03:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
forward the um the statutes that we
 
03:10:33.590 --> 03:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
currently have in our state and if
 
03:10:36.050 --> 03:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
there's any way to improve upon him
 
03:10:37.250 --> 03:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
um that that's what we would be
 
03:10:40.550 --> 03:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
ultimately charged to do having said
 
03:10:43.969 --> 03:10:43.979 align:start position:0%
that I think that as has been mentioned
 
03:10:45.710 --> 03:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
I think we are in a
 
03:10:48.050 --> 03:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
a discovery phase right now trying to
 
03:10:50.809 --> 03:10:50.819 align:start position:0%
understand exactly where we are uh in
 
03:10:52.370 --> 03:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
the state but also relative to other
 
03:10:54.469 --> 03:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
states and how the process works there
 
03:10:56.150 --> 03:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
as well
 
03:10:56.160 --> 03:10:56.809 align:start position:0%
as well
um

03:10:56.809 --> 03:10:56.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:58.849 --> 03:10:58.859 align:start position:0%
so I'm very interested in hearing from
 
03:11:00.410 --> 03:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
those that will be presenting to us and
 
03:11:04.250 --> 03:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with a um a logical
 
03:11:06.830 --> 03:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
um solution if there is a need for a
 
03:11:06.840 --> 03:11:07.690 align:start position:0%
um solution if there is a need for a
solution

03:11:07.690 --> 03:11:07.700 align:start position:0%
solution
 
03:11:09.830 --> 03:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
because the problem to me is that we
 
03:11:11.570 --> 03:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
simply at this point in time we simply
 
03:11:14.030 --> 03:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
don't understand and we need to get a
 
03:11:15.290 --> 03:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
little better understanding of the
 
03:11:19.010 --> 03:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
current process but the impetus for this
 
03:11:22.309 --> 03:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
was a series of articles in the Boston
 
03:11:24.130 --> 03:11:24.140 align:start position:0%
Globe which
 
03:11:27.710 --> 03:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
highlighted a significant difference in
 
03:11:31.130 --> 03:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
how the Massachusetts Board of Medicine
 
03:11:33.230 --> 03:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
reporting and how the New Hampshire
 
03:11:35.630 --> 03:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine reported on the same
 
03:11:39.230 --> 03:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
individual and the Massachusetts board
 
03:11:45.309 --> 03:11:45.319 align:start position:0%
reports 20 of what I believe wore 21
 
03:11:47.710 --> 03:11:47.720 align:start position:0%
I'll just use the word malpractice
 
03:11:51.349 --> 03:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
situations and try to make that as uh
 
03:11:51.359 --> 03:11:53.050 align:start position:0%
situations and try to make that as uh
non

03:11:53.050 --> 03:11:53.060 align:start position:0%
non
 
03:11:55.550 --> 03:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
judgmental as possible but there were 20
 
03:11:59.389 --> 03:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
instances reported on an individual from
 
03:12:01.429 --> 03:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
what I read I could not tell whether
 
03:12:03.830 --> 03:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
this was frivolous criminal anything in
 
03:12:06.290 --> 03:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
between it was just events
 
03:12:08.750 --> 03:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
at the same time the New Hampshire board
 
03:12:10.550 --> 03:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
reported zero
 
03:12:12.410 --> 03:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
and that isn't to say one is better than
 
03:12:14.690 --> 03:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
the other it's just where we're starting
 
03:12:17.929 --> 03:12:17.939 align:start position:0%
is what and why
 
03:12:17.939 --> 03:12:19.670 align:start position:0%
is what and why
um

03:12:19.670 --> 03:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:24.530 --> 03:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:24.540 --> 03:12:25.670 align:start position:0%

03:14:41.870 --> 03:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
cheer would like to know what are the
 
03:14:43.849 --> 03:14:43.859 align:start position:0%
rules for
 
03:14:46.370 --> 03:14:46.380 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine in terms of
 
03:14:48.550 --> 03:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
disclosure because
 
03:14:50.630 --> 03:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards with the staff
 
03:14:52.370 --> 03:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
here has done a great job in finding out
 
03:14:56.750 --> 03:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
what every state is supposed to do what
 
03:14:59.510 --> 03:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
are the rules and regulations for New
 
03:15:02.690 --> 03:15:02.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for posting on malpractice
 
03:15:05.750 --> 03:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
so generally the rules specific to the
 
03:15:08.349 --> 03:15:08.359 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine are consistent with
 
03:15:11.510 --> 03:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
the statutory requirements for all other
 
03:15:15.230 --> 03:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
licensing boards and the statutes can
 
03:15:16.969 --> 03:15:16.979 align:start position:0%
obviously be found in the various board
 
03:15:19.849 --> 03:15:19.859 align:start position:0%
practice acts but
 
03:15:22.969 --> 03:15:22.979 align:start position:0%
um essentially we only publicly disclose
 
03:15:26.389 --> 03:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
information if there has been a
 
03:15:28.670 --> 03:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action a notice of hearing
 
03:15:30.309 --> 03:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
has been issued
 
03:15:32.929 --> 03:15:32.939 align:start position:0%
after a notice of hearing is issued
 
03:15:36.469 --> 03:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
information that is generated through
 
03:15:39.950 --> 03:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
our office and the board is considered
 
03:15:42.769 --> 03:15:42.779 align:start position:0%
public information and that is what is
 
03:15:45.950 --> 03:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
posted to our website as well as the
 
03:15:47.889 --> 03:15:47.899 align:start position:0%
licensing portal
 
03:15:53.269 --> 03:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
we do receive reports of lawsuits that
 
03:15:55.309 --> 03:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
comes directly from the court and that
 
03:15:58.490 --> 03:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
is actually unique to the Board of
 
03:16:01.490 --> 03:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
Medicine we do not receive lawsuits from
 
03:16:03.370 --> 03:16:03.380 align:start position:0%
the court involving other professions
 
03:16:07.730 --> 03:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
when we receive those lawsuits that is
 
03:16:11.090 --> 03:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
considered a complaint we treat them as
 
03:16:13.670 --> 03:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
such meaning that the
 
03:16:15.530 --> 03:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
um it goes through the investigative
 
03:16:19.010 --> 03:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
process and if there ends up being
 
03:16:21.889 --> 03:16:21.899 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action taken at that time
 
03:16:26.389 --> 03:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:28.849 --> 03:16:28.859 align:start position:0%
let me clarify that you get information
 
03:16:32.269 --> 03:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
from the courts about lawsuits that is
 
03:16:36.170 --> 03:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
not posted correct only if anything from
 
03:16:39.769 --> 03:16:39.779 align:start position:0%
the lawsuits becomes disciplinary action
 
03:16:42.290 --> 03:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
correct and who disciplines
 
03:16:44.330 --> 03:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
the board the Board of Medicine correct
 
03:16:48.050 --> 03:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
okay so then theoretically
 
03:16:49.730 --> 03:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
um there could be all kinds of lawsuits
 
03:16:52.190 --> 03:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
settled out of court that you don't hear
 
03:16:54.230 --> 03:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
about and because you're not working on
 
03:16:55.790 --> 03:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
different rules you're working on these
 
03:16:55.800 --> 03:16:57.230 align:start position:0%
different rules you're working on these
rules

03:16:57.230 --> 03:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
rules
 
03:17:00.050 --> 03:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
um we don't
 
03:17:02.269 --> 03:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
we don't hear about them
 
03:17:04.910 --> 03:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
well we do also query the National
 
03:17:06.830 --> 03:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
Practitioner Data Bank we are required
 
03:17:09.190 --> 03:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
to do so under federal law
 
03:17:14.269 --> 03:17:14.279 align:start position:0%
and that uh that tells us whether or not
 
03:17:17.389 --> 03:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
there's been a malpractice payout
 
03:17:19.849 --> 03:17:19.859 align:start position:0%
um basically an insurance claim and so
 
03:17:23.210 --> 03:17:23.220 align:start position:0%
we treat those as complaints as well
 
03:17:25.969 --> 03:17:25.979 align:start position:0%
um when we either query or we receive
 
03:17:27.590 --> 03:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
notice from the National Practitioner
 
03:17:29.990 --> 03:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
Data Bank of a payout
 
03:17:32.510 --> 03:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
um it is treated as a complaint it's
 
03:17:33.950 --> 03:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
investigated pursuant to the
 
03:17:36.050 --> 03:17:36.060 align:start position:0%
investigative procedures and if it
 
03:17:38.210 --> 03:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
results in a notice of hearing it gets
 
03:17:40.250 --> 03:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
reported as such
 
03:17:44.030 --> 03:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:46.130 --> 03:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
I think you just answered my question
 
03:17:48.170 --> 03:17:48.180 align:start position:0%
but I want to be sure I have it correct
 
03:17:48.180 --> 03:17:50.389 align:start position:0%
but I want to be sure I have it correct
so

03:17:50.389 --> 03:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:17:54.769 --> 03:17:54.779 align:start position:0%
a simple payout does never arises to the
 
03:17:58.370 --> 03:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
level of something that gets noticed but
 
03:18:00.710 --> 03:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
it may trigger
 
03:18:05.269 --> 03:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
a hearing on whether actual disciplinary
 
03:18:07.490 --> 03:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
action is needed is have I got that the
 
03:18:10.790 --> 03:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
right way around yes and the theory
 
03:18:12.950 --> 03:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
behind that is that the justification
 
03:18:17.210 --> 03:18:17.220 align:start position:0%
for taking action in a licensure case is
 
03:18:19.550 --> 03:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
different than a malpractice case and
 
03:18:21.290 --> 03:18:21.300 align:start position:0%
malpractice is generally concerned with
 
03:18:24.230 --> 03:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
negligence the boards typically from an
 
03:18:25.969 --> 03:18:25.979 align:start position:0%
ethical standpoint only act if it's
 
03:18:28.010 --> 03:18:28.020 align:start position:0%
gross negligence or there are specific
 
03:18:29.929 --> 03:18:29.939 align:start position:0%
violations of their ethical code or
 
03:18:32.030 --> 03:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
their practice act and so just because
 
03:18:35.389 --> 03:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
there has been a payout which
 
03:18:37.250 --> 03:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
may or may not mean that there was
 
03:18:39.710 --> 03:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
negligence that does not necessarily
 
03:18:41.410 --> 03:18:41.420 align:start position:0%
translate to
 
03:18:44.030 --> 03:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
justification for abort disciplinary
 
03:18:45.410 --> 03:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
decision so there needs to be that
 
03:18:47.570 --> 03:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
case-by-case analysis and that is that
 
03:18:50.150 --> 03:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
is done by the board okay thank you
 
03:18:51.650 --> 03:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
given that
 
03:18:53.630 --> 03:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
um could you speak to the fact that
 
03:18:57.170 --> 03:18:57.180 align:start position:0%
there were none of the 20 items that
 
03:18:58.969 --> 03:18:58.979 align:start position:0%
were reported in Massachusetts were
 
03:19:00.670 --> 03:19:00.680 align:start position:0%
reported in New Hampshire
 
03:19:05.090 --> 03:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
what should one infer from that I I
 
03:19:07.610 --> 03:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
can't speak to any
 
03:19:10.250 --> 03:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
um investigative information all I can
 
03:19:11.950 --> 03:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
tell you is that
 
03:19:14.570 --> 03:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
that absence means that the board did
 
03:19:16.130 --> 03:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
not take disciplinary
 
03:19:17.929 --> 03:19:17.939 align:start position:0%
did not have a disciplinary decision
 
03:19:20.210 --> 03:19:20.220 align:start position:0%
that was reportable
 
03:19:24.889 --> 03:19:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:24.899 --> 03:19:26.570 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:19:26.570 --> 03:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:28.610 --> 03:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
I'll fill the clerk's job if you want to
 
03:19:30.429 --> 03:19:30.439 align:start position:0%
fill the Chairman's jobs not fair enough
 
03:19:35.030 --> 03:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:38.590 --> 03:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:40.630 --> 03:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
yes you may
 
03:19:43.969 --> 03:19:43.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr secretary chair
 
03:19:43.979 --> 03:19:44.630 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr secretary chair
um

03:19:44.630 --> 03:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:48.290 --> 03:19:48.300 align:start position:0%
okay so I I I want to come back to the
 
03:19:50.990 --> 03:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
one example that's been in the media uh
 
03:19:54.230 --> 03:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
and uh as the chair is reported there
 
03:19:56.750 --> 03:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
were 20 incidences reported by the
 
03:19:59.690 --> 03:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Board of Medicine and and
 
03:20:03.050 --> 03:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
zero by us and based on the the
 
03:20:05.510 --> 03:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
algorithm you gave us on how they become
 
03:20:09.769 --> 03:20:09.779 align:start position:0%
reportable uh by our board uh it seems
 
03:20:11.330 --> 03:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
to me like
 
03:20:13.429 --> 03:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
um the assumption
 
03:20:17.030 --> 03:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
is that even that that we knew about all
 
03:20:19.490 --> 03:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
of them and that there were no surprises
 
03:20:22.370 --> 03:20:22.380 align:start position:0%
because we knew about all of them that
 
03:20:25.550 --> 03:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
there were some preliminary inquiry into
 
03:20:27.050 --> 03:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
each of them
 
03:20:29.510 --> 03:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
that based on the preliminary inquiry
 
03:20:32.809 --> 03:20:32.819 align:start position:0%
there was an active decision to not do a
 
03:20:36.050 --> 03:20:36.060 align:start position:0%
full investigation or if there had been
 
03:20:39.110 --> 03:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
a full investigation we concluded that
 
03:20:41.269 --> 03:20:41.279 align:start position:0%
there was no gross negligence or no
 
03:20:44.110 --> 03:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
violation of ethical
 
03:20:48.410 --> 03:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
standards and therefore not reportable
 
03:20:51.290 --> 03:20:51.300 align:start position:0%
now the reason I I broke it down so
 
03:20:54.110 --> 03:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
specifically is because I'm just trying
 
03:20:57.349 --> 03:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
to um in the management world we call it
 
03:21:00.290 --> 03:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
an audit you know just walk through did
 
03:21:03.469 --> 03:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
we comply with our own procedures in a
 
03:21:05.450 --> 03:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
given case and so this is a bit of a
 
03:21:07.910 --> 03:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
management audit question for you
 
03:21:10.969 --> 03:21:10.979 align:start position:0%
certainly and it's a valid question I
 
03:21:13.790 --> 03:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
think one of the issues that I think has
 
03:21:15.950 --> 03:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
been raised regarding transparency is I
 
03:21:18.590 --> 03:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
cannot reveal any information regarding
 
03:21:21.110 --> 03:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
the investigative process specific to
 
03:21:22.490 --> 03:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
the cases that were mentioned in the
 
03:21:24.769 --> 03:21:24.779 align:start position:0%
Boston Globe because it is considered
 
03:21:26.929 --> 03:21:26.939 align:start position:0%
confidential and there were no public
 
03:21:30.170 --> 03:21:30.180 align:start position:0%
decisions uh rendered and so when we
 
03:21:31.670 --> 03:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
talk about transparency that's something
 
03:21:33.410 --> 03:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
that the committee may wish to consider
 
03:21:35.750 --> 03:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
is there a middle point at which
 
03:21:38.870 --> 03:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
information can be publicly shared
 
03:21:41.630 --> 03:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
um because without that we're we're not
 
03:21:44.210 --> 03:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
permitted to disclose the information
 
03:21:47.630 --> 03:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:47.640 --> 03:21:49.490 align:start position:0%
 
oh

03:21:49.490 --> 03:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:21:51.290 --> 03:21:51.300 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:21:51.300 --> 03:21:52.130 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

03:21:52.130 --> 03:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:54.410 --> 03:21:54.420 align:start position:0%
I I can understand that
 
03:21:54.420 --> 03:21:55.070 align:start position:0%
I I can understand that
um

03:21:55.070 --> 03:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:57.590 --> 03:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm just trying to figure out how
 
03:21:59.809 --> 03:21:59.819 align:start position:0%
the the people of New Hampshire can be
 
03:22:04.130 --> 03:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that and so uh is it
 
03:22:08.809 --> 03:22:08.819 align:start position:0%
um possible to ask you to go back and
 
03:22:11.210 --> 03:22:11.220 align:start position:0%
audit yourself your your own board
 
03:22:14.090 --> 03:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
procedures go through it in the steps
 
03:22:15.769 --> 03:22:15.779 align:start position:0%
that I just laid out and I can repeat
 
03:22:18.230 --> 03:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
them I think but
 
03:22:23.210 --> 03:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
um and then if you find that there was a
 
03:22:25.730 --> 03:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
breakdown at some point then you could
 
03:22:29.150 --> 03:22:29.160 align:start position:0%
undergo actions to self-repair
 
03:22:32.450 --> 03:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
absolutely we can definitely take that
 
03:22:35.330 --> 03:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
um back and take those actions
 
03:22:35.340 --> 03:22:37.010 align:start position:0%
um back and take those actions
um

03:22:37.010 --> 03:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:38.750 --> 03:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
what we what we wouldn't be able to do
 
03:22:41.030 --> 03:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
is report on the findings but we can we
 
03:22:42.650 --> 03:22:42.660 align:start position:0%
can certainly do that analysis
 
03:22:45.050 --> 03:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
internally but but what would be
 
03:22:46.969 --> 03:22:46.979 align:start position:0%
reportable is if you went back through
 
03:22:49.790 --> 03:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
all those steps and you went oh darn we
 
03:22:53.030 --> 03:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
missed one and now this one needs to be
 
03:22:54.710 --> 03:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
publicly reported then we would know
 
03:22:56.690 --> 03:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
that you're publicly reporting it after
 
03:22:59.690 --> 03:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
the fact so there would at least be some
 
03:23:02.389 --> 03:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
awareness of whether or not your
 
03:23:06.110 --> 03:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
internal management audit revealed you
 
03:23:09.110 --> 03:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
messed up maybe or somebody
 
03:23:09.120 --> 03:23:11.090 align:start position:0%
messed up maybe or somebody
right

03:23:11.090 --> 03:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:23:14.510 --> 03:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
yes if you go back and it is in
 
03:23:16.370 --> 03:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
retrospect should have been publicly
 
03:23:19.490 --> 03:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
reportable and you will still report it
 
03:23:23.450 --> 03:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
publicly and that would let us know that
 
03:23:26.030 --> 03:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
your self-audit came up with something I
 
03:23:28.130 --> 03:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
can assure you that we have reported
 
03:23:30.170 --> 03:23:30.180 align:start position:0%
everything that could be reported
 
03:23:32.929 --> 03:23:32.939 align:start position:0%
that we have done that analysis
 
03:23:35.870 --> 03:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
you've done it you're okay well that's
 
03:23:38.210 --> 03:23:38.220 align:start position:0%
big news right there thank you so the
 
03:23:39.410 --> 03:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
question is
 
03:23:41.990 --> 03:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
how much should be reported I think that
 
03:23:45.050 --> 03:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
is I think that is the open question
 
03:23:47.150 --> 03:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
um and oplc doesn't take a position on
 
03:23:47.160 --> 03:23:48.710 align:start position:0%
um and oplc doesn't take a position on
that

03:23:48.710 --> 03:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:23:50.690 --> 03:23:50.700 align:start position:0%
obviously there are significant
 
03:23:53.389 --> 03:23:53.399 align:start position:0%
constraints with what we can report now
 
03:23:56.690 --> 03:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
um many of our boards if I may take a
 
03:23:58.790 --> 03:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
process just during an investigation
 
03:24:01.309 --> 03:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
where they receive a complaint
 
03:24:04.130 --> 03:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
they do an initial inquiry that
 
03:24:06.650 --> 03:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
typically includes receiving a response
 
03:24:08.650 --> 03:24:08.660 align:start position:0%
from the licensee
 
03:24:11.090 --> 03:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
and they make a decision as to whether
 
03:24:12.650 --> 03:24:12.660 align:start position:0%
or not the complaint is essentially
 
03:24:14.510 --> 03:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
facially valid
 
03:24:17.030 --> 03:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
and warrants a formal investigation if
 
03:24:19.010 --> 03:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
there is a formal investigation most
 
03:24:20.929 --> 03:24:20.939 align:start position:0%
boards will issue an order of formal
 
03:24:24.410 --> 03:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
investigation so that's a middle
 
03:24:24.420 --> 03:24:25.370 align:start position:0%
investigation so that's a middle
um

03:24:25.370 --> 03:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:28.190 --> 03:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
point in the investigative process and
 
03:24:29.809 --> 03:24:29.819 align:start position:0%
the boards will outline what needs to be
 
03:24:32.090 --> 03:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
investigated and what the concerns could
 
03:24:35.090 --> 03:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
be from an investigative standpoint
 
03:24:37.550 --> 03:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
um one thing the state could consider is
 
03:24:39.769 --> 03:24:39.779 align:start position:0%
whether or not those orders of formal
 
03:24:41.630 --> 03:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
investigation should be made public
 
03:24:46.550 --> 03:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
because that would protect those initial
 
03:24:48.290 --> 03:24:48.300 align:start position:0%
complaints that are deemed frivolous
 
03:24:50.950 --> 03:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
that don't warrant an actual
 
03:24:50.960 --> 03:24:52.630 align:start position:0%
that don't warrant an actual
investigation

03:24:52.630 --> 03:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
03:24:55.070 --> 03:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
but then also put the public on notice
 
03:24:57.590 --> 03:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
when there is an order of formal
 
03:25:00.110 --> 03:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
investigation that is something that I
 
03:25:01.910 --> 03:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
think the state could could consider
 
03:25:04.309 --> 03:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
we're not taking a position on that
 
03:25:06.349 --> 03:25:06.359 align:start position:0%
um but that I just wanted the committee
 
03:25:08.269 --> 03:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
to be aware of the the process in which
 
03:25:09.710 --> 03:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
an investigation
 
03:25:09.720 --> 03:25:10.429 align:start position:0%
an investigation
um

03:25:10.429 --> 03:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:13.389 --> 03:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
flows follow up
 
03:25:16.070 --> 03:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's interesting to me the that
 
03:25:18.530 --> 03:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
that we could report on when there's a
 
03:25:20.150 --> 03:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
formal investigation that's been
 
03:25:22.910 --> 03:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
launched uh I would be reluctant to
 
03:25:28.130 --> 03:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
release that unless or until rather it
 
03:25:30.429 --> 03:25:30.439 align:start position:0%
got uh resolved and then we could
 
03:25:33.590 --> 03:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
simultaneously say that there was an
 
03:25:35.630 --> 03:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
investigation and the official
 
03:25:39.769 --> 03:25:39.779 align:start position:0%
conclusion was no no harm no foul or we
 
03:25:42.889 --> 03:25:42.899 align:start position:0%
we've we're following it up and and that
 
03:25:46.790 --> 03:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
is because uh of the implication of
 
03:25:49.010 --> 03:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
being under a formal investigation just
 
03:25:50.570 --> 03:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
the implication alone you're already
 
03:25:54.170 --> 03:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
guilty in the mind of many and I I don't
 
03:25:58.010 --> 03:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
know that that would be fair I I what so
 
03:25:59.750 --> 03:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
what are your what are your thoughts on
 
03:26:04.190 --> 03:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
maybe uh holding off on reporting a
 
03:26:07.130 --> 03:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
formal investigation until the it had
 
03:26:09.050 --> 03:26:09.060 align:start position:0%
come to a formal conclusion that could
 
03:26:11.929 --> 03:26:11.939 align:start position:0%
also be reported simultaneously
 
03:26:14.330 --> 03:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
so again we're not taking the agency
 
03:26:16.190 --> 03:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't take a position from a policy
 
03:26:17.750 --> 03:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
standpoint on what should be reported
 
03:26:19.250 --> 03:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
but I will say that is the current
 
03:26:21.110 --> 03:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
process we have now
 
03:26:23.990 --> 03:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
um it we report when a notice appearing
 
03:26:26.570 --> 03:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
is issued which basically
 
03:26:28.790 --> 03:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
admits that there has acknowledges that
 
03:26:30.950 --> 03:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
there has been an investigation that the
 
03:26:32.450 --> 03:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
board has decided to proceed with
 
03:26:34.790 --> 03:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action even if after
 
03:26:36.950 --> 03:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
hearing the case is dismissed that
 
03:26:38.690 --> 03:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
notice of hearing is public and it's
 
03:26:41.269 --> 03:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
posted so that is the current system
 
03:26:43.670 --> 03:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
that we have now and it's probably you
 
03:26:43.680 --> 03:26:44.809 align:start position:0%
that we have now and it's probably you
know

03:26:44.809 --> 03:26:44.819 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:26:46.610 --> 03:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
because of some of the concerns that you
 
03:26:46.620 --> 03:26:48.889 align:start position:0%
because of some of the concerns that you
raised

03:26:48.889 --> 03:26:48.899 align:start position:0%
raised
 
03:26:51.950 --> 03:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
you're on a roll okay so I I just
 
03:26:54.469 --> 03:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
declarified if you if you've done a
 
03:26:56.750 --> 03:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
formal investigation and you decide that
 
03:26:59.090 --> 03:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
there's no further review required and
 
03:27:01.490 --> 03:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
you stop the formal investigation with
 
03:27:05.269 --> 03:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
no conclusion that the fact that you had
 
03:27:07.969 --> 03:27:07.979 align:start position:0%
a formal investigation is not reportable
 
03:27:10.729 --> 03:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
is it do you report that now we don't
 
03:27:13.969 --> 03:27:13.979 align:start position:0%
report it unless the board's decision is
 
03:27:15.229 --> 03:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
that they would like to pursue
 
03:27:17.210 --> 03:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
discipline right but if there is no
 
03:27:19.490 --> 03:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
correct Pursuit then there's nothing
 
03:27:21.889 --> 03:27:21.899 align:start position:0%
ever reported on the fact that a formal
 
03:27:24.050 --> 03:27:24.060 align:start position:0%
investigation was opened
 
03:27:26.030 --> 03:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
that even the fact that there was a
 
03:27:27.590 --> 03:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
formal investigation is not reported
 
03:27:29.809 --> 03:27:29.819 align:start position:0%
nothing is reported good I'm just I'm
 
03:27:31.250 --> 03:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
not trying to argue I'm just trying to
 
03:27:33.590 --> 03:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
understand the you know when the
 
03:27:36.229 --> 03:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
switches get thrown absolutely I have a
 
03:27:38.510 --> 03:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
question before I do anyone in the
 
03:27:42.349 --> 03:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
audience who wishes to testify uh we
 
03:27:44.150 --> 03:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
have these pink cards up here that you
 
03:27:47.330 --> 03:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
need to fill out and pass along up if
 
03:27:49.969 --> 03:27:49.979 align:start position:0%
it's in your hand it doesn't exist in my
 
03:27:52.190 --> 03:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
site so bring them on down or pass them
 
03:27:55.130 --> 03:27:55.140 align:start position:0%
all down and the
 
03:27:57.710 --> 03:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
blue sheep representative Solway is for
 
03:27:57.720 --> 03:28:01.490 align:start position:0%
blue sheep representative Solway is for
what

03:28:01.490 --> 03:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:01.500 --> 03:28:06.830 align:start position:0%
 
what

03:28:06.830 --> 03:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:10.370 --> 03:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
those visiting the hearings to register
 
03:28:13.550 --> 03:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
their name affiliation and whether they
 
03:28:15.290 --> 03:28:15.300 align:start position:0%
support or do not support
 
03:28:20.870 --> 03:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:25.130 --> 03:28:25.140 align:start position:0%
with that uh yes yes uh representative
 
03:28:25.140 --> 03:28:27.190 align:start position:0%
with that uh yes yes uh representative
Murphy

03:28:27.190 --> 03:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
Murphy
 
03:28:31.729 --> 03:28:31.739 align:start position:0%
thank you um I just wanted to clarify
 
03:28:31.739 --> 03:28:32.750 align:start position:0%
thank you um I just wanted to clarify
um

03:28:32.750 --> 03:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:35.690 --> 03:28:35.700 align:start position:0%
and you were you said you were required
 
03:28:39.530 --> 03:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
by federal law to uh query the national
 
03:28:41.750 --> 03:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
provider Data Bank practitioner databank
 
03:28:43.250 --> 03:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
is that correct that's correct that's
 
03:28:46.550 --> 03:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
not a state statute no I believe it's a
 
03:28:48.349 --> 03:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
federal law obviously there's enabling
 
03:28:50.269 --> 03:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
statute but it's it's detailed in some
 
03:28:51.650 --> 03:28:51.660 align:start position:0%
federal regulations
 
03:28:53.809 --> 03:28:53.819 align:start position:0%
the article I read referenced the fact
 
03:28:55.370 --> 03:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
that as a result of the healthcare
 
03:28:58.370 --> 03:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
quality improvement Act of 86 hospitals
 
03:29:00.229 --> 03:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
are required to
 
03:29:02.870 --> 03:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
query that data bank but you know states
 
03:29:04.610 --> 03:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
are not State and medical boards are not
 
03:29:05.929 --> 03:29:05.939 align:start position:0%
required to do so and they they
 
03:29:07.969 --> 03:29:07.979 align:start position:0%
suggested that simply that a lot of
 
03:29:10.610 --> 03:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
states don't query it so you say we are
 
03:29:13.370 --> 03:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
one that does query it we are and there
 
03:29:16.790 --> 03:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
are I think there are three regs at
 
03:29:18.290 --> 03:29:18.300 align:start position:0%
issue I apologize they don't have them
 
03:29:21.349 --> 03:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
memorized that touch upon when you're
 
03:29:22.790 --> 03:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
required to query when you're not
 
03:29:24.650 --> 03:29:24.660 align:start position:0%
required to query the board of dental
 
03:29:26.450 --> 03:29:26.460 align:start position:0%
examiners and the Board of Medicine are
 
03:29:28.250 --> 03:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
required to query and we do query for
 
03:29:30.050 --> 03:29:30.060 align:start position:0%
those two boards
 
03:29:32.090 --> 03:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
um and then obviously there's a
 
03:29:35.769 --> 03:29:35.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:38.090 --> 03:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
my other question relates to the fact
 
03:29:39.950 --> 03:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
that it seems like there may be and you
 
03:29:42.290 --> 03:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
would know better than I you know as
 
03:29:43.550 --> 03:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
03:29:47.090 --> 03:29:47.100 align:start position:0%
um Medical Board and also the um uh
 
03:29:49.010 --> 03:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
credentialing or you know privileging
 
03:29:51.769 --> 03:29:51.779 align:start position:0%
and you know licensing board
 
03:29:53.929 --> 03:29:53.939 align:start position:0%
where do we where do you think we stand
 
03:29:57.290 --> 03:29:57.300 align:start position:0%
relative to other states with regard to
 
03:30:01.210 --> 03:30:01.220 align:start position:0%
regulatory oversight of the process of
 
03:30:04.670 --> 03:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
Licensing you know providers meaning we
 
03:30:07.010 --> 03:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
feel it lacks do we have very few
 
03:30:10.090 --> 03:30:10.100 align:start position:0%
regulations controlling the licensing of
 
03:30:13.910 --> 03:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
providers or are we very restrictive in
 
03:30:15.889 --> 03:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
many ways where do we fall in that
 
03:30:17.269 --> 03:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
spectrum is my I'm trying to understand
 
03:30:18.590 --> 03:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
where we are
 
03:30:20.210 --> 03:30:20.220 align:start position:0%
so I think that would depend on the
 
03:30:20.220 --> 03:30:21.590 align:start position:0%
so I think that would depend on the
profession

03:30:21.590 --> 03:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
profession
 
03:30:25.130 --> 03:30:25.140 align:start position:0%
um we're in medicine then well
 
03:30:27.590 --> 03:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not really in a position to comment
 
03:30:29.750 --> 03:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
on that because my job is to provide
 
03:30:31.969 --> 03:30:31.979 align:start position:0%
administrative support I would defer to
 
03:30:34.130 --> 03:30:34.140 align:start position:0%
Dr Baker who I know is here
 
03:30:36.969 --> 03:30:36.979 align:start position:0%
um who can comment on that um
 
03:30:40.010 --> 03:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
as I'm not a member of the profession so
 
03:30:43.670 --> 03:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
I from a licensing standpoint I can't
 
03:30:45.050 --> 03:30:45.060 align:start position:0%
um comment
 
03:30:48.889 --> 03:30:48.899 align:start position:0%
so just so just to be clear your role
 
03:30:48.899 --> 03:30:50.229 align:start position:0%
so just so just to be clear your role
the

03:30:50.229 --> 03:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:30:52.910 --> 03:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
your your arm of it is basically an
 
03:30:54.349 --> 03:30:54.359 align:start position:0%
administrative support for all the
 
03:30:55.790 --> 03:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
multiple boards
 
03:30:57.530 --> 03:30:57.540 align:start position:0%
and it's the board of medicine's
 
03:30:59.630 --> 03:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility to issue the license and
 
03:31:01.670 --> 03:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
then recertify a license going forward
 
03:31:03.530 --> 03:31:03.540 align:start position:0%
every two years which we always did is
 
03:31:04.849 --> 03:31:04.859 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
03:31:06.889 --> 03:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
correct although I will say that the
 
03:31:09.889 --> 03:31:09.899 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine like most boards has
 
03:31:09.899 --> 03:31:11.450 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine like most boards has
delegated

03:31:11.450 --> 03:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
delegated
 
03:31:13.610 --> 03:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
certain tasks to the agency such as
 
03:31:16.729 --> 03:31:16.739 align:start position:0%
renewals issuing licenses
 
03:31:19.729 --> 03:31:19.739 align:start position:0%
in between board meetings they'll go on
 
03:31:22.790 --> 03:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
a consent agenda a lot of Licensing
 
03:31:24.830 --> 03:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
boards have delegated that to our office
 
03:31:27.710 --> 03:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
if it is objective criteria but yes my
 
03:31:29.690 --> 03:31:29.700 align:start position:0%
job is to oversee the administrative
 
03:31:31.309 --> 03:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
support to all of the licensing boards
 
03:31:33.349 --> 03:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
which would include posting information
 
03:31:35.269 --> 03:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
online and working with the Department
 
03:31:36.950 --> 03:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
of Information Technology to make sure
 
03:31:39.769 --> 03:31:39.779 align:start position:0%
that we have a portal and interface with
 
03:31:40.929 --> 03:31:40.939 align:start position:0%
the appropriate
 
03:31:43.370 --> 03:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
websites in order to make reporting
 
03:31:46.370 --> 03:31:46.380 align:start position:0%
happen great thank you you're welcome
 
03:31:49.790 --> 03:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
who decides how
 
03:31:49.800 --> 03:31:51.170 align:start position:0%
who decides how
something

03:31:51.170 --> 03:31:51.180 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:31:53.510 --> 03:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
is to
 
03:31:56.630 --> 03:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
to proceed in terms of Investigations is
 
03:31:59.630 --> 03:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
that something each board decides and
 
03:32:02.269 --> 03:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
then you as an administrative arm carry
 
03:32:03.349 --> 03:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
that out
 
03:32:05.269 --> 03:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
what can you decide
 
03:32:07.550 --> 03:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh no all of the authority to
 
03:32:10.030 --> 03:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
investigate and to
 
03:32:12.349 --> 03:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
conduct disciplinary proceedings
 
03:32:14.690 --> 03:32:14.700 align:start position:0%
generally resides with the licensing
 
03:32:16.790 --> 03:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
boards the
 
03:32:19.309 --> 03:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine is unique because they
 
03:32:20.809 --> 03:32:20.819 align:start position:0%
have the medical review subcommittee
 
03:32:23.690 --> 03:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
which is a creature of Statute there are
 
03:32:25.190 --> 03:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
Physicians and public members who are
 
03:32:26.929 --> 03:32:26.939 align:start position:0%
appointed by governor and Council to
 
03:32:30.650 --> 03:32:30.660 align:start position:0%
serve on that and they are essentially
 
03:32:32.929 --> 03:32:32.939 align:start position:0%
an investigative arm of the Board of
 
03:32:34.729 --> 03:32:34.739 align:start position:0%
Medicine to assist the Board of Medicine
 
03:32:38.030 --> 03:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
with the investigative process we
 
03:32:40.429 --> 03:32:40.439 align:start position:0%
provide administrative support
 
03:32:42.410 --> 03:32:42.420 align:start position:0%
um but ultimately the decisions reside
 
03:32:45.889 --> 03:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:47.929 --> 03:32:47.939 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions yeah
 
03:32:49.969 --> 03:32:49.979 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards okay I'm going to
 
03:32:51.889 --> 03:32:51.899 align:start position:0%
shift on you a little bit uh since you
 
03:32:55.070 --> 03:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned websites and
 
03:32:57.650 --> 03:32:57.660 align:start position:0%
um the person who who came up with all
 
03:33:00.769 --> 03:33:00.779 align:start position:0%
this documentation works for legislative
 
03:33:03.889 --> 03:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
services and he did a great job Mr
 
03:33:05.870 --> 03:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
Richard Latham and so I want to thank
 
03:33:08.090 --> 03:33:08.100 align:start position:0%
him for that but I I want to just share
 
03:33:11.269 --> 03:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
with you his observation as he was going
 
03:33:13.490 --> 03:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
to get this information from various
 
03:33:16.429 --> 03:33:16.439 align:start position:0%
States websites he loved the main
 
03:33:18.889 --> 03:33:18.899 align:start position:0%
website he said it was beautifully laid
 
03:33:23.150 --> 03:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
out it was easy to navigate and and he
 
03:33:25.429 --> 03:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
thought Massachusetts and Vermont also
 
03:33:28.790 --> 03:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
had very nice websites
 
03:33:32.330 --> 03:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
I I I I I I I I think we may have come
 
03:33:34.550 --> 03:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
in forth in that beauty contest though
 
03:33:37.010 --> 03:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
do you do you have any insight about
 
03:33:40.309 --> 03:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
what we're doing to upgrade our our web
 
03:33:40.319 --> 03:33:40.969 align:start position:0%
what we're doing to upgrade our our web
um

03:33:40.969 --> 03:33:40.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:46.070 --> 03:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
what the public portion of our web yes
 
03:33:48.530 --> 03:33:48.540 align:start position:0%
um as you know doit
 
03:33:50.510 --> 03:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
essentially controls that part of the
 
03:33:52.610 --> 03:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
process oplc was one of the first
 
03:33:55.309 --> 03:33:55.319 align:start position:0%
agencies when the state received
 
03:33:57.650 --> 03:33:57.660 align:start position:0%
um some additional Federal funding to
 
03:33:59.630 --> 03:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
upgrade its website um
 
03:34:03.290 --> 03:34:03.300 align:start position:0%
the issue that I see that is of most
 
03:34:05.809 --> 03:34:05.819 align:start position:0%
significance to the agency is the
 
03:34:07.729 --> 03:34:07.739 align:start position:0%
licensing portal
 
03:34:10.550 --> 03:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
um it's extremely outdated I want to say
 
03:34:13.550 --> 03:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
it's about 15 years old the contract is
 
03:34:16.849 --> 03:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
slated to expire very shortly
 
03:34:20.330 --> 03:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
um it's uh it breaks all the time I
 
03:34:22.370 --> 03:34:22.380 align:start position:0%
can't run reports until after my staff
 
03:34:26.110 --> 03:34:26.120 align:start position:0%
leave because it will crash the system
 
03:34:29.090 --> 03:34:29.100 align:start position:0%
to make any changes in the system
 
03:34:32.389 --> 03:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
requires that I reach out to a part-time
 
03:34:34.250 --> 03:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
contractor for the Department of
 
03:34:36.830 --> 03:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
Information Technology who only works a
 
03:34:38.229 --> 03:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
couple days a week
 
03:34:41.290 --> 03:34:41.300 align:start position:0%
it's is a broken process
 
03:34:41.300 --> 03:34:42.950 align:start position:0%
it's is a broken process
we

03:34:42.950 --> 03:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:34:44.929 --> 03:34:44.939 align:start position:0%
um we have identity we identified this
 
03:34:46.550 --> 03:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
as an issue years ago
 
03:34:48.830 --> 03:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
um when I first came on board
 
03:34:52.250 --> 03:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
um we are working actively with the doit
 
03:34:55.190 --> 03:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
to procure a new solution
 
03:34:57.530 --> 03:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
um the state did just receive a 3.4
 
03:35:00.710 --> 03:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars in arpa funding for this
 
03:35:02.510 --> 03:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh purpose
 
03:35:05.210 --> 03:35:05.220 align:start position:0%
um that will hopefully allow us to
 
03:35:08.389 --> 03:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
obtain a portal that is a little bit
 
03:35:08.399 --> 03:35:09.010 align:start position:0%
obtain a portal that is a little bit
um

03:35:09.010 --> 03:35:09.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:11.870 --> 03:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
similar to Maine and others that are
 
03:35:14.269 --> 03:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
that are just better capable of
 
03:35:17.630 --> 03:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
providing access to information but I'll
 
03:35:18.889 --> 03:35:18.899 align:start position:0%
tell you that
 
03:35:21.050 --> 03:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
the reason for the delay is because the
 
03:35:22.729 --> 03:35:22.739 align:start position:0%
agency can't control its own destiny
 
03:35:26.150 --> 03:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
with respect to I.T and I fully
 
03:35:28.309 --> 03:35:28.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate why we need an Enterprise
 
03:35:32.030 --> 03:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
solution for the state but you know that
 
03:35:34.790 --> 03:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
we have had funding we have the ability
 
03:35:36.229 --> 03:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
to fund
 
03:35:39.050 --> 03:35:39.060 align:start position:0%
um technology we are self-funded agency
 
03:35:42.050 --> 03:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
and it has it has added significant time
 
03:35:43.610 --> 03:35:43.620 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
03:35:46.309 --> 03:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
um work with agency partners
 
03:35:46.319 --> 03:35:47.150 align:start position:0%
um work with agency partners
um

03:35:47.150 --> 03:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:48.889 --> 03:35:48.899 align:start position:0%
basically because you have to convince
 
03:35:51.590 --> 03:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
them of the priorities so that's where
 
03:35:53.630 --> 03:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
we stand with regards to the licensing
 
03:35:57.170 --> 03:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
portal follow up sure so I I want to
 
03:35:59.030 --> 03:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that you just committed a
 
03:36:01.729 --> 03:36:01.739 align:start position:0%
grand Act of Candor and I really
 
03:36:04.309 --> 03:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate your your transparency given
 
03:36:06.590 --> 03:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
that is our theme I'm there would be
 
03:36:08.269 --> 03:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
people that would want to tap dance
 
03:36:10.429 --> 03:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
around the issue and I really appreciate
 
03:36:12.710 --> 03:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
that you are very clear thank you
 
03:36:15.229 --> 03:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative would you say a
 
03:36:18.229 --> 03:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
word or two about the parallel process
 
03:36:20.750 --> 03:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's underway and that is Senator
 
03:36:23.929 --> 03:36:23.939 align:start position:0%
Carson's chairing of a committee out of
 
03:36:26.929 --> 03:36:26.939 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 330 which I believe has to
 
03:36:30.769 --> 03:36:30.779 align:start position:0%
do with oplc and various of the bureaus
 
03:36:33.769 --> 03:36:33.779 align:start position:0%
uh compare contrast to us
 
03:36:36.050 --> 03:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
yeah so the the objective really of that
 
03:36:38.809 --> 03:36:38.819 align:start position:0%
committee which came about a couple
 
03:36:41.150 --> 03:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
different pieces of legislation
 
03:36:42.590 --> 03:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
um That Was Then combined and Senate
 
03:36:47.030 --> 03:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 230. yes no 3 30. you're correct
 
03:36:47.040 --> 03:36:48.650 align:start position:0%
Bill 230. yes no 3 30. you're correct
representative

03:36:48.650 --> 03:36:48.660 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:36:51.469 --> 03:36:51.479 align:start position:0%
was really just to take a look at how
 
03:36:54.229 --> 03:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
oplc is functioning as it relates to the
 
03:36:54.239 --> 03:36:55.250 align:start position:0%
oplc is functioning as it relates to the
boards

03:36:55.250 --> 03:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
boards
 
03:36:57.830 --> 03:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
um my perspective is that oplc was
 
03:36:58.870 --> 03:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
created in
 
03:37:01.729 --> 03:37:01.739 align:start position:0%
2015. there was probably not a lot of
 
03:37:01.739 --> 03:37:03.769 align:start position:0%
2015. there was probably not a lot of
consensus

03:37:03.769 --> 03:37:03.779 align:start position:0%
consensus
 
03:37:05.150 --> 03:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the boards didn't want to
 
03:37:08.570 --> 03:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
participate in that initially we do have
 
03:37:10.309 --> 03:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
very good working relationships with the
 
03:37:12.469 --> 03:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
majority of boards now but it still
 
03:37:14.450 --> 03:37:14.460 align:start position:0%
remains clear what the oplc is supposed
 
03:37:16.070 --> 03:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
to do versus what the boards are
 
03:37:17.570 --> 03:37:17.580 align:start position:0%
supposed to do as it relates to
 
03:37:20.750 --> 03:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
Authority fees is a primary example of
 
03:37:23.150 --> 03:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
that so this committee was really
 
03:37:26.630 --> 03:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
supposed to help us assess where the
 
03:37:29.269 --> 03:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
authorities should lie and provide a
 
03:37:32.750 --> 03:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
clear directive to all of the agencies
 
03:37:35.210 --> 03:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
um moving forward
 
03:37:37.490 --> 03:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I I'm it's important
 
03:37:39.349 --> 03:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
that at least some of us know that
 
03:37:42.410 --> 03:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
because this is actively working and I'm
 
03:37:42.420 --> 03:37:43.370 align:start position:0%
because this is actively working and I'm
hoping

03:37:43.370 --> 03:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
hoping
 
03:37:46.010 --> 03:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
um we are hoping that conclusions we
 
03:37:48.349 --> 03:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
make will be shuffled over to them as
 
03:37:50.929 --> 03:37:50.939 align:start position:0%
our little word in thank you absolutely
 
03:37:55.130 --> 03:37:55.140 align:start position:0%
anyone else for Miss Courtney
 
03:37:56.870 --> 03:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you so much thank you
 
03:38:01.070 --> 03:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:04.670 --> 03:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
sure would like to call Dr David Conway
 
03:38:07.070 --> 03:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
to come up he's provided written
 
03:38:09.469 --> 03:38:09.479 align:start position:0%
testimony which I've scanned that looks
 
03:38:12.469 --> 03:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
very good he's an MD he's f-a-c-o-g
 
03:38:14.990 --> 03:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
fellow of the American College of
 
03:38:15.000 --> 03:38:17.889 align:start position:0%
fellow of the American College of
gynecology

03:38:17.889 --> 03:38:17.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:29.990 --> 03:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:32.090 --> 03:38:32.100 align:start position:0%
and then you hit the button to make it
 
03:38:32.100 --> 03:38:32.950 align:start position:0%
and then you hit the button to make it
red

03:38:32.950 --> 03:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
red
 
03:38:39.050 --> 03:38:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:39.060 --> 03:38:40.610 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:38:40.610 --> 03:38:40.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:38:41.990 --> 03:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to read through the
 
03:38:44.389 --> 03:38:44.399 align:start position:0%
entire sheet here could I ask you to be
 
03:38:46.370 --> 03:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
a little closer to the mic please
 
03:38:47.950 --> 03:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:38:51.469 --> 03:38:51.479 align:start position:0%
swallow it okay I didn't want to read
 
03:38:53.150 --> 03:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
through the entire statement I described
 
03:38:54.530 --> 03:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
some of my background when I was in
 
03:38:57.590 --> 03:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
practice I'm now retired I think what's
 
03:39:00.590 --> 03:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
important for the discussion today is
 
03:39:02.150 --> 03:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm speaking for myself I'm not
 
03:39:05.269 --> 03:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
speaking for the board I was a member of
 
03:39:07.910 --> 03:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
the mrsc the medical review subcommittee
 
03:39:10.670 --> 03:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
for six years the last two of which I
 
03:39:13.070 --> 03:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
was chairman I was a member of the Board
 
03:39:15.290 --> 03:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
of Medicine for six years the last year
 
03:39:18.170 --> 03:39:18.180 align:start position:0%
or so I was president of the board and I
 
03:39:20.090 --> 03:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
have since resigned from the board and
 
03:39:22.610 --> 03:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
am now the physician investigator for
 
03:39:24.110 --> 03:39:24.120 align:start position:0%
the board so I can speak to the
 
03:39:26.389 --> 03:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
investigative process in a fair amount
 
03:39:30.769 --> 03:39:30.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:32.570 --> 03:39:32.580 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing you're next to the last
 
03:39:34.969 --> 03:39:34.979 align:start position:0%
paragraph is one that really is most
 
03:39:38.389 --> 03:39:38.399 align:start position:0%
germane to our purpose here
 
03:39:38.399 --> 03:39:47.450 align:start position:0%
germane to our purpose here
yes

03:39:47.450 --> 03:39:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:49.490 --> 03:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
are there copies of the testimony
 
03:39:49.500 --> 03:39:51.050 align:start position:0%
are there copies of the testimony
available

03:39:51.050 --> 03:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
available
 
03:39:52.610 --> 03:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
or is that just something that was
 
03:39:54.349 --> 03:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
handed in this morning I'm sorry I
 
03:39:57.170 --> 03:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
printed two copies that's fine I just
 
03:39:58.610 --> 03:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
wondered if they were if they're not
 
03:39:59.990 --> 03:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
will no
 
03:40:02.990 --> 03:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
well we will get more copies for
 
03:40:03.000 --> 03:40:04.550 align:start position:0%
well we will get more copies for
everyone

03:40:04.550 --> 03:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
03:40:07.250 --> 03:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
um doctor if you could send an email
 
03:40:09.889 --> 03:40:09.899 align:start position:0%

03:40:15.590 --> 03:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
you a card okay so yes if you would
 
03:40:17.030 --> 03:40:17.040 align:start position:0%

03:40:17.040 --> 03:40:19.070 align:start position:0%
speak to the next to the last Powers
okay

03:40:19.070 --> 03:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:40:19.080 --> 03:40:24.889 align:start position:0%
okay
um

03:40:24.889 --> 03:40:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:26.990 --> 03:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
so that when information comes to the
 
03:40:30.290 --> 03:40:30.300 align:start position:0%
board thank you uh whether it be a
 
03:40:33.590 --> 03:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
Consumer complaint uh from
 
03:40:36.889 --> 03:40:36.899 align:start position:0%
um a member of the public whether it's a
 
03:40:39.410 --> 03:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
complaint from another licensee about a
 
03:40:39.420 --> 03:40:40.490 align:start position:0%
complaint from another licensee about a
licensee

03:40:40.490 --> 03:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
licensee
 
03:40:43.630 --> 03:40:43.640 align:start position:0%
whether it's the results of a lawsuit
 
03:40:47.050 --> 03:40:47.060 align:start position:0%
any kind of law enforcement involvement
 
03:40:50.150 --> 03:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
then an investigation has started
 
03:40:52.969 --> 03:40:52.979 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:40:55.910 --> 03:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
it can start with an initial review by
 
03:40:59.030 --> 03:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
the investigator there are investigators
 
03:41:02.870 --> 03:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
in the oplc as well as myself who look
 
03:41:05.090 --> 03:41:05.100 align:start position:0%
at it and if there is no merit to it
 
03:41:08.990 --> 03:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
it's no further action
 
03:41:13.429 --> 03:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
um if an investigation is indicated by
 
03:41:15.530 --> 03:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
that initial review and that initial
 
03:41:18.729 --> 03:41:18.739 align:start position:0%
review can sometimes look at whether
 
03:41:22.250 --> 03:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
a licensees practice is a threat to the
 
03:41:24.950 --> 03:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
public in which case a license can be
 
03:41:30.110 --> 03:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
suspended for 10 days pending a hearing
 
03:41:32.210 --> 03:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
um and pending the results of an
 
03:41:34.929 --> 03:41:34.939 align:start position:0%
investigation that happens occasionally
 
03:41:37.510 --> 03:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
but not often
 
03:41:40.429 --> 03:41:40.439 align:start position:0%
once an investigation has started a
 
03:41:42.590 --> 03:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
response is obtained from The Physician
 
03:41:45.550 --> 03:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
or like a physician's assistant
 
03:41:50.050 --> 03:41:50.060 align:start position:0%
as well as medical records and reviewed
 
03:41:54.110 --> 03:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
by the investigator and if it looks as
 
03:41:56.269 --> 03:41:56.279 align:start position:0%
if it needs to be further reviewed by
 
03:41:58.610 --> 03:41:58.620 align:start position:0%
their medical review subcommittee that
 
03:42:00.410 --> 03:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
information is forwarded to the
 
03:42:03.050 --> 03:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
committee to do an investigation
 
03:42:06.170 --> 03:42:06.180 align:start position:0%
results of the investigation can be one
 
03:42:08.510 --> 03:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
of several it can be found to be
 
03:42:11.210 --> 03:42:11.220 align:start position:0%
unfounded that it really does not fall
 
03:42:13.849 --> 03:42:13.859 align:start position:0%
under the statute that there is no
 
03:42:15.910 --> 03:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
further action
 
03:42:19.490 --> 03:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
that there's concern there are letters
 
03:42:24.110 --> 03:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
of concern that can be written where the
 
03:42:26.750 --> 03:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
statute has not been violated but that
 
03:42:28.490 --> 03:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
there is concern about the physician's
 
03:42:31.309 --> 03:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
practice or that the statute has been
 
03:42:36.110 --> 03:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
violated and the board has chosen
 
03:42:39.010 --> 03:42:39.020 align:start position:0%
um not to discipline and then finally
 
03:42:41.269 --> 03:42:41.279 align:start position:0%
there's the decision for recommendation
 
03:42:43.670 --> 03:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
of discipline and that's coming from the
 
03:42:45.710 --> 03:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
medical review subcommittee that
 
03:42:48.070 --> 03:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation and that review
 
03:42:51.469 --> 03:42:51.479 align:start position:0%
is then sent to the board to see if the
 
03:42:52.969 --> 03:42:52.979 align:start position:0%
board agrees with that recommendation
 
03:42:55.729 --> 03:42:55.739 align:start position:0%
and it's up to the board itself to then
 
03:42:58.250 --> 03:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
decide the action
 
03:43:01.070 --> 03:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
nothing becomes public unless it is a
 
03:43:04.370 --> 03:43:04.380 align:start position:0%
decision for discipline
 
03:43:05.929 --> 03:43:05.939 align:start position:0%
that if there's a decision for
 
03:43:09.229 --> 03:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
discipline then it comes down to either
 
03:43:11.870 --> 03:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
their their being a settlement between
 
03:43:16.910 --> 03:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
the board and the licensee or that
 
03:43:19.010 --> 03:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
there's a hearing and both of those
 
03:43:20.630 --> 03:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
become public and are listed on the
 
03:43:20.640 --> 03:43:29.090 align:start position:0%
become public and are listed on the
website

03:43:29.090 --> 03:43:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:33.170 --> 03:43:33.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Dr Conway I I I got a couple
 
03:43:35.090 --> 03:43:35.100 align:start position:0%
of questions at the Strategic level I
 
03:43:37.070 --> 03:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
want to make sure of the context and
 
03:43:38.870 --> 03:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
then I want to go down into the weeds
 
03:43:40.370 --> 03:43:40.380 align:start position:0%
with you to get your opinion on
 
03:43:40.380 --> 03:43:41.510 align:start position:0%
with you to get your opinion on
something

03:43:41.510 --> 03:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:43:41.520 --> 03:43:43.250 align:start position:0%
something
uh

03:43:43.250 --> 03:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:43:45.349 --> 03:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
for context
 
03:43:48.469 --> 03:43:48.479 align:start position:0%
um I well I I was I was a
 
03:43:51.290 --> 03:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
healthcare administrator for 45 years
 
03:43:54.110 --> 03:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
and so I was I'm just generally aware I
 
03:43:57.610 --> 03:43:57.620 align:start position:0%
think that the highest malpractice
 
03:44:02.030 --> 03:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
premiums are are found in OB GYN uh or
 
03:44:05.450 --> 03:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
or very it's very high up is that right
 
03:44:08.750 --> 03:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
it's in probably the top three and and
 
03:44:12.530 --> 03:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
is it the is it the case that the high
 
03:44:16.010 --> 03:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
insurance premiums May limit the number
 
03:44:18.110 --> 03:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
of people that will
 
03:44:20.570 --> 03:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
um serve in that area that they would
 
03:44:23.630 --> 03:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
seek something that isn't quite as uh
 
03:44:23.640 --> 03:44:25.190 align:start position:0%
seek something that isn't quite as uh
risky

03:44:25.190 --> 03:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
risky
 
03:44:28.670 --> 03:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
or or we have no shortage of Physicians
 
03:44:30.889 --> 03:44:30.899 align:start position:0%
because of the malpractice premium
 
03:44:32.630 --> 03:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there's a shortage I can't
 
03:44:34.370 --> 03:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
speak to that
 
03:44:37.610 --> 03:44:37.620 align:start position:0%
um I chose a very long time ago to go
 
03:44:40.370 --> 03:44:40.380 align:start position:0%
into obstetrics and
 
03:44:40.380 --> 03:44:41.090 align:start position:0%
into obstetrics and
um

03:44:41.090 --> 03:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:41.100 --> 03:44:42.530 align:start position:0%
um
that

03:44:42.530 --> 03:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:44:44.269 --> 03:44:44.279 align:start position:0%
I've said when I was working in the
 
03:44:46.010 --> 03:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
residency over Concord Hospital I would
 
03:44:49.130 --> 03:44:49.140 align:start position:0%
say to the residents that if you want a
 
03:44:50.870 --> 03:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
convenient practice if you don't want to
 
03:44:53.690 --> 03:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
take risk then you should go to
 
03:44:56.389 --> 03:44:56.399 align:start position:0%
Hannaford and check out groceries okay
 
03:44:58.429 --> 03:44:58.439 align:start position:0%
so so now I'm about to go into the weeds
 
03:45:00.229 --> 03:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
if I may
 
03:45:04.370 --> 03:45:04.380 align:start position:0%
um I I'm I'm exploring the thought
 
03:45:06.530 --> 03:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
um and it's a it's an ill-form thought
 
03:45:08.210 --> 03:45:08.220 align:start position:0%
at this point but I want to explore it
 
03:45:10.849 --> 03:45:10.859 align:start position:0%
with you of whether or not
 
03:45:14.750 --> 03:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
we should uh after an investigation has
 
03:45:17.750 --> 03:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
been open and there's a conclusion I I
 
03:45:19.429 --> 03:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
guess I didn't realize that there were
 
03:45:21.410 --> 03:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
so many alternative conclusions that
 
03:45:23.210 --> 03:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
could be reached
 
03:45:23.220 --> 03:45:23.830 align:start position:0%
could be reached
um

03:45:23.830 --> 03:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:26.870 --> 03:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
would would you think it would be a good
 
03:45:30.050 --> 03:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
idea for any of these scenarios and that
 
03:45:32.450 --> 03:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
you can uh come to a conclusion but
 
03:45:36.070 --> 03:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
there's no disciplinary action that's uh
 
03:45:39.530 --> 03:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
determined that we should report that
 
03:45:41.809 --> 03:45:41.819 align:start position:0%
there was an investigation and this is
 
03:45:44.889 --> 03:45:44.899 align:start position:0%
exactly what the status of that
 
03:45:47.630 --> 03:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
investigation was you mentioned it could
 
03:45:50.170 --> 03:45:50.180 align:start position:0%
be unfounded no further action taken
 
03:45:53.210 --> 03:45:53.220 align:start position:0%
statute not violated but the board is
 
03:45:55.490 --> 03:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
concerned and then you have two or three
 
03:45:55.500 --> 03:45:56.530 align:start position:0%
concerned and then you have two or three
other

03:45:56.530 --> 03:45:56.540 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:46:00.830 --> 03:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
possibility possible outcomes in your
 
03:46:00.840 --> 03:46:02.389 align:start position:0%
possibility possible outcomes in your
mind

03:46:02.389 --> 03:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
mind
 
03:46:06.650 --> 03:46:06.660 align:start position:0%
would it be wise or foolhardy to report
 
03:46:09.590 --> 03:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
the precise conclusion of the
 
03:46:11.510 --> 03:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
investigation using
 
03:46:14.030 --> 03:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
terms such of those six or seven
 
03:46:15.889 --> 03:46:15.899 align:start position:0%
conditions I think it would be
 
03:46:17.870 --> 03:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunate if you did that
 
03:46:21.050 --> 03:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
and why is that sir that
 
03:46:24.950 --> 03:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
just because there is a complaint
 
03:46:27.590 --> 03:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
just because there's a lawsuit does not
 
03:46:31.729 --> 03:46:31.739 align:start position:0%
mean those Bad Medicine period
 
03:46:34.190 --> 03:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
but but wouldn't that necessarily show
 
03:46:36.290 --> 03:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
up in the outcome of the investigation
 
03:46:39.229 --> 03:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't one of these Alternatives be
 
03:46:42.410 --> 03:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
selected if the board thought that it
 
03:46:45.170 --> 03:46:45.180 align:start position:0%
was the the for The Meta the clinical
 
03:46:48.349 --> 03:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
Behavior was acceptable it's just a
 
03:46:50.929 --> 03:46:50.939 align:start position:0%
complaint I mean why why wouldn't that
 
03:46:55.070 --> 03:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
be validating for a physician who had
 
03:46:57.650 --> 03:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
had their work reviewed and had the
 
03:46:59.990 --> 03:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
board come out basically with a stamp of
 
03:47:02.150 --> 03:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
approval saying there was a complaint
 
03:47:05.210 --> 03:47:05.220 align:start position:0%
but we didn't see anything wrong why
 
03:47:09.290 --> 03:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:11.090 --> 03:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's fair to the physician
 
03:47:12.650 --> 03:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
and I will tell you why
 
03:47:15.170 --> 03:47:15.180 align:start position:0%
I was investigated by the New Hampshire
 
03:47:17.990 --> 03:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
board several years ago uh probably
 
03:47:20.809 --> 03:47:20.819 align:start position:0%
about 15 or 20 years ago where I was
 
03:47:23.210 --> 03:47:23.220 align:start position:0%
pulled in at the very last minute
 
03:47:25.250 --> 03:47:25.260 align:start position:0%
literally the very last minute for a
 
03:47:28.150 --> 03:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
delivery by one of the family physicians
 
03:47:31.849 --> 03:47:31.859 align:start position:0%
that I was covering I was another
 
03:47:33.849 --> 03:47:33.859 align:start position:0%
partner and I were
 
03:47:35.630 --> 03:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
initially there were just two of us
 
03:47:38.450 --> 03:47:38.460 align:start position:0%
hired back in 2001 to cover the
 
03:47:40.910 --> 03:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
residency as far as women who might need
 
03:47:43.250 --> 03:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
a cesarean section complications in
 
03:47:46.670 --> 03:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and so I was asked by this one
 
03:47:49.190 --> 03:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
provider if I just kind of sit around in
 
03:47:50.870 --> 03:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
labor and delivery in case they needed
 
03:47:51.769 --> 03:47:51.779 align:start position:0%
some help
 
03:47:56.630 --> 03:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
and the help they needed was for a
 
03:47:58.969 --> 03:47:58.979 align:start position:0%
shoulder dystocia and if you're not sure
 
03:48:01.250 --> 03:48:01.260 align:start position:0%
what a shoulder dystocia is it's where
 
03:48:03.110 --> 03:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
the head sort of comes out
 
03:48:04.969 --> 03:48:04.979 align:start position:0%
and then the shoulder gets stuck behind
 
03:48:06.229 --> 03:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
pubic bone
 
03:48:10.610 --> 03:48:10.620 align:start position:0%
and it's terrifying to anyone who's been
 
03:48:12.670 --> 03:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
involved in that situation
 
03:48:15.410 --> 03:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
and it took
 
03:48:17.389 --> 03:48:17.399 align:start position:0%
five or six minutes to really deliver
 
03:48:18.950 --> 03:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
that child
 
03:48:22.070 --> 03:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
and the child was neurologically injured
 
03:48:24.070 --> 03:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
and there are certain
 
03:48:26.570 --> 03:48:26.580 align:start position:0%
Maneuvers that a provider has to go
 
03:48:28.490 --> 03:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
through to
 
03:48:30.910 --> 03:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
actually deliver the child
 
03:48:33.190 --> 03:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
the most dramatic
 
03:48:35.510 --> 03:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
is where you try and push the head up
 
03:48:35.520 --> 03:48:36.469 align:start position:0%
is where you try and push the head up
inside

03:48:36.469 --> 03:48:36.479 align:start position:0%
inside
 
03:48:39.290 --> 03:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
and those results are almost uniformly
 
03:48:39.300 --> 03:48:40.610 align:start position:0%
and those results are almost uniformly
terrible

03:48:40.610 --> 03:48:40.620 align:start position:0%
terrible
 
03:48:42.889 --> 03:48:42.899 align:start position:0%
there are other results or other
 
03:48:45.650 --> 03:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
Maneuvers that you can do to try and
 
03:48:49.729 --> 03:48:49.739 align:start position:0%
deliver the shoulder that I used
 
03:48:52.610 --> 03:48:52.620 align:start position:0%
repeatedly and was Abe finally able to
 
03:48:56.090 --> 03:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:59.870 --> 03:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
and that's as good as it gets
 
03:49:02.570 --> 03:49:02.580 align:start position:0%
that you do whatever it is possible to
 
03:49:05.809 --> 03:49:05.819 align:start position:0%
do and if you have a bad result
 
03:49:08.690 --> 03:49:08.700 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's no avoiding a bad
 
03:49:08.700 --> 03:49:10.130 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's no avoiding a bad
result

03:49:10.130 --> 03:49:10.140 align:start position:0%
result
 
03:49:12.650 --> 03:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
I can mention that I practiced for about
 
03:49:14.929 --> 03:49:14.939 align:start position:0%
eight years in Solo practice in
 
03:49:17.630 --> 03:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
Northwestern Pennsylvania in a rural
 
03:49:19.969 --> 03:49:19.979 align:start position:0%
area where the nearest tertiary Center
 
03:49:22.490 --> 03:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
was about two and a half hours away
 
03:49:25.190 --> 03:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
and having someone come in there were
 
03:49:28.370 --> 03:49:28.380 align:start position:0%
two instances of twins one at 24 weeks
 
03:49:31.309 --> 03:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
who came in and both Twins were in
 
03:49:32.690 --> 03:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
breach position
 
03:49:35.570 --> 03:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
and she the woman was fully diluted
 
03:49:37.130 --> 03:49:37.140 align:start position:0%
she was not going to get put into an
 
03:49:39.229 --> 03:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
ambulance and sent two and a half hours
 
03:49:41.269 --> 03:49:41.279 align:start position:0%
on the road where she'd likely deliver
 
03:49:43.250 --> 03:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
on route
 
03:49:45.650 --> 03:49:45.660 align:start position:0%
it was going to be 45 minutes
 
03:49:47.990 --> 03:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
flight time to get a helicopter in and
 
03:49:49.729 --> 03:49:49.739 align:start position:0%
then another 45 minutes to get her to
 
03:49:51.830 --> 03:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania to Pittsburgh
 
03:49:55.250 --> 03:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
and we did the best we could I delivered
 
03:49:58.070 --> 03:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
two living children one of whom survived
 
03:50:00.410 --> 03:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
I don't know the results of that
 
03:50:04.309 --> 03:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
I had another patient arrive at 26 weeks
 
03:50:07.849 --> 03:50:07.859 align:start position:0%
who was also fully dilated and bleeding
 
03:50:08.990 --> 03:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
to death
 
03:50:11.450 --> 03:50:11.460 align:start position:0%
that she had a placenta previa
 
03:50:14.750 --> 03:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
and we
 
03:50:18.290 --> 03:50:18.300 align:start position:0%
were able to save her life and also the
 
03:50:20.330 --> 03:50:20.340 align:start position:0%
baby was delivered alive but
 
03:50:22.309 --> 03:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
subsequently succumbed
 
03:50:29.870 --> 03:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:33.950 --> 03:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
all right so I I sincerely appreciate
 
03:50:36.290 --> 03:50:36.300 align:start position:0%
everything you've done that helped our
 
03:50:39.110 --> 03:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
society with our health care needs I I I
 
03:50:42.290 --> 03:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
I assume that the point of having a
 
03:50:44.929 --> 03:50:44.939 align:start position:0%
board of medicine filled with peers with
 
03:50:48.349 --> 03:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
physician peers is so that they can look
 
03:50:51.229 --> 03:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
into the clinical facts of the situation
 
03:50:54.590 --> 03:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
and they can make a informed medical
 
03:50:58.010 --> 03:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
opinion on whether or not the the the
 
03:51:01.670 --> 03:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
the the the complaint is unfounded or
 
03:51:03.650 --> 03:51:03.660 align:start position:0%
not and I I assume based on those two
 
03:51:06.349 --> 03:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
cases you said that they would come back
 
03:51:10.550 --> 03:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
with an unfounded status uh even though
 
03:51:14.510 --> 03:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
there was an investigation if if if as a
 
03:51:17.870 --> 03:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
physician would it be detrimental to
 
03:51:21.710 --> 03:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
your career to have knowledge that there
 
03:51:23.990 --> 03:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
was an investigation and you came out
 
03:51:27.889 --> 03:51:27.899 align:start position:0%
clean with an unfounded finding I I'm
 
03:51:30.290 --> 03:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
still just wondering a lot out if if
 
03:51:33.710 --> 03:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
that's actually good policy to validate
 
03:51:36.170 --> 03:51:36.180 align:start position:0%
that you've been reviewed and and and
 
03:51:38.170 --> 03:51:38.180 align:start position:0%
everything's fine
 
03:51:41.510 --> 03:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
do you is it is it still your position
 
03:51:44.630 --> 03:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
that even if there's a unfounded status
 
03:51:47.929 --> 03:51:47.939 align:start position:0%
that the fact that there was an
 
03:51:50.229 --> 03:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
investigation should not be made public
 
03:51:55.550 --> 03:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:00.410 --> 03:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:01.550 --> 03:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:52:01.560 --> 03:52:16.990 align:start position:0%
thank you
foreign

03:52:16.990 --> 03:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:19.790 --> 03:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor I was really interested
 
03:52:21.889 --> 03:52:21.899 align:start position:0%
in your explanation about the different
 
03:52:24.410 --> 03:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
categories of disposition
 
03:52:27.530 --> 03:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
and I'm far less interested in the
 
03:52:30.349 --> 03:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
unfounded issues and I will just state
 
03:52:32.090 --> 03:52:32.100 align:start position:0%
for anybody who doesn't know me that I'm
 
03:52:35.269 --> 03:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
an attorney by training although retired
 
03:52:38.210 --> 03:52:38.220 align:start position:0%
and so I have some experience of the
 
03:52:39.889 --> 03:52:39.899 align:start position:0%
same kinds of issues of what happens
 
03:52:41.570 --> 03:52:41.580 align:start position:0%
when somebody complains because they're
 
03:52:41.580 --> 03:52:42.590 align:start position:0%
when somebody complains because they're
annoyed

03:52:42.590 --> 03:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
annoyed
 
03:52:45.650 --> 03:52:45.660 align:start position:0%
but there isn't anything founded as to
 
03:52:47.389 --> 03:52:47.399 align:start position:0%
something you've done wrong
 
03:52:50.030 --> 03:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
what I'm interested in is the category
 
03:52:51.530 --> 03:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
that you said
 
03:52:54.349 --> 03:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
is that one category is when the statute
 
03:52:56.750 --> 03:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
has been violated but the board has
 
03:52:59.570 --> 03:52:59.580 align:start position:0%
decided not to discipline
 
03:53:02.150 --> 03:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
and that seems to me to be a very
 
03:53:04.729 --> 03:53:04.739 align:start position:0%
different category
 
03:53:08.809 --> 03:53:08.819 align:start position:0%
than the unfounded or a letter of
 
03:53:12.170 --> 03:53:12.180 align:start position:0%
concern because those don't arise to a
 
03:53:14.030 --> 03:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
statutory violation
 
03:53:16.070 --> 03:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
so I was wondering if you could just
 
03:53:21.050 --> 03:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
give me generally an idea of what kind
 
03:53:22.990 --> 03:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
of thing
 
03:53:26.269 --> 03:53:26.279 align:start position:0%
might be found in the category of
 
03:53:27.950 --> 03:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
something that
 
03:53:31.790 --> 03:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
is a violation of Statute but no
 
03:53:34.250 --> 03:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
discipline is resulting and then give me
 
03:53:36.950 --> 03:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
your opinion about why that perhaps
 
03:53:39.830 --> 03:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
should or should not be reported because
 
03:53:42.349 --> 03:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
that seems to me to be a bright line as
 
03:53:50.150 --> 03:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:53.870 --> 03:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
should keep medical records reflecting
 
03:53:53.880 --> 03:53:55.210 align:start position:0%
should keep medical records reflecting
care

03:53:55.210 --> 03:53:55.220 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:54:00.170 --> 03:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:00.180 --> 03:54:01.550 align:start position:0%
 
sure

03:54:01.550 --> 03:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:54:04.670 --> 03:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
and I will tell you that my experience
 
03:54:06.349 --> 03:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
on the medical view subcommittee I
 
03:54:07.790 --> 03:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
03:54:09.769 --> 03:54:09.779 align:start position:0%
a variety of records that were not
 
03:54:09.779 --> 03:54:11.389 align:start position:0%
a variety of records that were not
legible

03:54:11.389 --> 03:54:11.399 align:start position:0%
legible
 
03:54:16.210 --> 03:54:16.220 align:start position:0%
and so the report out was that you know
 
03:54:18.349 --> 03:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
we're not going to discipline you even
 
03:54:20.210 --> 03:54:20.220 align:start position:0%
though this is a violation of Statute
 
03:54:23.510 --> 03:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
but boy Shape Up This is the electronic
 
03:54:23.520 --> 03:54:24.469 align:start position:0%
but boy Shape Up This is the electronic
age

03:54:24.469 --> 03:54:24.479 align:start position:0%
age
 
03:54:29.570 --> 03:54:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:29.580 --> 03:54:33.290 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:54:33.290 --> 03:54:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:35.090 --> 03:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
03:54:37.490 --> 03:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:54:40.849 --> 03:54:40.859 align:start position:0%
my question is how much of the data that
 
03:54:42.469 --> 03:54:42.479 align:start position:0%
or the various categories that are
 
03:54:45.410 --> 03:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
resolved with your review of cases is
 
03:54:47.389 --> 03:54:47.399 align:start position:0%
actually submitted or entered into the
 
03:54:49.729 --> 03:54:49.739 align:start position:0%
National Practitioner database okay is
 
03:54:52.550 --> 03:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
it only the untold the bad results or
 
03:54:54.950 --> 03:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
the ones can you know with a penalty or
 
03:54:57.410 --> 03:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
all of them the only ones that were
 
03:55:00.650 --> 03:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
reported to the National Data Bank are
 
03:55:02.929 --> 03:55:02.939 align:start position:0%
ones that go to discipline whether it
 
03:55:04.969 --> 03:55:04.979 align:start position:0%
actually comes to a hearing or whether
 
03:55:08.650 --> 03:55:08.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:11.330 --> 03:55:11.340 align:start position:0%
in reference to your comment about
 
03:55:13.189 --> 03:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
Hannaford's with the residents at
 
03:55:14.389 --> 03:55:14.399 align:start position:0%
Concord Hospital that was a little
 
03:55:16.490 --> 03:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
tongue-in-cheek yeah
 
03:55:18.830 --> 03:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
my experience has made me yours as well
 
03:55:21.889 --> 03:55:21.899 align:start position:0%
is that those that were afraid to get
 
03:55:24.110 --> 03:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
into the fire will drop the OB part of
 
03:55:26.809 --> 03:55:26.819 align:start position:0%
the OB GYN practice and practice only
 
03:55:29.689 --> 03:55:29.699 align:start position:0%
GYN less risk involved that sort of
 
03:55:31.689 --> 03:55:31.699 align:start position:0%
thing potentially
 
03:55:34.250 --> 03:55:34.260 align:start position:0%
my my question is there are
 
03:55:36.590 --> 03:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
practitioners that will only take the
 
03:55:39.170 --> 03:55:39.180 align:start position:0%
easy cases surgically and they have low
 
03:55:42.290 --> 03:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
risk involved there are others that have
 
03:55:44.510 --> 03:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
significant Acuity to their practice
 
03:55:47.389 --> 03:55:47.399 align:start position:0%
High Acuity referral centers by the
 
03:55:49.250 --> 03:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
nature of it they're going to have a
 
03:55:52.309 --> 03:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
potential problem on a number of cases
 
03:55:54.290 --> 03:55:54.300 align:start position:0%
so my question is the ones in the middle
 
03:55:56.269 --> 03:55:56.279 align:start position:0%
those that don't know their boundaries
 
03:55:58.729 --> 03:55:58.739 align:start position:0%
those that practice beyond the scope of
 
03:56:01.550 --> 03:56:01.560 align:start position:0%
their skill set do you believe that in
 
03:56:03.290 --> 03:56:03.300 align:start position:0%
your experience with the board that
 
03:56:05.689 --> 03:56:05.699 align:start position:0%
those are the ones that are adequately
 
03:56:09.950 --> 03:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
vetted out and identified or is there or
 
03:56:12.889 --> 03:56:12.899 align:start position:0%
is it across the entire Spectrum
 
03:56:16.070 --> 03:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's hard to answer that when you're
 
03:56:17.689 --> 03:56:17.699 align:start position:0%
talking about vetting who are you
 
03:56:21.410 --> 03:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
licensing and people that are licensees
 
03:56:24.410 --> 03:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
that are applying for a license have to
 
03:56:26.269 --> 03:56:26.279 align:start position:0%
submit a variety of information that
 
03:56:29.889 --> 03:56:29.899 align:start position:0%
includes malpractice suits
 
03:56:33.670 --> 03:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
03:56:35.990 --> 03:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors from before medical school
 
03:56:42.050 --> 03:56:42.060 align:start position:0%
any number of things that Ms Courtney
 
03:56:42.060 --> 03:56:44.750 align:start position:0%
any number of things that Ms Courtney
described

03:56:44.750 --> 03:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
described
 
03:56:48.130 --> 03:56:48.140 align:start position:0%
that the they vetted some of the license
 
03:56:52.130 --> 03:56:52.140 align:start position:0%
approvals to administrative staff
 
03:56:55.790 --> 03:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
anything that falls out in that initial
 
03:56:59.410 --> 03:56:59.420 align:start position:0%
review anyone who's had a malpractice
 
03:57:03.670 --> 03:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
suit anyone who's had any kind of
 
03:57:07.130 --> 03:57:07.140 align:start position:0%
Investigation in medical school they've
 
03:57:09.229 --> 03:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
been on probation in residency who've
 
03:57:11.630 --> 03:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
been on probation uh
 
03:57:13.849 --> 03:57:13.859 align:start position:0%
anything that falls out and I'm not
 
03:57:15.410 --> 03:57:15.420 align:start position:0%
hitting everything but
 
03:57:17.269 --> 03:57:17.279 align:start position:0%
um anything that falls out immediately
 
03:57:19.189 --> 03:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
goes to the board for review
 
03:57:22.010 --> 03:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
and uh and it's up to the board then to
 
03:57:24.950 --> 03:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
review it themselves and decide if if we
 
03:57:26.870 --> 03:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
want to license this person do we need
 
03:57:29.150 --> 03:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
more explanation from them than they've
 
03:57:34.610 --> 03:57:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:39.229 --> 03:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
doctor let me give you a hypothetical
 
03:57:43.189 --> 03:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
suppose a hypothetical physician is
 
03:57:43.199 --> 03:57:44.269 align:start position:0%
suppose a hypothetical physician is
deemed

03:57:44.269 --> 03:57:44.279 align:start position:0%
deemed
 
03:57:48.370 --> 03:57:48.380 align:start position:0%
by medical colleagues to practice
 
03:57:51.950 --> 03:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
medicine in such a way that
 
03:57:54.889 --> 03:57:54.899 align:start position:0%
not just the physician takes the tough
 
03:57:57.590 --> 03:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
cases thank God somebody does but that
 
03:58:00.110 --> 03:58:00.120 align:start position:0%
this person has gone beyond that into
 
03:58:03.349 --> 03:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
for very dangerous place
 
03:58:05.450 --> 03:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
but nothing is reported about this
 
03:58:08.809 --> 03:58:08.819 align:start position:0%
hypothetical physician on the website
 
03:58:14.150 --> 03:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:17.889 --> 03:58:17.899 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure exactly what you're asking
 
03:58:21.050 --> 03:58:21.060 align:start position:0%
that that
 
03:58:23.469 --> 03:58:23.479 align:start position:0%
the board has to hear something
 
03:58:26.090 --> 03:58:26.100 align:start position:0%
before they can do any kind of
 
03:58:30.469 --> 03:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
Investigation so if there are
 
03:58:32.510 --> 03:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
other licensees who are concerned about
 
03:58:35.150 --> 03:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
someone's practice if they don't make a
 
03:58:37.729 --> 03:58:37.739 align:start position:0%
complaint to the Board of Medicine the
 
03:58:42.469 --> 03:58:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:43.790 --> 03:58:43.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if that answers your
 
03:58:43.800 --> 03:58:44.929 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if that answers your
question

03:58:44.929 --> 03:58:44.939 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:58:48.170 --> 03:58:48.180 align:start position:0%
it's hopeful that maybe
 
03:58:49.790 --> 03:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure how to follow it up
 
03:58:52.309 --> 03:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for something more
 
03:58:55.070 --> 03:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
um I I will I want to make one statement
 
03:58:57.650 --> 03:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
that when the Boston Globe article came
 
03:58:57.660 --> 03:58:58.670 align:start position:0%
that when the Boston Globe article came
out

03:58:58.670 --> 03:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:59:01.910 --> 03:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
it was something that just
 
03:59:01.920 --> 03:59:04.370 align:start position:0%
it was something that just
um

03:59:04.370 --> 03:59:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:07.250 --> 03:59:07.260 align:start position:0%
caused me considerable upset sorry
 
03:59:09.769 --> 03:59:09.779 align:start position:0%
considerable considerable upset okay
 
03:59:09.779 --> 03:59:11.630 align:start position:0%
considerable considerable upset okay
that

03:59:11.630 --> 03:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:59:11.640 --> 03:59:15.710 align:start position:0%
that
um

03:59:15.710 --> 03:59:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:18.229 --> 03:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure this this kind of off topic
 
03:59:19.550 --> 03:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
a little bit but I'm not sure if any of
 
03:59:20.570 --> 03:59:20.580 align:start position:0%
you have ever
 
03:59:23.030 --> 03:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
heard of Dr Death
 
03:59:26.580 --> 03:59:26.590 align:start position:0%
who was a neurosurgeon in Texas who
 
03:59:26.590 --> 03:59:27.769 align:start position:0%
who was a neurosurgeon in Texas who
[Music]

03:59:27.769 --> 03:59:27.779 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:59:27.779 --> 03:59:28.370 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

03:59:28.370 --> 03:59:28.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:28.380 --> 03:59:30.110 align:start position:0%
um
really

03:59:30.110 --> 03:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:59:32.090 --> 03:59:32.100 align:start position:0%
didn't get reported to the board in
 
03:59:34.910 --> 03:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
Texas it wasn't no complaints were
 
03:59:37.429 --> 03:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
raised but who was practicing terrible
 
03:59:37.439 --> 03:59:38.990 align:start position:0%
raised but who was practicing terrible
medicine

03:59:38.990 --> 03:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
03:59:42.889 --> 03:59:42.899 align:start position:0%
and who wasn't finally brought to he's
 
03:59:46.429 --> 03:59:46.439 align:start position:0%
now incarcerated but was not brought to
 
03:59:50.170 --> 03:59:50.180 align:start position:0%
any kind of review until
 
03:59:54.229 --> 03:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
another neurosurgeon had to take one of
 
03:59:56.150 --> 03:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
his patients in his absence back to the
 
03:59:57.590 --> 03:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
operating room
 
04:00:00.710 --> 04:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
and re-operate and find
 
04:00:02.809 --> 04:00:02.819 align:start position:0%
really terrible surgery
 
04:00:04.969 --> 04:00:04.979 align:start position:0%
where Hardware That was supposed to be
 
04:00:09.170 --> 04:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
inserted in a certain way was not
 
04:00:11.630 --> 04:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't until he was he brought
 
04:00:12.889 --> 04:00:12.899 align:start position:0%
from that
 
04:00:12.899 --> 04:00:13.729 align:start position:0%
from that
um

04:00:13.729 --> 04:00:13.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:15.050 --> 04:00:15.060 align:start position:0%
and he took that to the Attorney
 
04:00:16.910 --> 04:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
General's office and it was the Attorney
 
04:00:18.950 --> 04:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
General's office who brought that
 
04:00:21.950 --> 04:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
physician to trial
 
04:00:24.050 --> 04:00:24.060 align:start position:0%
and sentencing
 
04:00:24.060 --> 04:00:26.150 align:start position:0%
and sentencing
so

04:00:26.150 --> 04:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:00:29.090 --> 04:00:29.100 align:start position:0%
if we don't hear it as a board we don't
 
04:00:31.250 --> 04:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
know anything about it we can't act on
 
04:00:31.260 --> 04:00:32.349 align:start position:0%
know anything about it we can't act on
it

04:00:32.349 --> 04:00:32.359 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:00:35.570 --> 04:00:35.580 align:start position:0%
and which
 
04:00:38.990 --> 04:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
it comes down to other providers who
 
04:00:42.530 --> 04:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
will make a complaint uh if that is done
 
04:00:45.650 --> 04:00:45.660 align:start position:0%
then those cases are reviewed it comes
 
04:00:49.610 --> 04:00:49.620 align:start position:0%
down to insurers informing the board
 
04:00:53.269 --> 04:00:53.279 align:start position:0%
that somebody has settled it comes down
 
04:00:55.189 --> 04:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
to reviewing reports from the National
 
04:01:00.110 --> 04:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:02.389 --> 04:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
I share your concern
 
04:01:06.550 --> 04:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
I've spent 12 over 12 years
 
04:01:08.269 --> 04:01:08.279 align:start position:0%
associated with the Board of Medicine
 
04:01:11.090 --> 04:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that
 
04:01:14.330 --> 04:01:14.340 align:start position:0%
patients get adequate care I spent if
 
04:01:15.950 --> 04:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
you look at my statement I've spent a
 
04:01:18.530 --> 04:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
fair amount of time in practice doing
 
04:01:19.729 --> 04:01:19.739 align:start position:0%
the same thing
 
04:01:24.290 --> 04:01:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:26.269 --> 04:01:26.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Doctor any further questions
 
04:01:28.429 --> 04:01:28.439 align:start position:0%
for Dr Conroy
 
04:01:30.469 --> 04:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
representative Solway
 
04:01:33.349 --> 04:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Pearson an
 
04:01:35.809 --> 04:01:35.819 align:start position:0%
apology to those assembled that I was
 
04:01:38.150 --> 04:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
not here on time I was over in the
 
04:01:40.630 --> 04:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
Legislative Office Building on time
 
04:01:43.150 --> 04:01:43.160 align:start position:0%
regrettably apparently the sign
 
04:01:46.610 --> 04:01:46.620 align:start position:0%
redirecting here must have fallen off it
 
04:01:49.790 --> 04:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
was not there or visible and there was
 
04:01:53.510 --> 04:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
no one from the committee there to
 
04:01:56.210 --> 04:01:56.220 align:start position:0%
inform me that it had been relocated so
 
04:01:58.309 --> 04:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
it came as a surprise and I'm certainly
 
04:02:00.550 --> 04:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
glad finally to be here to be with you
 
04:02:03.910 --> 04:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
Dr Conway uh
 
04:02:07.309 --> 04:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
oftentimes when there is a claim
 
04:02:11.450 --> 04:02:11.460 align:start position:0%
it is settled through insurance
 
04:02:13.370 --> 04:02:13.380 align:start position:0%
there is a settlement
 
04:02:17.150 --> 04:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes there is an attorney and
 
04:02:19.370 --> 04:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
uh very commonly there's a
 
04:02:22.309 --> 04:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreement am I correct so
 
04:02:24.710 --> 04:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
far yes
 
04:02:27.650 --> 04:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
does the board attend to
 
04:02:30.830 --> 04:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
does it alter Its Behavior in the light
 
04:02:35.210 --> 04:02:35.220 align:start position:0%
of is it limited by in any way such
 
04:02:39.050 --> 04:02:39.060 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreements I have no idea
 
04:02:40.849 --> 04:02:40.859 align:start position:0%
that's a lawyer question
 
04:02:43.790 --> 04:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to find a lawyer to
 
04:02:46.070 --> 04:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
address that issue thank you Dr Conway
 
04:02:46.080 --> 04:02:53.030 align:start position:0%
address that issue thank you Dr Conway
okay

04:02:53.030 --> 04:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:56.689 --> 04:02:56.699 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much yes okay okay
 
04:02:59.210 --> 04:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
so do do we have anyone on our pink
 
04:03:01.670 --> 04:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
cards who seems to be the subject matter
 
04:03:05.630 --> 04:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
expert on malpractice insurance premium
 
04:03:07.550 --> 04:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
setting because I I have a specific
 
04:03:09.410 --> 04:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
question about that
 
04:03:09.420 --> 04:03:13.729 align:start position:0%
question about that
okay

04:03:13.729 --> 04:03:13.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:18.290 --> 04:03:18.300 align:start position:0%
would at winner Van Der Zander Esquire
 
04:03:24.370 --> 04:03:24.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:28.189 --> 04:03:28.199 align:start position:0%
okay come on up and um it's a two-seater
 
04:03:29.750 --> 04:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
I think unless there's any further
 
04:03:31.490 --> 04:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
questions for Dr Conway thank you so
 
04:03:48.250 --> 04:03:48.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:51.349 --> 04:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
for the record on midwin of andersanden
 
04:03:53.809 --> 04:03:53.819 align:start position:0%
I practice law with the firm of
 
04:03:56.330 --> 04:03:56.340 align:start position:0%
getmanship to steer and Poulin an
 
04:04:00.050 --> 04:04:00.060 align:start position:0%
insurance defense firm in Manchester and
 
04:04:02.689 --> 04:04:02.699 align:start position:0%
I have been there for 23 years
 
04:04:06.110 --> 04:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
I practiced largely in the area of
 
04:04:09.050 --> 04:04:09.060 align:start position:0%
professional negligence defending
 
04:04:11.809 --> 04:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
primarily institutions long-term care
 
04:04:15.410 --> 04:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
facilities Etc I've also represented
 
04:04:17.210 --> 04:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
nurses Physicians and dentists before
 
04:04:20.150 --> 04:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
the respective boards in disciplinary
 
04:04:20.160 --> 04:04:21.710 align:start position:0%
the respective boards in disciplinary
matters

04:04:21.710 --> 04:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
matters
 
04:04:24.110 --> 04:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
I've also done some plaintiff's work
 
04:04:26.269 --> 04:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
so I thought it might be helpful to just
 
04:04:28.729 --> 04:04:28.739 align:start position:0%
quickly encapsulate for you what I think
 
04:04:31.309 --> 04:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
is troubling you the most and that is
 
04:04:33.769 --> 04:04:33.779 align:start position:0%
that there seems to be a substantial
 
04:04:37.729 --> 04:04:37.739 align:start position:0%
period of time between malpractice and
 
04:04:37.739 --> 04:04:39.110 align:start position:0%
period of time between malpractice and
remedy

04:04:39.110 --> 04:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
remedy
 
04:04:43.250 --> 04:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
and notice to the public and that is a
 
04:04:46.370 --> 04:04:46.380 align:start position:0%
function largely of the statutes that
 
04:04:49.429 --> 04:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
have been promulgated both federally and
 
04:04:52.849 --> 04:04:52.859 align:start position:0%
in the state to try and address what has
 
04:04:56.450 --> 04:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
been perceived as a malpractice crisis
 
04:04:58.849 --> 04:04:58.859 align:start position:0%
I should also point out that research
 
04:05:01.090 --> 04:05:01.100 align:start position:0%
has been done by various medical
 
04:05:03.889 --> 04:05:03.899 align:start position:0%
institutions not the least of which was
 
04:05:05.870 --> 04:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
John Hopkins University School of
 
04:05:05.880 --> 04:05:06.830 align:start position:0%
John Hopkins University School of
Medicine

04:05:06.830 --> 04:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
Medicine
 
04:05:09.530 --> 04:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
that determined that the malpractice
 
04:05:13.370 --> 04:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
system really doesn't work very well to
 
04:05:16.429 --> 04:05:16.439 align:start position:0%
address true malpractice
 
04:05:18.830 --> 04:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
that there are claims that are brought
 
04:05:21.889 --> 04:05:21.899 align:start position:0%
and this was more true back in the early
 
04:05:24.830 --> 04:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
years of the malpractice crisis before
 
04:05:26.450 --> 04:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
the institution of the National
 
04:05:28.670 --> 04:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
Practitioner Data Bank
 
04:05:31.849 --> 04:05:31.859 align:start position:0%
that were settled because the Physicians
 
04:05:35.090 --> 04:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
didn't wish to have the fact of a
 
04:05:37.389 --> 04:05:37.399 align:start position:0%
malpractice claim
 
04:05:40.370 --> 04:05:40.380 align:start position:0%
noticed to the public and so as soon as
 
04:05:42.830 --> 04:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
a claim was threatened if there was even
 
04:05:46.250 --> 04:05:46.260 align:start position:0%
a perceived bit of Merit to it insurers
 
04:05:48.889 --> 04:05:48.899 align:start position:0%
paid up to protect their insurance
 
04:05:51.710 --> 04:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
that don't happen no more
 
04:05:53.929 --> 04:05:53.939 align:start position:0%
since the National Practitioner Data
 
04:05:57.650 --> 04:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
Bank was put into practice in I think it
 
04:06:02.809 --> 04:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
was 1986. it has become a requirement
 
04:06:06.229 --> 04:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
that every settlement or verdict that is
 
04:06:10.070 --> 04:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
paid by any insurer and that is entered
 
04:06:14.689 --> 04:06:14.699 align:start position:0%
into by any practitioner must be filed
 
04:06:17.110 --> 04:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
with the National Practitioner Data Bank
 
04:06:20.929 --> 04:06:20.939 align:start position:0%
then hospitals who are looking to hire
 
04:06:23.389 --> 04:06:23.399 align:start position:0%
Physicians query the National
 
04:06:25.870 --> 04:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
Practitioner Data Bank to discover
 
04:06:29.330 --> 04:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
whether there have been claims settled
 
04:06:32.389 --> 04:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
or verdicts paid on behalf of that
 
04:06:32.399 --> 04:06:33.769 align:start position:0%
or verdicts paid on behalf of that
physician

04:06:33.769 --> 04:06:33.779 align:start position:0%
physician
 
04:06:36.290 --> 04:06:36.300 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire you have a statutory
 
04:06:40.070 --> 04:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
requirement that investigations of
 
04:06:44.090 --> 04:06:44.100 align:start position:0%
Physicians are confidential and as has
 
04:06:47.750 --> 04:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
been noticed earlier cannot be disclosed
 
04:06:52.790 --> 04:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
until disciplinary action is complete
 
04:06:52.800 --> 04:06:53.750 align:start position:0%
until disciplinary action is complete
um

04:06:53.750 --> 04:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:56.389 --> 04:06:56.399 align:start position:0%
there is another step in this process
 
04:06:59.330 --> 04:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
that has not been discussed and I think
 
04:07:02.510 --> 04:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
it's the one that is troubling the
 
04:07:05.570 --> 04:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
committee and that is that
 
04:07:08.710 --> 04:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
peers the Physicians peers his
 
04:07:12.650 --> 04:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
colleagues are generally the first to
 
04:07:16.790 --> 04:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
know that someone is not practicing up
 
04:07:19.550 --> 04:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
to standards and they have an obligation
 
04:07:21.229 --> 04:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
to report
 
04:07:23.050 --> 04:07:23.060 align:start position:0%
but they report to their Hospital
 
04:07:25.189 --> 04:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
credentials committee
 
04:07:27.590 --> 04:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
and being a hospital credentials
 
04:07:30.290 --> 04:07:30.300 align:start position:0%
Committee Member not only involves
 
04:07:33.070 --> 04:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
allowing a physician to become
 
04:07:35.929 --> 04:07:35.939 align:start position:0%
admitted to have privileges in the
 
04:07:35.939 --> 04:07:37.490 align:start position:0%
admitted to have privileges in the
institution

04:07:37.490 --> 04:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
institution
 
04:07:40.790 --> 04:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
it's also the job of the credentials
 
04:07:43.790 --> 04:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
committee that they act upon and
 
04:07:46.550 --> 04:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
investigate complaints of their
 
04:07:49.010 --> 04:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
colleagues that someone is not
 
04:07:51.290 --> 04:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
practicing in accordance with the
 
04:07:53.870 --> 04:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
standards of the institution
 
04:07:58.090 --> 04:07:58.100 align:start position:0%
so in the case where you have 20 or 21
 
04:08:01.370 --> 04:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
terrible outcomes
 
04:08:04.490 --> 04:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
it would have been the very the very
 
04:08:07.250 --> 04:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
first line of defense for the public
 
04:08:09.469 --> 04:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
would have and should have been the
 
04:08:11.929 --> 04:08:11.939 align:start position:0%
hospital credentials committee the
 
04:08:13.929 --> 04:08:13.939 align:start position:0%
committee meets
 
04:08:17.030 --> 04:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
brings forward all of the records of all
 
04:08:19.610 --> 04:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
of the procedures evaluates the
 
04:08:22.070 --> 04:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
decisions that were made the lab studies
 
04:08:25.849 --> 04:08:25.859 align:start position:0%
the MRIs the CTS everything
 
04:08:28.370 --> 04:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
and comes to a determination as to
 
04:08:30.170 --> 04:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
whether this was a case
 
04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
such as the doctor described where there
 
04:08:35.330 --> 04:08:35.340 align:start position:0%
was was a hopeless case and and this
 
04:08:37.490 --> 04:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
practitioner did the best he could
 
04:08:39.710 --> 04:08:39.720 align:start position:0%
or this was a case of a Cavalier
 
04:08:43.729 --> 04:08:43.739 align:start position:0%
physician exceeding his abilities his
 
04:08:46.309 --> 04:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
training his scope of practice
 
04:08:48.469 --> 04:08:48.479 align:start position:0%
and that's where
 
04:08:51.469 --> 04:08:51.479 align:start position:0%
those investigations are also
 
04:08:51.479 --> 04:08:53.090 align:start position:0%
those investigations are also
confidential

04:08:53.090 --> 04:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
04:08:55.670 --> 04:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
they may well be reported to the board I
 
04:08:57.469 --> 04:08:57.479 align:start position:0%
was involved many years ago with a
 
04:09:00.769 --> 04:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
neurosurgeon in Dover who ultimately the
 
04:09:02.929 --> 04:09:02.939 align:start position:0%
board lifted his license to practice
 
04:09:06.710 --> 04:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
because he lied about a PhD in
 
04:09:08.450 --> 04:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
linguistics in which he had never
 
04:09:11.889 --> 04:09:11.899 align:start position:0%
completed his thesis had nothing to do
 
04:09:15.349 --> 04:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
with his malpractice but it seemed to be
 
04:09:17.210 --> 04:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
the safest way
 
04:09:20.510 --> 04:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
to rid the institution and the state of
 
04:09:22.910 --> 04:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire of
 
04:09:24.950 --> 04:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
a doctor death
 
04:09:24.960 --> 04:09:26.210 align:start position:0%
a doctor death
so

04:09:26.210 --> 04:09:26.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:09:30.050 --> 04:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
that's where the first line of defenses
 
04:09:31.969 --> 04:09:31.979 align:start position:0%
is with the hospital credentials
 
04:09:34.370 --> 04:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
committee and if that committee is made
 
04:09:36.469 --> 04:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
up of people who see their job as to
 
04:09:39.830 --> 04:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
protect their peers from further action
 
04:09:41.809 --> 04:09:41.819 align:start position:0%
then the reports are not going to be
 
04:09:44.090 --> 04:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
made to the Board of Medicine
 
04:09:46.790 --> 04:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
then your next line of defense are that
 
04:09:49.550 --> 04:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
every court clerk in the state in the
 
04:09:51.530 --> 04:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
superior court system of which there are
 
04:09:55.070 --> 04:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
10 is mandated by Statute
 
04:09:57.050 --> 04:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
to notify
 
04:09:59.990 --> 04:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine when a suit is
 
04:10:02.689 --> 04:10:02.699 align:start position:0%
filed not when it's settled not when it
 
04:10:05.450 --> 04:10:05.460 align:start position:0%
goes to verdict but when it is filed
 
04:10:07.849 --> 04:10:07.859 align:start position:0%
but the Board of Medicine
 
04:10:10.250 --> 04:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
does not involve itself in the discovery
 
04:10:12.410 --> 04:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
process during the litigation the Board
 
04:10:14.870 --> 04:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
of Medicine has no role in that
 
04:10:17.389 --> 04:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
litigation other than to Simply know
 
04:10:20.750 --> 04:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
that a claim was filed and then if a
 
04:10:22.610 --> 04:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
verdict or settlement is paid on that
 
04:10:25.010 --> 04:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
claim that is reported to the National
 
04:10:28.370 --> 04:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
Practitioner Data Bank and maybe by the
 
04:10:29.809 --> 04:10:29.819 align:start position:0%
Clerks of Court but I'm not even
 
04:10:35.210 --> 04:10:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:38.870 --> 04:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Dr uh yes and representative
 
04:10:38.880 --> 04:10:40.250 align:start position:0%
thank you Dr uh yes and representative
Murphy

04:10:40.250 --> 04:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
Murphy
 
04:10:41.929 --> 04:10:41.939 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:10:43.729 --> 04:10:43.739 align:start position:0%
for off the cuff coming up here and
 
04:10:46.370 --> 04:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
volunteering your information so is it
 
04:10:48.710 --> 04:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
your opinion from a legal perspective
 
04:10:50.990 --> 04:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing is that
 
04:10:52.790 --> 04:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
and maybe I'm not this is not accurate
 
04:10:54.889 --> 04:10:54.899 align:start position:0%
that it's not the statutes necessarily
 
04:10:56.630 --> 04:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
in the state or federally that are
 
04:10:59.750 --> 04:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
problem but it's the Homegrown problems
 
04:11:03.610 --> 04:11:03.620 align:start position:0%
at local hospitals and that's practices
 
04:11:06.469 --> 04:11:06.479 align:start position:0%
that's where it can first fall down
 
04:11:08.630 --> 04:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
right is that if the credentialing
 
04:11:10.790 --> 04:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
boards are not doing their and it's a
 
04:11:13.910 --> 04:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
rotten job and nobody likes to be on the
 
04:11:15.950 --> 04:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
credentials Committee in any institution
 
04:11:18.170 --> 04:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
because it means you're
 
04:11:20.030 --> 04:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
you're looking over your shoulder at
 
04:11:21.710 --> 04:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
your colleagues and your peers who may
 
04:11:24.229 --> 04:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
be your friends so my follow-up then is
 
04:11:26.090 --> 04:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
that you haven't been involved in
 
04:11:29.750 --> 04:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
credentialing and privileging committees
 
04:11:31.790 --> 04:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
cutting back the Privileges of a
 
04:11:33.710 --> 04:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
provider are sometimes done by the
 
04:11:36.050 --> 04:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
provider himself or herself and
 
04:11:38.809 --> 04:11:38.819 align:start position:0%
sometimes but less Often by the hospital
 
04:11:40.550 --> 04:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
cutting back because you check the boxes
 
04:11:42.469 --> 04:11:42.479 align:start position:0%
you know and they continue to practice
 
04:11:44.510 --> 04:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
as they always have despite the fact
 
04:11:45.590 --> 04:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
that their skill set may have
 
04:11:48.410 --> 04:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
deteriorated is that you're well I I'm
 
04:11:50.570 --> 04:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
not sure that that happens so much as
 
04:11:53.150 --> 04:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
that privileges get limited but there is
 
04:11:53.160 --> 04:11:54.410 align:start position:0%
that privileges get limited but there is
no

04:11:54.410 --> 04:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:11:58.550 --> 04:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh ability of the consumer or people who
 
04:12:02.150 --> 04:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
are not part of the team to know that
 
04:12:05.809 --> 04:12:05.819 align:start position:0%
that has happened and that it implies
 
04:12:08.330 --> 04:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
a criticism of the quality of care that
 
04:12:10.610 --> 04:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
is being rendered
 
04:12:15.170 --> 04:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:18.410 --> 04:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm probably splitting hairs
 
04:12:20.269 --> 04:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
but I just want to go back to the issue
 
04:12:22.330 --> 04:12:22.340 align:start position:0%
of settlements
 
04:12:25.309 --> 04:12:25.319 align:start position:0%
clearly a settlement that happens in the
 
04:12:27.469 --> 04:12:27.479 align:start position:0%
course of a court case is going to be
 
04:12:29.389 --> 04:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
caught we hope it's going to be caught
 
04:12:31.309 --> 04:12:31.319 align:start position:0%
by the court clerks and the reporting
 
04:12:33.110 --> 04:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
system yes they're always they're always
 
04:12:35.689 --> 04:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
informed but there's typically a
 
04:12:37.910 --> 04:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
document filed called a neither party
 
04:12:42.229 --> 04:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
docket marking and it says this the case
 
04:12:46.130 --> 04:12:46.140 align:start position:0%
is resolved no judgment for either party
 
04:12:49.790 --> 04:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
no further action on the same cause
 
04:12:51.710 --> 04:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
meaning it's all gone and the court has
 
04:12:53.150 --> 04:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
to know that so it can take the case off
 
04:12:56.809 --> 04:12:56.819 align:start position:0%
its docket but my actual question if I
 
04:13:01.150 --> 04:13:01.160 align:start position:0%
can finish it is the issue of
 
04:13:04.429 --> 04:13:04.439 align:start position:0%
settlements well even like the one you
 
04:13:07.729 --> 04:13:07.739 align:start position:0%
just said no further action but is is
 
04:13:10.790 --> 04:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
there no further action because uh let
 
04:13:12.410 --> 04:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
me ask it the way I was thinking of it
 
04:13:12.420 --> 04:13:14.030 align:start position:0%
me ask it the way I was thinking of it
originally

04:13:14.030 --> 04:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
originally
 
04:13:18.290 --> 04:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
um somebody believes they have a claim
 
04:13:21.710 --> 04:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
they get an attorney the attorney sends
 
04:13:24.410 --> 04:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
a demand letter to the physician or the
 
04:13:26.689 --> 04:13:26.699 align:start position:0%
physician's Insurance whichever
 
04:13:28.490 --> 04:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
comes first
 
04:13:31.189 --> 04:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
and the insurance company looks at that
 
04:13:32.929 --> 04:13:32.939 align:start position:0%
and says
 
04:13:36.710 --> 04:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
we will pay X dollars to settle this
 
04:13:39.110 --> 04:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
case right up front with no need to file
 
04:13:41.689 --> 04:13:41.699 align:start position:0%
anything until recently all medical
 
04:13:45.830 --> 04:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
malpractice insurance policies had a
 
04:13:48.469 --> 04:13:48.479 align:start position:0%
clause called a consent to settle clause
 
04:13:51.229 --> 04:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
and this insurance company most
 
04:13:53.809 --> 04:13:53.819 align:start position:0%
insurance companies can settle claims
 
04:13:56.269 --> 04:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
other than malpractice claims without
 
04:13:58.309 --> 04:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
the authorization of their insured
 
04:14:00.710 --> 04:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
because they see it as saving themselves
 
04:14:03.610 --> 04:14:03.620 align:start position:0%
right and I get that but my question is
 
04:14:08.330 --> 04:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
are those cases reported to anybody when
 
04:14:11.090 --> 04:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
they get settled at that point okay the
 
04:14:13.610 --> 04:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
insurers have the insurance the
 
04:14:17.210 --> 04:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
statutory obligation under the law and
 
04:14:19.189 --> 04:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
this law has been integrated into
 
04:14:22.729 --> 04:14:22.739 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid and HIPAA so every
 
04:14:25.250 --> 04:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
one of those Federal statutes has a
 
04:14:26.809 --> 04:14:26.819 align:start position:0%
National Practitioner Data Bank
 
04:14:28.729 --> 04:14:28.739 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement thank you I
 
04:14:30.950 --> 04:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
04:14:34.670 --> 04:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
representative soloway uh thank you uh
 
04:14:36.889 --> 04:14:36.899 align:start position:0%
councilor nice to see you regards to Ms
 
04:14:36.899 --> 04:14:37.849 align:start position:0%
councilor nice to see you regards to Ms

04:14:37.849 --> 04:14:37.859 align:start position:0%
Fiona
 
04:14:37.859 --> 04:14:38.389 align:start position:0%
Fiona
ire

04:14:38.389 --> 04:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
ire
 
04:14:38.399 --> 04:14:39.410 align:start position:0%
ire
um

04:14:39.410 --> 04:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:42.170 --> 04:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
you've indicated that the Superior
 
04:14:45.590 --> 04:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
Courts are required to notify the Board
 
04:14:48.410 --> 04:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
of Medicine if there is a complaint
 
04:14:50.929 --> 04:14:50.939 align:start position:0%
filed is that correct yes
 
04:14:54.469 --> 04:14:54.479 align:start position:0%
and is it conceivable that in some
 
04:14:58.870 --> 04:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
states Boards of medicine could then be
 
04:15:02.090 --> 04:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
proactive in pursuing their own
 
04:15:02.100 --> 04:15:03.830 align:start position:0%
proactive in pursuing their own
investigation

04:15:03.830 --> 04:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
04:15:06.229 --> 04:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
well I get the sense that the board is I
 
04:15:09.110 --> 04:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
mean if there is a
 
04:15:15.349 --> 04:15:15.359 align:start position:0%
a complaint that alleges you know clear
 
04:15:19.610 --> 04:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
you know prescribed 180 Oxycontin to a
 
04:15:21.469 --> 04:15:21.479 align:start position:0%
12 year old kid I imagine the board
 
04:15:22.670 --> 04:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
would get involved in that pretty
 
04:15:22.680 --> 04:15:24.290 align:start position:0%
would get involved in that pretty
quickly

04:15:24.290 --> 04:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
04:15:24.300 --> 04:15:25.070 align:start position:0%
quickly
um

04:15:25.070 --> 04:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:28.189 --> 04:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
but the board is well aware of the fact
 
04:15:28.199 --> 04:15:29.809 align:start position:0%
but the board is well aware of the fact
that

04:15:29.809 --> 04:15:29.819 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:15:31.849 --> 04:15:31.859 align:start position:0%
most of the malpractice cases that get
 
04:15:33.410 --> 04:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
tried in this state result in
 
04:15:35.450 --> 04:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
defendant's verdicts
 
04:15:35.460 --> 04:15:36.889 align:start position:0%
defendant's verdicts
so

04:15:36.889 --> 04:15:36.899 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:15:40.370 --> 04:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
they're under no obligation to make an
 
04:15:43.429 --> 04:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
immediate determination they
 
04:15:46.309 --> 04:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
they are aware of it they keep an eye on
 
04:15:48.590 --> 04:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
it but
 
04:15:52.490 --> 04:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
um the board is not really the place
 
04:15:52.500 --> 04:15:54.050 align:start position:0%
um the board is not really the place
where

04:15:54.050 --> 04:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:15:56.150 --> 04:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
the rubbers hitting the road in terms of
 
04:15:57.889 --> 04:15:57.899 align:start position:0%
actual malpractice it's in the
 
04:16:00.050 --> 04:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
credentials committees
 
04:16:04.969 --> 04:16:04.979 align:start position:0%
a quick follow-up so it is the board's
 
04:16:08.570 --> 04:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
decision on how to proceed
 
04:16:12.410 --> 04:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
in any Court notified case is that
 
04:16:12.420 --> 04:16:13.969 align:start position:0%
in any Court notified case is that
correct

04:16:13.969 --> 04:16:13.979 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:16:18.769 --> 04:16:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:20.030 --> 04:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
refer to an event
 
04:16:22.250 --> 04:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
in the committee of Physicians of the
 
04:16:24.590 --> 04:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
same specialty I'm not that familiar
 
04:16:26.990 --> 04:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
with the board's uh procedures and I
 
04:16:29.330 --> 04:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
think you have that witness here
 
04:16:32.450 --> 04:16:32.460 align:start position:0%
um but yes but if your concern is that
 
04:16:34.250 --> 04:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
things are happening too late and people
 
04:16:37.370 --> 04:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
are being injured I just respectfully
 
04:16:39.530 --> 04:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
suggest that
 
04:16:42.050 --> 04:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
the concern about that should be with
 
04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
Hospital credentials committee every
 
04:16:45.229 --> 04:16:45.239 align:start position:0%
hospital has one they have to As a
 
04:16:47.450 --> 04:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
matter of law and some of them just may
 
04:16:50.570 --> 04:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:53.450 --> 04:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
thank you cousler thank you counselor if
 
04:16:55.870 --> 04:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
you and I are speaking on the same
 
04:16:58.790 --> 04:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
hypothetical which we might be
 
04:17:01.729 --> 04:17:01.739 align:start position:0%
I wrote down when you said 20 to 21
 
04:17:04.130 --> 04:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
terrible outcomes
 
04:17:04.140 --> 04:17:05.030 align:start position:0%
terrible outcomes
um

04:17:05.030 --> 04:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:07.429 --> 04:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
we liberal arts people might call that
 
04:17:10.389 --> 04:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
facts not an Evidence
 
04:17:10.399 --> 04:17:12.370 align:start position:0%
facts not an Evidence
laughs

04:17:12.370 --> 04:17:12.380 align:start position:0%
laughs
 
04:17:14.870 --> 04:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
I learn a lot from my lawyer friends
 
04:17:16.429 --> 04:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
04:17:18.710 --> 04:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
um because that's part of the problem we
 
04:17:22.070 --> 04:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
don't know in those 20 or 21 in the
 
04:17:24.189 --> 04:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
hypotheticals that I think you and I are
 
04:17:26.990 --> 04:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
agreeing with that we don't know the
 
04:17:31.429 --> 04:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
level of which level that particular
 
04:17:34.130 --> 04:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
which is why you vest in the Board of
 
04:17:36.469 --> 04:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
Medicine the obligation to investigate
 
04:17:40.189 --> 04:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
because that board is staffed with and
 
04:17:42.950 --> 04:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
or has access to
 
04:17:44.929 --> 04:17:44.939 align:start position:0%
Physicians practicing in the same
 
04:17:46.729 --> 04:17:46.739 align:start position:0%
specialty who can sit down with those
 
04:17:48.410 --> 04:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
records some of which will be this thick
 
04:17:49.670 --> 04:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sure
 
04:17:52.250 --> 04:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
and Wade through them and figure out
 
04:17:56.870 --> 04:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
whether this was just a terrible case
 
04:18:01.250 --> 04:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
that came out the way God meant it to or
 
04:18:04.250 --> 04:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
it was malpractice that that's the job
 
04:18:07.910 --> 04:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:10.849 --> 04:18:10.859 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
04:18:12.590 --> 04:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
chair I have uh I have two different
 
04:18:14.570 --> 04:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
questions the first one may just be a
 
04:18:16.250 --> 04:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
yes no thing
 
04:18:20.090 --> 04:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
um it is the National Practitioner Data
 
04:18:23.510 --> 04:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
Bank accessible by the public no no all
 
04:18:25.790 --> 04:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
right thank you and then the second one
 
04:18:29.150 --> 04:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at a document that's not an
 
04:18:31.189 --> 04:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
original Source it's called guidelines
 
04:18:33.469 --> 04:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
for Hospital reporting and effective
 
04:18:37.010 --> 04:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
September 9 2001. I there's none no
 
04:18:40.010 --> 04:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
indication of who authored it but I'm
 
04:18:41.870 --> 04:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking at it because it talks
 
04:18:43.969 --> 04:18:43.979 align:start position:0%
about Hospital reporting
 
04:18:47.030 --> 04:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that
 
04:18:50.269 --> 04:18:50.279 align:start position:0%
there there is no requirement or even
 
04:18:52.490 --> 04:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
opportunity if this is literally
 
04:18:56.210 --> 04:18:56.220 align:start position:0%
accurate for a credential board to
 
04:18:58.309 --> 04:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
report to the Board of Medicine if they
 
04:18:59.990 --> 04:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
simply have a concern
 
04:19:03.110 --> 04:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
and and I'll I'll read to you what it
 
04:19:06.110 --> 04:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
says reportable items uh related to
 
04:19:08.570 --> 04:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
disciplinary discipline or adverse
 
04:19:08.580 --> 04:19:10.010 align:start position:0%
disciplinary discipline or adverse
action

04:19:10.010 --> 04:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
action
 
04:19:11.990 --> 04:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
if there's been a reduction a
 
04:19:14.870 --> 04:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
restriction a suspension a revocation a
 
04:19:17.750 --> 04:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
termination denial of Privileges and
 
04:19:19.849 --> 04:19:19.859 align:start position:0%
then it's got some other things where it
 
04:19:22.429 --> 04:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
says and these are not reportable
 
04:19:25.010 --> 04:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
uh like failure to to do your medical
 
04:19:27.290 --> 04:19:27.300 align:start position:0%
records properly failure to show up at
 
04:19:31.670 --> 04:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
meetings and so so it seems to me that
 
04:19:36.189 --> 04:19:36.199 align:start position:0%
there there may be a gap in the handoff
 
04:19:39.410 --> 04:19:39.420 align:start position:0%
possibilities between a credential board
 
04:19:41.809 --> 04:19:41.819 align:start position:0%
and the Board of Medicine if the
 
04:19:43.729 --> 04:19:43.739 align:start position:0%
credential board
 
04:19:46.210 --> 04:19:46.220 align:start position:0%
doesn't do a reduction
 
04:19:48.950 --> 04:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
restriction suspension if they if they
 
04:19:51.229 --> 04:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
if they're just concerned that there's
 
04:19:52.630 --> 04:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
really no
 
04:19:55.130 --> 04:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
mechanism for them to inform the Board
 
04:19:57.889 --> 04:19:57.899 align:start position:0%
of Medicine am I am I missing that
 
04:20:04.670 --> 04:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:07.370 --> 04:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm looking for the statute I'm
 
04:20:11.030 --> 04:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
aware of a statute that does
 
04:20:11.040 --> 04:20:12.650 align:start position:0%
aware of a statute that does
um

04:20:12.650 --> 04:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:15.290 --> 04:20:15.300 align:start position:0%
impose the obligation on peer review
 
04:20:18.410 --> 04:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
committees and credentials committees to
 
04:20:18.420 --> 04:20:20.389 align:start position:0%
committees and credentials committees to
report

04:20:20.389 --> 04:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
report
 
04:20:20.399 --> 04:20:23.389 align:start position:0%
report

04:20:27.830 --> 04:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:20:27.840 --> 04:20:31.010 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:20:31.010 --> 04:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:35.689 --> 04:20:35.699 align:start position:0%
this might be it 329 colon 1 double A
 
04:20:38.330 --> 04:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
the practice of medicine is a privilege
 
04:20:40.010 --> 04:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
granted by the people according to the
 
04:20:42.830 --> 04:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
laws enacted by the legislature and not
 
04:20:44.510 --> 04:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
a natural right in the interest of
 
04:20:47.030 --> 04:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
public health safety and Welfare and to
 
04:20:48.830 --> 04:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
protect the public from the
 
04:20:51.050 --> 04:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
unprofessional improper incompetent
 
04:20:53.210 --> 04:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
unlawful fraudulent and deceptive
 
04:20:54.769 --> 04:20:54.779 align:start position:0%
practice of Medicine
 
04:20:56.870 --> 04:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
it is necessary to provide laws and
 
04:20:58.610 --> 04:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
rules to regulate the granting and
 
04:21:00.830 --> 04:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
subsequent use of the privilege to
 
04:21:03.349 --> 04:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
practice medicine and that leads into
 
04:21:06.170 --> 04:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
the obligation of peer review committees
 
04:21:09.349 --> 04:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
and credentialing committees to be alert
 
04:21:12.170 --> 04:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
to and to report for investigation and
 
04:21:14.050 --> 04:21:14.060 align:start position:0%
disciplinary proceedings where
 
04:21:18.229 --> 04:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:22.189 --> 04:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
so so are you aware of any time that a
 
04:21:25.030 --> 04:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
credentialing board or peer review board
 
04:21:29.030 --> 04:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
has uh reported to the Board of Medicine
 
04:21:31.610 --> 04:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
when they simply are concerned as
 
04:21:36.050 --> 04:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
opposed to having taken over action to
 
04:21:39.650 --> 04:21:39.660 align:start position:0%
restrain the provider no nor would I be
 
04:21:42.410 --> 04:21:42.420 align:start position:0%
because the only circumstance under
 
04:21:44.570 --> 04:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
which I would be involved would be
 
04:21:46.670 --> 04:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
probably as a representative of the
 
04:21:48.290 --> 04:21:48.300 align:start position:0%
attorney as the attorney for the
 
04:21:50.450 --> 04:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
physician before the board I have had
 
04:21:53.929 --> 04:21:53.939 align:start position:0%
cases where uh peer review committees
 
04:21:56.269 --> 04:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
have reported to the board and the board
 
04:21:59.929 --> 04:21:59.939 align:start position:0%
has temporarily suspended the license of
 
04:22:01.370 --> 04:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
that physician they have the authority
 
04:22:03.170 --> 04:22:03.180 align:start position:0%
to do that for 10 days
 
04:22:05.090 --> 04:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
and then they also have the authority to
 
04:22:07.550 --> 04:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
go into court and seek an injunction
 
04:22:09.769 --> 04:22:09.779 align:start position:0%
against further practice by that
 
04:22:09.779 --> 04:22:11.210 align:start position:0%
against further practice by that
physician

04:22:11.210 --> 04:22:11.220 align:start position:0%
physician
 
04:22:15.250 --> 04:22:15.260 align:start position:0%
so there are there are statutory
 
04:22:18.469 --> 04:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
opportunities for immediate intervention
 
04:22:21.769 --> 04:22:21.779 align:start position:0%
in cases where there is perceived
 
04:22:23.809 --> 04:22:23.819 align:start position:0%
threatened harm
 
04:22:26.150 --> 04:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
so I'm just working on this scenario if
 
04:22:27.769 --> 04:22:27.779 align:start position:0%
you don't know what you don't know if
 
04:22:29.990 --> 04:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine is unaware that
 
04:22:31.849 --> 04:22:31.859 align:start position:0%
there's a credentialing board out there
 
04:22:35.269 --> 04:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
with some cons if poorly defined
 
04:22:37.910 --> 04:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
concerns they're they're just not even
 
04:22:40.670 --> 04:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
aware that there's a potential issue no
 
04:22:42.410 --> 04:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
and I think a lot of times credentials
 
04:22:44.870 --> 04:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
committees and peer review committees
 
04:22:46.910 --> 04:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
will try and address these things
 
04:22:51.050 --> 04:22:51.060 align:start position:0%
in-house because they can do so most
 
04:22:53.389 --> 04:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
efficiently and perhaps with the least
 
04:22:56.750 --> 04:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
damage to maybe an otherwise worthwhile
 
04:22:59.830 --> 04:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
physician yeah and and then if I may
 
04:23:02.450 --> 04:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
04:23:04.849 --> 04:23:04.859 align:start position:0%
um in your earlier testimony you
 
04:23:06.410 --> 04:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
mentioned that being on a credential
 
04:23:08.090 --> 04:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
sport it can be
 
04:23:09.830 --> 04:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
ugly nasty work because you're reviewing
 
04:23:12.950 --> 04:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
the work of your friends and stuff and I
 
04:23:15.889 --> 04:23:15.899 align:start position:0%
get that but I've worked in the real
 
04:23:18.769 --> 04:23:18.779 align:start position:0%
world too and and I just wonder if there
 
04:23:20.750 --> 04:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
are ever opportunities where somebody
 
04:23:24.290 --> 04:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
may be on a credentialing board and uses
 
04:23:27.410 --> 04:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
that power to go after an adversary a
 
04:23:30.050 --> 04:23:30.060 align:start position:0%
competitor someone that looked at his
 
04:23:33.290 --> 04:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
wife wrong or any any number of reasons
 
04:23:36.769 --> 04:23:36.779 align:start position:0%
other than behaving in an A Way
 
04:23:39.349 --> 04:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
displaying integrity and ethics have we
 
04:23:41.030 --> 04:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
have you ever hard to imagine because
 
04:23:43.070 --> 04:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
the people who are selected to sit on
 
04:23:45.229 --> 04:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
these credentials committees are
 
04:23:47.090 --> 04:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
regarded as
 
04:23:49.610 --> 04:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
the cream not only with most knowledge
 
04:23:52.550 --> 04:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
but High ethics all right and so you've
 
04:23:54.349 --> 04:23:54.359 align:start position:0%
just never noticed it you're working the
 
04:23:56.210 --> 04:23:56.220 align:start position:0%
other way I've never heard of it I mean
 
04:23:57.650 --> 04:23:57.660 align:start position:0%
I might have read it in the John Grisham
 
04:24:00.830 --> 04:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
novel but um I certainly have never
 
04:24:02.750 --> 04:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
heard of it in practice I've never read
 
04:24:04.790 --> 04:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
one of those so I just have a vivid
 
04:24:07.130 --> 04:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
imagination thank you
 
04:24:09.650 --> 04:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
anything else thank you counselor thank
 
04:24:09.660 --> 04:24:14.870 align:start position:0%
anything else thank you counselor thank

04:24:14.870 --> 04:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:17.389 --> 04:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes attorney Holly
 
04:24:17.399 --> 04:24:19.070 align:start position:0%

04:24:27.950 --> 04:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:30.410 --> 04:24:30.420 align:start position:0%
I do chairman uh I don't have it with me
 
04:24:31.910 --> 04:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
though I put my thoughts together for
 
04:24:33.830 --> 04:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
this committee meeting this weekend and
 
04:24:36.710 --> 04:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
you have written testimonies I will
 
04:24:38.630 --> 04:24:38.640 align:start position:0%

representative Edward says in fact it's

04:24:54.410 --> 04:24:54.420 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much chairman for
 
04:24:56.750 --> 04:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
competing this hearing and for allowing
 
04:24:58.550 --> 04:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
me to testify my name is Holly Haines
 
04:25:00.469 --> 04:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
I'm an attorney at Abramson Brown and
 
04:25:02.809 --> 04:25:02.819 align:start position:0%
Dugan in Manchester New Hampshire and I
 
04:25:05.330 --> 04:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
represent patients who have been harmed
 
04:25:08.450 --> 04:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
by medical errors and many who have been
 
04:25:11.210 --> 04:25:11.220 align:start position:0%
harmed by physicians who had committed
 
04:25:13.910 --> 04:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
numerous medical errors in the past and
 
04:25:16.790 --> 04:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
had not been disciplined
 
04:25:19.250 --> 04:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
this is a really important committee I'm
 
04:25:20.750 --> 04:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
glad that you're convening it I think
 
04:25:22.189 --> 04:25:22.199 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of different issues that
 
04:25:24.769 --> 04:25:24.779 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed the purpose of the
 
04:25:26.689 --> 04:25:26.699 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine is you
 
04:25:29.030 --> 04:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
we were discussing earlier is the first
 
04:25:30.410 --> 04:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
and foremost it's to protect the
 
04:25:32.030 --> 04:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
Integrity of the profession it's to make
 
04:25:33.349 --> 04:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
sure that doctors are practicing
 
04:25:34.729 --> 04:25:34.739 align:start position:0%
medicine safely
 
04:25:36.710 --> 04:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
the second is
 
04:25:40.610 --> 04:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
to protect the public and to do that
 
04:25:42.769 --> 04:25:42.779 align:start position:0%
you need to have transparency which is
 
04:25:45.349 --> 04:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
what this committee is about
 
04:25:48.290 --> 04:25:48.300 align:start position:0%
by disclosing both complaints or
 
04:25:50.689 --> 04:25:50.699 align:start position:0%
malpractice payments that are made on
 
04:25:55.010 --> 04:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
behalf of a physician and also claims
 
04:25:56.450 --> 04:25:56.460 align:start position:0%
that are brought against them or if
 
04:25:58.849 --> 04:25:58.859 align:start position:0%
discipline is imposed I want to address
 
04:26:00.349 --> 04:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
just a couple of points that were made
 
04:26:03.889 --> 04:26:03.899 align:start position:0%
by prior speakers if I may
 
04:26:03.899 --> 04:26:04.490 align:start position:0%
by prior speakers if I may
um

04:26:04.490 --> 04:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:07.010 --> 04:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
first Dr Conway
 
04:26:10.729 --> 04:26:10.739 align:start position:0%
um whose testimony was excellent uh said
 
04:26:12.830 --> 04:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
that if the Board of Medicine or the
 
04:26:14.389 --> 04:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
medical review subcommittee does not
 
04:26:16.429 --> 04:26:16.439 align:start position:0%
hear it as a board the board can't do
 
04:26:18.290 --> 04:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
anything about it
 
04:26:20.689 --> 04:26:20.699 align:start position:0%
um as this committee probably knows from
 
04:26:22.309 --> 04:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
the Boston Globe Spotlight article
 
04:26:24.410 --> 04:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
attorney Chuck Douglas did report this
 
04:26:25.870 --> 04:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
to the board in 2018
 
04:26:29.210 --> 04:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
and the board had full information about
 
04:26:31.910 --> 04:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
that at that time and could have
 
04:26:34.370 --> 04:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
conducted an investigation the board was
 
04:26:37.070 --> 04:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
presented I believe with medical records
 
04:26:42.110 --> 04:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:44.570 --> 04:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
a second question that was asked was
 
04:26:45.950 --> 04:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not the existence of a
 
04:26:47.750 --> 04:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreement in a settlement
 
04:26:49.969 --> 04:26:49.979 align:start position:0%
agreement May prohibit or limit what the
 
04:26:52.429 --> 04:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
board can do our office was actively
 
04:26:55.610 --> 04:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
involved in legislation in 2003 it's RSA
 
04:26:59.269 --> 04:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:59.279 --> 04:27:00.410 align:start position:0%
 
again

04:27:00.410 --> 04:27:00.420 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:27:00.420 --> 04:27:01.490 align:start position:0%
again
sure

04:27:01.490 --> 04:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:27:04.250 --> 04:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
um this is about whether or not nda's uh
 
04:27:06.349 --> 04:27:06.359 align:start position:0%
limit what the board can do could you
 
04:27:08.570 --> 04:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
cite the reference again please it's RSA
 
04:27:08.580 --> 04:27:10.910 align:start position:0%
cite the reference again please it's RSA
507e3

04:27:10.910 --> 04:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
507e3
 
04:27:15.010 --> 04:27:15.020 align:start position:0%
thank you and that statute prohibits
 
04:27:17.269 --> 04:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
confidential settlements from preventing
 
04:27:18.530 --> 04:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
people from reporting to the Board of
 
04:27:19.790 --> 04:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
Medicine it makes sure that all
 
04:27:21.530 --> 04:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
confidential settlements can be reported
 
04:27:23.809 --> 04:27:23.819 align:start position:0%
to the Board of Medicine
 
04:27:23.819 --> 04:27:26.689 align:start position:0%
to the Board of Medicine
um

04:27:26.689 --> 04:27:26.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:29.689 --> 04:27:29.699 align:start position:0%
with regard to it not being the statutes
 
04:27:31.849 --> 04:27:31.859 align:start position:0%
that are the problem that it's the
 
04:27:33.170 --> 04:27:33.180 align:start position:0%
hospital committees that are the problem
 
04:27:34.610 --> 04:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to disagree at all with
 
04:27:36.950 --> 04:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
attorney vanders and that it the
 
04:27:39.110 --> 04:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
hospital committees are a problem
 
04:27:41.689 --> 04:27:41.699 align:start position:0%
um in this state I think they should be
 
04:27:44.510 --> 04:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
more aggressive with disciplining
 
04:27:47.330 --> 04:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
their own as well but I do believe that
 
04:27:48.830 --> 04:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
there are significant problems with our
 
04:27:53.389 --> 04:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
statutes and I will lay those out in
 
04:27:55.729 --> 04:27:55.739 align:start position:0%
my written testimony for you that you
 
04:27:58.370 --> 04:27:58.380 align:start position:0%
will have later but the biggest problem
 
04:28:00.769 --> 04:28:00.779 align:start position:0%
that I think we have is that the statute
 
04:28:03.050 --> 04:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
itself is permissive for the Board of
 
04:28:04.250 --> 04:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
Medicine everything for the Board of
 
04:28:06.410 --> 04:28:06.420 align:start position:0%
Medicine is permissive the statute
 
04:28:08.809 --> 04:28:08.819 align:start position:0%
mandates that the Superior Court shall
 
04:28:11.030 --> 04:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
report actions to the board the statute
 
04:28:12.950 --> 04:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
mandates that insurers shall report
 
04:28:14.809 --> 04:28:14.819 align:start position:0%
payments to the board the statute
 
04:28:16.910 --> 04:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
mandates that hospitals and
 
04:28:18.649 --> 04:28:18.659 align:start position:0%
credentialing committees shall report
 
04:28:20.389 --> 04:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
adverse action and discipline to the
 
04:28:22.189 --> 04:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
board but
 
04:28:25.130 --> 04:28:25.140 align:start position:0%
the statute says that
 
04:28:31.550 --> 04:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
and the statute is uh 329.17 and 329 18.
 
04:28:33.830 --> 04:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
the board May undertake disciplinary
 
04:28:36.110 --> 04:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
proceedings the board May undertake
 
04:28:40.309 --> 04:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:42.229 --> 04:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
um every provision related to what the
 
04:28:44.210 --> 04:28:44.220 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine does is
 
04:28:46.250 --> 04:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
permissive but everything for every
 
04:28:48.229 --> 04:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
other reporting entity in the state of
 
04:28:50.689 --> 04:28:50.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is mandatory I submit that
 
04:28:52.550 --> 04:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
a simple change to the statute could be
 
04:28:53.990 --> 04:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
to make it mandatory as opposed to
 
04:28:56.269 --> 04:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
permissive that the Board of Medicine
 
04:28:59.450 --> 04:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
shall conduct disciplinary proceedings
 
04:29:01.450 --> 04:29:01.460 align:start position:0%
shall conduct formal investigations
 
04:29:01.460 --> 04:29:03.370 align:start position:0%
shall conduct formal investigations
shall

04:29:03.370 --> 04:29:03.380 align:start position:0%
shall
 
04:29:05.870 --> 04:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
undertake non-disciplinary remedial
 
04:29:08.389 --> 04:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
proceedings when appropriate it doesn't
 
04:29:10.250 --> 04:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
change any of the statutory Provisions
 
04:29:12.229 --> 04:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
for the reasons that discipline can or
 
04:29:15.849 --> 04:29:15.859 align:start position:0%
can be imposed and it's a very simple
 
04:29:19.729 --> 04:29:19.739 align:start position:0%
fix to the statute that I suggest
 
04:29:22.070 --> 04:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
would be easily done and it would give
 
04:29:24.469 --> 04:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine more Authority it
 
04:29:26.149 --> 04:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
would allow there to be more oversight
 
04:29:29.450 --> 04:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
over the practice of medicine and I
 
04:29:31.189 --> 04:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
suspect and respectfully submit that
 
04:29:33.530 --> 04:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
more discipline would be imposed and
 
04:29:36.830 --> 04:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
would be public for the public
 
04:29:39.710 --> 04:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
um with regard to the transparency issue
 
04:29:41.269 --> 04:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
that I know prompted this committee to
 
04:29:42.710 --> 04:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
be formed
 
04:29:44.210 --> 04:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
there were concerns because of
 
04:29:46.910 --> 04:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Board of Medicine reports
 
04:29:49.370 --> 04:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice payments that have
 
04:29:50.689 --> 04:29:50.699 align:start position:0%
been made whereas the New Hampshire
 
04:29:52.370 --> 04:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine does not
 
04:29:55.010 --> 04:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
you've heard from several people that
 
04:29:56.929 --> 04:29:56.939 align:start position:0%
the reporting of payments made is
 
04:29:58.550 --> 04:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
mandated by the National Practitioner
 
04:30:02.090 --> 04:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
Data Bank under federal law
 
04:30:04.610 --> 04:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
I submit that the New Hampshire Board of
 
04:30:06.189 --> 04:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
Medicine could make their website
 
04:30:08.469 --> 04:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
identical to Massachusetts
 
04:30:10.550 --> 04:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
by simply
 
04:30:12.710 --> 04:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
go into the National Practitioner Data
 
04:30:15.649 --> 04:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
Bank and taking the data of malpractice
 
04:30:17.870 --> 04:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
payments and putting it on the licensing
 
04:30:20.570 --> 04:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
form I realize that would be onerous and
 
04:30:22.870 --> 04:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
quite a task because there are 8 700
 
04:30:26.210 --> 04:30:26.220 align:start position:0%
licensed physicians in New Hampshire but
 
04:30:28.130 --> 04:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
each time a physician renews their
 
04:30:31.010 --> 04:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
license the board must go to the
 
04:30:32.809 --> 04:30:32.819 align:start position:0%
National Practitioner Data Bank anyhow
 
04:30:35.990 --> 04:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
they could go at renewal and update each
 
04:30:37.969 --> 04:30:37.979 align:start position:0%
Physician's licensing profile to include
 
04:30:40.250 --> 04:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
that information no patient names would
 
04:30:41.689 --> 04:30:41.699 align:start position:0%
be included no allegations of
 
04:30:43.370 --> 04:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
malpractice would be there there
 
04:30:45.889 --> 04:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be any privacy concerns and
 
04:30:47.809 --> 04:30:47.819 align:start position:0%
since physician licenses are renewed in
 
04:30:49.429 --> 04:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
six year Cycles six years from now
 
04:30:51.950 --> 04:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully our website would be up to
 
04:30:53.689 --> 04:30:53.699 align:start position:0%
date with public information have the
 
04:30:59.269 --> 04:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:59.279 --> 04:31:01.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:31:01.490 --> 04:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:05.330 --> 04:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
some other points that were made earlier
 
04:31:08.769 --> 04:31:08.779 align:start position:0%
I must disagree with uh my colleague
 
04:31:11.870 --> 04:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
attorney Vander zanden in her answer to
 
04:31:14.630 --> 04:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
representative solway's question
 
04:31:16.309 --> 04:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
I think the Board of Medicine could be
 
04:31:19.610 --> 04:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
proactive to do more I they certainly
 
04:31:22.130 --> 04:31:22.140 align:start position:0%
should be proactive to do more when they
 
04:31:23.630 --> 04:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
receive a complaint from the federal
 
04:31:25.550 --> 04:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
from the Superior Court when it is
 
04:31:27.649 --> 04:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
reported to them they should conduct an
 
04:31:28.849 --> 04:31:28.859 align:start position:0%
investigation they should have the
 
04:31:30.530 --> 04:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to do that and they
 
04:31:33.050 --> 04:31:33.060 align:start position:0%
should be mandatory right now they have
 
04:31:34.790 --> 04:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
the permissive authority to do that
 
04:31:36.410 --> 04:31:36.420 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that should be
 
04:31:37.790 --> 04:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
mandatory that should trigger an
 
04:31:39.710 --> 04:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
investigation and they should be given
 
04:31:41.750 --> 04:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
the authority to hire appropriate
 
04:31:44.510 --> 04:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
experts to conduct that investigation
 
04:31:46.670 --> 04:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
our office I know there are always
 
04:31:48.349 --> 04:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
concerns about
 
04:31:50.330 --> 04:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
um frivolous malpractice claims a
 
04:31:52.130 --> 04:31:52.140 align:start position:0%
malpractice crisis we've heard this for
 
04:31:52.140 --> 04:31:53.870 align:start position:0%
malpractice crisis we've heard this for
decades

04:31:53.870 --> 04:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
decades
 
04:31:56.149 --> 04:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
our office does almost exclusively
 
04:31:57.830 --> 04:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice we do some personal
 
04:32:01.309 --> 04:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
injury actions but by and large 95
 
04:32:02.689 --> 04:32:02.699 align:start position:0%
percent of our practices medical
 
04:32:05.689 --> 04:32:05.699 align:start position:0%
malpractice I looked at the recent data
 
04:32:07.849 --> 04:32:07.859 align:start position:0%
our last year of reporting we compile
 
04:32:09.710 --> 04:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
our data once a year
 
04:32:13.010 --> 04:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
um so from June 2020 to June 2021
 
04:32:16.729 --> 04:32:16.739 align:start position:0%
we received on average 150 calls or
 
04:32:19.429 --> 04:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
emails asking do I have a case
 
04:32:22.250 --> 04:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
that is about 1800 a year
 
04:32:24.290 --> 04:32:24.300 align:start position:0%
of those
 
04:32:27.229 --> 04:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
the vast majority are not meritorious at
 
04:32:30.229 --> 04:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
all we probably request medical records
 
04:32:33.590 --> 04:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
in one out of 10 of those maybe 15 out
 
04:32:36.229 --> 04:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
of the 150 a month those we have
 
04:32:38.149 --> 04:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
reviewed by a medical expert in the
 
04:32:40.429 --> 04:32:40.439 align:start position:0%
specialty that the person is complaining
 
04:32:43.910 --> 04:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
about and if our medical expert supports
 
04:32:44.870 --> 04:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
a claim
 
04:32:47.689 --> 04:32:47.699 align:start position:0%
then we file suit if our medical expert
 
04:32:49.610 --> 04:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
does not support a claim we explain that
 
04:32:53.330 --> 04:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
to the patient and we decline the case
 
04:32:56.990 --> 04:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
we probably file suit in one to two of
 
04:32:59.630 --> 04:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
the ones that we look at per month it is
 
04:33:01.610 --> 04:33:01.620 align:start position:0%
less than one percent of the intakes to
 
04:33:03.769 --> 04:33:03.779 align:start position:0%
our office that actually get filed in
 
04:33:05.869 --> 04:33:05.879 align:start position:0%
Superior Court so I know there are a lot
 
04:33:07.429 --> 04:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
of um
 
04:33:10.310 --> 04:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
concerns about frivolous claims but I
 
04:33:12.170 --> 04:33:12.180 align:start position:0%
would submit to you that attorneys in
 
04:33:13.670 --> 04:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I know there has been
 
04:33:15.470 --> 04:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
past testimony at the legislature there
 
04:33:17.029 --> 04:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
aren't frivolous claims in New Hampshire
 
04:33:18.949 --> 04:33:18.959 align:start position:0%
that are brought because they're so cost
 
04:33:21.289 --> 04:33:21.299 align:start position:0%
prohibitive to bring
 
04:33:23.090 --> 04:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
um for a plaintiff to hire medical
 
04:33:25.250 --> 04:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
experts to pursue that to pay for their
 
04:33:29.209 --> 04:33:29.219 align:start position:0%
medical records Imaging testing uh
 
04:33:31.970 --> 04:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
the costs are exorbitant and they are
 
04:33:34.189 --> 04:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
not going to take a chance on
 
04:33:36.709 --> 04:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
losing as you heard um and this is one
 
04:33:38.390 --> 04:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
of the other points that I would just
 
04:33:40.490 --> 04:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
like to clarify the vast majority of
 
04:33:42.650 --> 04:33:42.660 align:start position:0%
malpractice cases in New Hampshire that
 
04:33:45.529 --> 04:33:45.539 align:start position:0%
go to trial and that's the specific
 
04:33:47.929 --> 04:33:47.939 align:start position:0%
that's the most important part our
 
04:33:50.029 --> 04:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
defense verdicts but the vast majority
 
04:33:51.830 --> 04:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
of malpractice cases that are filed in
 
04:33:54.109 --> 04:33:54.119 align:start position:0%
Superior Court do not ever see a trial
 
04:33:55.849 --> 04:33:55.859 align:start position:0%
they don't ever see a courtroom because
 
04:33:58.849 --> 04:33:58.859 align:start position:0%
they are resolved out of court
 
04:34:01.369 --> 04:34:01.379 align:start position:0%
because they are meritorious claims so
 
04:34:03.650 --> 04:34:03.660 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of cases filed in
 
04:34:06.529 --> 04:34:06.539 align:start position:0%
Superior Court are meritorious and I
 
04:34:08.510 --> 04:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
would submit I know people have concerns
 
04:34:10.970 --> 04:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
I've heard some concerns expressed that
 
04:34:10.980 --> 04:34:11.810 align:start position:0%
I've heard some concerns expressed that
um

04:34:11.810 --> 04:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:13.910 --> 04:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
maybe an insurer made a payment because
 
04:34:15.830 --> 04:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's a nuisance payment they don't want
 
04:34:18.051 --> 04:34:18.061 align:start position:0%
to pay the exorbitant costs of taking
 
04:34:19.490 --> 04:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
the case to trial they don't want to pay
 
04:34:21.650 --> 04:34:21.660 align:start position:0%
their own experts so they make a
 
04:34:21.660 --> 04:34:22.789 align:start position:0%
their own experts so they make a
settlement

04:34:22.789 --> 04:34:22.799 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
04:34:24.590 --> 04:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
to pay a nuisance cost and that's going
 
04:34:26.209 --> 04:34:26.219 align:start position:0%
to be reported to the National
 
04:34:28.310 --> 04:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
Practitioner Data Bank
 
04:34:31.189 --> 04:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
I understand that that's a concern but I
 
04:34:33.529 --> 04:34:33.539 align:start position:0%
would submit that making the statute
 
04:34:36.349 --> 04:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
mandatory for board disciplined
 
04:34:36.359 --> 04:34:37.670 align:start position:0%
mandatory for board disciplined
investigations

04:34:37.670 --> 04:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
04:34:39.769 --> 04:34:39.779 align:start position:0%
in all of the situations where reporting
 
04:34:41.390 --> 04:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
is already mandatory in the superior
 
04:34:43.010 --> 04:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
court if it's been filed in the Superior
 
04:34:45.410 --> 04:34:45.420 align:start position:0%
Court the case has to have been vetted
 
04:34:47.631 --> 04:34:47.641 align:start position:0%
already by a medical expert attorneys
 
04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
have their own professional
 
04:34:50.689 --> 04:34:50.699 align:start position:0%
responsibility not to file mer uh
 
04:34:52.131 --> 04:34:52.141 align:start position:0%
frivolous claims
 
04:34:53.869 --> 04:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
that's one of the rules that we're
 
04:34:57.349 --> 04:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
subject to it has already been vetted if
 
04:34:59.269 --> 04:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
and insurer the statute requires that
 
04:35:01.490 --> 04:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
insurance companies anytime they set a
 
04:35:04.070 --> 04:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
reserve in a case meaning anytime there
 
04:35:05.929 --> 04:35:05.939 align:start position:0%
they receive a report of an injury to a
 
04:35:08.330 --> 04:35:08.340 align:start position:0%
patient by Medical Practice if they set
 
04:35:10.970 --> 04:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
a reserve and a case they have to report
 
04:35:12.529 --> 04:35:12.539 align:start position:0%
it to the Board of Medicine
 
04:35:14.570 --> 04:35:14.580 align:start position:0%
if an insurance company is setting a
 
04:35:16.250 --> 04:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
reserve in a case it meets the insurance
 
04:35:18.470 --> 04:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
company has had the claim reviewed by a
 
04:35:21.189 --> 04:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
medical expert already in that specialty
 
04:35:24.289 --> 04:35:24.299 align:start position:0%
likewise in the case of hospitals and
 
04:35:26.869 --> 04:35:26.879 align:start position:0%
credentialing committees if they report
 
04:35:30.230 --> 04:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
an action they have reviewed it by
 
04:35:32.209 --> 04:35:32.219 align:start position:0%
medical experts or at least Physicians
 
04:35:34.730 --> 04:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
within their hospital so all of these
 
04:35:36.051 --> 04:35:36.061 align:start position:0%
cases where the reporting is already
 
04:35:38.869 --> 04:35:38.879 align:start position:0%
mandatory to the board I submit the
 
04:35:41.330 --> 04:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
investigation disciplinary process by
 
04:35:43.310 --> 04:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
the board should be mandatory as well
 
04:35:45.109 --> 04:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
because all of those have at least
 
04:35:47.029 --> 04:35:47.039 align:start position:0%
passed an initial vetting of being
 
04:35:48.890 --> 04:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
reviewed by a medical expert those are
 
04:35:52.150 --> 04:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
not frivolous claims they are not the
 
04:35:54.650 --> 04:35:54.660 align:start position:0%
1800 people who call their office or
 
04:35:56.689 --> 04:35:56.699 align:start position:0%
email their office those are the one or
 
04:35:59.510 --> 04:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
two that had
 
04:36:01.189 --> 04:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
um Merit after being vetted by medical
 
04:36:04.189 --> 04:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
experts to the point that they got filed
 
04:36:07.310 --> 04:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
in court the vast majority would never
 
04:36:07.320 --> 04:36:07.970 align:start position:0%
in court the vast majority would never
um

04:36:07.970 --> 04:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:10.490 --> 04:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
get to that point
 
04:36:10.500 --> 04:36:12.830 align:start position:0%
get to that point
and

04:36:12.830 --> 04:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:36:14.570 --> 04:36:14.580 align:start position:0%
I think that was the last point that I
 
04:36:19.609 --> 04:36:19.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:21.170 --> 04:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
that the other attorneys had made and
 
04:36:23.209 --> 04:36:23.219 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer questions does
 
04:36:25.131 --> 04:36:25.141 align:start position:0%
anybody have a question for attorney
 
04:36:29.929 --> 04:36:29.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:33.051 --> 04:36:33.061 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to see if we could
 
04:36:36.289 --> 04:36:36.299 align:start position:0%
either substantiate or dismiss the
 
04:36:41.150 --> 04:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:46.429 --> 04:36:46.439 align:start position:0%
are you is is there any way of of
 
04:36:48.349 --> 04:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
figuring out
 
04:36:50.150 --> 04:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
I mean I love the statistics you've
 
04:36:53.689 --> 04:36:53.699 align:start position:0%
given us because it puts the issues into
 
04:36:57.650 --> 04:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
a far more clear perspective for me and
 
04:37:00.590 --> 04:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if there is any way of
 
04:37:03.590 --> 04:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
getting at the same kind of clarity
 
04:37:07.849 --> 04:37:07.859 align:start position:0%
with respect to the oh somebody just
 
04:37:10.070 --> 04:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
gets paid forty thousand dollars to go
 
04:37:10.080 --> 04:37:11.209 align:start position:0%
gets paid forty thousand dollars to go
away

04:37:11.209 --> 04:37:11.219 align:start position:0%
away
 
04:37:13.551 --> 04:37:13.561 align:start position:0%
um which I certainly have seen in the
 
04:37:15.709 --> 04:37:15.719 align:start position:0%
case of um
 
04:37:15.719 --> 04:37:17.631 align:start position:0%
case of um
um

04:37:17.631 --> 04:37:17.641 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:19.429 --> 04:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
insurance claims with respect to
 
04:37:21.470 --> 04:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
building losses and things like that but
 
04:37:23.869 --> 04:37:23.879 align:start position:0%
I I have no idea
 
04:37:26.929 --> 04:37:26.939 align:start position:0%
how prevalent that is or or how often
 
04:37:29.330 --> 04:37:29.340 align:start position:0%
that happens in the medical malpractice
 
04:37:30.709 --> 04:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
case so I don't know whether that's
 
04:37:33.470 --> 04:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
something we ought to think about or not
 
04:37:35.449 --> 04:37:35.459 align:start position:0%
and I wonder what your perspective on
 
04:37:37.789 --> 04:37:37.799 align:start position:0%
those is because if if it's not if it
 
04:37:39.410 --> 04:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen we don't have to worry
 
04:37:41.510 --> 04:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
about it anymore
 
04:37:43.670 --> 04:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
I suspect that it does happen I don't
 
04:37:45.170 --> 04:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
think that I'm the appropriate person to
 
04:37:46.609 --> 04:37:46.619 align:start position:0%
answer that question I know that there
 
04:37:48.051 --> 04:37:48.061 align:start position:0%
are multiple defense attorneys in the
 
04:37:50.689 --> 04:37:50.699 align:start position:0%
room who who defend our cases okay who
 
04:37:53.510 --> 04:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
may be able to better speak to that okay
 
04:37:56.209 --> 04:37:56.219 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:37:59.209 --> 04:37:59.219 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh uh thank you
 
04:37:59.219 --> 04:38:00.470 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh uh thank you
so

04:38:00.470 --> 04:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:38:03.170 --> 04:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
um I I what you said makes perfect sense
 
04:38:05.029 --> 04:38:05.039 align:start position:0%
that you would have an internal vetting
 
04:38:07.670 --> 04:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
process that requires a medical review
 
04:38:09.769 --> 04:38:09.779 align:start position:0%
before you decide whether or not the
 
04:38:12.830 --> 04:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
case had Merit was worthy of pursuit
 
04:38:16.131 --> 04:38:16.141 align:start position:0%
uh but I assume two things and maybe you
 
04:38:16.141 --> 04:38:17.650 align:start position:0%
uh but I assume two things and maybe you
could

04:38:17.650 --> 04:38:17.660 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:38:20.390 --> 04:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
explode either or both of them I I
 
04:38:23.750 --> 04:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
assume that um that that that internal
 
04:38:26.510 --> 04:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
medical vetting is just good legal
 
04:38:29.810 --> 04:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
practice and is not required in order to
 
04:38:31.609 --> 04:38:31.619 align:start position:0%
be able to file a suit so there's
 
04:38:33.349 --> 04:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
there's you're not you're not required
 
04:38:35.209 --> 04:38:35.219 align:start position:0%
to do that it just makes sense to do
 
04:38:38.150 --> 04:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
that and and the other assumption would
 
04:38:41.510 --> 04:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
be that there may be some uh young
 
04:38:43.670 --> 04:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
attorneys out there with a shingle that
 
04:38:46.970 --> 04:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
they've hung that don't yet have a
 
04:38:49.189 --> 04:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
developed practice to include a medical
 
04:38:51.590 --> 04:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
review who could file
 
04:38:54.470 --> 04:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
a malpractice suit without the due
 
04:38:56.330 --> 04:38:56.340 align:start position:0%
diligence that your firm puts into it
 
04:38:59.150 --> 04:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
what how do you deal with those two kind
 
04:39:02.029 --> 04:39:02.039 align:start position:0%
of assumptions so the first
 
04:39:04.609 --> 04:39:04.619 align:start position:0%
I respectfully believe is incorrect
 
04:39:06.650 --> 04:39:06.660 align:start position:0%
um there are statutory requirements to
 
04:39:08.209 --> 04:39:08.219 align:start position:0%
file a malpractice suit in New Hampshire
 
04:39:10.670 --> 04:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
and the statute requires
 
04:39:13.250 --> 04:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
um an expert witness to support each of
 
04:39:15.470 --> 04:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
the elements of a claim and the statute
 
04:39:18.170 --> 04:39:18.180 align:start position:0%
has four specific elements so in order
 
04:39:21.230 --> 04:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
to file a claim an attorney would have a
 
04:39:23.029 --> 04:39:23.039 align:start position:0%
professional obligation to have a
 
04:39:25.310 --> 04:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
medical expert that can support this
 
04:39:27.470 --> 04:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
does that mean that a pro se litigant
 
04:39:30.051 --> 04:39:30.061 align:start position:0%
would not I don't know that there there
 
04:39:31.910 --> 04:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
may be and I believe that there are some
 
04:39:35.390 --> 04:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
prosely litigants who do file claims
 
04:39:37.368 --> 04:39:37.378 align:start position:0%
on their own behalf and may not have
 
04:39:38.810 --> 04:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
medical experts I know that some have
 
04:39:40.010 --> 04:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
been dismissed
 
04:39:42.708 --> 04:39:42.718 align:start position:0%
could a young attorney or would a young
 
04:39:44.090 --> 04:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
attorney do that I would hope that they
 
04:39:45.288 --> 04:39:45.298 align:start position:0%
don't because there are statutory
 
04:39:47.150 --> 04:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
requirements and I would hope that they
 
04:39:48.830 --> 04:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
would call
 
04:39:51.410 --> 04:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
our office or refer the case to our
 
04:39:53.390 --> 04:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
office or not try to get and delve into
 
04:39:55.310 --> 04:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
an area that they don't have experience
 
04:39:58.010 --> 04:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
with do you have the citation of the
 
04:39:59.750 --> 04:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
statute at hand
 
04:40:03.670 --> 04:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh yes it's RSA
 
04:40:06.590 --> 04:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
507e4 I believe that has the elements of
 
04:40:09.410 --> 04:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:11.390 --> 04:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
yeah you you would want to look the
 
04:40:13.910 --> 04:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
medical injury statute the chapters RSA
 
04:40:17.270 --> 04:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
507e thank you representative Ed would
 
04:40:19.610 --> 04:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
you want to follow up yes and thank you
 
04:40:22.368 --> 04:40:22.378 align:start position:0%
for the education I I have to admit I've
 
04:40:25.130 --> 04:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
not read every RSA uh so I appreciate
 
04:40:29.690 --> 04:40:29.700 align:start position:0%
the education the um okay so so because
 
04:40:31.368 --> 04:40:31.378 align:start position:0%
you're doing the medical vetting
 
04:40:34.788 --> 04:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
in-house it seems to me like
 
04:40:36.830 --> 04:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
um you're you're you have an implicit
 
04:40:40.130 --> 04:40:40.140 align:start position:0%
argument that that may there may be
 
04:40:43.070 --> 04:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
sufficient due diligence just on the
 
04:40:46.850 --> 04:40:46.860 align:start position:0%
basis of your internal work that would
 
04:40:49.310 --> 04:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
be sufficient for us to do public
 
04:40:52.070 --> 04:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
reporting that a malpractice suit has
 
04:40:54.590 --> 04:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
been filed at this point we're not the
 
04:40:57.530 --> 04:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine is not reporting those
 
04:40:59.530 --> 04:40:59.540 align:start position:0%
um but but
 
04:41:02.510 --> 04:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
would it is it wrong of me to think that
 
04:41:06.288 --> 04:41:06.298 align:start position:0%
you're implying that you your firms are
 
04:41:08.810 --> 04:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
doing enough work that we should it
 
04:41:11.868 --> 04:41:11.878 align:start position:0%
should be a able to be substantiated as
 
04:41:13.910 --> 04:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
reportable eye action
 
04:41:16.010 --> 04:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
just the seat filing of the suit itself
 
04:41:18.110 --> 04:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
I think the fact that a suit has been
 
04:41:20.628 --> 04:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
filed could absolutely be reported or
 
04:41:22.310 --> 04:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely should be reported and the
 
04:41:23.628 --> 04:41:23.638 align:start position:0%
fact that a suit has been filed it's
 
04:41:25.190 --> 04:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
already public record in the Superior
 
04:41:25.200 --> 04:41:28.330 align:start position:0%
already public record in the Superior
Court

04:41:28.330 --> 04:41:28.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:30.590 --> 04:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
04:41:32.810 --> 04:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
um I want to get to the permissive part
 
04:41:36.288 --> 04:41:36.298 align:start position:0%
changing maze the shells and um are you
 
04:41:39.288 --> 04:41:39.298 align:start position:0%
familiar with like the main mass or
 
04:41:41.990 --> 04:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
Vermont statutes would would the
 
04:41:45.070 --> 04:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
changing our maze the shells make us
 
04:41:48.110 --> 04:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
very much like the surrounding states or
 
04:41:51.770 --> 04:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
or would we be getting into a a more
 
04:41:54.350 --> 04:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
rigid environment than they're in I do
 
04:41:55.730 --> 04:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
not know I haven't looked at any of
 
04:41:58.128 --> 04:41:58.138 align:start position:0%
those State statutes all right then you
 
04:42:00.770 --> 04:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
have a homework assignment but no I'm
 
04:42:04.010 --> 04:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:07.128 --> 04:42:07.138 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:42:14.390 --> 04:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:31.310 --> 04:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:35.930 --> 04:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:37.670 --> 04:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
I want to thank everybody for having
 
04:42:39.110 --> 04:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
this hearing
 
04:42:41.330 --> 04:42:41.340 align:start position:0%
my name is Sean mcgorry I'm not an
 
04:42:41.340 --> 04:42:42.070 align:start position:0%
my name is Sean mcgorry I'm not an
attorney

04:42:42.070 --> 04:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
04:42:45.650 --> 04:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
I am not a physician I don't work at a
 
04:42:49.610 --> 04:42:49.620 align:start position:0%
hospital I represent my sister who
 
04:42:53.510 --> 04:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
could possibly be tragic case number 22
 
04:42:58.128 --> 04:42:58.138 align:start position:0%
who died at the hands of Yvonne barabo
 
04:43:00.948 --> 04:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
we found out some years after her
 
04:43:04.310 --> 04:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
surgery that he had been suspended the
 
04:43:07.490 --> 04:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
summer before her surgery
 
04:43:12.170 --> 04:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:13.788 --> 04:43:13.798 align:start position:0%
she would not have gone forward with the
 
04:43:15.830 --> 04:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
surgery she was nervous about the
 
04:43:18.410 --> 04:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
surgery to begin with
 
04:43:21.230 --> 04:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
but without proper information how can a
 
04:43:23.510 --> 04:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
patient give consent
 
04:43:25.850 --> 04:43:25.860 align:start position:0%
for that surgeon to do surgery if they
 
04:43:29.868 --> 04:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:31.070 --> 04:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
to me
 
04:43:33.590 --> 04:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine Catholic Medical
 
04:43:37.368 --> 04:43:37.378 align:start position:0%
Center failed my sister
 
04:43:40.910 --> 04:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
because the information is not reported
 
04:43:42.830 --> 04:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
she was not able to make an informed
 
04:43:44.930 --> 04:43:44.940 align:start position:0%
decision about who was going to perform
 
04:43:44.940 --> 04:43:46.250 align:start position:0%
decision about who was going to perform
surgery

04:43:46.250 --> 04:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
surgery
 
04:43:48.650 --> 04:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
as a family we made a decision that we
 
04:43:50.868 --> 04:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
were not going to file a lawsuit because
 
04:43:52.368 --> 04:43:52.378 align:start position:0%
we felt as though with open heart
 
04:43:54.890 --> 04:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
surgery there is a human element to that
 
04:43:57.830 --> 04:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
surgery that things can go wrong
 
04:44:00.470 --> 04:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
had we had that information
 
04:44:02.208 --> 04:44:02.218 align:start position:0%
perhaps our decision would have been
 
04:44:02.218 --> 04:44:04.610 align:start position:0%
perhaps our decision would have been
different

04:44:04.610 --> 04:44:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:06.948 --> 04:44:06.958 align:start position:0%
I'm not looking to get involved in any
 
04:44:09.770 --> 04:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
lawsuits I'm not looking to gain any
 
04:44:13.128 --> 04:44:13.138 align:start position:0%
monetary settlement from this what I'm
 
04:44:15.288 --> 04:44:15.298 align:start position:0%
looking for is I'm looking to hold the
 
04:44:18.650 --> 04:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
hospital responsible for failing to
 
04:44:20.628 --> 04:44:20.638 align:start position:0%
provide the information and to protect
 
04:44:24.110 --> 04:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:26.930 --> 04:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
she had the surgery
 
04:44:29.510 --> 04:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
we got a call the next morning that
 
04:44:31.490 --> 04:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
something had gone wrong
 
04:44:34.010 --> 04:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
the afternoon of the surgery Yvonne
 
04:44:35.868 --> 04:44:35.878 align:start position:0%
barabow told us that the surgery went
 
04:44:38.030 --> 04:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
great and he finished it in almost
 
04:44:41.448 --> 04:44:41.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:43.788 --> 04:44:43.798 align:start position:0%
then there was an incident of
 
04:44:46.310 --> 04:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
catastrophic brain swelling and I will
 
04:44:49.150 --> 04:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
remember that word until the day I die
 
04:44:52.430 --> 04:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
catastrophic brain swelling which they
 
04:44:57.770 --> 04:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:01.250 --> 04:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
she never came out of the anesthesia she
 
04:45:03.830 --> 04:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
never regained consciousness
 
04:45:07.128 --> 04:45:07.138 align:start position:0%
we my brother actually questioned it
 
04:45:09.170 --> 04:45:09.180 align:start position:0%
several hours after the surgery because
 
04:45:10.910 --> 04:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
she had already had one valve
 
04:45:13.490 --> 04:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
replacement performed
 
04:45:15.410 --> 04:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
and she was not responding to any
 
04:45:18.170 --> 04:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
touches any speech anything else hours
 
04:45:20.810 --> 04:45:20.820 align:start position:0%
after the surgery
 
04:45:25.910 --> 04:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
so on Wednesday after her surgery my 87
 
04:45:28.610 --> 04:45:28.620 align:start position:0%
year old mother had to watch for two
 
04:45:31.010 --> 04:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
minutes to see if her daughter's chest
 
04:45:33.830 --> 04:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
would rise on its own
 
04:45:37.150 --> 04:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:40.850 --> 04:45:40.860 align:start position:0%
that is negligence on the part of the
 
04:45:43.970 --> 04:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
hospital the doctor and they all failed
 
04:45:46.128 --> 04:45:46.138 align:start position:0%
my sister because they didn't want to
 
04:45:48.050 --> 04:45:48.060 align:start position:0%
share that information they could have
 
04:45:49.910 --> 04:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
shared that information
 
04:45:51.770 --> 04:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
she should have been made aware that he
 
04:45:53.208 --> 04:45:53.218 align:start position:0%
had been suspended
 
04:45:55.550 --> 04:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
if I'm not mistaken he was on limited
 
04:45:58.128 --> 04:45:58.138 align:start position:0%
privileges at the time of my sister's
 
04:45:58.138 --> 04:45:59.690 align:start position:0%
privileges at the time of my sister's
surgery

04:45:59.690 --> 04:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
surgery
 
04:46:04.368 --> 04:46:04.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:07.208 --> 04:46:07.218 align:start position:0%
so I'm not talking about
 
04:46:09.170 --> 04:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
lawsuits I'm not talking about anything
 
04:46:10.430 --> 04:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
that we can talk about insurance
 
04:46:12.050 --> 04:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
companies all we want
 
04:46:15.350 --> 04:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
as a manager of a business if I have an
 
04:46:18.410 --> 04:46:18.420 align:start position:0%
employee who gets hurt yet had a prior
 
04:46:18.420 --> 04:46:20.330 align:start position:0%
employee who gets hurt yet had a prior
injury

04:46:20.330 --> 04:46:20.340 align:start position:0%
injury
 
04:46:22.310 --> 04:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
the workers comp insurance can settle
 
04:46:25.190 --> 04:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
and I have no say why are doctor's any
 
04:46:25.200 --> 04:46:28.970 align:start position:0%
and I have no say why are doctor's any
different

04:46:28.970 --> 04:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:31.970 --> 04:46:31.980 align:start position:0%
we're talking about human beings
 
04:46:34.610 --> 04:46:34.620 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about hospitals we're
 
04:46:37.368 --> 04:46:37.378 align:start position:0%
not talking about insurance companies my
 
04:46:40.070 --> 04:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
sister is a human being who's not here
 
04:46:40.080 --> 04:46:41.570 align:start position:0%
sister is a human being who's not here
anymore

04:46:41.570 --> 04:46:41.580 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
04:46:43.788 --> 04:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the transparency
 
04:46:46.010 --> 04:46:46.020 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:46:47.868 --> 04:46:47.878 align:start position:0%
I personally would like to thank the
 
04:46:49.910 --> 04:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
Boston Globe for bringing this
 
04:46:52.368 --> 04:46:52.378 align:start position:0%
information forth because clearly none
 
04:46:53.868 --> 04:46:53.878 align:start position:0%
of the media agencies in New Hampshire
 
04:46:53.878 --> 04:46:56.090 align:start position:0%
of the media agencies in New Hampshire
did

04:46:56.090 --> 04:46:56.100 align:start position:0%
did
 
04:46:58.490 --> 04:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
and again I just think that's
 
04:47:01.368 --> 04:47:01.378 align:start position:0%
reprehensible that nobody ever looked
 
04:47:03.708 --> 04:47:03.718 align:start position:0%
into this
 
04:47:06.830 --> 04:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
and to call them tragic outcomes
 
04:47:08.750 --> 04:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
to me dismisses what really happened
 
04:47:11.570 --> 04:47:11.580 align:start position:0%
there weren't tragic outcomes
 
04:47:13.430 --> 04:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
there were negligence on the part of the
 
04:47:16.490 --> 04:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
doctor that resulted in people's deaths
 
04:47:18.230 --> 04:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
let's break it down to what it is it's
 
04:47:22.010 --> 04:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
not a tragic outcome people died
 
04:47:24.050 --> 04:47:24.060 align:start position:0%
because we aren't transparent in the
 
04:47:27.050 --> 04:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:28.970 --> 04:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
if I'm not mistaken we report the
 
04:47:31.430 --> 04:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
disciplinary records of police officers
 
04:47:35.270 --> 04:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:37.250 --> 04:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
why are doctors held
 
04:47:38.810 --> 04:47:38.820 align:start position:0%
to a higher level that they don't need
 
04:47:38.820 --> 04:47:45.288 align:start position:0%
to a higher level that they don't need
that

04:47:45.288 --> 04:47:45.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:48.170 --> 04:47:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:50.270 --> 04:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
should anybody have a question would you
 
04:47:57.770 --> 04:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:57.780 --> 04:47:59.990 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:47:59.990 --> 04:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:48:08.570 --> 04:48:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:11.990 --> 04:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes Dr Emily Baker from
 
04:48:27.230 --> 04:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:30.230 --> 04:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
pass the first test
 
04:48:32.930 --> 04:48:32.940 align:start position:0%
I'm Emily Baker I'm the current
 
04:48:36.050 --> 04:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
president of the Board of Medicine
 
04:48:38.410 --> 04:48:38.420 align:start position:0%
I've been a full-time practicing
 
04:48:41.868 --> 04:48:41.878 align:start position:0%
obstetrician in our state for 29 years
 
04:48:44.690 --> 04:48:44.700 align:start position:0%
and the pleasure of serving women and
 
04:48:45.830 --> 04:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
their families
 
04:48:47.448 --> 04:48:47.458 align:start position:0%
I've been the Board of Medicine for
 
04:48:49.128 --> 04:48:49.138 align:start position:0%
eight years
 
04:48:53.390 --> 04:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
serving the citizens of New Hampshire
 
04:48:56.990 --> 04:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
the board is comprised of medical
 
04:48:59.510 --> 04:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
doctors osteopaths physician assistant
 
04:49:02.750 --> 04:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
and public members the members are very
 
04:49:05.090 --> 04:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
important to us
 
04:49:08.570 --> 04:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
the board knows I know that it's my
 
04:49:10.670 --> 04:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
primary responsibility to Serve and
 
04:49:13.550 --> 04:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
Protect the citizens of New Hampshire
 
04:49:16.368 --> 04:49:16.378 align:start position:0%
there is not a meeting
 
04:49:18.770 --> 04:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
that goes by where somebody doesn't say
 
04:49:20.208 --> 04:49:20.218 align:start position:0%
out loud
 
04:49:22.670 --> 04:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
my role here is to protect the citizens
 
04:49:24.530 --> 04:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
04:49:27.590 --> 04:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
so when it's been very difficult for us
 
04:49:30.770 --> 04:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
me board hasn't met yet so
 
04:49:33.230 --> 04:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
since the globe articles
 
04:49:35.448 --> 04:49:35.458 align:start position:0%
because we do take it seriously and have
 
04:49:38.690 --> 04:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
the press and comments made making the
 
04:49:41.390 --> 04:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
assumption that we don't has been hard
 
04:49:44.390 --> 04:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
because we do take it very seriously and
 
04:49:46.610 --> 04:49:46.620 align:start position:0%
we do investigate the board sees
 
04:49:46.620 --> 04:49:47.690 align:start position:0%
we do investigate the board sees
everything

04:49:47.690 --> 04:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
everything
 
04:49:49.430 --> 04:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
that we get
 
04:49:52.070 --> 04:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
but if we don't see something we can't
 
04:49:54.590 --> 04:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
act on it we can't evaluate it
 
04:49:59.090 --> 04:49:59.100 align:start position:0%
we did not see 20 of 21 of the things on
 
04:50:00.410 --> 04:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
the board of Registration of Medicine
 
04:50:02.150 --> 04:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
and Mass
 
04:50:04.190 --> 04:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
so that's a small thing but just letting
 
04:50:06.650 --> 04:50:06.660 align:start position:0%
you know as an example that was not a
 
04:50:08.448 --> 04:50:08.458 align:start position:0%
piece of information that we had that we
 
04:50:09.830 --> 04:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
could act on
 
04:50:12.708 --> 04:50:12.718 align:start position:0%
I'm not here to talk about specifics
 
04:50:15.170 --> 04:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
because I can't disclose
 
04:50:17.270 --> 04:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
certainly things that were held in
 
04:50:17.280 --> 04:50:19.610 align:start position:0%
certainly things that were held in
confidentiality

04:50:19.610 --> 04:50:19.620 align:start position:0%
confidentiality
 
04:50:22.010 --> 04:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
one of the a lot of this stuff has been
 
04:50:23.150 --> 04:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
04:50:25.850 --> 04:50:25.860 align:start position:0%
with you know am I prepared stuff that's
 
04:50:28.190 --> 04:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
already been spoken about
 
04:50:33.530 --> 04:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
yeah I have this I'm bad about my the my
 
04:50:36.470 --> 04:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
voice doesn't carry very well so
 
04:50:38.810 --> 04:50:38.820 align:start position:0%
it is always a problem
 
04:50:40.430 --> 04:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that just got
 
04:50:43.368 --> 04:50:43.378 align:start position:0%
brought up about making the assumption
 
04:50:46.850 --> 04:50:46.860 align:start position:0%
that the board does not take on cases
 
04:50:49.310 --> 04:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
that are in process of tort
 
04:50:52.250 --> 04:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
when we see a
 
04:50:55.910 --> 04:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
case coming and we see all the lawsuits
 
04:50:59.750 --> 04:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
we don't hold back on starting our own
 
04:51:01.610 --> 04:51:01.620 align:start position:0%
investigation to letting the tort
 
04:51:03.948 --> 04:51:03.958 align:start position:0%
process go on and that's a change that
 
04:51:06.110 --> 04:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
happened during my few years on the
 
04:51:09.948 --> 04:51:09.958 align:start position:0%
board for some time we would say yep
 
04:51:11.690 --> 04:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
it's going to be we're sorry it could be
 
04:51:13.970 --> 04:51:13.980 align:start position:0%
prejudicial to you the doctor if we do
 
04:51:16.670 --> 04:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
ours because if we take action that's
 
04:51:19.550 --> 04:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
going to impact on your tort process we
 
04:51:20.930 --> 04:51:20.940 align:start position:0%
don't do that
 
04:51:23.690 --> 04:51:23.700 align:start position:0%
we now look at them we do start
 
04:51:26.868 --> 04:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
investigating even before the it's run
 
04:51:28.788 --> 04:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
through because it takes years
 
04:51:32.150 --> 04:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
and years to go through the legal
 
04:51:34.368 --> 04:51:34.378 align:start position:0%
process claim to be made you know
 
04:51:37.010 --> 04:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
Discovery testimony so it takes a long
 
04:51:39.708 --> 04:51:39.718 align:start position:0%
time so we're no longer waiting you just
 
04:51:42.050 --> 04:51:42.060 align:start position:0%
have to get started
 
04:51:44.570 --> 04:51:44.580 align:start position:0%
um so that's one one piece I wanted why
 
04:51:44.580 --> 04:51:46.190 align:start position:0%
um so that's one one piece I wanted why
not

04:51:46.190 --> 04:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:51:46.200 --> 04:51:47.030 align:start position:0%
not
um

04:51:47.030 --> 04:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:49.610 --> 04:51:49.620 align:start position:0%
the other thing
 
04:51:52.010 --> 04:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
briefly take a second because one of the
 
04:51:53.930 --> 04:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
things that got brought up in all this
 
04:51:56.868 --> 04:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
was how does New Hampshire compare so
 
04:52:00.050 --> 04:52:00.060 align:start position:0%
the Federation of State Medical boards
 
04:52:03.050 --> 04:52:03.060 align:start position:0%
is the National Organization it does a
 
04:52:06.650 --> 04:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
lot for us it's part of the the public
 
04:52:09.470 --> 04:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
data banks it does
 
04:52:12.110 --> 04:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
um licensing examinations for residents
 
04:52:14.390 --> 04:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
for um students
 
04:52:16.430 --> 04:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
but it also pays attention to everything
 
04:52:19.070 --> 04:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
each one of the boards does right
 
04:52:23.090 --> 04:52:23.100 align:start position:0%
so I went to their most recent document
 
04:52:24.770 --> 04:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
about looking what all of the
 
04:52:28.070 --> 04:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
individuals boards do and then this can
 
04:52:30.110 --> 04:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
take a second to read one of the things
 
04:52:33.110 --> 04:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
that they ended up concluding
 
04:52:36.770 --> 04:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
the tremendous sorry variation in
 
04:52:39.110 --> 04:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
statutory funding judicial
 
04:52:41.090 --> 04:52:41.100 align:start position:0%
administrative and Geographic
 
04:52:43.910 --> 04:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
environments from state to state
 
04:52:46.310 --> 04:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
precludes any meaningful comparative
 
04:52:48.470 --> 04:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
reporting of disciplinary statistics by
 
04:52:48.480 --> 04:52:49.310 align:start position:0%
reporting of disciplinary statistics by
state

04:52:49.310 --> 04:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:52:52.850 --> 04:52:52.860 align:start position:0%
and we're all different and so
 
04:52:56.090 --> 04:52:56.100 align:start position:0%
I think it's going to be very important
 
04:52:58.250 --> 04:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
and I think the FSNB is actually a very
 
04:52:59.690 --> 04:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
good resource because there are
 
04:53:01.250 --> 04:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
documents that say this is what Arizona
 
04:53:04.070 --> 04:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
does this is what New Hampshire does so
 
04:53:06.470 --> 04:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
I can get it for you
 
04:53:08.510 --> 04:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
those documents exist and that's what
 
04:53:11.990 --> 04:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
the fsmv can provide for you
 
04:53:12.000 --> 04:53:13.190 align:start position:0%
the fsmv can provide for you
um

04:53:13.190 --> 04:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:16.670 --> 04:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh let's see the the most the
 
04:53:19.430 --> 04:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
the most recent discussion about having
 
04:53:22.910 --> 04:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
the Torah process inform what we should
 
04:53:22.920 --> 04:53:25.190 align:start position:0%
the Torah process inform what we should
report

04:53:25.190 --> 04:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
report
 
04:53:28.490 --> 04:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
shall report the
 
04:53:28.500 --> 04:53:30.350 align:start position:0%
shall report the
we

04:53:30.350 --> 04:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:53:34.310 --> 04:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
do have our experts and we look at
 
04:53:39.050 --> 04:53:39.060 align:start position:0%
everything and act on cases and it makes
 
04:53:41.208 --> 04:53:41.218 align:start position:0%
me feel a little nervous having the tort
 
04:53:44.690 --> 04:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
process be what drives the valuations of
 
04:53:46.490 --> 04:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
Physicians and you've already brought up
 
04:53:49.250 --> 04:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
some of the questions about
 
04:53:50.570 --> 04:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:53:50.580 --> 04:53:51.910 align:start position:0%
you know
um

04:53:51.910 --> 04:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:54.530 --> 04:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
professionalism lawyers to lawyers I
 
04:53:56.270 --> 04:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
mean I
 
04:53:58.368 --> 04:53:58.378 align:start position:0%
I grew up in family lawyers
 
04:54:00.650 --> 04:54:00.660 align:start position:0%
my dad's a federal judge so I understand
 
04:54:03.470 --> 04:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of this and I don't I'm not
 
04:54:05.208 --> 04:54:05.218 align:start position:0%
frightened by a large legal system but I
 
04:54:07.970 --> 04:54:07.980 align:start position:0%
want to have us at least stop and think
 
04:54:10.250 --> 04:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
about do how much do we want to divest
 
04:54:12.708 --> 04:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
to the legal process in terms of
 
04:54:13.970 --> 04:54:13.980 align:start position:0%
preparing what we're going to do for
 
04:54:21.050 --> 04:54:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:25.250 --> 04:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
you brought up a point about licenses
 
04:54:27.288 --> 04:54:27.298 align:start position:0%
that's one of the
 
04:54:30.770 --> 04:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
giving a license to a licensee is one of
 
04:54:32.090 --> 04:54:32.100 align:start position:0%
the things that we spend a lot of time
 
04:54:32.100 --> 04:54:33.050 align:start position:0%
the things that we spend a lot of time
on

04:54:33.050 --> 04:54:33.060 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:54:35.510 --> 04:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
we get all of the licenses where there's
 
04:54:38.868 --> 04:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
been any sort of deviation failed an
 
04:54:42.050 --> 04:54:42.060 align:start position:0%
exam have a lawsuit and we spend a bunch
 
04:54:44.208 --> 04:54:44.218 align:start position:0%
of time talking about that so because if
 
04:54:46.250 --> 04:54:46.260 align:start position:0%
you once you let them in
 
04:54:49.670 --> 04:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
so we're very careful about that and we
 
04:54:52.128 --> 04:54:52.138 align:start position:0%
don't give everybody a license
 
04:54:56.330 --> 04:54:56.340 align:start position:0%
and we spent a long time on all these
 
04:54:59.990 --> 04:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
investigations that get started so our
 
04:55:03.530 --> 04:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
days we're they're all day long and we
 
04:55:06.288 --> 04:55:06.298 align:start position:0%
evaluate everything that's brought to us
 
04:55:06.298 --> 04:55:08.628 align:start position:0%
evaluate everything that's brought to us
and

04:55:08.628 --> 04:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:55:10.730 --> 04:55:10.740 align:start position:0%
very few end up being severe enough for
 
04:55:12.890 --> 04:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
discipline that's true for all states
 
04:55:12.900 --> 04:55:14.390 align:start position:0%
discipline that's true for all states
because

04:55:14.390 --> 04:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:55:16.310 --> 04:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of stuff comes in they didn't have
 
04:55:19.490 --> 04:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
a billing the doctor was mean to me some
 
04:55:22.610 --> 04:55:22.620 align:start position:0%
things are serious but it's the doctor
 
04:55:24.590 --> 04:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
comes and he says to us
 
04:55:26.390 --> 04:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
I made a mistake
 
04:55:27.770 --> 04:55:27.780 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:55:30.650 --> 04:55:30.660 align:start position:0%
does that person go to discipline and
 
04:55:32.030 --> 04:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
never learn from that mistake because
 
04:55:34.788 --> 04:55:34.798 align:start position:0%
now they're patients don't trust them
 
04:55:36.830 --> 04:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
anymore so
 
04:55:38.810 --> 04:55:38.820 align:start position:0%
and you
 
04:55:40.190 --> 04:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
I guess it's probably easier for me to
 
04:55:42.288 --> 04:55:42.298 align:start position:0%
take questions from you
 
04:55:49.010 --> 04:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:50.868 --> 04:55:50.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you very
 
04:55:53.930 --> 04:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony here today
 
04:55:53.940 --> 04:55:54.590 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony here today
um

04:55:54.590 --> 04:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:54.600 --> 04:55:57.110 align:start position:0%
um
I'm

04:55:57.110 --> 04:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
04:56:00.350 --> 04:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
trying increasingly dividing things into
 
04:56:02.390 --> 04:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
several different strands one of which
 
04:56:07.310 --> 04:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
is when do we report publicly
 
04:56:10.550 --> 04:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
but the other strand is when do we start
 
04:56:13.128 --> 04:56:13.138 align:start position:0%
to investigate
 
04:56:16.250 --> 04:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
and what I think I want to ask other
 
04:56:17.810 --> 04:56:17.820 align:start position:0%
than um
 
04:56:21.128 --> 04:56:21.138 align:start position:0%
is the fsmd is that a publicly available
 
04:56:23.750 --> 04:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
resource oh absolutely and if you would
 
04:56:25.368 --> 04:56:25.378 align:start position:0%
give us the site for example this would
 
04:56:26.868 --> 04:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
be really helpful
 
04:56:26.878 --> 04:56:27.590 align:start position:0%
be really helpful
um

04:56:27.590 --> 04:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:31.128 --> 04:56:31.138 align:start position:0%
is going back to the suggestion made
 
04:56:34.310 --> 04:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
earlier that we change May investigate
 
04:56:36.470 --> 04:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
to shall investigate
 
04:56:40.610 --> 04:56:40.620 align:start position:0%
and I wonder what your opinion is on
 
04:56:42.410 --> 04:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
that change from the perspective of
 
04:56:45.590 --> 04:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
somebody on the board and then further I
 
04:56:49.190 --> 04:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
wonder if we change that may to shall if
 
04:56:53.030 --> 04:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
you thought that would impact the
 
04:56:55.788 --> 04:56:55.798 align:start position:0%
um personnel and resources employed by
 
04:57:00.770 --> 04:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
the board and by how much yeah
 
04:57:03.170 --> 04:57:03.180 align:start position:0%
um one thing I'd say is
 
04:57:05.208 --> 04:57:05.218 align:start position:0%
everything that comes in
 
04:57:07.128 --> 04:57:07.138 align:start position:0%
gets investigated
 
04:57:11.030 --> 04:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
it may be the physician investigator and
 
04:57:13.610 --> 04:57:13.620 align:start position:0%
the oplc investigator who looks and says
 
04:57:16.670 --> 04:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
this doesn't meet criteria for being
 
04:57:18.708 --> 04:57:18.718 align:start position:0%
evaluated or this was
 
04:57:22.010 --> 04:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
a billing question but that still comes
 
04:57:23.868 --> 04:57:23.878 align:start position:0%
to us we see
 
04:57:26.570 --> 04:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
everything all the complaints that come
 
04:57:28.910 --> 04:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
in all the claims made
 
04:57:34.788 --> 04:57:34.798 align:start position:0%
it comes to us it and we do undertake
 
04:57:37.788 --> 04:57:37.798 align:start position:0%
an investigation but not everybody comes
 
04:57:39.470 --> 04:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
to the place of having discipline for
 
04:57:39.480 --> 04:57:41.150 align:start position:0%
to the place of having discipline for
example

04:57:41.150 --> 04:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
example
 
04:57:46.150 --> 04:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:49.190 --> 04:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
what that's which would mean if the
 
04:57:50.570 --> 04:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
notion is we have to have a full
 
04:57:53.208 --> 04:57:53.218 align:start position:0%
investigation right we don't have the
 
04:57:56.990 --> 04:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
resources to have hearings for all of
 
04:57:59.930 --> 04:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
these complaints for example that we
 
04:58:02.208 --> 04:58:02.218 align:start position:0%
just don't we get hundreds and hundreds
 
04:58:04.850 --> 04:58:04.860 align:start position:0%
of complaints and we can't
 
04:58:07.430 --> 04:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
so if they're all if they were all
 
04:58:09.410 --> 04:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
egregious they would all get hearings
 
04:58:13.610 --> 04:58:13.620 align:start position:0%
absolutely but most things that come in
 
04:58:15.470 --> 04:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
don't come to hearing
 
04:58:18.050 --> 04:58:18.060 align:start position:0%
which hearings take us half a day
 
04:58:19.788 --> 04:58:19.798 align:start position:0%
sometimes two days
 
04:58:21.948 --> 04:58:21.958 align:start position:0%
if it's if it's an egregious event we
 
04:58:23.990 --> 04:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's sort of like having a trial
 
04:58:27.110 --> 04:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
and we abrogate give up
 
04:58:30.288 --> 04:58:30.298 align:start position:0%
as much as a couple of days to these so
 
04:58:32.990 --> 04:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
if that's the hope is that we would
 
04:58:35.030 --> 04:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
investigate to the extent of having a
 
04:58:35.040 --> 04:58:36.410 align:start position:0%
investigate to the extent of having a
hearing

04:58:36.410 --> 04:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:58:38.090 --> 04:58:38.100 align:start position:0%
that we don't have resources for that
 
04:58:40.128 --> 04:58:40.138 align:start position:0%
and a lot of it doesn't make sense could
 
04:58:43.970 --> 04:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
I clarify Mr yes no I just it I thought
 
04:58:48.050 --> 04:58:48.060 align:start position:0%
I was hearing earlier on that there are
 
04:58:50.208 --> 04:58:50.218 align:start position:0%
cases that are reported to the Board of
 
04:58:54.110 --> 04:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
Medicine which are either just put on
 
04:58:55.910 --> 04:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
hold pending
 
04:58:58.128 --> 04:58:58.138 align:start position:0%
something else happening as in the case
 
04:59:00.770 --> 04:59:00.780 align:start position:0%
of a tort and and now I've been told no
 
04:59:04.610 --> 04:59:04.620 align:start position:0%
they don't get put on hold so what I'm
 
04:59:07.128 --> 04:59:07.138 align:start position:0%
if what I'm hearing for you which is
 
04:59:09.948 --> 04:59:09.958 align:start position:0%
that every single complaint
 
04:59:13.128 --> 04:59:13.138 align:start position:0%
gets looked at at a minimum by an
 
04:59:16.190 --> 04:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
investigator who determines no there is
 
04:59:16.200 --> 04:59:17.090 align:start position:0%
investigator who determines no there is
no

04:59:17.090 --> 04:59:17.100 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:59:19.730 --> 04:59:19.740 align:start position:0%
whatever happened here it was not
 
04:59:21.410 --> 04:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
something that is a subject for
 
04:59:23.868 --> 04:59:23.878 align:start position:0%
discipline from the Board of Medicine
 
04:59:23.878 --> 04:59:24.890 align:start position:0%
discipline from the Board of Medicine
um

04:59:24.890 --> 04:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:27.230 --> 04:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
what does that mean no
 
04:59:29.810 --> 04:59:29.820 align:start position:0%
um then then that's fine we don't need
 
04:59:32.570 --> 04:59:32.580 align:start position:0%
to change anything I I want to get us to
 
04:59:34.750 --> 04:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
the point where
 
04:59:38.030 --> 04:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
everything that comes in and what I
 
04:59:39.470 --> 04:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
think I'm hearing you saying is that
 
04:59:42.230 --> 04:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
everything that comes in gets reviewed
 
04:59:46.150 --> 04:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
and then it gets sorted into the pile of
 
04:59:49.310 --> 04:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
this is just a billing complaint this is
 
04:59:52.788 --> 04:59:52.798 align:start position:0%
the doctor's manner was not what I would
 
04:59:54.948 --> 04:59:54.958 align:start position:0%
have liked it to be or whatever
 
04:59:58.368 --> 04:59:58.378 align:start position:0%
all the way through to a full hearing I
 
05:00:00.410 --> 05:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
I wanted to make it clear that I'm not
 
05:00:02.628 --> 05:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
in any way asking for a full Hearing in
 
05:00:04.788 --> 05:00:04.798 align:start position:0%
every case because it's not warranted by
 
05:00:05.930 --> 05:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
any case
 
05:00:05.940 --> 05:00:08.150 align:start position:0%
any case
so

05:00:08.150 --> 05:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:00:12.288 --> 05:00:12.298 align:start position:0%
I guess the corollary question is if we
 
05:00:14.570 --> 05:00:14.580 align:start position:0%
changed May investigate to shall
 
05:00:17.090 --> 05:00:17.100 align:start position:0%
investigate not not hold a hearing but
 
05:00:18.830 --> 05:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
just investigate
 
05:00:21.650 --> 05:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
uh in the statutes would that be of your
 
05:00:22.970 --> 05:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
problem for you
 
05:00:24.530 --> 05:00:24.540 align:start position:0%
because it sounds like that's what
 
05:00:26.330 --> 05:00:26.340 align:start position:0%
you're doing now I mean everything that
 
05:00:29.150 --> 05:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
comes in gets investigated
 
05:00:31.190 --> 05:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
physician investigator or goes to the
 
05:00:33.650 --> 05:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
medical review subcommittee and you know
 
05:00:36.110 --> 05:00:36.120 align:start position:0%
your but no further action that comes to
 
05:00:38.510 --> 05:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
us too right we see the no further
 
05:00:42.470 --> 05:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
actions and then we make a decision of
 
05:00:44.448 --> 05:00:44.458 align:start position:0%
this is a disciplinary tract
 
05:00:47.930 --> 05:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
or can this be managed not in a
 
05:00:49.970 --> 05:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
disciplinary way and we tell the doctor
 
05:00:53.570 --> 05:00:53.580 align:start position:0%
okay this is what we learned and
 
05:00:56.208 --> 05:00:56.218 align:start position:0%
and give them point you know and then
 
05:00:57.948 --> 05:00:57.958 align:start position:0%
that gets in their file and if it comes
 
05:01:02.650 --> 05:01:02.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:05.570 --> 05:01:05.580 align:start position:0%
so you still didn't tell me how you felt
 
05:01:07.430 --> 05:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
about changing made a shell
 
05:01:07.440 --> 05:01:09.650 align:start position:0%
about changing made a shell
um

05:01:09.650 --> 05:01:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:13.730 --> 05:01:13.740 align:start position:0%
I guess it so long as As
 
05:01:17.208 --> 05:01:17.218 align:start position:0%
the understanding of shall investigate
 
05:01:19.850 --> 05:01:19.860 align:start position:0%
is understanding that the pro like what
 
05:01:23.448 --> 05:01:23.458 align:start position:0%
we're doing right and if the public says
 
05:01:25.550 --> 05:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
or legislatures by you they shall
 
05:01:27.708 --> 05:01:27.718 align:start position:0%
investigate I need you to do to this
 
05:01:27.718 --> 05:01:29.330 align:start position:0%
investigate I need you to do to this
degree

05:01:29.330 --> 05:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
degree
 
05:01:32.090 --> 05:01:32.100 align:start position:0%
and if it's just a matter of you guys
 
05:01:34.788 --> 05:01:34.798 align:start position:0%
decide what the level of Investigation
 
05:01:37.070 --> 05:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
is well then it
 
05:01:39.530 --> 05:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any difference it's what we
 
05:01:39.540 --> 05:01:43.310 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any difference it's what we
do

05:01:43.310 --> 05:01:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:45.410 --> 05:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:01:47.708 --> 05:01:47.718 align:start position:0%
any other questions for Dr Baker
 
05:01:50.330 --> 05:01:50.340 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you and
 
05:01:52.490 --> 05:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for the testimony I had two
 
05:01:54.590 --> 05:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
questions one is is this too cold for
 
05:01:57.470 --> 05:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
you okay because these guys will be hot
 
05:01:58.970 --> 05:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
and then I'll be in trouble they wanted
 
05:02:00.110 --> 05:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure
 
05:02:00.120 --> 05:02:00.830 align:start position:0%
to make sure
um

05:02:00.830 --> 05:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:03.170 --> 05:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
I think we've heard a lot today about
 
05:02:05.390 --> 05:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
what I don't know I don't know I can't
 
05:02:08.090 --> 05:02:08.100 align:start position:0%
act on information I don't have already
 
05:02:11.150 --> 05:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
in the hospital we have credentialing
 
05:02:13.788 --> 05:02:13.798 align:start position:0%
and privileging committees they
 
05:02:16.250 --> 05:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
established on them right they establish
 
05:02:18.470 --> 05:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
that you have I always looked at it as
 
05:02:20.330 --> 05:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
the credentials say that you have a
 
05:02:22.128 --> 05:02:22.138 align:start position:0%
medical license but you're only
 
05:02:24.350 --> 05:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
privileged to do X
 
05:02:27.230 --> 05:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
it's analogous to I have a pilot's
 
05:02:29.330 --> 05:02:29.340 align:start position:0%
license but your privilege is that you
 
05:02:32.930 --> 05:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
can only find a Cessna not a 747.
 
05:02:35.570 --> 05:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
we have you know m m committees
 
05:02:38.810 --> 05:02:38.820 align:start position:0%
we have quality review we have a lot of
 
05:02:41.510 --> 05:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
internal committees at the local level
 
05:02:44.330 --> 05:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
but somehow it seems like if somebody is
 
05:02:46.850 --> 05:02:46.860 align:start position:0%
discovered or you know somebody is not
 
05:02:49.910 --> 05:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
practicing up to speed
 
05:02:51.830 --> 05:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
there there seems to be that that
 
05:02:54.530 --> 05:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
information is somehow not available to
 
05:02:55.850 --> 05:02:55.860 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine who ultimately
 
05:02:58.730 --> 05:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
provides the license and as you said
 
05:03:01.310 --> 05:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
provides some assurances to the public
 
05:03:03.830 --> 05:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
that safety is going to be assured at
 
05:03:05.270 --> 05:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
that organization
 
05:03:07.910 --> 05:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
so I I guess what I'm asking is
 
05:03:10.010 --> 05:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
can you suggest or do you have
 
05:03:12.110 --> 05:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
suggestions or thoughts about what is
 
05:03:14.270 --> 05:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
necessary whether it's legislative or
 
05:03:17.090 --> 05:03:17.100 align:start position:0%
not that Bridges the gap between the
 
05:03:19.430 --> 05:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
local disciplinary and investigation and
 
05:03:22.250 --> 05:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
evaluation and that which is the board
 
05:03:23.930 --> 05:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
of medicines purview to provide them
 
05:03:27.530 --> 05:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
with a medicine a medical license
 
05:03:27.540 --> 05:03:28.610 align:start position:0%
with a medicine a medical license
um

05:03:28.610 --> 05:03:28.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:30.410 --> 05:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure with some statute now but I
 
05:03:32.750 --> 05:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
think hospitals are expected to report
 
05:03:35.330 --> 05:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
these and when we see them then we're
 
05:03:38.930 --> 05:03:38.940 align:start position:0%
able to investigate that so I think
 
05:03:41.330 --> 05:03:41.340 align:start position:0%
if there's not a statute that says
 
05:03:44.150 --> 05:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
hospitals need to report what happens on
 
05:03:46.910 --> 05:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
on their credentials committees than it
 
05:03:49.970 --> 05:03:49.980 align:start position:0%
should be now you mentioned Eminem that
 
05:03:52.788 --> 05:03:52.798 align:start position:0%
is a whole separate carve out and that's
 
05:03:55.128 --> 05:03:55.138 align:start position:0%
really what the whole point of that is
 
05:03:57.170 --> 05:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
to improve care for the public and not
 
05:03:59.090 --> 05:03:59.100 align:start position:0%
have that be discoverable
 
05:04:00.708 --> 05:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:04:05.030 --> 05:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
so surely hospitals should be expected
 
05:04:07.550 --> 05:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
to report actions the other thing that's
 
05:04:08.990 --> 05:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
happened in the last
 
05:04:11.330 --> 05:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
several years nationally is the Joint
 
05:04:13.690 --> 05:04:13.700 align:start position:0%
Commission has been very prescriptive
 
05:04:18.050 --> 05:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
about processes for evaluating of
 
05:04:19.490 --> 05:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
Physicians where you have to do
 
05:04:21.770 --> 05:04:21.780 align:start position:0%
professional practice evaluations and so
 
05:04:24.110 --> 05:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
hospitals that are
 
05:04:26.628 --> 05:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
accredited by The Joint Commission have
 
05:04:28.430 --> 05:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
these processes not not every hospital
 
05:04:30.410 --> 05:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:04:32.990 --> 05:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
is a joint commission hospital and so
 
05:04:35.150 --> 05:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
again I don't know what the regulations
 
05:04:37.610 --> 05:04:37.620 align:start position:0%
or statutes are for the not those
 
05:04:37.620 --> 05:04:38.930 align:start position:0%
or statutes are for the not those
hospitals

05:04:38.930 --> 05:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
05:04:42.170 --> 05:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
is it detailed enough to make it of the
 
05:04:44.510 --> 05:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
same sort of level of scrutiny as The
 
05:04:47.090 --> 05:04:47.100 align:start position:0%
Joint Commission hospitals
 
05:04:50.448 --> 05:04:50.458 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up um so I guess my
 
05:04:52.010 --> 05:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
question would be then is there
 
05:04:53.690 --> 05:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
something that you would want to have
 
05:04:57.470 --> 05:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
available to you so that you could fully
 
05:05:00.288 --> 05:05:00.298 align:start position:0%
and safely and effectively evaluate you
 
05:05:02.208 --> 05:05:02.218 align:start position:0%
know providers
 
05:05:05.110 --> 05:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
um I think we would be
 
05:05:07.910 --> 05:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
helped by having
 
05:05:11.448 --> 05:05:11.458 align:start position:0%
a greater ability to get experts not
 
05:05:14.030 --> 05:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily on our state right now it's
 
05:05:15.590 --> 05:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and so we're really Frugal
 
05:05:19.490 --> 05:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
and the majority of evaluations we get
 
05:05:21.890 --> 05:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
are done by either the medical review
 
05:05:25.490 --> 05:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or we ask pro bono a
 
05:05:27.590 --> 05:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
physician in the state to help us
 
05:05:29.750 --> 05:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
that works great the majority of the
 
05:05:31.970 --> 05:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
time but you know it's a small state
 
05:05:34.910 --> 05:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
everybody knows each other right and
 
05:05:36.708 --> 05:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
sometimes if
 
05:05:38.750 --> 05:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
and we're going to work with the oplc on
 
05:05:40.550 --> 05:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
that they're they've been great about
 
05:05:42.948 --> 05:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
that but I think having more resources
 
05:05:45.890 --> 05:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
05:05:49.788 --> 05:05:49.798 align:start position:0%
get experts outside because if like some
 
05:05:52.250 --> 05:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
cases it'll run if you've got two of
 
05:05:54.530 --> 05:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
these guys in the state you can't have
 
05:05:56.510 --> 05:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
somebody within the state
 
05:05:59.750 --> 05:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
provide you with with expert support for
 
05:06:02.448 --> 05:06:02.458 align:start position:0%
evaluating their competency
 
05:06:04.670 --> 05:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
that would be that would be helpful I
 
05:06:08.090 --> 05:06:08.100 align:start position:0%
mean part of it's executive in terms of
 
05:06:11.750 --> 05:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
how much funds are distributed that's no
 
05:06:13.850 --> 05:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
small piece of it because you can only
 
05:06:16.128 --> 05:06:16.138 align:start position:0%
have so many Resources with the money
 
05:06:19.128 --> 05:06:19.138 align:start position:0%
that that you're given but from a
 
05:06:21.410 --> 05:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
legislative standpoint
 
05:06:24.650 --> 05:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
deciding when you look and we all look I
 
05:06:26.690 --> 05:06:26.700 align:start position:0%
guess and see what the other states do
 
05:06:28.190 --> 05:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
what do we want to look like then that
 
05:06:31.490 --> 05:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
would be a matter of Statute and I don't
 
05:06:33.650 --> 05:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
think there's nobody who thinks that
 
05:06:35.270 --> 05:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
there should be
 
05:06:38.810 --> 05:06:38.820 align:start position:0%
silence over this we care about the the
 
05:06:40.730 --> 05:06:40.740 align:start position:0%
patient we care about our citizens and
 
05:06:42.590 --> 05:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
if something needs to get reported
 
05:06:44.510 --> 05:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
it should be reported
 
05:06:48.650 --> 05:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:51.530 --> 05:06:51.540 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Dr
 
05:06:53.150 --> 05:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
Baker I
 
05:06:56.810 --> 05:06:56.820 align:start position:0%
um as I look at the the statute section
 
05:06:59.830 --> 05:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
329 colon 18
 
05:07:04.010 --> 05:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
paragraph one or I uh
 
05:07:06.410 --> 05:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
representative Weber actually taught me
 
05:07:09.470 --> 05:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
this years ago that you should go into
 
05:07:11.208 --> 05:07:11.218 align:start position:0%
the statute to see if something's
 
05:07:14.448 --> 05:07:14.458 align:start position:0%
defined and I think the definition of
 
05:07:17.330 --> 05:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
Investigations is loose enough there
 
05:07:21.110 --> 05:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
it's formal or informal that that I I
 
05:07:24.530 --> 05:07:24.540 align:start position:0%
don't know I made a shall would would
 
05:07:26.868 --> 05:07:26.878 align:start position:0%
tie your hands much
 
05:07:29.090 --> 05:07:29.100 align:start position:0%
um but I don't I don't want to jump to
 
05:07:30.948 --> 05:07:30.958 align:start position:0%
that conclusion but
 
05:07:33.590 --> 05:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
um if if there are
 
05:07:33.600 --> 05:07:34.930 align:start position:0%
um if if there are
um

05:07:34.930 --> 05:07:34.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:37.670 --> 05:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
how did you react
 
05:07:40.610 --> 05:07:40.620 align:start position:0%
um when you heard the argument that that
 
05:07:43.368 --> 05:07:43.378 align:start position:0%
this is too permissive and we should be
 
05:07:46.490 --> 05:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
looking to change maze to shall says are
 
05:07:49.730 --> 05:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
are there are there a number of maze in
 
05:07:52.010 --> 05:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
here that that you think would be good
 
05:07:55.430 --> 05:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
contenders for being changed to show
 
05:07:55.440 --> 05:07:56.208 align:start position:0%
contenders for being changed to show
um

05:07:56.208 --> 05:07:56.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:59.330 --> 05:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
but only when I remember offhand is the
 
05:08:01.250 --> 05:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
shall investigate
 
05:08:04.670 --> 05:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
in it enough if you guys remember the
 
05:08:06.350 --> 05:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
ones that she said
 
05:08:08.990 --> 05:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
I I assume you have
 
05:08:10.670 --> 05:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
um a Consulting attorney that works with
 
05:08:14.150 --> 05:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
the board or not we have our boards we
 
05:08:17.570 --> 05:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
have a board attorney for us
 
05:08:17.580 --> 05:08:18.890 align:start position:0%
have a board attorney for us
there's

05:08:18.890 --> 05:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
there's
 
05:08:20.868 --> 05:08:20.878 align:start position:0%
um the oplc has an attorney but we have
 
05:08:23.930 --> 05:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
a attorney who sits with us and if I
 
05:08:25.368 --> 05:08:25.378 align:start position:0%
turn I say could you help me understand
 
05:08:27.770 --> 05:08:27.780 align:start position:0%
this statute our rules and regulations
 
05:08:30.170 --> 05:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
permission of the chair I think I'd like
 
05:08:33.708 --> 05:08:33.718 align:start position:0%
to ask for the board to come back and
 
05:08:36.110 --> 05:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
say sure which of are there May's in
 
05:08:38.390 --> 05:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
here that you think should be shells or
 
05:08:41.030 --> 05:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
or something like that I think that
 
05:08:43.010 --> 05:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
might be useful and we don't have a
 
05:08:44.390 --> 05:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
whole lot of time for that because we're
 
05:08:46.310 --> 05:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
supposed to be done in three months or
 
05:08:49.368 --> 05:08:49.378 align:start position:0%
three weeks so are you um yeah I'm I'm
 
05:08:52.128 --> 05:08:52.138 align:start position:0%
you're okay with that yeah okay the in
 
05:08:55.310 --> 05:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
under the uh the board duties I skimmed
 
05:08:58.190 --> 05:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
it to see if the board members are
 
05:09:02.090 --> 05:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
compensated no well so we get lunch so
 
05:09:04.610 --> 05:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
so it's you're you're volunteers and
 
05:09:07.610 --> 05:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
you're putting in a lot of time
 
05:09:10.128 --> 05:09:10.138 align:start position:0%
um do you do you know if that comes with
 
05:09:13.970 --> 05:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
it a um a legal liability standard if
 
05:09:16.430 --> 05:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
you guys don't perform your job properly
 
05:09:18.650 --> 05:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
could could you be sued as being a
 
05:09:20.570 --> 05:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
member of the board that that didn't do
 
05:09:22.850 --> 05:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
what they were supposed to I
 
05:09:25.128 --> 05:09:25.138 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that
 
05:09:27.230 --> 05:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
it's a little scary that you're asking
 
05:09:27.240 --> 05:09:29.390 align:start position:0%
it's a little scary that you're asking
any

05:09:29.390 --> 05:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:31.190 --> 05:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
I think you should be protected I mean
 
05:09:34.190 --> 05:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
even me on a homeowner's board we have
 
05:09:36.590 --> 05:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
insurance to keep us from being
 
05:09:38.930 --> 05:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
personally liable for anything that the
 
05:09:41.150 --> 05:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
board May mess up and so I was just
 
05:09:43.430 --> 05:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
curious if we needed to make sure you
 
05:09:45.670 --> 05:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
all were protected because as volunteers
 
05:09:48.770 --> 05:09:48.780 align:start position:0%
providing a valuable service and you're
 
05:09:51.708 --> 05:09:51.718 align:start position:0%
all very expensive people uh and you're
 
05:09:53.448 --> 05:09:53.458 align:start position:0%
donating your time I would just want to
 
05:09:56.448 --> 05:09:56.458 align:start position:0%
make sure that you personally as board
 
05:10:00.070 --> 05:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
members would not be subject to you know
 
05:10:03.948 --> 05:10:03.958 align:start position:0%
Financial liability for uh much
 
05:10:06.170 --> 05:10:06.180 align:start position:0%
appreciated yeah that's where I was
 
05:10:07.310 --> 05:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
05:10:07.320 --> 05:10:09.708 align:start position:0%
coming from
um

05:10:09.708 --> 05:10:09.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:12.890 --> 05:10:12.900 align:start position:0%
a typical so you're the you're you've
 
05:10:12.900 --> 05:10:13.550 align:start position:0%
a typical so you're the you're you've
been

05:10:13.550 --> 05:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:10:15.948 --> 05:10:15.958 align:start position:0%
um the president of the board for a few
 
05:10:18.770 --> 05:10:18.780 align:start position:0%
years now I thank you sir and this is I
 
05:10:22.610 --> 05:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
took over Dr Conway's term when he went
 
05:10:25.250 --> 05:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
to be the physician investigator I had a
 
05:10:28.368 --> 05:10:28.378 align:start position:0%
previous stint as being president four
 
05:10:31.128 --> 05:10:31.138 align:start position:0%
or five years ago okay so where I'm
 
05:10:33.610 --> 05:10:33.620 align:start position:0%
going with that is you would know by now
 
05:10:37.610 --> 05:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
just how time consuming this is for you
 
05:10:39.650 --> 05:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
as the president and maybe what some of
 
05:10:41.390 --> 05:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
the other board members could you could
 
05:10:43.490 --> 05:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
you tell us about the time commitment
 
05:10:45.470 --> 05:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
that the board spends on this in a
 
05:10:48.230 --> 05:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
voluntary role yeah sure
 
05:10:51.770 --> 05:10:51.780 align:start position:0%
um the board meetings themselves are a
 
05:10:54.288 --> 05:10:54.298 align:start position:0%
full day in Concord we generally start
 
05:10:57.530 --> 05:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
at eight and we can and as late as eight
 
05:10:59.208 --> 05:10:59.218 align:start position:0%
if we've had a hearing and then need to
 
05:11:00.770 --> 05:11:00.780 align:start position:0%
because all our business gets done we
 
05:11:02.090 --> 05:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
have to get all the business done even
 
05:11:04.010 --> 05:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
if there hasn't been here for a month
 
05:11:06.770 --> 05:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
per year we meet once a month once a
 
05:11:10.310 --> 05:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
month and you're we have homework
 
05:11:14.330 --> 05:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
basically to do which is reading all of
 
05:11:17.208 --> 05:11:17.218 align:start position:0%
the documents that are going to be acted
 
05:11:17.218 --> 05:11:18.050 align:start position:0%
the documents that are going to be acted
on

05:11:18.050 --> 05:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:11:20.390 --> 05:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
and the amount of time it takes to read
 
05:11:22.550 --> 05:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
that it varies a little bit but usually
 
05:11:24.410 --> 05:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
on that weekend I spend probably eight
 
05:11:24.420 --> 05:11:25.368 align:start position:0%
on that weekend I spend probably eight
hours

05:11:25.368 --> 05:11:25.378 align:start position:0%
hours
 
05:11:27.650 --> 05:11:27.660 align:start position:0%
eight to ten hours reading those
 
05:11:29.810 --> 05:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
so would it be fair to say that you're
 
05:11:32.868 --> 05:11:32.878 align:start position:0%
committed to you know between 10 and 20
 
05:11:35.650 --> 05:11:35.660 align:start position:0%
hours a month sort of minimum
 
05:11:38.390 --> 05:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
yeah especially sort of doing extra
 
05:11:41.330 --> 05:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
board president things yeah okay so I'm
 
05:11:43.190 --> 05:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
I'm done with my questions I just want
 
05:11:44.990 --> 05:11:45.000 align:start position:0%

05:11:46.670 --> 05:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
and all that you do for the state I
 
05:11:48.708 --> 05:11:48.718 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you anything else
 
05:11:51.410 --> 05:11:51.420 align:start position:0%

05:12:02.270 --> 05:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
to walk again I left a batch of my cards
 
05:12:05.090 --> 05:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
you can take one if if you wish it's my
 
05:12:09.350 --> 05:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:11.510 --> 05:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
values and showers
 
05:12:14.930 --> 05:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:14.940 --> 05:12:16.490 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:12:28.670 --> 05:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
this has been a very educational
 
05:12:31.070 --> 05:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon I do want to catch up with
 
05:12:33.170 --> 05:12:33.180 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards afterwards just
 
05:12:35.628 --> 05:12:35.638 align:start position:0%
to to just give him a little bit of
 
05:12:39.170 --> 05:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
briefing on the 99d coverage for both
 
05:12:41.090 --> 05:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
defense indemnification for State actors
 
05:12:43.490 --> 05:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
so it applies not only to individuals
 
05:12:44.930 --> 05:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
who would be serving On The Board of
 
05:12:47.390 --> 05:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
Medicine but anybody in an executive
 
05:12:49.010 --> 05:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
branch function acting under Colorado
 
05:12:50.930 --> 05:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
state law under their normal functions
 
05:12:52.610 --> 05:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
and duties there are limitations you
 
05:12:55.730 --> 05:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
can't emit crimes and be covered but if
 
05:12:58.070 --> 05:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's otherwise there is to the state and
 
05:13:00.708 --> 05:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
I know attorney Douglas osterhoud has
 
05:13:02.390 --> 05:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
even more refined a couple of other
 
05:13:04.550 --> 05:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
statutes that does cover for the
 
05:13:06.170 --> 05:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
concerns that you raised regarding
 
05:13:08.930 --> 05:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
identification and protection for Dr
 
05:13:11.390 --> 05:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
Baker and folks similarly situated who
 
05:13:13.368 --> 05:13:13.378 align:start position:0%
volunteer in the capacity of acting on
 
05:13:15.288 --> 05:13:15.298 align:start position:0%
behalf of the state
 
05:13:17.030 --> 05:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you attorney Williams anything
 
05:13:17.040 --> 05:13:18.830 align:start position:0%
thank you attorney Williams anything
further

05:13:18.830 --> 05:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
further
 
05:13:23.628 --> 05:13:23.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:26.030 --> 05:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
no I think attorney Williams covered
 
05:13:27.288 --> 05:13:27.298 align:start position:0%
what I was going to add that a lot of
 
05:13:28.970 --> 05:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
the practice acts do have their own
 
05:13:31.010 --> 05:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
statutory carve-outs that protect and
 
05:13:33.110 --> 05:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
indemnify individuals acting in good
 
05:13:33.120 --> 05:13:34.930 align:start position:0%
indemnify individuals acting in good
faith

05:13:34.930 --> 05:13:34.940 align:start position:0%
faith
 
05:13:38.510 --> 05:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
let me ask any of the attorneys here to
 
05:13:42.230 --> 05:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
what degree does 91a prevent the
 
05:13:44.150 --> 05:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
committee from
 
05:13:46.128 --> 05:13:46.138 align:start position:0%
doing anything more than one person
 
05:13:51.110 --> 05:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
talking to no more than 50 percent minus
 
05:13:53.690 --> 05:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
in other words can we have a discussion
 
05:13:55.850 --> 05:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
on today
 
05:13:59.270 --> 05:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
with all of us on board
 
05:14:01.910 --> 05:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna I'm gonna defer to represent
 
05:14:03.770 --> 05:14:03.780 align:start position:0%
Weber on this issue because I think we
 
05:14:05.750 --> 05:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
we think alike on this subject matter
 
05:14:08.590 --> 05:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
under coverage of 99 91a
 
05:14:10.910 --> 05:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
well I guess I'm not really
 
05:14:13.190 --> 05:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
understanding the question we're here in
 
05:14:14.810 --> 05:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
a notice meeting so we can discuss
 
05:14:16.128 --> 05:14:16.138 align:start position:0%
anything are you talking about
 
05:14:18.830 --> 05:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
discussing amongst ourselves outside of
 
05:14:20.448 --> 05:14:20.458 align:start position:0%
a notice meeting
 
05:14:23.570 --> 05:14:23.580 align:start position:0%
then we're covered by 91a and if it's
 
05:14:26.628 --> 05:14:26.638 align:start position:0%
more than half of us and it's not a
 
05:14:28.190 --> 05:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
political caucus
 
05:14:30.530 --> 05:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
and it's not an exception somewhere we
 
05:14:32.510 --> 05:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
can't do it I was looking for the
 
05:14:34.270 --> 05:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
exception somewhere
 
05:14:37.448 --> 05:14:37.458 align:start position:0%
not that I know of but I mean
 
05:14:40.910 --> 05:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not the best
 
05:14:43.730 --> 05:14:43.740 align:start position:0%
prepared to answer that because
 
05:14:45.530 --> 05:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
I only know the things that have come up
 
05:14:47.990 --> 05:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
that I've gotten stuck with I was
 
05:14:50.448 --> 05:14:50.458 align:start position:0%
looking for and I don't remember how
 
05:14:52.070 --> 05:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
many people there are in this committee
 
05:14:53.690 --> 05:14:53.700 align:start position:0%
but there is certainly a number of
 
05:14:55.550 --> 05:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
people on this committee who are not
 
05:14:58.310 --> 05:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
here today so yeah
 
05:15:00.770 --> 05:15:00.780 align:start position:0%
um I was looking for the process towards
 
05:15:02.868 --> 05:15:02.878 align:start position:0%
the content the agenda of our next
 
05:15:05.270 --> 05:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
meeting primarily
 
05:15:07.970 --> 05:15:07.980 align:start position:0%
I don't think when you're talking about
 
05:15:10.490 --> 05:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
stuff that were that we're not going to
 
05:15:13.610 --> 05:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
vote on or make decisions on things like
 
05:15:16.670 --> 05:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
when we're going to meet
 
05:15:19.750 --> 05:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
um attached our
 
05:15:22.788 --> 05:15:22.798 align:start position:0%
3987 pages of material to you for you to
 
05:15:26.090 --> 05:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
review before our next meeting or
 
05:15:28.730 --> 05:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
I have certain concerns that I want you
 
05:15:31.368 --> 05:15:31.378 align:start position:0%
to think about are things that we have
 
05:15:34.490 --> 05:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
always traditionally rightly or wrongly
 
05:15:37.970 --> 05:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
send out in advance so that people can
 
05:15:40.490 --> 05:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
read them not while they're sitting at
 
05:15:42.590 --> 05:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
the table but before so that they can
 
05:15:45.350 --> 05:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
and and generally when we do that
 
05:15:48.230 --> 05:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
whoever sends them reminds everybody not
 
05:15:51.530 --> 05:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
to discuss them just to look at them and
 
05:15:52.570 --> 05:15:52.580 align:start position:0%
bring any
 
05:15:55.490 --> 05:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
comments they have okay yeah that's what
 
05:15:57.830 --> 05:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
I was looking for so then I think we can
 
05:15:59.750 --> 05:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
do that anyone else with anything before
 
05:16:01.250 --> 05:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
we adjourn
 
05:16:03.590 --> 05:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
there was one question I wanted to ask
 
05:16:05.868 --> 05:16:05.878 align:start position:0%
somebody but I do I can do that
 
05:16:09.530 --> 05:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
afterwards Rover well you're focusing on
 
05:16:12.230 --> 05:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
an agenda I wanted to ask a question
 
05:16:17.410 --> 05:16:17.420 align:start position:0%
related to the calculation of medical
 
05:16:20.890 --> 05:16:20.900 align:start position:0%
malpractice premiums and whether or not
 
05:16:23.390 --> 05:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
increased disclosures
 
05:16:26.930 --> 05:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
public disclosures may have a direct
 
05:16:30.770 --> 05:16:30.780 align:start position:0%
impact on increasing medical liability
 
05:16:35.690 --> 05:16:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:37.730 --> 05:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
I think the board of insurance would
 
05:16:39.170 --> 05:16:39.180 align:start position:0%
answer I think
 
05:16:43.190 --> 05:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
my thought on that would be that that's
 
05:16:45.770 --> 05:16:45.780 align:start position:0%
a really good question but it's outside
 
05:16:48.770 --> 05:16:48.780 align:start position:0%
of the competence of this committee and
 
05:16:51.050 --> 05:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
it's something that should be examined
 
05:16:53.270 --> 05:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
in the con in the context of any
 
05:16:55.550 --> 05:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
legislation that would be filed to
 
05:16:57.288 --> 05:16:57.298 align:start position:0%
require disclosure
 
05:17:00.128 --> 05:17:00.138 align:start position:0%
and that would mean that it could be
 
05:17:02.690 --> 05:17:02.700 align:start position:0%
considered by
 
05:17:04.670 --> 05:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
presumably somebody on the Commerce
 
05:17:06.350 --> 05:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
Committee who deals with insurance
 
05:17:08.390 --> 05:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
premiums and that kind of thing but that
 
05:17:10.070 --> 05:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
really wasn't our mandate our mandate
 
05:17:11.890 --> 05:17:11.900 align:start position:0%
was to talk about
 
05:17:14.448 --> 05:17:14.458 align:start position:0%
transparency not not the effect on
 
05:17:23.750 --> 05:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:26.390 --> 05:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
the word homework has been invoked more
 
05:17:28.550 --> 05:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
than once and we've just added to your
 
05:17:30.590 --> 05:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
list thank you we're finished
 
05:17:34.430 --> 05:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:37.010 --> 05:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
we're in disagreement about that but I I
