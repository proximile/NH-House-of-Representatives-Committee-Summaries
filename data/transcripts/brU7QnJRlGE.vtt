services um just to give folks some con
 
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
context uh today uh i' I'd like us to
 
00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 align:start position:0%
see if we can get through this at uh by
 
00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 align:start position:0%
noon and I realize to do that uh I have
 
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
to keep an obligation to only ask the
 
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.309 align:start position:0%
to keep an obligation to only ask the
essential

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
essential
 
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
questions um and I I'd hope all the
 
00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
committee members uh keep in mind we
 
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
want to be able to wrap up at noon and
 
00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
and then tomorrow is an interesting day
 
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
for us we'll be looking at the veterans
 
00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 align:start position:0%
home and other um Direct Care Providers
 
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire hospital Glen Cliff
 
00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
home Hamstead hospital so that's uh
 
00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:44.470 align:start position:0%
home Hamstead hospital so that's uh
that's

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
tomorrow uh and then I think we we've
 
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
um we've somewhere we've squeezed in the
 
00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board I
 
00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 align:start position:0%
can't really tell what day that is
 
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
Wednesday that's a Wednesday
 
00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 align:start position:0%
okay and then Thursday we have session
 
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 align:start position:0%
and uh representative walner you you
 
00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
asked me if we had anything on uh on the
 
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
14th and there's nothing on the calendar
 
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
and we talked through it in a working
 
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
group this morning and I don't think we
 
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
need to schedule anything on the
 
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
14th so but we are going to have to add
 
00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
something on the
 
00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 align:start position:0%
17th uh on the 17th I've asked Mr Ripple
 
00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
to anticipate the new bills that we're
 
00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 align:start position:0%
going to get as a division and I want to
 
00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
schedule the 17th for us to hit the
 
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
bills so so that's where we are uh
 
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
overall um and uh welcome uh Dr Hardy no

Nathan white Chief finance officer with
 
00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 align:start position:0%

Services uh today in the governor's
 
00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:03.439 align:start position:0%
operating budget um we'll be working
 
00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 align:start position:0%
from Pages
 
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
8993 through
 
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
97 and then we will also be working from
 
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
pages4 through 1025 for the DD budget um
 
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
in front of you you also have the budget
 
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
briefing book again just as a reminder
 
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
it's for accounts over a million dollars
 
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
annually and with that said I will hand
 
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
it over to Melissa thank you Nathan I'm
 
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
Melissa Hardy I'm the division director
 
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
for long longterm supports and services
 
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
so thank you for having us this morning
 
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
I think in the interest of time uh I
 
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of slides there so um
 
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 align:start position:0%
chairman Edwards if you're okay with me
 
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
kind of accelerating a little bit we're
 
00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
we're in your hands okay so I think
 
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
probably starting on slide three to just
 
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
give a quick overview of the division
 
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 align:start position:0%
and the people that we serve um our
 
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
division has three distinct bureaus the
 
00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Aging adult and Aging Services
 
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
we have the Bureau of Developmental
 
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
services and the Bureau of family
 
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
centered Services uh one thing I'd like
 
00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 align:start position:0%
to point out um that's unique with us is
 
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
that we serve people throughout the
 
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 align:start position:0%
lifespan so our Bureau of family
 
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
centered Services serves um kids from
 
00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
birth to up to age 21 um and then we
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
have our adult and Aging Services and
 
00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
our DD services that serve um adults and
 
00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 align:start position:0%
people with physical disabilities so um
 
00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 align:start position:0%
in in talking with our stakeholders we
 
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
could have a parent who's taking care of
 
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
somebody on uh the DD waiver who also
 
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
receives CFI waiver services at the same
 
00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
time so we overlap in a in a lot of
 
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 align:start position:0%
different ways um but have the honor of
 
00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
serving people um throughout their
 
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
lifespan if needed so from a budget
 
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
context the BDS is probably what for
 
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
General funds probably 60% of your total
 
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
budget just approximately it it it's
 
00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
it's the elephant in the room right for
 
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
BDS it's um yes I would say it's
 
00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
significantly um higher than our other
 
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 align:start position:0%
divisions and and then um uh aging and
 
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
adult relative to family centered are
 
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
they effectively the same or no I would
 
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
say um Family centered service is uh is
 
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
less than um adult and Aging Services
 
00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
for general f all right I I find that
 
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
kind of context useful so so thank you
 
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
sure um slide four is just again a brief
 
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
overview of what we do at the division
 
00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
um providing guidance and technical
 
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
support and quality monitoring for our
 
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
provider networks um on all three of our
 
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
bureaus um so we're there as a resource
 
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
we do a lot of contracted uh provider
 
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
work um so giving them um the time and
 
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
the technical assistance in order to
 
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're following our Rules
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
of Engagement with our funders um and
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
making sure that we're reporting out on
 
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
a timely
 
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 align:start position:0%
basis we also work with um Meredith
 
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
too's group the division of program
 
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
quality and integrity uh when we do
 
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
things like uh file service file reviews
 
00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
we do redesignation reviews um and
 
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
partner with her team to look at those
 
00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:18.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
measures Slide Five is just a brief um a
 
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
high Lev look of our org chart uh for
 
00:07:26.869 --> 00:07:26.879 align:start position:0%
your for your context uh so again just
 
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
shows the three different bureaus we
 
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
have a Chief Operating Officer of the
 
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
division um they're all here with me
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
today so if I need to phone a friend um
 
00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
they're here to answer questions that I
 
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:41.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
us slide six is um our staffing and
 
00:07:47.469 --> 00:07:47.479 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate so you can see we're pretty
 
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
proud of our vacancy rate um being at 4%
 
00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
for the Bureau of adult and Aging
 
00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
Services 15% for uh developmental
 
00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
services and
 
00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
6% um for family centered services so
 
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
15% relative to Workforce shortages
 
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
around the state 15% seems to be a
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
pretty relatively low vacancy rate I'm
 
00:08:14.149 --> 00:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
I'm still a little bit curious um what
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
what what do you think the single
 
00:08:18.149 --> 00:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
biggest or a couple biggest reasons for
 
00:08:22.149 --> 00:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
you having a vacancy rate u in uh
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
BDS um I think we've spent a lot of time
 
00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
uh fostering a a positive work
 
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
environment for people to want to work
 
00:08:31.029 --> 00:08:31.039 align:start position:0%
in and then seeing the results of the
 
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
work um and talking and engaging with
 
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
families and providers I think that
 
00:08:37.949 --> 00:08:37.959 align:start position:0%
gives a lot of context to you know why
 
00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
people stay in their jobs it's not
 
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:42.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily for the glory it's for you
 
00:08:43.709 --> 00:08:43.719 align:start position:0%
know seeing outcomes for the people that
 
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
we serve what I I I should have said it
 
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
a little different what do you have a
 
00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
barrier to uh getting U closer to a a
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
four or five% vacancy rate what what
 
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
what what's sort of in the way yeah I
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
think because of the number we only have
 
00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:01.399 align:start position:0%
27 authorized position so when you have
 
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
you know four that are vacant it really
 
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
you know skews that number so I think
 
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
right now we have four vacant positions
 
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
in BDS um so when you look at that I
 
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
just think the the end number is is low
 
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
to begin with thank
 
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
you um during the governor's budget we
 
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
were unfunded eight positions in the
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
division so three in the uh Bureau of
 
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:25.720 align:start position:0%
adult and Aging Services and five in BDS
 
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
okay um slide seven is really just um a
 
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
visual of our department and the
 
00:09:40.509 --> 00:09:40.519 align:start position:0%
different ways that we help um across
 
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
the division with um our area so family
 
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
support we have a Adult Protective
 
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
Services in our division we provide
 
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
early intervention services for kids and
 
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
families um information referral food
 
00:09:57.069 --> 00:09:57.079 align:start position:0%
and nutrition so just um a a kind of
 
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
like high level view of the different
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
arraya services
 
00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:07.389 --> 00:10:07.399 align:start position:0%
division and let me know if I'm going
 
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
too fast or too slow nope it's it would
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
be hard for you to go too fast now okay
 
00:10:13.949 --> 00:10:13.959 align:start position:0%
were you one of the ones that came to us
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
in January to just give us the
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
information portion okay so this a lot
 
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
of this shouldn't be new to us right I
 
00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:22.839 align:start position:0%
think Chris selo presented to this team
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
um just kind of the higher level
 
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
programmatic view of of our division
 
00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:30.279 align:start position:0%
so um I know you heard a lot about the
 
00:10:32.829 --> 00:10:32.839 align:start position:0%
com uh the Department's road map um and
 
00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
our initiatives there so we are um
 
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
initiative seven for building a system
 
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
of care for healthy aging which you've
 
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
probably heard a lot about um in hb2 of
 
00:10:46.269 --> 00:10:46.279 align:start position:0%
2023 and the work going onwards um that
 
00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:49.160 align:start position:0%
we're doing for that and then initiative
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
eight is strengthening the developmental
 
00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
disabilities program and systems so
 
00:10:58.629 --> 00:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
looking at uh parity and rates and
 
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
looking at a reimbursement system that
 
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.710 align:start position:0%
looking at a reimbursement system that
is

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
predictable Slide N I'm sorry I'm a
 
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
little slow so at the bottom of slide
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
eight on goal two develop and propose a
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
new reimbursement rate
 
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
structure can can you can you just give
 
00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
us like four sentences what what the old
 
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
and what the new what are we doing there
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
yep so we contracted with with an
 
00:11:32.629 --> 00:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
actuary to look at the actual costs of
 
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
providing our services in the in the DD
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
field um worked with them for about a
 
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
year and a half two years on services
 
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
and um our rates hadn't been uh studied
 
00:11:45.389 --> 00:11:45.399 align:start position:0%
I think since
 
00:11:45.399 --> 00:11:47.030 align:start position:0%
I think since
2017

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
2017
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
so what we found was our rates were
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
significantly lower in comparison to not
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
only other states but you know what the
 
00:11:58.910 --> 00:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
actual cost of doing that business is
 
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
and we we link that directly to um
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
having Services authorized but not
 
00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
having providers to provide those
 
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
services so it's great that you know it
 
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
that everyone's funded for services but
 
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
if you can't find a provider because
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
they don't get an adequate reimbursement
 
00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:18.519 align:start position:0%
rate for services um we're we're not
 
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
going to be able to provide the service
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
so is the expectation that we're going
 
00:12:25.389 --> 00:12:25.399 align:start position:0%
to probably increase rates overall in
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
the Aggregate and to draw out more
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
Supply and the process of doing that
 
00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to have both an increase in
 
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
quantity and an increase in the price so
 
00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:38.839 align:start position:0%
our total uh spend at the state is
 
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
likely to end up more it'll ends up more
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
in the short term I think our our our
 
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
strategy or our proposal was to focus on
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
those services that keep that are lower
 
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
cost and keep people um in the community
 
00:12:54.509 --> 00:12:54.519 align:start position:0%
is is there money in this budget for for
 
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
a prior yeah it was a prioritized need
 
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
that we put in that was not funded
 
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you representative
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
walner it looked like you might have a
 
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
question there all right go ahead uh
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
yeah representative priest thank you
 
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
you're in the sun there it's kind of
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
hard to see
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
great yay thank you for taking my
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
question um can you give us some numbers
 
00:13:27.629 --> 00:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
of how many um aging adults are in
 
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
long-term facility ities versus home
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
care and and what are the needs and what
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
are the
 
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
unsupportive needs out
 
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
there I I can give you the number so in
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
um in our waiver we have to report out
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
UND duplicated counts of people that we
 
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
serve so on the aging and adult waiver
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
which is the choices for Independence or
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
the CFI waiver we serve about
 
00:13:53.519 --> 00:13:55.150 align:start position:0%
the CFI waiver we serve about
4,161

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
4,161
 
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
individuals um in contrast to the
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
nursing facility care so it's in lie of
 
00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
Nursing Facility care um they're
 
00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
averaging 3-month average for nursing
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
facility care is about
 
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
3,688 individuals in our nursing
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
homes um on the developmental Services
 
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
waiver we serve
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
5,061 individuals just on the waiver um
 
00:14:21.389 --> 00:14:21.399 align:start position:0%
for our uh acquired brain disorder
 
00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
waiver we serve 228 folks and then on
 
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:26.959 align:start position:0%
our inhome support waiver which is our
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
children's developmental disabilities
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
waiver we serve
 
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
488 children I do want to say that our
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
service delivery system certainly serves
 
00:14:38.749 --> 00:14:38.759 align:start position:0%
a lot more people than the people just
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
on the waivers um so for example we
 
00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:44.959 align:start position:0%
would say um on the on the DD side of
 
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
things we serve over 15,000 families and
 
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
people in general when we're looking at
 
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
all the services not necessarily just um
 
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
people who are on the DD
 
00:14:59.629 --> 00:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
waiver as a followup how many addition
 
00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
people are asking for services but you
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
can't provide
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
services so we don't have a wait list
 
00:15:09.069 --> 00:15:09.079 align:start position:0%
for services um funding for services let
 
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
me say that we don't have a funding
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
weight list but again finding providers
 
00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:16.759 align:start position:0%
to um provide the services that people
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
need at the rates that we have
 
00:15:21.389 --> 00:15:21.399 align:start position:0%
especially on the DD waiver um is hard
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
so we're able to fund everybody which is
 
00:15:25.749 --> 00:15:25.759 align:start position:0%
great but we're not able to provide all
 
00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:36.509 --> 00:15:36.519 align:start position:0%
slide nine is just uh and you can read
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
these these are just some of our
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
accomplishments that we've had over the
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
past two years for each of our bureaus
 
00:15:45.309 --> 00:15:45.319 align:start position:0%
um I will say one thing that is uh
 
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
prevalent throughout all the bureaus is
 
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
our investment in it and I'll talk a
 
00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519 align:start position:0%
little bit about that our infrastructure
 
00:15:55.069 --> 00:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
and how we've changed um and are able to
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
not only track um data better but also
 
00:15:59.949 --> 00:15:59.959 align:start position:0%
produce some outc comes that we weren't
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
able to really do before because it was
 
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
a manual process or it was done by an
 
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:06.680 align:start position:0%
outside system that uh unfortunately
 
00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:09.160 align:start position:0%
does not is no longer operable so we've
 
00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:12.519 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time um creating
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
processes in um New Heights that
 
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
automate a lot of things for us we can I
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
can highlight some of those things as we
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
move ahead um I do also want to say and
 
00:16:26.309 --> 00:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
I'm sure a lot of people have heard um
 
00:16:28.269 --> 00:16:28.279 align:start position:0%
on the Bureau of Developmental services
 
00:16:31.309 --> 00:16:31.319 align:start position:0%
on July 1st 1 2023 we finally closed out
 
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
our corrective action cap that we had
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
with oh yes a representative stram knows
 
00:16:39.629 --> 00:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
all about it um we were able to close
 
00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
that out and meet compliance and that
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
was um something that had been out there
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
since 2017 I believe um that we've been
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
working toward so you know this team and
 
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
our providers and our area agencies have
 
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
worked really hard to gain compliance
 
00:16:58.309 --> 00:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
with CMS and give us the nice uh letter
 
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
that that is closed out um so we can
 
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
move towards you know move from
 
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
compliance and CMS and you know looking
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
at those regulations every day to really
 
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
how do we strengthen and make it a
 
00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
system that meets the needs of the
 
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
people that we serve so I just wanted to
 
00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
note that it's been a long process for
 
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
for the bureau and the division so I
 
00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:23.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to give that um some some
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
nine sorry so so I I looked ahead
 
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
through uh 14 where you've got it
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
enhancements and let me just say that I
 
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
I I love the fact that your division
 
00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:47.320 align:start position:0%
specifically got into the IT issues
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
because this is one of my big things is
 
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
you know what are we doing to leverage
 
00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
our it to drive productivity or to
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
improve you know reimbursements from the
 
00:18:00.669 --> 00:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
feds or from others and it looks like in
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of these are cleaning up
 
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
process um but um what of of of these
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
that have been completed or in progress
 
00:18:12.149 --> 00:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
which which one do you think has the
 
00:18:14.909 --> 00:18:14.919 align:start position:0%
biggest impact on driving
 
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
productivity um I would like I like can
 
00:18:18.909 --> 00:18:18.919 align:start position:0%
I have two because I feel like you can
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
have two all right I would say um the
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
transition for adult our Adult
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
Protective Services to go into New
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
Heights um it just creates a lot of
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
efficiencies for our sta St as it
 
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
relates to case consultation notes um
 
00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:36.039 align:start position:0%
we're able to pull data um a lot easier
 
00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
than we were in our old system um that's
 
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
not really supported anymore so I I
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
would say adult protection going into
 
00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
new heights but then a very close uh or
 
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
maybe equal would be our Bureau of
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
Developmental Services also going into
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
New Heights where we're able to um
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
automate a lot of functions as it
 
00:18:57.149 --> 00:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
relates to service authorizations we can
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
see where they're at in the process
 
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:01.640 align:start position:0%
um our providers can see into that
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
system as well so they can see if a
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
service authorization has been submitted
 
00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:07.400 align:start position:0%
you know is it waiting for the
 
00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
Department is it waiting for the
 
00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
provider just creating a lot of
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
transparency so it's not something
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
that's stuck in a spreadsheet at the
 
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
bureau level um where at any point a
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
provider can go in and look to see um
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
where their case is at so I think those
 
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
two would be our our two biggest
 
00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:27.799 align:start position:0%
accomplishments outstanding so so if I
 
00:19:30.909 --> 00:19:30.919 align:start position:0%
may make a request for the oversight
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
committee occasionally you talk to the
 
00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
oversight committee uh one of the times
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
coming up would you would you do just a
 
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
special focus on leveraging of it sure
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
okay yes I can do that thank you you're
 
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
welcome and I I do want to add a little
 
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
note to the it I know that there's been
 
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
um you know there's been a lot
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
accomplished over the bium and I think
 
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
um you know really looking at if we were
 
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
to reduce our uh our allocations for it
 
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
not only this is great right this this
 
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
creation of these IT services but we
 
00:20:08.909 --> 00:20:08.919 align:start position:0%
also have to make sure it's funded you
 
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
know going forward for maintenance um
 
00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
and any any other updates that you know
 
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
will streamline our processes and make
 
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
uh not only the lives of our staff
 
00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
better but you know quicker Service
 
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
delivery to to the folks that we serve
 
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
so I just want to put a plug out there
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
for that so you you brought up a really
 
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
big expense item maintenance uh gen
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
generally New Heights is budgeted for
 
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance in the these departments Mr
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
White or or is that under a big catchall
 
00:20:40.029 --> 00:20:40.039 align:start position:0%
in the in your department of it in the
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
department I I believe that's budgeted
 
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
in class 27 within the office of the
 
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner than the Bureau of
 
00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.950 align:start position:0%
commissioner than the Bureau of
Information

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
Information
 
00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
Services okay
 
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
so so at some point there may be kind of
 
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
a a training or a transparency thing for
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
the the members just so that we know
 
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
that new for example is helping support
 
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
specific departments and correlating the
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
costs with the with the benefit could
 
00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:09.039 align:start position:0%
help us I don't think we need to worry
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
about that in this budget cycle but
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
it'll be an ongoing sure I I I think the
 
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
um the presentation that Dave weers had
 
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
provided early on a number of weeks ago
 
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
had a breakdown of each system and then
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
the the the benefiting or uh parties or
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
or Services delivered to uh specific
 
00:21:28.909 --> 00:21:28.919 align:start position:0%
parties so you probably you may have a
 
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
reference document but we're more than
 
00:21:32.269 --> 00:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
happy to talk about that in the future
 
00:21:35.549 --> 00:21:35.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
you so slide 16 goes into now I'll talk
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
about each of our bureaus and go through
 
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
their um accounting units uh we'll start
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
with the Bureau of adult and Aging
 
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
Services so slide 16 just gives a an
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
overview of what we do in the Bureau of
 
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
adult and Aging Services so um just to
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
note we did have a bureau name change we
 
00:21:59.549 --> 00:21:59.559 align:start position:0%
you probably heard of us as the Bureau
 
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
of elderly and Adult Services and um and
 
00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
looking at age friendly language and
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
we're all aging and I have a little I'm
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
not wearing it now but a little pin
 
00:22:08.909 --> 00:22:08.919 align:start position:0%
saying aging everyone's doing it right
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
so um it's not just elderly I think
 
00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:13.559 align:start position:0%
elderly you know has that negative
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
connotation um and prevents some people
 
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
who are aging that might you know want
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
to access preventative Services that we
 
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
serve um but don't consider themselves
 
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
elderly so we were able to um you know
 
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
we enhanced our name to adult and aging
 
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:30.200 align:start position:0%
uh to take out that kind of elderly
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
connotation um and that we're all adults
 
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
and we're all aging so uh we might need
 
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
services at some
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
point um we're looking at strengthening
 
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
our uh Adult Protective Services again
 
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
through the it enhancement but also
 
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
looking at training opportunities for
 
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:47.960 align:start position:0%
them we're seeing in in a couple of
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
slides ahead um you know we're seeing
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
some Trends in um adult protection uh as
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
far as what we're seeing for cases um
 
00:22:59.470 --> 00:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
more cases as it relates to scams for
 
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
older adults um you know Financial
 
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
exploitation and a lot of um self-
 
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:07.480 align:start position:0%
neglect or isolation so we'll talk a
 
00:23:10.669 --> 00:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
little bit about that we administer
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
under the Bureau of adult and Aging
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
Services our choices for Independence
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
1915c Medicaid waiver so that provides
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
services to adults in the community um
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
who meet Nursing Facility level of care
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
but choose to have their services um the
 
00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
community we also develop uh we also
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
determine medical eligibility for level
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
of care not only for people on the
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
choices for Independence Weaver but also
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
for um individuals who are um admitting
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
into the nursing facilities to ensure
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
that they meet and need that level of
 
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
care medically so so on that bullet
 
00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
specifically to what extent today are
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
the counties officially responsible for
 
00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:57.640 align:start position:0%
helping with the uh medical eligibility
 
00:23:59.149 --> 00:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
level of care
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
the counties are not responsible at this
 
00:24:04.269 --> 00:24:04.279 align:start position:0%
time to to be part of the process we are
 
00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
working with uh maram County as they
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
have a few doing a pilot with Marat
 
00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
County to um use their they have some
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
Navigators um in their system to see if
 
00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:17.919 align:start position:0%
we can um transfer some of that you know
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
from their waiting lists for eligibility
 
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
not only for the nursing facility but
 
00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
for CFI and have them kind of be a quasi
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
arm of the department to help determine
 
00:24:29.549 --> 00:24:29.559 align:start position:0%
eligibility and and then on on the
 
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
previous bullet about the waiver so I
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
understand the waiver we we when we
 
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
asked for it and received it we um
 
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
basically made some uh commitments
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
things that look like commitments of how
 
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
many people we would have in CFI at each
 
00:24:45.789 --> 00:24:45.799 align:start position:0%
year yes and and as I understand it
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
we're we're only about 60 65% of those
 
00:24:53.269 --> 00:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
targets um what kind of potential uh
 
00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
problem would that cause with the
 
00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:57.640 align:start position:0%
federal government if we don't basically
 
00:25:00.149 --> 00:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
achieve what we said we would with the
 
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
CFI I I think we would have to give them
 
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
an explanation of why we're not seeing
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
the growth in those numbers we've talked
 
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:08.799 align:start position:0%
internally about you know when we do our
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
waiver amendment to really look at that
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
projection to see if that's something
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
that is attainable in New Hampshire um
 
00:25:18.389 --> 00:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
not that we're not an aging State
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
because we all know we are um but we
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
also have to have enough people who are
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
eligible for Medicaid in order to be on
 
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
the waiver so what we're seeing is our
 
00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
age is you know the the number of older
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
adults is climbing but the number of
 
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
older adults that qualify financially
 
00:25:36.669 --> 00:25:36.679 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid is not climbing at that
 
00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
same rate yeah so what I think I heard
 
00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
you say is is that we don't anticipate
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
any problem with the feds we may just
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
have to re update our waiver yeah and we
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
we would do that in our next Amendment
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
just to say you know explain why our
 
00:25:53.549 --> 00:25:53.559 align:start position:0%
projection isn't what you know is being
 
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
served and you know any interventions to
 
00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
help that
 
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh yes representative seaworth thank
 
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh kind of as a followup
 
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
to that is
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
there um a connection so if we're at 65%
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
on what we expected to do is there a
 
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
Federal grant that we have to curtail
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
because because we're not eligible for
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
it or is it all taken care of in the
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
waiver processes yeah I would say we're
 
00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
good from from that side it's taken care
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
in the waiver we also have have um we
 
00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:31.559 align:start position:0%
received another Federal grant outside
 
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
of um the CFI waiver called money falls
 
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
the person which is um 100% federal
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
funds that really focus on transitioning
 
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
individuals out of nursing facilities to
 
00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:45.039 align:start position:0%
remain in the community so we also have
 
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
that project that we're standing up and
 
00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:51.029 align:start position:0%
that project that we're standing up and
operationalizing

00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:54.269 --> 00:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
now thank you yep and then we contract
 
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
in adult and Aging Services with
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
providers um in the community to um
 
00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:02.799 align:start position:0%
Carry Out uh services that are funded
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
through other funding streams so I think
 
00:27:07.029 --> 00:27:07.039 align:start position:0%
what you'll see um in in this Bureau
 
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
particularly we braid a lot of funding
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
together so we get funding from not only
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and not only the state but we
 
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
have um older Americans act money that
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
we get in in in Social uh service block
 
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
grants um different just different
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
streams that fund um preventative
 
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
community- Based Services so you'll see
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
um it's not I think on the other uh in
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
our other divisions you'll see that it's
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
50% Medicaid 50% State dollars this is a
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
little different when we're talking
 
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
about the funding of things like meals
 
00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
and nutrition um Family caregiver
 
00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:44.360 align:start position:0%
support uh in home care so Nursing Care
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
in somebody's home or or housekeeping so
 
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
it's a breeding of of multiple funding
 
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
streams not just your traditional
 
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and state funds so I'm jumping
 
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
to slide 19 and I'm looking at um uh at
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
the bottom the number of sexual abuse uh
 
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
reportings um what is is there a general
 
00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh setting in which those seem to be
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
more more predominant are these settings
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
like uh you know private nursing homes
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
public nursing homes CFI I'm just I'm I
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
don't have if you don't have the data
 
00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
don't don't worry about it it's an
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
information only question it just makes
 
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
me curious if we have something that we
 
00:28:31.149 --> 00:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
should be doing that setting base to to
 
00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:33.039 align:start position:0%
try to reduce that I'm sure we have the
 
00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:35.480 align:start position:0%
data I just don't have it with me but um
 
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
we can look at that to see if there's
 
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
any Trend or um uh environment where
 
00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
we're seeing that more prob and then
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
exploitation does that include uh like
 
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
Financial exploitation is that
 
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
predominantly what that is that kind of
 
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
exploitation it can be or it can be um
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
you know people just mostly Financial I
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
will say but it can be you can exploit
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
people emotionally by you know uh
 
00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
manipulating them into making you know
 
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
them feel bad for somebody else so it is
 
00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
I would say mostly Financial but it
 
00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
could be in other forms as well all
 
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
right thank
 
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
you a question represent torski thank
 
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
you good morning thanks for being here
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if we're going to get to
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
this in the coming slides if so put me
 
00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
off I have a question explicitly about
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
hb2 that affects your department on page
 
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
49 section 98 at the
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
bottom um regarding congregate housing
 
00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
and services that it will be the program
 
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
it will be suspended for the coming bium
 
00:29:36.269 --> 00:29:36.279 align:start position:0%
can you please talk about that in the
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
impact of what that could have yes I
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
will get to that okay yes I will talk
 
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:41.960 align:start position:0%
about looking forward to it thanks yes
 
00:29:44.269 --> 00:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other hp2 items
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
in there I mean let's I I think that's a
 
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
great question uh but are do we have
 
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
multiples of them you want to go over um
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
that affects this Bureau I don't know
 
00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
but that one jumped out to me okay in
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
the last couple days all right great
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
question go ahead uh representa
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
walner thank you so while we're at um
 
00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
The Adult Protective Services how many
 
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:11.320 align:start position:0%
how many Adult Protective Services
 
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
Workers do you have in total we have
 
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
70 and what kind of a case load are they
 
00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
carrying they're carrying about
 
00:30:23.789 --> 00:30:23.799 align:start position:0%
97 um 97 individuals on their case
 
00:30:26.549 --> 00:30:26.559 align:start position:0%
load which is which is there's no
 
00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
National Standard in Lo for adult
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
protection we're really uh working with
 
00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
um the national folks on developing
 
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
something like that there is no standard
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
I think in other um avenues that provide
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
Protective Services they do um but there
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
is no National Standard certainly we
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
would like that number to come down um
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
as again as our aging population grows
 
00:30:51.389 --> 00:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we just expect the
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
number of adult protection protective
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
cases to grow um I do think we have some
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
opportunities to better partner with
 
00:31:00.029 --> 00:31:00.039 align:start position:0%
with some of our community
 
00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
organizations um you know if it's not
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
necessarily an abuse or neglect area
 
00:31:06.629 --> 00:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
that somebody needs you know more
 
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
informational referral or or um
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
community- Based Services to be able to
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
hand off um that from an APS worker to a
 
00:31:16.509 --> 00:31:16.519 align:start position:0%
community- based provider so we're
 
00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
working on those connections as
 
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
well go ahead so do you have on all of
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
these cases does the case worker have
 
00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
yes yes I'm looking at my team back
 
00:31:35.629 --> 00:31:35.639 align:start position:0%
there I see the shaking head out there
 
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
yes um face to face um and so you can
 
00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
you can tell I think they use a priority
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
that we have we have some
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
decision-making trees that we use in APS
 
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
to kind of um see which which uh person
 
00:31:52.029 --> 00:31:52.039 align:start position:0%
should be seen sooner which person maybe
 
00:31:54.509 --> 00:31:54.519 align:start position:0%
be able to be helped by an aging or
 
00:31:56.269 --> 00:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
disability Resource Center maybe
 
00:31:58.509 --> 00:31:58.519 align:start position:0%
somebody else is being served by by the
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
Bureau of uh um mental health services
 
00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
so we have an algorithm to kind of
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
prioritize those at higher
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
risk and one other question is there a
 
00:32:12.269 --> 00:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
hotline or a re a referral number that
 
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
the public has yes um I think it's on
 
00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:17.720 align:start position:0%
one of the slides and we also have now
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
as part of our IT solutions we also have
 
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
24-hour reporting online so anyone can
 
00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
report allegations of abuse or neglect
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
um that that's on an online port that
 
00:32:29.789 --> 00:32:29.799 align:start position:0%
people can submit and that's something
 
00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
new that we instituted this year so um
 
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
247 ability to report great thank you
 
00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:38.519 align:start position:0%
representative priest did you have a
 
00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
question my question was the same as the
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
previous representative thank you I
 
00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
continue on slide 17 we talk about um
 
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:52.919 align:start position:0%
this is where we have the aps accounting
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
units I didn't know if you had questions
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
or wanted to review this we do um um you
 
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
can see here in accounting unit 9250 was
 
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
where all of our APS staff are H housed
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
and paid for um significant General
 
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
funds there that's historical for APS as
 
00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
far as the federal government not
 
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
funding the service however um in 2023
 
00:33:18.909 --> 00:33:18.919 align:start position:0%
they started giving us a small amount of
 
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
money um which is that accounting unit
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
4046 um for adult protective operation
 
00:33:27.789 --> 00:33:27.799 align:start position:0%
so um we're starting to see a little
 
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
little bit of um assistance with the
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
federal government and providing funds
 
00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
for adult protection can can you jump to
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
slide 22 or or did you have things in
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
highlight go go ahead turn your mic on
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
before we leave this slide yeah quick
 
00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
question you're still on 17 yes okay uh
 
00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
just helping me with the terminology of
 
00:33:58.269 --> 00:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
minimum allotment state could you
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
explain what that means yeah sure um so
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
the the federal government has a formula
 
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
uh in in determining how much states
 
00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:08.919 align:start position:0%
will receive in federal dollars so
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
looking um at and I think main main
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
Vermont and Rhode Island were all um a
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
minimum allotment State um due to a
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
couple of factors population um people
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
who are uh in poverty um number of Aging
 
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
adults so they they look all look at all
 
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
of that and create um a scale in which
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
states uh receive those dollars so St
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
like Massachusetts I was looking at the
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
numbers they receive a bit more but I
 
00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:42.280 align:start position:0%
would only say maybe like 20 or $30,000
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
more not not a significant amount of
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
money um and this amount of money for
 
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
the aps formula grant is pretty um low
 
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
comparative to you know other Federal
 
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
funding um but it's a start we'll we'll
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
welcome are you on 22 now or is there
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
no okay slide 22 um is our aging and
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
disability Resource Centers so I I CL I
 
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
clustered these together for a couple of
 
00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
reasons um again this is kind of how we
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
see the breeding of funding work so in
 
00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
9565 that is uh where our funding for
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
our adrcs our aging and disability
 
00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
Resource Center is also known as service
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
link uh previously known as service link
 
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
we have seven contracted providers um at
 
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
13 different sites throughout the state
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh they provide information referral
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
information referral supports um person
 
00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.510 align:start position:0%
information referral supports um person
centered

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
centered
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
counseling uh they administer our family
 
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
caregivers Support Program throughout
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
the state um and ALS also um they were
 
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:03.640 align:start position:0%
given U additional dollars in hp2 of 23
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
um to enhance the system of care for
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
healthy aging
 
00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:12.200 align:start position:0%
um so we have that we also in
 
00:36:15.309 --> 00:36:15.319 align:start position:0%
3317 we have the senior Medicare uh
 
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
Patrol program mostly federal funds that
 
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
teaches um older adults who are on
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
Medicare to look at and be aware of any
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
Medicare scams that might be going on
 
00:36:29.069 --> 00:36:29.079 align:start position:0%
and then 8925 is the Medicaid services
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
Grant uh which is the state health
 
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
insurance education program uh 95%
 
00:36:36.349 --> 00:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
federal funds and it really is a a
 
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
counseling program to help people
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
understand their options when it comes
 
00:36:40.079 --> 00:36:46.270 align:start position:0%
understand their options when it comes
to

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
Medicare any questions on those I don't
 
00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:54.750 align:start position:0%
Medicare any questions on those I don't
see

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
any um slide 23 is just a kind of a
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
visual on the system of care for healthy
 
00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:04.599 align:start position:0%
aging um so just wanted to point out you
 
00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
know we are underway we were able to
 
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
again secure that funding in hp2 in 23
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
um so that included uh a a study to look
 
00:37:19.309 --> 00:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
at our our coordinated system uh some in
 
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
some funding for it technology to create
 
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
dashboarding um reporting requirements
 
00:37:30.309 --> 00:37:30.319 align:start position:0%
we did get that um significant a good
 
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
significant amount of funding for person
 
00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
centering counseling programs that are
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
within our adrcs and the department
 
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
received two positions to help with the
 
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
system of care for healthy aging um so
 
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
we so that was an
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
hb2 um this graphic really just shows
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
you know obviously the the individuals
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
that we serve in the middle and then all
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
the supports in places of support that
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
um people can go to in order to navigate
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:03.640 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent tki so slide 23 is
 
00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:05.720 align:start position:0%
all about this wonderful work that
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
happened with hb2 where we last bium
 
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
where are we going to be at now in this
 
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
bium with this same work are we going to
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
be able to continue it is my question
 
00:38:18.309 --> 00:38:18.319 align:start position:0%
funding wise or just um programmatically
 
00:38:22.349 --> 00:38:22.359 align:start position:0%
wise both okay I can talk um from a
 
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
program standpoint our next our next um
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
our next steps in the system of care for
 
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
healthy aging is we still haven't um
 
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
completed the dashboarding piece so
 
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
again kind of the it in in real time so
 
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
people know um what services are
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
available to them um you know if if a
 
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
provider has uh a capacity to take on
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
somebody who needs home health care for
 
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
example um so that has yet to be
 
00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
completed uh but that's part of that
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
appropriation in hb2 of last year we
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
have been able to
 
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
um start and what we're seeing is an
 
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
increase in home visiting with the
 
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
inclusion of the dollars for the person
 
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
centered counseling so um we've been
 
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
seeing the number of home visits from
 
00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:13.480 align:start position:0%
those um individuals that work at our
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
adrcs um to go out to the home um and
 
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
kind of it's always good to have an
 
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
extra set of eyes on somebody um or if
 
00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:23.079 align:start position:0%
somebody physically can't come into the
 
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
adrc or have communication issues uh
 
00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
through telephone so we're also ramping
 
00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
adrcs we have 63 staff um Statewide in
 
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
in our
 
00:39:44.109 --> 00:39:44.119 align:start position:0%
adrcs um that's just in in a brief kind
 
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
of overview of slide 24 of what what
 
00:39:48.589 --> 00:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
they do which I I talked a little bit
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
about person centered counseling access
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
to uh family caregiver information and
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
explore options that you know are either
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
covered by Medicaid or Medicare
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
um slide 25 is just um the locations
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
that we have throughout the state um so
 
00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:07.720 align:start position:0%
walk-in locations physical locations for
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
people to come in and again um those
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
those workers can go out and do home
 
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
in slide 26 is just a breakdown of um
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
the total Encounters in in state fiscal
 
00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:27.400 align:start position:0%
year 24 that our adc's had and also uh
 
00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
um again I'm focusing on the home visits
 
00:40:30.829 --> 00:40:30.839 align:start position:0%
because I think it's really important to
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
have eyes on some some folks um and then
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
kind of Total Staffing by each um
 
00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
adrc so so I have a a a vision of a
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
virtual Health Care system to where we
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
don't need to Mo move people around on
 
00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
roads as much do you do you how long do
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
you think it might be to where uh we can
 
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
provide a tremendous amount of this
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
support U virtually through something
 
00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:00.839 align:start position:0%
like tele medicine instead of spending
 
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
windshield time moving people around
 
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I think we do a lot of that now
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
where a lot of our encounters like we
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
call them encounters but are either you
 
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
know on a zoom or on teams or via
 
00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:14.079 align:start position:0%
telephone um you know not only for I
 
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
think we learned that through Co that we
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
can get a lot done without being face
 
00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:19.640 align:start position:0%
Toof face with somebody physically um
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
and it's also it allows us to touch more
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
people um you know to be able to be more
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
efficient in our time so you know time
 
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
Trav traving um from Claremont to to
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
coldbrook is isn't really efficient so
 
00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:35.720 align:start position:0%
if we can leverage those um and connect
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
more providers with that tele medicine
 
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
so would you say you're about half of
 
00:41:43.309 --> 00:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
your visits now are virtual oh I would
 
00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
say more than more than half are um you
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
know either via telephone or visual or
 
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
virtual and and do you see us hitting
 
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
80% at some point I would think that
 
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
would be a good goal I I I don't know I
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
don't have the number now but would
 
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
think that you know the number of inhome
 
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
visits would really be limited to people
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
who may be at risk or uh people that
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to navigate
 
00:42:10.349 --> 00:42:10.359 align:start position:0%
technology um or have the ability to you
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
know uh have the internet or um you know
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
some of those other barriers so one last
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
question here and then I I think you uh
 
00:42:20.349 --> 00:42:20.359 align:start position:0%
representative walner has a question but
 
00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
um Dr Ballard chairs a tele medicine
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
committee with people from around the
 
00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:27.870 align:start position:0%
committee with people from around the
state

00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:30.839 align:start position:0%
and they try to aggregate data that
 
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
reflects the changing use of tele it's
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
just generally called tele medicine do
 
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
you do you think your data ends up in uh
 
00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
his data sets I wouldn't at this time I
 
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
don't think so because it's not
 
00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
considered medicine I'm not I'm not sure
 
00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:50.839 align:start position:0%
if he's coming from a you know a medical
 
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
provider yeah um tele medicine if if you
 
00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:55.640 align:start position:0%
ever have a cup of coffee with them ask
 
00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
him about it cuz I because what we're
 
00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
trying to document in that committee is
 
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh the the changing nature of healthc
 
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
care delivery and what we may do to
 
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
facilitate it to make it go faster so
 
00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
all right representative Waller did you
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
have a question representative tersi
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
thanks can you explain um to me why the
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County numbers are so low on
 
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
these home visits and encounters when
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
it's the largest county I don't
 
00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
understand that I I think part of it has
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
been our ability to retain staff in in
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
that specific office so just our uh
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
staff capacity which we're seeing um
 
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.870 align:start position:0%
staff capacity which we're seeing um
improve

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
improve
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
um other than that I don't have um
 
00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
another answer as to why that's lower
 
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
okay do you have a followup information
 
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
my followup is I'm really concerned
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
looking at that number compared to
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County and Marram County with
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
it's half of those counties that tells
 
00:43:57.549 --> 00:43:57.559 align:start position:0%
me that there are a lot of people who
 
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
are not getting the support and the the
 
00:44:02.549 --> 00:44:02.559 align:start position:0%
contact that they should be getting yeah
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
and I think if you're looking at the
 
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
particular home visit number with um 37
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
in 24 and 25 you know for the half a
 
00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
year that we've been or a little bit
 
00:44:15.309 --> 00:44:15.319 align:start position:0%
more we're up to 24 so we are seeing a
 
00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:17.839 align:start position:0%
little bit of a climb their encounters
 
00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
though if you look that's still
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
6,716 encounters so that could be um
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
again you know it could be a telephone
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
call it could be a zoom meeting so not
 
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily a home visit but we're still
 
00:44:33.549 --> 00:44:33.559 align:start position:0%
have a a significant uh amount of
 
00:44:36.549 --> 00:44:36.559 align:start position:0%
encounters I I do see like Marram County
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
and Rockingham County have have higher
 
00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:41.720 align:start position:0%
encounters than than Hillsboro County
 
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean just if you look at
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
population alone they should be
 
00:44:46.549 --> 00:44:46.559 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County numbers of contact
 
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
should be encounter should be up there
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
with the other two if not more so okay
 
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.390 align:start position:0%
with the other two if not more so okay
thank

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
you representative Daniels I just follow
 
00:44:58.750 --> 00:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
following up on that you list the number
 
00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
of home visits but you don't list the
 
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
number of
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
homes so you know going going back to uh
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
H Hillsboro County 37 home visits but
 
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
how many times that did how many homes
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
did you visit it's a good question I can
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
look at I don't have it with me but we
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
can get some unduplicated counts so
 
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
number of actual people versus if I go
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
to a home two times three times you know
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
is that counted as three visits or one
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
visit I can get that for you thank you
 
00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:30.150 align:start position:0%
visit I can get that for you thank you
you're

00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:32.829 --> 00:45:32.839 align:start position:0%
welcome and of and of course however
 
00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
you're doing it the data would be
 
00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
captured consistently like we wouldn't
 
00:45:39.309 --> 00:45:39.319 align:start position:0%
have a Hillsboro issue where they're may
 
00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
be reporting the data differently even
 
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
though the yeah everyone uses the same
 
00:45:46.109 --> 00:45:46.119 align:start position:0%
reporting so I don't think it's a data
 
00:45:46.119 --> 00:45:53.270 align:start position:0%
reporting so I don't think it's a data
collection

00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:55.640 align:start position:0%
issue slide
 
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
27 um is our accounting units for um
 
00:46:02.549 --> 00:46:02.559 align:start position:0%
again still in our same Bureau but um
 
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
our Administration on Aging our social
 
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
service block grant and our volunteer
 
00:46:09.549 --> 00:46:09.559 align:start position:0%
opportunities so
 
00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
7872 um the administration on Aging
 
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
funds a variety of different services so
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
anything from nutrition
 
00:46:20.349 --> 00:46:20.359 align:start position:0%
services uh home modifications and
 
00:46:20.359 --> 00:46:21.589 align:start position:0%
services uh home modifications and
caregiver

00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
caregiver
 
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
support and 9255 that's our social
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
service block grant um
 
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
again um funds things like medical Adult
 
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
Day services in home care uh chore
 
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
Services emergency support resit hom
 
00:46:39.309 --> 00:46:39.319 align:start position:0%
delivered meals and Homemaker services
 
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
so so is this I assume Meals on Wheels
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
is part of that yes is is all are all of
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
meals and wheels in this area or are
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
they spread out in multiple accounting
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
units they are spread out in multiple
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
accounting units so um certainly um they
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
are under the administration on Aging
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
funds they're in the social service
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
block grants um they're also in you know
 
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
we have a significant um state funded
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
portion of meals and nutrition do you
 
00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
know if we do one big contract with them
 
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
or do we do like 12 different contracts
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
per program yeah so um for for meals we
 
00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:20.200 align:start position:0%
have 10 contracts that braid all that
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
funding in together um so 10 10
 
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
providers with their contract but
 
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
includes you know funding from the
 
00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
administration aging from the block
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
grant from the different sources all
 
00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:32.990 align:start position:0%
grant from the different sources all
right

00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:35.960 align:start position:0%
thanks represent
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
noo yeah and looking at page uh 900 I'm
 
00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
just want is this another case where we
 
00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:43.839 align:start position:0%
have a crosswalk issue where
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
money I see you know there's a 100,000
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
in there for fiscal year 25 adjusted and
 
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
then goes to zero is that another where
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
it's shifted to another
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
accounting unit um you're looking at
 
00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
9010 uh class
 
00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
103 yeah one I'm looking at 103 and I
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
guess I'm looking at yeah so there was
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
in chapter 79 laws of 2023
 
00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
hb2 uh there was an appropriation made
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
for the Foster grandparent program which
 
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
is currently not
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
funded okay so that's why it went to
 
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
zero okay yes and then the other a quick
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
followup on um on the volunteer
 
00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
activities how many how many people are
 
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
we serving
 
00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:31.710 align:start position:0%
we serving
[Applause]

00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
there I do have that I just have to get
 
00:48:37.829 --> 00:48:37.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
page so for the volunteer um it's it's
 
00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
the senior companion program which has
 
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
been um in existence in New Hampshire
 
00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:46.910 align:start position:0%
been um in existence in New Hampshire
since

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
1974 and so when we look at um 2020 uh
 
00:48:54.549 --> 00:48:54.559 align:start position:0%
four numbers we um have 75 companions
 
00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:57.640 align:start position:0%
that have provided uh over 50 3,000
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
hours of services to
 
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
457 um older adults so that funding um
 
00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
provides you know mileage reimbursement
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
a small stip in Education and Training
 
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
to those um senior
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
you and uh chairman Edwards if I can
 
00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
just add one thing on the um in the
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 9010 uh class 103
 
00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
because the Foster um grandparent
 
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:29.480 align:start position:0%
program is not funded in the current B
 
00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
anym I did send Kevin an email over the
 
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
weekend indicating that we'd probably
 
00:49:34.349 --> 00:49:34.359 align:start position:0%
want to consider suspending the
 
00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
corresponding statute for the bayum if
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be funny going
 
00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
forward all right good
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:04.109 --> 00:50:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
um slide 28 is specific to nutrition
 
00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
services so just giving um you some
 
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
information on the um satisfaction
 
00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:14.680 align:start position:0%
surveys that we send out to folks that
 
00:50:16.589 --> 00:50:16.599 align:start position:0%
Access Nutrition so it could be Meals on
 
00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
Wheels it could be our grab andg go
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
services or it could be congregate meal
 
00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
settings so um you know we serve a lot
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
of people um 30 over 37,000 folks we've
 
00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
served over almost 2 million meals um
 
00:50:33.549 --> 00:50:33.559 align:start position:0%
and you know I think I think one of the
 
00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:35.240 align:start position:0%
things I want to highlight is that from
 
00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
a Meals on Wheels perspective you know
 
00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
61% of our folks say it's their primary
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
source of
 
00:50:45.309 --> 00:50:45.319 align:start position:0%
nutrition um and then you know 41% say
 
00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
it's the only person they see all week
 
00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
is the person that delivers their meals
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
um so not only is it providing nutrition
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
services but it also provides another
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
layer of support um and oversight of of
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
folks so if somebody didn't pick up
 
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
their meals our meals and wheels
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
providers are great at notifying you
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
know either their their agency or us to
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
say we haven't seen you know Melissa in
 
00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:08.200 align:start position:0%
a couple of days I think we need to
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
check in on her or I saw her and she was
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
looking a little different today it's
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
it's a great you know supplemental set
 
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
of eyes uh for people who are homebound
 
00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
um and receiving meals so not only does
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
it provide nutrition but also that extra
 
00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
layer so so I love meals and wheels CU I
 
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
had surgery on my ankle year or two ago
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
and I was stuck in my comfy chair for 3
 
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
months and they would come into my house
 
00:51:35.309 --> 00:51:35.319 align:start position:0%
and feed me right there at my chair and
 
00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
you know ask me how my day was going
 
00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
doing like a little mental health check
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know if they did that
 
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
intentionally but it was there uh the
 
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
only issue I had with them is that they
 
00:51:48.789 --> 00:51:48.799 align:start position:0%
they didn't do weekends they didn't do
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
Saturday and Sunday it was Monday
 
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
through Friday it was one meal and and
 
00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:55.160 align:start position:0%
for a big fat guy like me it wasn't
 
00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
enough food but other other than that
 
00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:01.640 align:start position:0%
they were really good representative
 
00:52:04.789 --> 00:52:04.799 align:start position:0%
walner thank you so when Meals on Wheels
 
00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:07.720 align:start position:0%
goes out and delivers a meal and a day
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
goes by or two days goes by and they
 
00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
haven't seen anyone who actually then
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
follows up and do you actually go out to
 
00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
the house yeah so um with our contract
 
00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:21.400 align:start position:0%
there is um kind of a a safety net so if
 
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
somebody does see something like that
 
00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
they they report it um to their
 
00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
supervisor but we have contract managers
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
that manage all the 10 meals and wheels
 
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
contracts so the expectation would be
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
that they report up to us and then we
 
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
can partner either with you know the
 
00:52:37.349 --> 00:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
local adrc or if it's something that
 
00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
we're concerned from a protective
 
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
standpoint we can look at adult
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
protection or even a wellness check
 
00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839 align:start position:0%
through the local you know Police
 
00:52:46.589 --> 00:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
Department to make sure that person is
 
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
okay so so can I do a time check um I I
 
00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:53.960 align:start position:0%
I think we've got U 40 more minutes that
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
we're pushing towards and then I want to
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
open up for some questions around
 
00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
possible um shifts to mcos so how how do
 
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
you think we're doing you got another 40
 
00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
minutes what do you think for uh I would
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
say we still have um the developmental
 
00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:11.240 align:start position:0%
Services waivers which I think might
 
00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
take some time so I don't know if you
 
00:53:16.789 --> 00:53:16.799 align:start position:0%
want to jump to BDS um or if there are
 
00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:19.160 align:start position:0%
any large question we still have we
 
00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
haven't also talked about um CFI or
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities in theas might want
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
to jump that first I I think I think we
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
might get to the CFI issue when we start
 
00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
talking about a potential shift to manag
 
00:53:40.589 --> 00:53:40.599 align:start position:0%
care okay I think okay all right um so
 
00:53:43.069 --> 00:53:43.079 align:start position:0%
so as I'm flipping through the
 
00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
think where do you think we can go I
 
00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
think you got some good stuff in here
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
but but do we but you have good write up
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
too so can we just read those and and we
 
00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
could get into the DD area yep I was
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
thinking we could do slide oh go ahead
 
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:03.640 align:start position:0%
sorry I had flagged a specific question
 
00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:06.200 align:start position:0%
that you're sl you want to talk you have
 
00:54:07.589 --> 00:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
a question you want to ask I'm sorry a
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
specific line item on hb1 that we're
 
00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
about to you're flipping Pages by that I
 
00:54:14.349 --> 00:54:14.359 align:start position:0%
have okay what what uh page number would
 
00:54:16.109 --> 00:54:16.119 align:start position:0%
you want to have us highlight so you
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
could ask your question on page 31 I
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
have a question about the um accounting
 
00:54:31.789 --> 00:54:31.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:33.069 --> 00:54:33.079 align:start position:0%
I think this
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
is the CFI and the
 
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
um nursing home yes is that correct
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
corre okay um looking at the 506 line
 
00:54:47.829 --> 00:54:47.839 align:start position:0%
almost all the way at the bottom it
 
00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
looks like there is a um drop in funding
 
00:54:56.829 --> 00:54:56.839 align:start position:0%
to the um 26 the 125
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm just curious if um that funding
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
that we put in there with Medicaid rates
 
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
last go around if it's still in there if
 
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
they're going to be supported at the
 
00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
same level or if there's going to be a
 
00:55:11.309 --> 00:55:11.319 align:start position:0%
change in the support that they get your
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
your question is very clear I I'm just
 
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
not tracking which pages and numbers P
 
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
yeah all the way at the bottom there's
 
00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
a actually a nursing home payment line
 
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:30.799 align:start position:0%
and there's also a home support waiver
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
Services line and it looks like 504
 
00:55:37.390 --> 00:55:37.400 align:start position:0%
nursing homes gets a big bump but it
 
00:55:39.309 --> 00:55:39.319 align:start position:0%
looks like the home support waiver
 
00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
service does not there's also asteris on
 
00:55:44.309 --> 00:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
there with footnotes so I'm just hoping
 
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
we can dig into both of those and make
 
00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
sure that um both of those are seeing
 
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
the proper proper level of support sure
 
00:55:55.309 --> 00:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
so if you if you look at so on page uh
 
00:55:58.589 --> 00:55:58.599 align:start position:0%
92 account unit 2152 I I'll start with
 
00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:01.640 align:start position:0%
line 506 so this is the CFI waiver
 
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
payments in in the current
 
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
bium uh this was the 506 line was
 
00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
budgeted at 92 million 100
 
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
million so what you're looking at there
 
00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:14.440 align:start position:0%
is you're looking at the actuals and
 
00:56:17.789 --> 00:56:17.799 align:start position:0%
that has the applied rate increases from
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
hb2 so when you're looking at the
 
00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:21.400 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized you're actually
 
00:56:23.549 --> 00:56:23.559 align:start position:0%
seeing a bit of carry forward that was
 
00:56:25.789 --> 00:56:25.799 align:start position:0%
not spent in the first year so the
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
projection going forward are based on on
 
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
the actual expenses and the adjusted
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
authorized doesn't necessarily um it's
 
00:56:35.829 --> 00:56:35.839 align:start position:0%
not necessarily a good comparator but in
 
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
in the budget we have Incorporated those
 
00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
rate increases into that um historically
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
we also used classes um 505 and 529 but
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
those have been wrapped up into into
 
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
class 506 which is why you're not seeing
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
that anymore and the reason that we did
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
that was because we had some challenges
 
00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
relative to the administration of that
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
so if we needed to move money in between
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
that we could be looking at a 5e delay
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to ensure that Services
 
00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
were paid um on time and in a timely
 
00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:11.480 align:start position:0%
manner uh in the event we had to go back
 
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
through so so that was a change that was
 
00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:15.880 align:start position:0%
made by this committee um in
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
consolidating those lines in the last
 
00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:19.720 align:start position:0%
budget and in the next cycle you won't
 
00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:22.799 align:start position:0%
see those lines anymore
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
okay could we talk about the the
 
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
increase in the nursing home rates which
 
00:57:28.829 --> 00:57:28.839 align:start position:0%
does look like a significant increase
 
00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
sure so in the in the class 504 line
 
00:57:34.829 --> 00:57:34.839 align:start position:0%
there these are the the nursing facility
 
00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
payments for Medicaid eligible
 
00:57:40.029 --> 00:57:40.039 align:start position:0%
individuals um there there's a bit of a
 
00:57:44.589 --> 00:57:44.599 align:start position:0%
history here so in state fiscal year 24
 
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
the budgeted amount was 233
 
00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:50.799 align:start position:0%
million and you'll see that the expense
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
there is $263 million so about $30
 
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
million higher um I believe Henry Litman
 
00:57:59.870 --> 00:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
Andor myself have talked to the fiscal
 
00:58:02.349 --> 00:58:02.359 align:start position:0%
committee and members of this committee
 
00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
about uh some of the nursing facility
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
change of ownership challenges that the
 
00:58:09.309 --> 00:58:09.319 align:start position:0%
state has been seeing where we've seen I
 
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
think 18 18 nursing facilities change
 
00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:15.640 align:start position:0%
ownership that's led to a number of
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
Downstream issues including back billing
 
00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
which has been uh pretty significant uh
 
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
last year I don't remember off the top
 
00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
of my head but I thought we saw over $14
 
00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:27.640 align:start position:0%
million of back billing from prior years
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
and that's a that is a historical
 
00:58:32.069 --> 00:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
anomaly and likely a function of both
 
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
delays and billing during the pandemic
 
00:58:37.630 --> 00:58:37.640 align:start position:0%
um as well as the change of ownership
 
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
issue that the state is
 
00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:41.720 align:start position:0%
experiencing what you when you look at
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
State fiscal year 25 and the adjusted
 
00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
authorized we have already moved um
 
00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
through the department-wide transfer
 
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:54.559 align:start position:0%
this year so far um I believe it was uh
 
00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
$10 million already uh in this year
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
we're expecting to have to move an
 
00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:03.400 align:start position:0%
additional $10 to $30 million as well to
 
00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
continue to deal with the back billing
 
00:59:07.829 --> 00:59:07.839 align:start position:0%
issue so when you look at um State
 
00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:11.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal years 26 and 27 we looked at a
 
00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
period of 8 years of growth to to
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
estimate the numbers that we would need
 
00:59:18.589 --> 00:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
based on Trends and utilization and
 
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's why those numbers are showing an
 
00:59:24.109 --> 00:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
increase there wow okay so it's not
 
00:59:27.029 --> 00:59:27.039 align:start position:0%
necessarily choices being made to sync
 
00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
more money in the nursing homes as
 
00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:30.559 align:start position:0%
opposed to CFI which keeps people in
 
00:59:30.559 --> 00:59:31.510 align:start position:0%
opposed to CFI which keeps people in
their

00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:59:35.029 --> 00:59:35.039 align:start position:0%
homes yes administrative delays and
 
00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
snafus and payments that were just
 
00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
trying to pick up the
 
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
pieces and backfill as you said I I I
 
00:59:43.870 --> 00:59:43.880 align:start position:0%
think it's more than administrative
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
delays it's it's some of the challenges
 
00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
that we've seen uh with ownership that
 
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
are are resulting in those things so I
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I mean that may be the effect
 
00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:55.720 align:start position:0%
but when you're looking at the cause
 
00:59:57.870 --> 00:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's where you know I think Henry
 
01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
said the other day we've had a third of
 
01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:01.960 align:start position:0%
our nursing facilities change in
 
01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
ownership in the past couple of years
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
okay that's that's pretty significant
 
01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:07.640 align:start position:0%
and that has caused a degree of
 
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
instability and it's affected the the
 
01:00:12.589 --> 01:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
back billing that we've seen included in
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
there as well is also the rate increases
 
01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
from hb2 um so so so there's a number of
 
01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
different factors okay I just wanted to
 
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that this was not a uh
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
investing in nursing homes as opposed to
 
01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
CFI which we all know was not the best
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
choice that is correct thanks so my
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
impression over the last year or two is
 
01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:33.640 align:start position:0%
the department really prioritizes the
 
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
CFI and trying to make it happen so um
 
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
so I if it's not reflected here it's not
 
01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:43.400 align:start position:0%
a reflection I to think on their
 
01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:45.400 align:start position:0%
prioritization they they're having other
 
01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:48.280 align:start position:0%
issues with getting CFI really ruled
 
01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:51.880 align:start position:0%
out yeah so so representative Stringham
 
01:00:54.589 --> 01:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean my understanding was yes CFI
 
01:00:56.349 --> 01:00:56.359 align:start position:0%
is prioritized over nursing homes but
 
01:00:59.230 --> 01:00:59.240 align:start position:0%
nursing homes were prioritized over
 
01:01:02.029 --> 01:01:02.039 align:start position:0%
hospital stays and that and that part of
 
01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:05.039 align:start position:0%
the reason why we were uh supporting uh
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
rate increases in hb2 last by Anum uh uh
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
and um I guess you know the um
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
suspension what pro- share increase or
 
01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:19.240 align:start position:0%
something uh the 2% was so that there
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
would be more nursing home
 
01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
capacity uh to free up free up the
 
01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
hospital uh my question one of my
 
01:01:28.349 --> 01:01:28.359 align:start position:0%
questions is uh what percent of the beds
 
01:01:32.029 --> 01:01:32.039 align:start position:0%
are and our County increased uh uh open
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
a wing and increased by about 15% in the
 
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
last two years the number of of
 
01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:40.039 align:start position:0%
individuals they're able to serve so I'm
 
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
wondering uh what percentage of this
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
increase is due to uh more people taking
 
01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:47.720 align:start position:0%
the service versus the rates if we have
 
01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
that and then if you have numbers of
 
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
what percent of the beds are private
 
01:01:54.029 --> 01:01:54.039 align:start position:0%
versus County that would be um
 
01:01:54.039 --> 01:01:56.190 align:start position:0%
versus County that would be um
interesting

01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:56.200 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
01:01:58.750 --> 01:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
I I do know just um I do know there's
 
01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:01.400 align:start position:0%
reporting on uh the fiscal committee
 
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
dashboard that looks at Trends as far as
 
01:02:05.309 --> 01:02:05.319 align:start position:0%
utilization in nursing homes it's like a
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
three-month Trend so we can see um you
 
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
know the number of people that are
 
01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
served in nursing homes I don't have
 
01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
that in front of me but we can get that
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
to you as far as you know looking at
 
01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:18.839 align:start position:0%
those numbers um I will say that um you
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
know nursing facilities do play a vital
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
role in our whole system of care whether
 
01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:24.440 align:start position:0%
it's you know providing short-term
 
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
services for people to get better and
 
01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
transition back to the community or for
 
01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:31.839 align:start position:0%
people who truly require that level of
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
care and supervision um so it's not to
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
say that they're not you know they're
 
01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
not they're not prioritized because
 
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
people generally want to live at home
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
right they nobody kind of says I I can't
 
01:02:43.309 --> 01:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
wait to get into the nursing home but
 
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
the nursing home certainly is a is a
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
part of our system that's vital you know
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
from a step down from a hospital and
 
01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
then hopeful transition onto a CFI or
 
01:02:55.269 --> 01:02:55.279 align:start position:0%
other um supports that we have to
 
01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
maintain you know more preventative
 
01:02:59.150 --> 01:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
Services from that hospitalization back
 
01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
facility a little editorial note in here
 
01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
um uh I I believe the department is
 
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
tracking over 100 questions from us um
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
most of them are informational some of
 
01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
them uh drive directly at decision
 
01:03:21.269 --> 01:03:21.279 align:start position:0%
making uh we'll we'll need to make um
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
with a focus I think on General funds
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
management and so I've I've I've asked
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
Mr White as he's going through the 100
 
01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:33.160 align:start position:0%
questions to prioritize those in which
 
01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
in his professional discretion think are
 
01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
probably related to us making a a dollar
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
or Manpower decision relative to good
 
01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:45.799 align:start position:0%
information good background about the
 
01:03:48.069 --> 01:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
situation not that he's going to lose
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
those or forget those but just if you've
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
been asking questions wondering where
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
the answers are I think I I think we got
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
to prioritize answers that may drive uh
 
01:03:57.599 --> 01:03:58.789 align:start position:0%
to prioritize answers that may drive uh
budget

01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:04:02.349 --> 01:04:02.359 align:start position:0%
decisions so all right do you do you
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
have other questions I I think it's a
 
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:07.720 align:start position:0%
good point M uh uh Mr chairman I would
 
01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
say in this area we're going from 120
 
01:04:13.630 --> 01:04:13.640 align:start position:0%
million to 180 million over the B Anum
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
and general funds nursing homes
 
01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:19.039 align:start position:0%
so go
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:44.430 --> 01:04:44.440 align:start position:0%
um slide 32 is just some information
 
01:04:46.589 --> 01:04:46.599 align:start position:0%
about our CFI waiver again um
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
informational for for you so just our um
 
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
eligibility some of our eligibility
 
01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
requirements some of our services that
 
01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:56.200 align:start position:0%
were delivered in the average cost uh
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
based on claims uh in the past so you
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
can see you know obviously it's it's
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
less expensive to take care of somebody
 
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
in their home than it is in a nursing
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
facility or in a hospital setting for
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
long-term um placement so uh it is a
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
priority uh for us and and you know
 
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
federally to to main maintain people at
 
01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:17.720 align:start position:0%
home um it's not only where people want
 
01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
service um slide 30 again I'm a little
 
01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
slow so on 32 Under The Sur service
 
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
examples um I'm I'm just I'm just
 
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
wondering if um in the future we we
 
01:05:39.309 --> 01:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
should be explicitly pointing out that
 
01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
we we're providing virtual support or
 
01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
virtual services or I I I I don't know
 
01:05:47.789 --> 01:05:47.799 align:start position:0%
how you'd want to phrase that but but
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
but I I do like the idea of of making it
 
01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
more clear that not all of these are
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
01:06:06.109 --> 01:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
you um slide 33 is just more of a a
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
procedure a procedural slide on how um
 
01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
the department works with our
 
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
contractors um to uh determine
 
01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
eligibility for um CFI so it's a it's a
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
process where we contract with a uh a
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
contractor that goes and and meets with
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
the individual in person does an
 
01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
assessment brings that information back
 
01:06:30.029 --> 01:06:30.039 align:start position:0%
to the department where we make the
 
01:06:32.109 --> 01:06:32.119 align:start position:0%
decision if somebody is eligible or
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
ineligible from a medical standpoint um
 
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
for CFI Services um and then uh go from
 
01:06:41.549 --> 01:06:41.559 align:start position:0%
there so if somebody is ineligible for
 
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
CFI what other services can they be
 
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
connected to whether that's Services
 
01:06:47.549 --> 01:06:47.559 align:start position:0%
through the block grant or older
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
Americans act um to to prevent you know
 
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
Nursing Facility placement or
 
01:06:53.440 --> 01:07:00.510 align:start position:0%
Nursing Facility placement or
hospitalization

01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:03.640 align:start position:0%
slide 34 is just trending over the past
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
since 20 um
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
20 2004 excuse me um looking at our
 
01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:12.200 align:start position:0%
trending from the orange line is um
 
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
Nursing Facility totals and the blue
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
line is uh CFI totals so we're seeing
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
you know a little bit of growth there as
 
01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
far as you know moving from uh
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
institutional based care to home and
 
01:07:29.269 --> 01:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
care representative walner so this
 
01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
indicates the number of people not yeah
 
01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
this indicates the number of like the
 
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
percentage of clients that are um in CFI
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:49.640 align:start position:0%
thank slide 35 is more accounting units
 
01:07:52.829 --> 01:07:52.839 align:start position:0%
so money falls the person is 100% uh
 
01:07:55.829 --> 01:07:55.839 align:start position:0%
federally funded helps people transition
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
um and stay in the
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
community we have health promotion
 
01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
contracts we have the Alzheimer's
 
01:08:03.549 --> 01:08:03.559 align:start position:0%
disease and Related
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
Disorders um which uh is 100% General
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
funds but 100% of that uh funding goes
 
01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
to individuals who are caring for
 
01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
somebody with alzheimer's disease in the
 
01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
form of a respit grant so it could be um
 
01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
you know providing Home Care
 
01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:23.839 align:start position:0%
Services a respit stay for somebody in a
 
01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
facility for a caregiver that needs a
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
needs a a little bit of a break um so
 
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
100% of that money goes into grants for
 
01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
caregivers um and then 2165 is civil
 
01:08:36.669 --> 01:08:36.679 align:start position:0%
monetary penalties those are the
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
penalties that are collected based um on
 
01:08:42.269 --> 01:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
citations from nursing facilities and
 
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
then reinvested into programs and
 
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
services to make uh the quality
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
programming and nursing facilities
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
better so it's findes that are collected
 
01:08:53.309 --> 01:08:53.319 align:start position:0%
and then reinvested um in two programs
 
01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
represent tki quick question um my
 
01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
previous question about hb2 and chairman
 
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
Edwards says there any other question on
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
hb2 and I did do a quick search this
 
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily what this division
 
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
looks at but there's a change on the
 
01:09:16.030 --> 01:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
commission of Commission on Aging which
 
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
I assume you are somewhat connected to
 
01:09:20.829 --> 01:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
um what is your take on the changes in
 
01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
there it looks like it's adjusting the
 
01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
membership in some way uh Wendy Alman is
 
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%

that last mic and
 
01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
uh we we just need to make sure the
 
01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:42.359 align:start position:0%

commission thank you it it specifies a
 
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
change in the length of the
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
terms yeah we we talked as a commission
 
01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
uh about those changes um both to adding
 
01:10:23.950 --> 01:10:23.960 align:start position:0%
an individual and and changing the um
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
terms and we didn't have any okay
 
01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
opposition to that
 
01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
thanks representative now
 
01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:33.550 align:start position:0%
thanks representative now
vano

01:10:33.550 --> 01:10:33.560 align:start position:0%
vano
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah I had a quick question on uh
 
01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
page uh 35 I'm just kind of curious as
 
01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
to why the Alzheimer's disease and
 
01:10:46.189 --> 01:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
Related Disorders uh is 100% General
 
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
funds given the given the fact that uh
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's and the Aging population
 
01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
across the whole us is uh you know been
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
pretty PR
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh over the last several years uh any is
 
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
this an allocation issue where money for
 
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's is showing up someplace else
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
from the federal funds or just a
 
01:11:09.310 --> 01:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
peculiarity of what's funded and what's
 
01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
not funded sure I I I think part of that
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
is you know we do get family caregivers
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
support dollars through other funding
 
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
streams federally um this is a portion
 
01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
where the state pays and and really
 
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
provides that uh respit care Grant I
 
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
think it's $2,000 you know per person uh
 
01:11:29.149 --> 01:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
specifically for those caring for
 
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's so it's not like they're
 
01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
excluded from the family caregivers
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
support program it's just um you know
 
01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
we're seeing obviously a rise in in
 
01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
older adults and the need for um
 
01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
supporting them in the community so um
 
01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
we we think it's a pretty vital service
 
01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
um we just recently did a campaign um on
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
brain health and awareness um which I
 
01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:54.280 align:start position:0%
think is on one of the slides as far as
 
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
um I think that that was an allocation
 
01:11:58.910 --> 01:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
in hb2 as well um to make sure that
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
adults are getting screened in the
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
importance of you know uh recognizing
 
01:12:05.149 --> 01:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
early signs of of of Alzheimer's and
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
Dementia so um it's not that it's not
 
01:12:09.629 --> 01:12:09.639 align:start position:0%
covered again kind of Peace meal with
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
other funding sources but um nothing you
 
01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
know as specific as this where 100% of
 
01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
these dollars go to families with with
 
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
caring for somebody with alzheimer's so
 
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
it's just an allocate the fact that it's
 
01:12:23.629 --> 01:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
100% General funds is just a decision
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
internally how how we're treating
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
allocations from federal
 
01:12:30.629 --> 01:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
money uh I think it's a supplement to
 
01:12:32.189 --> 01:12:32.199 align:start position:0%
the allocations that we're getting from
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
federal dollars um I don't I don't know
 
01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
the history of of this line item as far
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
as how it you know uh originally got
 
01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
into our budget but historically um it's
 
01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
been in there for you know 100% use of
 
01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if now you want to jump
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
to developmental
 
01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:18.910 --> 01:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
41 and and you you'll you'll also be
 
01:13:21.629 --> 01:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
moving forward in the governor's um
 
01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
so we have a county unit
 
01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
7100 um in the Bureau of Developmental
 
01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
services for developmental Services um
 
01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:41.719 align:start position:0%
this is the developmental Services
 
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
waiver it's 50% um State funds and then
 
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
50% federal funds uh for those who
 
01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
qualify um for uh developmental services
 
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
on the DD waiver so it serves about
 
01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
5,061 individuals on the waiver um
 
01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
administered uh in partnership with our
 
01:14:06.149 --> 01:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
area agency system um and our and our uh
 
01:14:11.790 --> 01:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
providers uh accounting unit 7016 the
 
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
required brain uh disorder Services it
 
01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
is again a waiver service to wave
 
01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
institutional care for those who
 
01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
qualified under a brain uh acquired
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
brain disorder um the waiver itself is
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
50% uh federal funds 50% State funds um
 
01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
it also has an allocation for support of
 
01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
uh the New Hampshire Brain Injury
 
01:14:42.629 --> 01:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
Association who is our content um expert
 
01:14:45.629 --> 01:14:45.639 align:start position:0%
on providing services and linking uh
 
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
information referrals to those who are
 
01:14:50.629 --> 01:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
newly brain injured or those who have a
 
01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
a long-standing sustained brain injury
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
and provide really uh great support to
 
01:14:57.709 --> 01:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
those folks so that is also included in
 
01:14:57.719 --> 01:14:59.629 align:start position:0%
those folks so that is also included in
um

01:14:59.629 --> 01:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
716 7110 is our children's in home
 
01:15:05.950 --> 01:15:05.960 align:start position:0%
support waiver so this is completely um
 
01:15:09.149 --> 01:15:09.159 align:start position:0%
self-directed by families uh for
 
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
children who are in school um it is
 
01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
again a 5050 uh funding source for
 
01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
federal and general funds and it's for
 
01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
kids with developmental disabilities um
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
to uh stay at home with their their
 
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
parents or family and and receive
 
01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
services in the
 
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
home 7013 is Family Support Services
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
this is 100% General funds this funds um
 
01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
are 10 um Family Support councils which
 
01:15:42.669 --> 01:15:42.679 align:start position:0%
are located within the 10 area agencies
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
and also provides um operational funding
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
for our 10 contracted area agencies to
 
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
support individuals and families
 
01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
particularly those who um are not on the
 
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
waiver or not eligible for Medicaid
 
01:16:01.149 --> 01:16:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:03.149 --> 01:16:03.159 align:start position:0%
otherwise represent
 
01:16:05.709 --> 01:16:05.719 align:start position:0%
string uh might be jumping a little bit
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
but you know we're spending about 75,000
 
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
a year on the DD waiver program and the
 
01:16:13.629 --> 01:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
acquired brain disorder about 95,000
 
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
first question I have is uh you know
 
01:16:17.550 --> 01:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
given the number of people we have in
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
there what's the range of the amount
 
01:16:22.629 --> 01:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
we're spending per individual do you
 
01:16:25.709 --> 01:16:25.719 align:start position:0%
find it's very very narrow that almost
 
01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
everybody is very close to uh uh to the
 
01:16:31.709 --> 01:16:31.719 align:start position:0%
mean or is it uh vastly spread out and
 
01:16:34.149 --> 01:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
or you know are there a few people that
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
are using a substantial part of the
 
01:16:39.149 --> 01:16:39.159 align:start position:0%
budget that's the first question I had
 
01:16:40.990 --> 01:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I think with the the work that
 
01:16:43.229 --> 01:16:43.239 align:start position:0%
we're doing in it it's it's helping us
 
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
determine that before it was kind of uh
 
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
we weren't able to track let's say
 
01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:49.400 align:start position:0%
Trends in you know utilization of a
 
01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
specific service but I will say that we
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
see people um on the waiver who are
 
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
lower cost using those lower cost
 
01:16:58.189 --> 01:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
Services because they are more
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
independent so they might just need
 
01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
somebody to um help them with
 
01:17:04.510 --> 01:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
Transportation or help them in their in
 
01:17:06.629 --> 01:17:06.639 align:start position:0%
their jobs so supported employment but
 
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
we also have folks that you know require
 
01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
some really intensive needs they require
 
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
residential services with somebody with
 
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
them all the time because of their you
 
01:17:18.990 --> 01:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
know behavior um because of their um you
 
01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
know developmental disability and really
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
need you know somebody one-on-one so we
 
01:17:25.149 --> 01:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
see a range just based on you know our
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
person centered uh plans for our
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
individuals so you you may see a
 
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
significant number of of individuals in
 
01:17:35.709 --> 01:17:35.719 align:start position:0%
the program using say less than $10,000
 
01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
of services in a year do you think or is
 
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
that number even could you make sure
 
01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
you're hitting the microphone I have but
 
01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
I will speak into it yeah thank you
 
01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:46.070 align:start position:0%
I will speak into it yeah thank you
thank

01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:17:49.709 --> 01:17:49.719 align:start position:0%
you I am trying to find my average I do
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
have an average cost of you know
 
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
somebody on the on the D waiver give me
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
one second uh your your slide um 4 42
 
01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:02.470 align:start position:0%
one second uh your your slide um 4 42
has

01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
73739 is an average right so you know I
 
01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
was just kind of talking about the
 
01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
spread yeah so that takes into
 
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
consideration those who you know utilize
 
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
the lower cost services or less number
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
of services and those who have you know
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
High intensive need services so what do
 
01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
you think the most expensive um person
 
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
is in there is five million or is it no
 
01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't say five million I think
 
01:18:31.470 --> 01:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
we've seen um some budgets you know for
 
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
folks who who require maybe um two staff
 
01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
members with them at all times um
 
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
probably could be as high as 500,000 per
 
01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
year um and that's why we really
 
01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
advocated for rates so we can predict um
 
01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
you know that cost uh right now it's
 
01:18:53.310 --> 01:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
really um what the provider tells us
 
01:18:55.550 --> 01:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
they need in order to provide services
 
01:18:58.750 --> 01:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
to those folks without um you know the
 
01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
guard rails that a rate system would put
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
into place so uh you know last term we
 
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
put a lot of emphasis on on these rates
 
01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
but uh just at the at the waiver program
 
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
as its entirety not going into The
 
01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
Individual Services it sounds like
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
you're doing a tremendous job trying to
 
01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
um Auto automate and be able to collect
 
01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
and analyze information second
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
secondarily I I would hope
 
01:19:27.550 --> 01:19:27.560 align:start position:0%
understand which of those services are
 
01:19:30.510 --> 01:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
particularly valuable uh to those in the
 
01:19:34.189 --> 01:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
waiver programs do you have uh as of
 
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
this point say a list of what the top 10
 
01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
services are in terms of uh what in the
 
01:19:42.629 --> 01:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
uh DD waiver program that we're spending
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
money on at this point yes I I don't
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
have that with me but we we are tracking
 
01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
that information um I will say to the
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
first part uh of your um comment when we
 
01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:55.390 align:start position:0%
first part uh of your um comment when we
um

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
we're looking at rates on the DD side we
 
01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
did significant stakeholder engagement
 
01:20:02.590 --> 01:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
you know not only with area agencies but
 
01:20:04.629 --> 01:20:04.639 align:start position:0%
with providers with people who receive
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
the service and listen to them as far as
 
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
you know what do you need in order to be
 
01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
successful um in the community where you
 
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
want to live and so that's how we
 
01:20:16.750 --> 01:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
prioritized specific services that we
 
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
targeted rates to um based on that
 
01:20:21.669 --> 01:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
feedback and also based on a a cost
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
analysis of providing those Services
 
01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
versus higher cost residential service
 
01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
so you're saying with the with the last
 
01:20:31.629 --> 01:20:31.639 align:start position:0%
waiver increases you didn't spread them
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
equal percentage across everything you
 
01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
targeted them based on getting the the
 
01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
best um need for the uh those
 
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
individuals in the program was that I
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
would say for the last waiver increase
 
01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:45.229 align:start position:0%
would say for the last waiver increase
it

01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
was it was probably it was I think it
 
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:54.189 --> 01:20:54.199 align:start position:0%
management so we haven't uh received an
 
01:20:57.229 --> 01:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
appropri ation for this rate development
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's why we put that um forth as a
 
01:21:02.350 --> 01:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
prioritized need in order to to do this
 
01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
plan of prioritizing services that that
 
01:21:08.189 --> 01:21:08.199 align:start position:0%
the people and providers have told us
 
01:21:11.709 --> 01:21:11.719 align:start position:0%
that are important um for them um as far
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
as any rate increases I believe it was
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
across the board it wasn't um focused on
 
01:21:19.390 --> 01:21:19.400 align:start position:0%
a specific service so I still hear
 
01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
concerns and I call it the 25 cent
 
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
hamburger everybody gets a hamburger
 
01:21:25.629 --> 01:21:25.639 align:start position:0%
here's your coupon for 05 cents turn it
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
into anybody you want and they'll give
 
01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
you a hamburger and they send it to the
 
01:21:31.229 --> 01:21:31.239 align:start position:0%
state and the state will pay them 25
 
01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
cents it's pretty hard to get any
 
01:21:35.149 --> 01:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
anybody to take that and some of the
 
01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
services in the program um uh you know
 
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
particularly uh in the last you know
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
before the last bium were extremely
 
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
difficult to fill at the at the rates
 
01:21:50.830 --> 01:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
that were there but um you Pro we
 
01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't hear about those that
 
01:21:55.390 --> 01:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
are easy to fill so uh um you know
 
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
without without digging into what those
 
01:22:00.669 --> 01:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
services are and how they serve serve
 
01:22:03.550 --> 01:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
those individuals um it's hard to make
 
01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
specific recommendations in hb2 but if
 
01:22:09.790 --> 01:22:09.800 align:start position:0%
you have the list of top 10 Services um
 
01:22:12.830 --> 01:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
and uh how much dollars that represents
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
um I would be interested in that sure I
 
01:22:18.189 --> 01:22:18.199 align:start position:0%
think in a later slide um probably at
 
01:22:20.110 --> 01:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
the end where the prioritized needs were
 
01:22:22.590 --> 01:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
listed um we listed you know the
 
01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
services that we wanted to include in
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
the first phase of you know if rates
 
01:22:29.229 --> 01:22:29.239 align:start position:0%
were funded um and the fiscal impact of
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
those rates based on um not only
 
01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
utilization but um low rates so if
 
01:22:36.629 --> 01:22:36.639 align:start position:0%
people want a service like Community
 
01:22:38.629 --> 01:22:38.639 align:start position:0%
participation services but our rate is
 
01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
so low we don't have any um significant
 
01:22:44.030 --> 01:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
number of providers to provide that um
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
Home and Community Based service that's
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
where we we come into this um you know
 
01:22:52.189 --> 01:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
quandry of uh I can give you your your
 
01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:54.639 align:start position:0%
25 you know Cent coupon but if if I
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
don't have a provider going to give you
 
01:22:59.189 --> 01:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
a hamburger for 25 cents then you're
 
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
stuck with your 25 cent coupon right
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
with no service or no hamburger uh so to
 
01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
speak so I think that's you know why we
 
01:23:08.590 --> 01:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
we feel that rates not only in DD but in
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
CFI are important in order you know to
 
01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
attract providers to come I don't as a
 
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
provider you don't want to come into a
 
01:23:16.470 --> 01:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
state not knowing what you're going to
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
be paid to provide a specific service
 
01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
when it's something that's not
 
01:23:25.709 --> 01:23:25.719 align:start position:0%
controlled um and measurable um and um
 
01:23:28.229 --> 01:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
you know on uh measured as far as what
 
01:23:30.990 --> 01:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
does it cost to provide that service not
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
you know I'm telling you it costs
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
$500,000 to provide me Services um so we
 
01:23:39.189 --> 01:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
need that sort of methodology and
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
framework in order for us to you know
 
01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
look at our Cost Containment but also to
 
01:23:46.110 --> 01:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
make sure people are getting the actual
 
01:23:48.629 --> 01:23:48.639 align:start position:0%
services that have been uh funded or
 
01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
allocated to
 
01:23:52.669 --> 01:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
them so so I have a question for you
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham uh I'm
 
01:23:57.390 --> 01:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
following your conversation and it seems
 
01:23:59.470 --> 01:23:59.480 align:start position:0%
to me like somebody needs to say Where's
 
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
the Beef somewhere in here but but
 
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
having said that what you know where is
 
01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:06.719 align:start position:0%
the beef you it sounds like you have
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
intuitively put your finger on a key
 
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
service that you think is not being made
 
01:24:14.669 --> 01:24:14.679 align:start position:0%
available because of a rate issue do you
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
have any specifics in mind that you
 
01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
might want to mention I don't actually
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
okay you're you're just doing a sanity
 
01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
check on it so 75,000 is a lot of money
 
01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
per year and we want to give a uh get
 
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
full benefit for for uh those
 
01:24:34.189 --> 01:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
individuals and put the put the funds to
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
best use so all right and um and I think
 
01:24:41.229 --> 01:24:41.239 align:start position:0%
we did some good things last last term
 
01:24:41.239 --> 01:24:42.270 align:start position:0%
we did some good things last last term
by

01:24:42.270 --> 01:24:42.280 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
prioritizing rate increases or rate
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
adjustments to areas that helped okay
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
well thanks I just wanted to interpret
 
01:24:51.709 --> 01:24:51.719 align:start position:0%
what I was hearing from you a little
 
01:24:55.109 --> 01:24:55.119 align:start position:0%
better thank you representative priest
 
01:24:58.750 --> 01:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh back on page
 
01:24:58.760 --> 01:24:59.470 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh back on page
uh

01:24:59.470 --> 01:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
41 uh thank you for providing us with
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
the number of individuals that you are
 
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
servicing in the first three accounting
 
01:25:13.229 --> 01:25:13.239 align:start position:0%
units do you have the number of people
 
01:25:15.709 --> 01:25:15.719 align:start position:0%
that you have served like in the past
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
five years to give us the information
 
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not this number is increasing
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
or decreasing or
 
01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
or I just would like to have something
 
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
to compare this with with the staff that
 
01:25:34.030 --> 01:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
was in place for those
 
01:25:37.229 --> 01:25:37.239 align:start position:0%
years yes we we report um case load
 
01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
numbers out on the fiscal committee
 
01:25:40.990 --> 01:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
dashboard so we can send that to you as
 
01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
far as I don't know how far back it
 
01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
looks yeah at least five years is on
 
01:25:47.109 --> 01:25:47.119 align:start position:0%
there so you can look at um the number
 
01:25:48.990 --> 01:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
of case loads and the trending of that
 
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
that would be great so so that that's
 
01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
actually already online then because all
 
01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee um statistical
 
01:25:58.390 --> 01:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
summaries are already there um but if
 
01:26:00.590 --> 01:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
you could send him a link just to get
 
01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:03.800 align:start position:0%
him going that would be great thank you
 
01:26:06.270 --> 01:26:06.280 align:start position:0%
welcome uh representative seaworth thank
 
01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um my question is on the
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
Family Support Services it's actually a
 
01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
two-part question um the first part
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
pardon me I'm going to kind of repeat my
 
01:26:21.310 --> 01:26:21.320 align:start position:0%
colleagues question before so this is a
 
01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
100% General funds is this in service to
 
01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
a federal obligation or is this
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
something on our own initiative we
 
01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
decided it's it's necessary yeah it's um
 
01:26:36.189 --> 01:26:36.199 align:start position:0%
in in Statute in New Hampshire it's not
 
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
a federal statute it is um under
 
01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
126g um for family support um to um to
 
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
provide assistance to individuals that
 
01:26:49.629 --> 01:26:49.639 align:start position:0%
to families that are taking care of
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
individuals with developmental
 
01:26:53.629 --> 01:26:53.639 align:start position:0%
disabilities so it's within our um state
 
01:26:53.639 --> 01:26:54.910 align:start position:0%
disabilities so it's within our um state
statute

01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:26:58.830 --> 01:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
um and then um you know providing uh
 
01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
operating costs for area agencies to
 
01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:04.280 align:start position:0%
take care of those individuals that
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
don't have um Medicaid coverage or any
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
other insurance coverage um the area
 
01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
agencies are obligated if somebody is um
 
01:27:16.270 --> 01:27:16.280 align:start position:0%
determined eligible through 171a to
 
01:27:18.870 --> 01:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
provide you know developmental services
 
01:27:21.310 --> 01:27:21.320 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily based on if you're
 
01:27:23.709 --> 01:27:23.719 align:start position:0%
eligible for the waiver so we have a lot
 
01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
of reports that the area agencies
 
01:27:27.550 --> 01:27:27.560 align:start position:0%
provide to people who don't qualify for
 
01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and so so providing funding to
 
01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
the area agencies to keep um you know
 
01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
families uh in order to keep families as
 
01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
you know the primary caregiver but
 
01:27:41.550 --> 01:27:41.560 align:start position:0%
supplement the cost of doing that but
 
01:27:46.669 --> 01:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
statute RSA 126g yes and I my my second
 
01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:54.679 align:start position:0%
question I almost thought it was anti
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
is going to be answered but so what it
 
01:28:00.669 --> 01:28:00.679 align:start position:0%
looks like to me is that it's the second
 
01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719 align:start position:0%
bullet that you mentioned and the other
 
01:28:05.470 --> 01:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
RSA reference 171a I can certainly go
 
01:28:07.870 --> 01:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
home and look at that but if there's a
 
01:28:11.350 --> 01:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
quick elevator summary because it looks
 
01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
to me in the budget that that's some new
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
funding um in the upcoming bium so if if
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
you I I believe you're on page 108 under
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
7013 so there there's two class lines
 
01:28:28.669 --> 01:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
there the first class line that has the
 
01:28:30.990 --> 01:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
Family Support Council dollars budgeted
 
01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
in state fiscal years 26 and
 
01:28:37.709 --> 01:28:37.719 align:start position:0%
27 and then in class 103 that is the um
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
the contracts with the area agencies
 
01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
that are is budgeted there these these
 
01:28:45.629 --> 01:28:45.639 align:start position:0%
were both previously budgeted in class
 
01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
102 but we tried to separate that out to
 
01:28:50.430 --> 01:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
make it more transparent going forward
 
01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
and just easier to
 
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
track and so
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
the difference between 24 and 25 in the
 
01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
102 line is the the difference um so if
 
01:29:09.310 --> 01:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
if you were to turn to
 
01:29:11.629 --> 01:29:11.639 align:start position:0%
um give me one second
 
01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
here so if you were to turn to chapter
 
01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
106 in the current operating budget it's
 
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
budgeted at 4.46 7 million each year
 
01:29:24.669 --> 01:29:24.679 align:start position:0%
what you see in the state fiscal year 24
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
actual expense is you're seeing delays
 
01:29:30.270 --> 01:29:30.280 align:start position:0%
in invoicing and billing so the expenses
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
did did not occur at that point in time
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
but the budgeted amounts have remained
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
flat B or bayum to bayum thank you for
 
01:29:38.639 --> 01:29:40.310 align:start position:0%
flat B or bayum to bayum thank you for
the

01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:42.990 --> 01:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
explanation so so you got me thinking
 
01:29:47.189 --> 01:29:47.199 align:start position:0%
about line 103 the $2.9 million that
 
01:29:49.390 --> 01:29:49.400 align:start position:0%
that those are contracts to area
 
01:29:51.950 --> 01:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
agencies to provide Area Agency kind of
 
01:29:54.910 --> 01:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
activities I suppose and I think we
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
talked about it in January but I asked
 
01:30:00.510 --> 01:30:00.520 align:start position:0%
the question we've got 10 now if we were
 
01:30:02.590 --> 01:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
to reduce that to eight would we save
 
01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
any money the testimony of uh the
 
01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
department at that point was no you
 
01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
would just you know move parts and
 
01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
people around but it would be the same
 
01:30:16.149 --> 01:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
cost is that still your position yes um
 
01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:19.400 align:start position:0%
you know we we serve a very um Niche
 
01:30:21.709 --> 01:30:21.719 align:start position:0%
population so that that population
 
01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't changed the number of people we
 
01:30:26.189 --> 01:30:26.199 align:start position:0%
serve wouldn't change it would just um
 
01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
you know go to a different agency so we
 
01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
don't believe it would be a significant
 
01:30:32.709 --> 01:30:32.719 align:start position:0%
cost savings and and then the big
 
01:30:34.910 --> 01:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
procedural shift I think we've seen in
 
01:30:38.669 --> 01:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
the area agencies is previous budgets
 
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
area agencies were responsible for doing
 
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
basically the billing for the providers
 
01:30:47.229 --> 01:30:47.239 align:start position:0%
and we've gone to um an independent
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
direct provider type of billing correct
 
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
was there any cost savings to our
 
01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
contracts to the area agencies since
 
01:30:56.910 --> 01:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
we're asking them to do
 
01:30:59.109 --> 01:30:59.119 align:start position:0%
less um I think they're two separate
 
01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
functions so I would say that um we
 
01:31:03.550 --> 01:31:03.560 align:start position:0%
haven't we've actually seen uh we're
 
01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
tracking month over month the actual
 
01:31:08.109 --> 01:31:08.119 align:start position:0%
spend on the waiver to see you know um
 
01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
now that the providers are able to
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
directly Bill instead of having to Bill
 
01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
through the area agency are we seeing an
 
01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
increase in Billing or a decrease we've
 
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
seen a pretty um I think I have a slide
 
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
in here we've seen a pretty consistent
 
01:31:22.750 --> 01:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
amount of billing whether it's from an
 
01:31:25.629 --> 01:31:25.639 align:start position:0%
area agency first services or from a
 
01:31:28.510 --> 01:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
provider for services so we haven't seen
 
01:31:30.750 --> 01:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
you know a cost shift in
 
01:31:33.950 --> 01:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
that okay and and then
 
01:31:37.390 --> 01:31:37.400 align:start position:0%
um it was part of the A&amp;M uh
 
01:31:39.390 --> 01:31:39.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations where there were three
 
01:31:41.229 --> 01:31:41.239 align:start position:0%
major things that the department wanted
 
01:31:43.629 --> 01:31:43.639 align:start position:0%
to do in this current this the current
 
01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
budget cycle one of them was the
 
01:31:48.109 --> 01:31:48.119 align:start position:0%
transition the billing and then there
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
were two other and I forget what the two
 
01:31:52.629 --> 01:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
others were but you you all ended up
 
01:31:55.229 --> 01:31:55.239 align:start position:0%
postponing it to to adjust the
 
01:31:57.430 --> 01:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
absorption rate by the area agencies
 
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
what what were the other two items that
 
01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
uh were on your list of of A&amp;M
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh a few so we s we had
 
01:32:08.830 --> 01:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations for it enhancements
 
01:32:10.470 --> 01:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
which is certainly something that we
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
have been working on that is not um it
 
01:32:14.830 --> 01:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
was briefly paused as we were trying to
 
01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
figure out operationally how that
 
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
happens um with the area agencies and
 
01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
making sure that um they have sufficient
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
software technology in order to to
 
01:32:27.870 --> 01:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
change that uh uh that practice um so we
 
01:32:30.390 --> 01:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
had it enhancements we had um
 
01:32:33.550 --> 01:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
investments in um intensive treatment
 
01:32:35.870 --> 01:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
services uh which we have done through
 
01:32:39.669 --> 01:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
federal dollars um with our arpa uh
 
01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
grants that we've um been able to open
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
um or at least fund at least um 115 new
 
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh beds in the community for those who
 
01:32:51.790 --> 01:32:51.800 align:start position:0%
need um a higher level of care um
 
01:32:54.270 --> 01:32:54.280 align:start position:0%
instead of having to move move out of
 
01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
state or receive Services um away from
 
01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
their families um so that was the other
 
01:33:03.149 --> 01:33:03.159 align:start position:0%
um suggestion that they had okay and so
 
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
just to wrap all of that up I I think we
 
01:33:09.629 --> 01:33:09.639 align:start position:0%
paid A&amp;M I don't know $15 million for
 
01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
their uh Consulting and they gave us at
 
01:33:14.990 --> 01:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
least these three big
 
01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations can we project any
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
savings or additional revenues that come
 
01:33:22.910 --> 01:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
from that contract we invested in are we
 
01:33:24.709 --> 01:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
are we going to get a return on
 
01:33:26.669 --> 01:33:26.679 align:start position:0%
investment for that
 
01:33:29.109 --> 01:33:29.119 align:start position:0%
Consulting I I I think that's a broader
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
question that I can bring back because
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have to pull in a couple of
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
different folks from different areas
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
there there was a lot more work I mean
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
currently they're they've been providing
 
01:33:37.950 --> 01:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
us assistance with the community
 
01:33:40.669 --> 01:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
re-entry that we previously talked about
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
when Medicaid was here um when Dave
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
weers was talking about the
 
01:33:47.229 --> 01:33:47.239 align:start position:0%
modularization of the uh the mismis
 
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
system and moving that towards uh more
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
of a modular based approach so there
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
there's quite a few other elements that
 
01:33:56.709 --> 01:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
they've been helping us with um in the
 
01:33:58.590 --> 01:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
current bayum there there has been a
 
01:34:00.590 --> 01:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
significant reduction to that Alvarez
 
01:34:03.149 --> 01:34:03.159 align:start position:0%
and Marcel contract so going forward it
 
01:34:06.189 --> 01:34:06.199 align:start position:0%
would only be the DD work and the mmis
 
01:34:08.510 --> 01:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
and and the other work streams um are
 
01:34:10.669 --> 01:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
being retired out from that all right
 
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
and do you happen to recall offhand what
 
01:34:17.189 --> 01:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
the hourly Bill rate is for A&amp;M I I I've
 
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
heard 180 I've heard 240 an hour um the
 
01:34:23.709 --> 01:34:23.719 align:start position:0%
the the billing is based on a month
 
01:34:26.229 --> 01:34:26.239 align:start position:0%
monthly uh amount B and and so we
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
receive uh a certain chunk of resources
 
01:34:31.709 --> 01:34:31.719 align:start position:0%
in work hours and then the billing is
 
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
done on a on a monthly basis I don't
 
01:34:34.629 --> 01:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
recall off the top of my head I'd have
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
to go back and get that okay so I'll
 
01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
I'll just say one thing that's been
 
01:34:40.629 --> 01:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
whispered to me in hallways is it would
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
be much smarter if we went and hired one
 
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
or two really smart people that can step
 
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
in and take over the A&amp;M implementation
 
01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
roles so that we're spending money
 
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
within oury employment structure rather
 
01:34:57.470 --> 01:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
than Contracting that out so I'm not I'm
 
01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
going to I'm not going to ask you your
 
01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
opinion on that here but I just want to
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
share the feedback that I've been
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
getting about the A&amp;M contract so if
 
01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
there if there if there if there's
 
01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
something to that idea that you want to
 
01:35:15.510 --> 01:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
act on you know come back and let us
 
01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:17.070 align:start position:0%
act on you know come back and let us
know

01:35:17.070 --> 01:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
okay um do you want to continue yeah I I
 
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
think one other point I just want to
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
make um Within slide 41 is that um our
 
01:35:31.229 --> 01:35:31.239 align:start position:0%
our rates were uh based on um we we used
 
01:35:34.109 --> 01:35:34.119 align:start position:0%
another contractor not A&amp;M to look at
 
01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
you know the cost structure of those
 
01:35:39.550 --> 01:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
rates uh uh uh one of the components was
 
01:35:45.629 --> 01:35:45.639 align:start position:0%
using an assessment um to uh to assess
 
01:35:48.669 --> 01:35:48.679 align:start position:0%
the level of need that an individual uh
 
01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
may need as far as uh a support uh the
 
01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
supports intensity scale um and that is
 
01:35:57.950 --> 01:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
not only um in our rules but in our
 
01:36:01.709 --> 01:36:01.719 align:start position:0%
waiver um that has been unfunded um so
 
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
that would be I'm just trying to put a
 
01:36:05.669 --> 01:36:05.679 align:start position:0%
plug out there as far as um
 
01:36:08.590 --> 01:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
considerations for you know our our rate
 
01:36:11.149 --> 01:36:11.159 align:start position:0%
base methodology is you know a component
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
of that is having that um individual uh
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
assessment of of of Need for people um
 
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
on the waiver who are adults so um I
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
was there a question over on this side
 
01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:38.790 --> 01:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
no um slide 42 is um again just um
 
01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
examples of um our three waivers in um
 
01:36:44.669 --> 01:36:44.679 align:start position:0%
developmental services and the average
 
01:36:46.590 --> 01:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
cost the historical average cost per
 
01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
year services rendered um and
 
01:36:53.830 --> 01:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements
 
01:36:58.030 --> 01:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
slide 43 is a billing slide um which is
 
01:37:01.109 --> 01:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
25 um data and and I just wanted to
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
point out you can see that um in that
 
01:37:06.270 --> 01:37:06.280 align:start position:0%
first box in the upper left hand side um
 
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
92% of the billing is for the DD waiver
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
um so you can see we have that's where
 
01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:13.480 align:start position:0%
our most of our billing goes is for
 
01:37:16.830 --> 01:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
those Services um the the major service
 
01:37:18.750 --> 01:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
types of billing that we're seeing is
 
01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
67% for residential services and 23% for
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
day service says um so we have a a a
 
01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
monthly billing average of about $ 43.4
 
01:37:33.070 --> 01:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
million um for um the DD for all of the
 
01:37:34.990 --> 01:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
waivers in BDS so we're seeing and we're
 
01:37:37.070 --> 01:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
seeing that pretty consistently since
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
we've been tracking um July we've been
 
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
tracking longer but since July 24 you
 
01:37:44.189 --> 01:37:44.199 align:start position:0%
can see that's pretty consistent bill so
 
01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm trying to manage the
 
01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
time yep um would would would would you
 
01:37:51.589 --> 01:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
uh would we be missing something
 
01:37:54.430 --> 01:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
significant if we went to slide
 
01:37:58.270 --> 01:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
50 that's where the uh prioritized needs
 
01:38:02.669 --> 01:38:02.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
that I I don't I don't want to jump
 
01:38:08.510 --> 01:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
something that you had put an aster by
 
01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:19.149 --> 01:38:19.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
it so starting on slide 50 is um a list
 
01:38:25.109 --> 01:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
of the prioritized needs that our
 
01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
division put forth um you can see that
 
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh for the BDS waivers we were funded
 
01:38:33.910 --> 01:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
for um our weight list requests so these
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
are um tracked um for individuals who
 
01:38:40.589 --> 01:38:40.599 align:start position:0%
are projected to need services that are
 
01:38:42.430 --> 01:38:42.440 align:start position:0%
currently not funded U because they're
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
not in the system so our area agencies
 
01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
help us um in a registry system to
 
01:38:49.870 --> 01:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
project um new people coming on the
 
01:38:51.550 --> 01:38:51.560 align:start position:0%
waiver and people who might need
 
01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
enhancements to the services that
 
01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
they're providing so um that was funded
 
01:38:59.149 --> 01:38:59.159 align:start position:0%
um that's that's what you hear uh when
 
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
you hear the wait list that's that's
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
what was funded uh as part of our
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
prioritized need so so for the newer
 
01:39:07.149 --> 01:39:07.159 align:start position:0%
people to the division and and just to
 
01:39:11.589 --> 01:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
make sure I I understand it um we often
 
01:39:14.470 --> 01:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
speak in terms of saying we are funding
 
01:39:17.709 --> 01:39:17.719 align:start position:0%
the weight list and what that means is
 
01:39:20.589 --> 01:39:20.599 align:start position:0%
that the money is in the budget to
 
01:39:22.750 --> 01:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
theoretically pay for everyone that
 
01:39:26.430 --> 01:39:26.440 align:start position:0%
needs the BDS service however the
 
01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
reality is that there is often a
 
01:39:33.790 --> 01:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
disconnect between um uh our ability to
 
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
fund the service and the individual
 
01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
actually receiving the service and so
 
01:39:41.550 --> 01:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
the real weight list is the number of
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
people who aren't being serviced even
 
01:39:47.629 --> 01:39:47.639 align:start position:0%
though there's money and so don't don't
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
get complacent when you hear that we
 
01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
fully funded to make sure that we have
 
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
no weit list because that's not the
 
01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
question the question is how many people
 
01:39:58.709 --> 01:39:58.719 align:start position:0%
need the service that aren't able to
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
access the service I think that's the
 
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
effec of wait list and that's a harder
 
01:40:05.709 --> 01:40:05.719 align:start position:0%
statistic to to maintain right but I
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
think you all have broken the code and
 
01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
now you report as routinely what the
 
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
actual number of people who who want
 
01:40:17.870 --> 01:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
services but can't correct okay yep and
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
and and the reasons why so is it because
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
they can't find a provider to secure the
 
01:40:25.750 --> 01:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
service is it um you know they they need
 
01:40:28.270 --> 01:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid you know eligibility so there's
 
01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
a there's a lot of factors that we uh
 
01:40:34.270 --> 01:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
now report out at at oversight as to yes
 
01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
funding is is you know people are funded
 
01:40:38.430 --> 01:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
but why are they not accessing the
 
01:40:40.830 --> 01:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
service and that's reported um to us
 
01:40:44.350 --> 01:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
from our area agency system so um that's
 
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
you know something part of Again part of
 
01:40:47.950 --> 01:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
our it technology that we were able to
 
01:40:51.070 --> 01:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
build but also um really taking that
 
01:40:53.870 --> 01:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
stock and being transparent of yeah we
 
01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have a funding weight list but
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
people aren't getting all the services
 
01:40:59.870 --> 01:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
that are authorized so so this 44
 
01:41:03.109 --> 01:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
million in 27 is feels just like an
 
01:41:06.430 --> 01:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
enormous jump so you have to remember in
 
01:41:09.030 --> 01:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
in 27 not only you would you be funding
 
01:41:11.310 --> 01:41:11.320 align:start position:0%
the new people on 27 but you also have
 
01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
to an uh annualize the folks that you're
 
01:41:17.470 --> 01:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
funding in 26 so you'll see you know
 
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
because if you fund people in 26 they
 
01:41:21.390 --> 01:41:21.400 align:start position:0%
also need funding in
 
01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
27 what's are I this isn't the right
 
01:41:27.229 --> 01:41:27.239 align:start position:0%
word but I'm I'm going to say attrition
 
01:41:29.310 --> 01:41:29.320 align:start position:0%
rate we're we're we're looking we're
 
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
looking for new people who need the
 
01:41:34.390 --> 01:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
services while at the same time at the
 
01:41:38.109 --> 01:41:38.119 align:start position:0%
back end of the system people are are no
 
01:41:40.430 --> 01:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
longer requiring services for a variety
 
01:41:44.229 --> 01:41:44.239 align:start position:0%
of reasons so so are do are you also
 
01:41:48.390 --> 01:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
projecting in this the um attrition rate
 
01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
yes but I would say it's fairly low
 
01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
because these are Services throughout
 
01:41:56.030 --> 01:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
somebody 's lifespan right so it's not
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
if you compare it to somebody on CFI
 
01:42:00.589 --> 01:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
who's an older adult um you know I would
 
01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
say the attrition is higher because you
 
01:42:05.709 --> 01:42:05.719 align:start position:0%
have a a shorter life lower range right
 
01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
right um where these people's range is
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
much longer exactly so you have kids you
 
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
have kids coming in from school all the
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
way through adulthood on you know being
 
01:42:18.109 --> 01:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
eligible for DD service you made that
 
01:42:20.589 --> 01:42:20.599 align:start position:0%
make sense for me thank you
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
welcome what what else uh so we also uh
 
01:42:27.589 --> 01:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
we put in our prioritized need for CFI
 
01:42:30.390 --> 01:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
rate increase based on hb2 system of
 
01:42:34.470 --> 01:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
care um as we were um legislated to do a
 
01:42:36.270 --> 01:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
rate study so we put that in our
 
01:42:39.669 --> 01:42:39.679 align:start position:0%
prioritized need we also um in listening
 
01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
to our stakeholders put in a prioritized
 
01:42:46.189 --> 01:42:46.199 align:start position:0%
need for guardianship slots um for uh
 
01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
people who are on the DD waiver and
 
01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
people and and older
 
01:42:52.910 --> 01:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
adults um congregate housing which was
 
01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:54.070 align:start position:0%
adults um congregate housing which was
something

01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
um that was
 
01:42:59.550 --> 01:42:59.560 align:start position:0%
unfunded was unfunded we put in as a
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
prioritized need um that was not funded
 
01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
um then we have the the BDS rat which
 
01:43:08.990 --> 01:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
we've talked about one um really
 
01:43:13.629 --> 01:43:13.639 align:start position:0%
important consideration on page 51 is
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
the uh prioritized need for room and
 
01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
board um we have providers um on the DD
 
01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
and ABD waiver that provide residential
 
01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
services for for people and room and
 
01:43:26.750 --> 01:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
board costs are not covered by the
 
01:43:29.350 --> 01:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
waiver or by Medicaid and so we have
 
01:43:32.910 --> 01:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
providers with Rising costs of utilities
 
01:43:37.109 --> 01:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
of um you know so of this 10 million how
 
01:43:39.070 --> 01:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
much of that is General funds all 10
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:45.310 --> 01:43:45.320 align:start position:0%
million and you know I I think there's a
 
01:43:47.790 --> 01:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
a slide on kind of I don't want to say a
 
01:43:50.750 --> 01:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
justification but you know the
 
01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
importance of we we've done work over
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
the past two years and developing a
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
formula for uh room and board rates as
 
01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
to looking at you know what county you
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
live in the number of beds that you're
 
01:44:06.589 --> 01:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
um certified as a provider in your home
 
01:44:09.550 --> 01:44:09.560 align:start position:0%
looking at um rental costs per County
 
01:44:11.950 --> 01:44:11.960 align:start position:0%
looking at utility costs phone and
 
01:44:14.510 --> 01:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
internet uh property costs which could
 
01:44:16.990 --> 01:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
include you know snow removal air
 
01:44:19.550 --> 01:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
conditioning that sort of thing and food
 
01:44:22.629 --> 01:44:22.639 align:start position:0%
costs um the the real danger and not
 
01:44:24.870 --> 01:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
funding this prioritized need is that
 
01:44:26.550 --> 01:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
we've heard from providers that they
 
01:44:29.350 --> 01:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
just cannot keep the service going
 
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
without those additional costs
 
01:44:35.470 --> 01:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
supplemented um and so again none of our
 
01:44:37.709 --> 01:44:37.719 align:start position:0%
Medicaid waiver dollars can pay for room
 
01:44:40.470 --> 01:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
and board that pay for services for the
 
01:44:43.950 --> 01:44:43.960 align:start position:0%
individual um the individuals do pay um
 
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
toward that room and board cost um but
 
01:44:48.629 --> 01:44:48.639 align:start position:0%
it's not enough to cover the cost to
 
01:44:52.270 --> 01:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
keep um doors open for our providers so
 
01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
you know potential concerns would be not
 
01:44:58.430 --> 01:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
only providers leaving the state not um
 
01:45:00.270 --> 01:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
not attracting new providers to the
 
01:45:02.790 --> 01:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
state but also UNH housing people with
 
01:45:04.350 --> 01:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities and where
 
01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
would they go if they did not have that
 
01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:08.229 align:start position:0%
would they go if they did not have that
Residential

01:45:08.229 --> 01:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
Residential
 
01:45:10.990 --> 01:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
Care represent wner how many people
 
01:45:13.990 --> 01:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
affect how many people that's kind of a
 
01:45:18.990 --> 01:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
hard one to guess I would think because
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
you don't know who's going to drop out
 
01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
and who's going to be affected but yeah
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
yeah um I I can I can look at more of
 
01:45:27.510 --> 01:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
the numbers on that I can get you kind
 
01:45:29.550 --> 01:45:29.560 align:start position:0%
of the number of certified beds and who
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
you know currently has room and board
 
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
funding but I would say um even the
 
01:45:35.350 --> 01:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
current roomin board funding that these
 
01:45:38.589 --> 01:45:38.599 align:start position:0%
providers are receiving um is not enough
 
01:45:40.270 --> 01:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
with you know without an adjustment
 
01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
factor to you know the changing costs
 
01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:43.470 align:start position:0%
factor to you know the changing costs
and

01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
service I would I would appreciate
 
01:45:47.229 --> 01:45:47.239 align:start position:0%
seeing what you know some sort of we can
 
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
do that estimate of so how many people
 
01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
are getting room in board now
 
01:45:55.270 --> 01:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
um that's a good question and then do
 
01:45:58.189 --> 01:45:58.199 align:start position:0%
you have a unmet need of the number of
 
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
people who still need room in board that
 
01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
don't have it now what what are those
 
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
two numbers yeah we certainly still have
 
01:46:05.830 --> 01:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
providers that are providing services
 
01:46:08.910 --> 01:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
without room and board um and and those
 
01:46:12.070 --> 01:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
um as we were you know creating a
 
01:46:15.510 --> 01:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
formula to make it fair and uh it used
 
01:46:17.229 --> 01:46:17.239 align:start position:0%
to be kind of first come first serve so
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
if I was a provider and I asked for room
 
01:46:21.310 --> 01:46:21.320 align:start position:0%
and board we have a finite amount of
 
01:46:23.669 --> 01:46:23.679 align:start position:0%
dollars currently um that we can use for
 
01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
room and board sure I'm just asking
 
01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
client numbers how many clients
 
01:46:31.149 --> 01:46:31.159 align:start position:0%
currently benefit from room and board
 
01:46:33.629 --> 01:46:33.639 align:start position:0%
and what is our unmet we got somebody
 
01:46:37.950 --> 01:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:41.149 --> 01:46:41.159 align:start position:0%
okay because because I think that gives
 
01:46:42.990 --> 01:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
representative walner and the rest of us
 
01:46:47.830 --> 01:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
an idea of what the potential impact is
 
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
here thank you she's looking it up so
 
01:46:52.270 --> 01:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
soon as soon as we get that we can okay
 
01:46:54.669 --> 01:46:54.679 align:start position:0%
she can continue need to look it up um
 
01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
Let me let me do a survey question and
 
01:46:59.310 --> 01:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
as we're pausing are there members of
 
01:47:01.950 --> 01:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
the audience that would like to speak to
 
01:47:05.589 --> 01:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
the committee this morning before we we
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
break I'm not I'm not seeing hands I'm
 
01:47:12.189 --> 01:47:12.199 align:start position:0%
not seeing hands
 
01:47:14.990 --> 01:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
okay um do you want to talk about
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
Recreation and and intervent early
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
intervention while she's coming up with
 
01:47:20.589 --> 01:47:20.599 align:start position:0%
the numbers yeah we can talk briefly
 
01:47:22.350 --> 01:47:22.360 align:start position:0%
about Recreation as we know that was
 
01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
funded in 202 see fiscal year 2025 with
 
01:47:29.390 --> 01:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
$500,000 of um General funds yeah how'd
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
that go do we have any data on on
 
01:47:34.229 --> 01:47:34.239 align:start position:0%
utilization we do so I looked last night
 
01:47:35.950 --> 01:47:35.960 align:start position:0%
before as I Was preparing for this
 
01:47:38.790 --> 01:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
morning so as of uh last night we've
 
01:47:46.669 --> 01:47:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:50.310 --> 01:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
$367,500 approvals and only one denial
 
01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
because um that person was not receiving
 
01:47:55.070 --> 01:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
waiver services so not U part of the
 
01:47:57.790 --> 01:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
criteria to um receive these Recreation
 
01:48:00.830 --> 01:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
funds so were your big numbers 360,000
 
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
divided by about 227 users um I would
 
01:48:09.229 --> 01:48:09.239 align:start position:0%
say divided by 673 users six so and
 
01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679 align:start position:0%
there's a cap of $600 so they can't ask
 
01:48:14.149 --> 01:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
for more than $600 for Recreation
 
01:48:17.669 --> 01:48:17.679 align:start position:0%
services okay um do we have the numbers
 
01:48:24.629 --> 01:48:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:26.669 --> 01:48:26.679 align:start position:0%
can you just that's our that's our if if
 
01:48:30.990 --> 01:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:34.669 --> 01:48:34.679 align:start position:0%
can we're about to hear I
 
01:48:36.910 --> 01:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
think good morning I'm Jessica Gorton
 
01:48:37.990 --> 01:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
the bureau chief with the Bureau of
 
01:48:40.270 --> 01:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
Developmental services and my colleague
 
01:48:42.270 --> 01:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
Lorie Bashon is pulling the numbers of
 
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
individuals who are currently receiving
 
01:48:46.229 --> 01:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
ran board funding we have about a list
 
01:48:48.790 --> 01:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
of 500 individuals right now who need
 
01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
Ren board funding that's been provided
 
01:48:53.310 --> 01:48:53.320 align:start position:0%
by our provider agencies 500 in addition
 
01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
to whatever number we already are
 
01:48:56.390 --> 01:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
supporting in addition to the current
 
01:48:57.910 --> 01:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
spend which we typically Track by
 
01:48:59.669 --> 01:48:59.679 align:start position:0%
provider but they should be very quickly
 
01:49:01.709 --> 01:49:01.719 align:start position:0%
able to um divide that by the total
 
01:49:03.750 --> 01:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
number of individuals so the immediate
 
01:49:06.270 --> 01:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
threat is probably could be summarized
 
01:49:09.390 --> 01:49:09.400 align:start position:0%
that those 500 may not be serviced and
 
01:49:13.550 --> 01:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
that of the existing client population
 
01:49:15.750 --> 01:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
they may be harmed because some unknown
 
01:49:17.950 --> 01:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
percentage will have it their room and
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
board re removed absolutely due to the
 
01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
total impact to a provider agency as a
 
01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
whole and not any one particular home
 
01:49:26.589 --> 01:49:26.599 align:start position:0%
that they might be receiving those funds
 
01:49:29.189 --> 01:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
mron do you want to come up did you have
 
01:49:29.199 --> 01:49:34.149 align:start position:0%
mron do you want to come up did you have
a

01:49:34.149 --> 01:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
number hi thank you I'm Lori vashan the
 
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
Chief Operating Officer for the division
 
01:49:41.550 --> 01:49:41.560 align:start position:0%
of long-term supports and services at
 
01:49:45.790 --> 01:49:45.800 align:start position:0%
this time we have a total of about
 
01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
240 um beds that providers could bill
 
01:49:52.830 --> 01:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
for there are sometimes a vacancy if an
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
individual passes away and then somebody
 
01:49:58.589 --> 01:49:58.599 align:start position:0%
else moves into the home but overall we
 
01:50:02.189 --> 01:50:02.199 align:start position:0%
have on average about
 
01:50:05.709 --> 01:50:05.719 align:start position:0%
550 approved um staffed
 
01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
residential individuals in New Hampshire
 
01:50:12.550 --> 01:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
so um that's the unmet
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
need I I'm getting my numbers confused
 
01:50:17.550 --> 01:50:17.560 align:start position:0%
the current people receiving Services
 
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
sounds to be a little under 250 no So
 
01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
currently receiving so we only only have
 
01:50:26.070 --> 01:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
a a smaller population that we're able
 
01:50:29.149 --> 01:50:29.159 align:start position:0%
to fund room and board services for and
 
01:50:33.510 --> 01:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
that's around 240 individuals or beds in
 
01:50:35.510 --> 01:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so we're only doing a
 
01:50:38.790 --> 01:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
third of the demand correct correct okay
 
01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:40.430 align:start position:0%
third of the demand correct correct okay
and

01:50:40.430 --> 01:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
um just to reemphasize what Melissa
 
01:50:46.270 --> 01:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
Hardy said it's critical to keep those
 
01:50:48.790 --> 01:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
individuals receiving current Services
 
01:50:51.629 --> 01:50:51.639 align:start position:0%
yep no I I understand I I I think we
 
01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to understand the context
 
01:50:56.430 --> 01:50:56.440 align:start position:0%
the human impact in in quantitative
 
01:50:59.510 --> 01:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
numbers so thank you thank
 
01:51:03.310 --> 01:51:03.320 align:start position:0%
you okay do you do you do you have a do
 
01:51:05.189 --> 01:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
you have a question I'm sorry were there
 
01:51:06.350 --> 01:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
questions over here there were questions
 
01:51:08.589 --> 01:51:08.599 align:start position:0%
over there but I do have representative
 
01:51:11.550 --> 01:51:11.560 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman back on
 
01:51:16.629 --> 01:51:16.639 align:start position:0%
page just quickly on page 50 on guardian
 
01:51:19.870 --> 01:51:19.880 align:start position:0%
and on congregate housing do you also
 
01:51:22.109 --> 01:51:22.119 align:start position:0%
have numbers of people that we serve and
 
01:51:26.510 --> 01:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
what's the need for that I do um and you
 
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
can provide this afterwards if if it's
 
01:51:31.430 --> 01:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
not easy to get to yes I do have numbers
 
01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
for that that I can get to you as far as
 
01:51:35.149 --> 01:51:35.159 align:start position:0%
the number of current slots that we have
 
01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:37.679 align:start position:0%
for Guardianship and then um I know
 
01:51:38.709 --> 01:51:38.719 align:start position:0%
there's also
 
01:51:41.629 --> 01:51:41.639 align:start position:0%
legislation um currently going on as far
 
01:51:45.470 --> 01:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
as as uh funding um this guardianship
 
01:51:47.910 --> 01:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
need and and what that would mean is you
 
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
know the increasing the number of slots
 
01:51:52.189 --> 01:51:52.199 align:start position:0%
but also increasing the rate that uh
 
01:51:54.030 --> 01:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
public Guardians received to provide
 
01:51:55.870 --> 01:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
that service great and the same with
 
01:51:58.990 --> 01:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
congregate housing yes um congregate
 
01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
housing um was something that was funded
 
01:52:06.790 --> 01:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
um in hb2 and um was um not funded
 
01:52:09.390 --> 01:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
during the governor's budget uh we have
 
01:52:12.990 --> 01:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
two providers um that are um housing
 
01:52:15.189 --> 01:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
authorities in Laconia and in Manchester
 
01:52:19.189 --> 01:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
that um receive this support uh through
 
01:52:21.790 --> 01:52:21.800 align:start position:0%
congregate housing so that could be um
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
support service
 
01:52:24.990 --> 01:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
you know housekeeping services for those
 
01:52:27.589 --> 01:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
individuals that live in those um
 
01:52:27.599 --> 01:52:28.870 align:start position:0%
individuals that live in those um
housing

01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:52:32.270 --> 01:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
developments okay thank
 
01:52:35.149 --> 01:52:35.159 align:start position:0%
you go ahead so that was the question I
 
01:52:37.790 --> 01:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
had had about the suspension in hb2 I
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
guess my followup to that is all these
 
01:52:43.069 --> 01:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
other line items that are not funded on
 
01:52:45.470 --> 01:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
your prioritized list
 
01:52:48.430 --> 01:52:48.440 align:start position:0%
is that congregate housing the only
 
01:52:50.149 --> 01:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
thing that's in statute how come that's
 
01:52:53.390 --> 01:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
the only thing that is suspended
 
01:52:54.870 --> 01:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
officially that's a question for you Mr
 
01:52:57.910 --> 01:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
White sure so congregate housing um it
 
01:53:00.790 --> 01:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
was funded at 1.5 million by NH hb2
 
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
appropriation in the current bium y
 
01:53:05.550 --> 01:53:05.560 align:start position:0%
prior to that um I I would have to go
 
01:53:07.109 --> 01:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
back and look at the history I don't
 
01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
know if Kevin knows off the top of his
 
01:53:10.990 --> 01:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
head it's been unfunded for a number of
 
01:53:12.910 --> 01:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
Bania it was it was one of the it was
 
01:53:15.470 --> 01:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
one of the items last go around when uh
 
01:53:17.149 --> 01:53:17.159 align:start position:0%
chairman Edwards asked the question of
 
01:53:18.669 --> 01:53:18.679 align:start position:0%
why do we keep suspending this we've
 
01:53:20.709 --> 01:53:20.719 align:start position:0%
never funded it but then last year we
 
01:53:23.629 --> 01:53:23.639 align:start position:0%
funded it so um different conversation
 
01:53:26.109 --> 01:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
now uh but it just has a history of not
 
01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
being funded for some time okay so my
 
01:53:30.069 --> 01:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
followup question though is these other
 
01:53:32.030 --> 01:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
line items that were not funded how come
 
01:53:33.430 --> 01:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
we don't have to suspend anything for
 
01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
those because they're not in statute or
 
01:53:38.109 --> 01:53:38.119 align:start position:0%
so the congregate housing that's the
 
01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:40.719 align:start position:0%
entire program so so under statute it
 
01:53:43.669 --> 01:53:43.679 align:start position:0%
directs us to um have a program for that
 
01:53:46.189 --> 01:53:46.199 align:start position:0%
but if we do not then uh then we would
 
01:53:48.910 --> 01:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
recommend suspending that the the CFI
 
01:53:51.550 --> 01:53:51.560 align:start position:0%
service rate incre the rate increased
 
01:53:53.350 --> 01:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
the guardianship rate increase the BDS
 
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
service rate increase you're not closing
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
down a program for a b so you wouldn't
 
01:53:58.709 --> 01:53:58.719 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to suspend the state
 
01:54:00.669 --> 01:54:00.679 align:start position:0%
law so there's that was my question so
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
there none of these other ones are at
 
01:54:06.669 --> 01:54:06.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:11.390 --> 01:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
no okay um that is that the do you have
 
01:54:13.629 --> 01:54:13.639 align:start position:0%
like a just a short summary because then
 
01:54:15.069 --> 01:54:15.079 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask you about some
 
01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
questions that may affect uh some
 
01:54:20.189 --> 01:54:20.199 align:start position:0%
thinking around long-term managed
 
01:54:24.030 --> 01:54:24.040 align:start position:0%
care one other item just um to be aware
 
01:54:25.629 --> 01:54:25.639 align:start position:0%
of that we previously discussed just
 
01:54:26.990 --> 01:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about prioritized
 
01:54:31.109 --> 01:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
needs um in in the governor's budget in
 
01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
the H sorry in the
 
01:54:37.510 --> 01:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
hb2 um there is a provision to continue
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
the DD pilot program um that was
 
01:54:43.870 --> 01:54:43.880 align:start position:0%
originally authorized in chapter or
 
01:54:46.750 --> 01:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
chapter 79 for the current bium um and
 
01:54:48.629 --> 01:54:48.639 align:start position:0%
that extends the program to allow us to
 
01:54:50.069 --> 01:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
continue to use the funds that were
 
01:54:52.750 --> 01:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
previously appropriated until the seven
 
01:54:55.270 --> 01:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
or eight individuals age off that pilot
 
01:54:57.270 --> 01:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
program uh so I just wanted to highlight
 
01:54:59.189 --> 01:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
that as well just as we're talking about
 
01:54:59.199 --> 01:55:00.030 align:start position:0%
that as well just as we're talking about
uh

01:55:00.030 --> 01:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:55:03.790 --> 01:55:03.800 align:start position:0%
DD okay so so so make it simple for me
 
01:55:06.069 --> 01:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
is is that would that need to be another
 
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
line on this prioritized need list like
 
01:55:11.629 --> 01:55:11.639 align:start position:0%
an extension of page 51 it it would not
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
no action is currently necessary it's
 
01:55:17.430 --> 01:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
section 104 of hb2 that makes that
 
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
extension I just wanted to highlight
 
01:55:20.550 --> 01:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
that in case there were any
 
01:55:23.229 --> 01:55:23.239 align:start position:0%
consideration for changing that
 
01:55:25.109 --> 01:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
okay not that I'm recommending it all
 
01:55:28.510 --> 01:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
right um all right so we have a a few
 
01:55:32.430 --> 01:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
minutes and uh and so there's been some
 
01:55:34.709 --> 01:55:34.719 align:start position:0%
discussion and this will be made more
 
01:55:37.069 --> 01:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
formal representative tersi rep
 
01:55:40.069 --> 01:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
representative walner um but but I I
 
01:55:41.910 --> 01:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
just want to start getting some thought
 
01:55:44.550 --> 01:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
out into the onto the table and in the
 
01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
public there's been some discussion
 
01:55:50.830 --> 01:55:50.840 align:start position:0%
around um maybe uh asking for this next
 
01:55:55.390 --> 01:55:55.400 align:start position:0%
budget to begin a transition period for
 
01:55:59.430 --> 01:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
um uh the long-term supports the the CFI
 
01:56:02.830 --> 01:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
and the like moving it um into the
 
01:56:06.189 --> 01:56:06.199 align:start position:0%
Managed Care Organization structure and
 
01:56:09.270 --> 01:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
if we did that um the Managed Care
 
01:56:11.629 --> 01:56:11.639 align:start position:0%
organizations would would then need to
 
01:56:15.550 --> 01:56:15.560 align:start position:0%
take care of uh issues like um uh
 
01:56:17.870 --> 01:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
discharge planning Transitional Care
 
01:56:20.069 --> 01:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
other educational programs to Physicians
 
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
and hospitals uh we would have have to
 
01:56:25.069 --> 01:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
uh have the Managed Care Organization
 
01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
start to provide those
 
01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
Services um and they would need to uh
 
01:56:32.109 --> 01:56:32.119 align:start position:0%
assist in collecting financial
 
01:56:34.149 --> 01:56:34.159 align:start position:0%
information uh provide payment
 
01:56:36.350 --> 01:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
incentives to nursing facilities to
 
01:56:39.669 --> 01:56:39.679 align:start position:0%
reward reductions in several types of
 
01:56:42.830 --> 01:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
problems and uh to develop a shared
 
01:56:45.310 --> 01:56:45.320 align:start position:0%
Savings Program for the county
 
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
governments so so those are the big
 
01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
things the mcos would need to do among
 
01:56:52.669 --> 01:56:52.679 align:start position:0%
you know some other obvious impl
 
01:56:57.229 --> 01:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
implementation stuff but but then some
 
01:57:02.350 --> 01:57:02.360 align:start position:0%
the counties would need to be um more in
 
01:57:05.350 --> 01:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
included more than they are now in doing
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
the um medical evaluations to help
 
01:57:12.910 --> 01:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
assess the level of need um and uh and
 
01:57:14.669 --> 01:57:14.679 align:start position:0%
so there would need to be a transition
 
01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
period where the counties uh were able
 
01:57:20.069 --> 01:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
to establish Manpower and training and
 
01:57:23.629 --> 01:57:23.639 align:start position:0%
put themselves in a position um I I I
 
01:57:26.510 --> 01:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
know that this topic has come up ever
 
01:57:29.550 --> 01:57:29.560 align:start position:0%
since we started doing mcos and I know
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
that every time it's come up uh a
 
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
decision has been made to leave it
 
01:57:36.669 --> 01:57:36.679 align:start position:0%
outside of the Managed Care
 
01:57:39.950 --> 01:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
structure um but but but based on the
 
01:57:42.310 --> 01:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
rambling I just did and you not having
 
01:57:44.830 --> 01:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
any paper in front of you do you have do
 
01:57:47.310 --> 01:57:47.320 align:start position:0%
you have any uh basic comments on this I
 
01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
see Mr Lipman has come in uh and um do
 
01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
you do you you want to respond to that
 
01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
in any way I would want to recommend
 
01:57:59.669 --> 01:57:59.679 align:start position:0%
that you know this was a discussion I
 
01:58:03.229 --> 01:58:03.239 align:start position:0%
think about 12 years ago um you know
 
01:58:05.950 --> 01:58:05.960 align:start position:0%
having ltss and managed care I think it
 
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
it got pretty far um but did not um
 
01:58:12.470 --> 01:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
produce ltss in managed care I think
 
01:58:14.550 --> 01:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of considerations in
 
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
looking at that um moving people into a
 
01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:19.679 align:start position:0%
medical model versus a person centered
 
01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
model you know how would we um that's
 
01:58:24.790 --> 01:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
That's the basis of all of our services
 
01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
right not necessarily from a medical
 
01:58:29.470 --> 01:58:29.480 align:start position:0%
perspective or an insurance perspective
 
01:58:31.790 --> 01:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
what's makes sense so I think you know
 
01:58:34.189 --> 01:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
how do we balance the preservation of
 
01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
our our system as Home and Community
 
01:58:40.109 --> 01:58:40.119 align:start position:0%
Based as person centered uh versus being
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
managed by you know a larger insurer um
 
01:58:46.550 --> 01:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
I I think that would be something that
 
01:58:50.910 --> 01:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
we would need um technical assistance or
 
01:58:53.669 --> 01:58:53.679 align:start position:0%
Consulting on you know from States or
 
01:58:55.550 --> 01:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
partners that have done it before that
 
01:58:58.030 --> 01:58:58.040 align:start position:0%
have moved into Managed Care U I think
 
01:59:00.629 --> 01:59:00.639 align:start position:0%
it's a bit beyond and above what what
 
01:59:03.030 --> 01:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
our capacity is to to look at all the
 
01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
risks and benefits of doing that not
 
01:59:06.629 --> 01:59:06.639 align:start position:0%
just you know looking at the cost
 
01:59:08.910 --> 01:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
savings but looking at the impact on you
 
01:59:12.589 --> 01:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
know the services that people uh receive
 
01:59:14.189 --> 01:59:14.199 align:start position:0%
as of right now it's very you know
 
01:59:16.229 --> 01:59:16.239 align:start position:0%
person driven so I I would want to
 
01:59:18.910 --> 01:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
caution in you making sure that we have
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
a you know a thoughtful plan that
 
01:59:24.149 --> 01:59:24.159 align:start position:0%
includes you know stakeholder provider
 
01:59:26.910 --> 01:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
uh input as to how would it affect you
 
01:59:29.189 --> 01:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
know an individual receiving services
 
01:59:32.310 --> 01:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
but also providers um you know being
 
01:59:34.709 --> 01:59:34.719 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for those Services provided
 
01:59:38.149 --> 01:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
yeah so so I I always try to play a
 
01:59:40.030 --> 01:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
little bit of a devil's advocate with my
 
01:59:42.470 --> 01:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
questions and so when I'm hearing this
 
01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
my devil's advocacy question is why
 
01:59:46.990 --> 01:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
would we do this we we we have a system
 
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's working you know what what what do
 
01:59:51.629 --> 01:59:51.639 align:start position:0%
we think the benefits of a change like
 
01:59:53.629 --> 01:59:53.639 align:start position:0%
this might might be and what has been
 
01:59:56.510 --> 01:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
offered back is that we initially had
 
01:59:58.709 --> 01:59:58.719 align:start position:0%
some estimates on the number of people
 
02:00:00.629 --> 02:00:00.639 align:start position:0%
that we thought would take advantage of
 
02:00:03.470 --> 02:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
CFI we we've not been hitting those
 
02:00:06.750 --> 02:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
numbers and and and and so as we've
 
02:00:09.149 --> 02:00:09.159 align:start position:0%
talked and agreed upon before there's
 
02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
not only a cost savings but a quality of
 
02:00:13.390 --> 02:00:13.400 align:start position:0%
life benefit for people who don't need
 
02:00:15.709 --> 02:00:15.719 align:start position:0%
to go into nursing homes and can stay at
 
02:00:18.270 --> 02:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
home longer so between the financial and
 
02:00:22.510 --> 02:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
personal if we found a way to uh drive
 
02:00:25.870 --> 02:00:25.880 align:start position:0%
up uh the the number of people in
 
02:00:28.629 --> 02:00:28.639 align:start position:0%
cfis and reduce the number of people in
 
02:00:31.470 --> 02:00:31.480 align:start position:0%
County homes that that could provide for
 
02:00:34.430 --> 02:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
significant um uh quality of life
 
02:00:36.629 --> 02:00:36.639 align:start position:0%
improvements while saving considerable
 
02:00:39.229 --> 02:00:39.239 align:start position:0%
money and the and the and the belief is
 
02:00:41.390 --> 02:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
that the mcos they had the
 
02:00:43.270 --> 02:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
accountability for those long-term
 
02:00:45.470 --> 02:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
dollars then they would have more of an
 
02:00:48.750 --> 02:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
incentive to aggressively manage that
 
02:00:52.510 --> 02:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
program so so that's the answer to my
 
02:00:55.470 --> 02:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
why would we do this question and and I
 
02:00:57.910 --> 02:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
just leave that out for you not for
 
02:01:02.310 --> 02:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
comment but for context thank you um so
 
02:01:05.510 --> 02:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
um it's it's pretty much noon are there
 
02:01:07.709 --> 02:01:07.719 align:start position:0%
any you're you're thinking do you have
 
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
questions or comments on this topic I'm
 
02:01:13.310 --> 02:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
sure I will I know I wasn't expecting
 
02:01:15.229 --> 02:01:15.239 align:start position:0%
the conversation right representative
 
02:01:17.310 --> 02:01:17.320 align:start position:0%
well and and I I wanted to make it part
 
02:01:20.270 --> 02:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
of the conversation to tee up a real
 
02:01:25.870 --> 02:01:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
walner okay well I I don't know how how
 
02:01:32.510 --> 02:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
we did it but it's noon and uh I'm going
 
02:01:36.390 --> 02:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
to um adjourn this this uh this work
 
02:01:50.830 --> 02:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
