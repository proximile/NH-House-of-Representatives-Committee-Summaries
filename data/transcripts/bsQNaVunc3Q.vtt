00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
the key issues that we want to addressed
 
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
and uh a subcommittee of Senator Lang
 
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
Charlie McIntyre and myself uh met um
 
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough we all read the the
 
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
Innovation convergence and then
 
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
spectrum and um I did I did send a
 
00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
summary to everybody about the process
 
00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
that we did uh but I started off this
 
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 align:start position:0%
like being in a jury um I said let's
 
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
just have a first round of who who would
 
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
you pick as number one
 
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
and all three of us said spectrum and
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
then we went through a more detailed
 
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
process uh of that and it turns out
 
00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 align:start position:0%
Spectrum was actually the low bid at
 
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
77,500 plus
 
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
travel Innovation was 8
 
00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
80,000 and convergence was 123,000 and
 
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
change um but and then we used the
 
00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 align:start position:0%
process uh the Charlie has that he uses
 
00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
to to assess these things weighted
 
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
74% uh um qualifications and then 25%
 
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
the price and and it scored out that uh
 
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
Spectrum was the firm so we did um and
 
00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:14.199 align:start position:0%
then I sent an email to everybody I said
 
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
it's you know in L of having a meeting
 
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
get approval I said does anybody object
 
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
please let me know uh no one objected so
 
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
we we started the ball rolling with
 
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
Spectrum but Charlie can you give us an
 
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
update as to where we are cuz you know
 
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
we need a contract or something like
 
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
important uh yeah so
 
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
the we're in the process now um that
 
00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 align:start position:0%
it's with Spectrum waiting for them to
 
00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
sign off on it so and after that I think
 
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
really they're just dealing the the
 
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
ministerial matters of the state the
 
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State sign off and so they
 
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
they they've got a a contract in our
 
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
language yes yeah yeah okay and so when
 
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
we get that back we'll submit it through
 
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
GNC approval
 
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
right you know yeah because post haste
 
00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 align:start position:0%
yeah it has to be post haste because you
 
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
know time is clicking here and we need
 
00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
them for the two big issues that we're
 
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
going to address one is is the
 
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
allocation of the money
 
00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate between the between the the
 
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
state Charities and the and the uh
 
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 align:start position:0%
facilities and um and then you know the
 
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
oversight the regulation part uh we
 
00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to compare us compare us to these
 
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
other states that have you know bigger
 
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
casinos so those are the two major
 
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
things other little things there too but
 
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
those are the main things so we it' be
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
helpful to get them going on this so we
 
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
can then use their respon their
 
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
observations to drive our discussions
 
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
about that and for us to come to some
 
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
conclusions that we need to modify or
 
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
whatever what we're doing so um
 
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully what's the drop dead for
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
getting the executive Council for
 
00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 align:start position:0%
March is it end I think you said seg
 
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
midm march to to submit and then yeah
 
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
Kelly yeah yeah there's a calendar it's
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
only days ahead of the I'll have to
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
check okay because I is that next
 
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
meeting the 27th okay no the next the
 
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120 align:start position:0%
27th will be the following meeting be
 
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
the first one in April
 
00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
yeah so okay let's think you that so but
 
00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:21.919 align:start position:0%
we're on it we're trying to get it
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
moving um what I'd like to try to do and
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
I'm going to talk to to Charlie offline
 
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
is even though we may not have a
 
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
contract I I think it may not be a bad
 
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
idea especially if they've signed off in
 
00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
the contract I think it's 99% I don't
 
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:39.560 align:start position:0%
understand 90% 99% sure that the
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
executive council is not going to say no
 
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to have them at
 
00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:49.759 align:start position:0%
least next meeting they have said no
 
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
before one two commissions ago they
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
denied the contract for a
 
00:07:57.869 --> 00:07:57.879 align:start position:0%
consultant so just preparing
 
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
you I love that this but I'm sure they
 
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:05.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind uh zooming into our our
 
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
meeting so that we can start at least
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
having discussions with
 
00:08:12.749 --> 00:08:12.759 align:start position:0%
them um I
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
think you know we didn't ask them to
 
00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
come in and and I remember I was a
 
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
consultant for 43 years we just have to
 
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
come in we'd have to defend our
 
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
proposals in front of whatever we never
 
00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:25.039 align:start position:0%
had that part part of it so I I don't
 
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
think they would mind us zooming them in
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
and having them fly in here to um just
 
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
talk to us about we we I'm sure we all
 
00:08:34.029 --> 00:08:34.039 align:start position:0%
have questions about how this is all
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
going to work so if we can jump the gun
 
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
and have that happen at our next meeting
 
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
that'll be great so I'll talk to you
 
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
more about that does anybody object to
 
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:44.360 align:start position:0%
that by the way I mean I think that's
 
00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
something we should do just to keep the
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
process going
 
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
here um so okay last meeting oh
 
00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
de just a question that on that um the
 
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
scope of the ser services that are to be
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
provided you you briefly alluded to them
 
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
but could you take them off uh what are
 
00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:09.560 align:start position:0%
what are we expecting from this group
 
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:12.200 align:start position:0%
and um specifically I'm wondering about
 
00:09:13.949 --> 00:09:13.959 align:start position:0%
uh whether they're going to tell us
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
anything about what other states are
 
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
doing on problem gambling yeah you know
 
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
we um you other thing I thought you know
 
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to get copies of the
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
spectrum proposal to everybody okay um I
 
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:29.320 align:start position:0%
mean it's in here but the main thing is
 
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
what I just said you know we want an
 
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
outside person to come in and Survey the
 
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
industry with that knowledge to come in
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
and tell us you know that U especially
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
on the historic racing machines what did
 
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
the allocation really between the the
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
facilities and the state because you can
 
00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
look at the state that the state's
 
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
giving some of their money to the Char
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
you know it's like or all three really
 
00:09:59.230 --> 00:09:59.240 align:start position:0%
but so and then the other thing is
 
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
oversight you know you know how do we
 
00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:04.519 align:start position:0%
compare given that we have all these big
 
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
players coming in now what's how do we
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
look in terms of our oversight do we
 
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
need more resource do we need more audit
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
for instance do we need more you know
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
things like that um and is there
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
something that we're not doing that we
 
00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
should be doing uh to to um keep this
 
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.990 align:start position:0%
should be doing uh to to um keep this
type

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
type
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
now you know I just spoke to the
 
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
Assistant Attorney General before the
 
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
meeting uh he he mentioned that you know
 
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
maybe it's was a good idea to have maybe
 
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
Maine or Massachusetts and we come in we
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
may do that uh from a a regulation
 
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
standpoint uh to talk about and he said
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
this morning maybe Massachusetts
 
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
probably the better one to have come in
 
00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
um and um and hear from them um uh and
 
00:10:56.269 --> 00:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
we may do that but again to me the
 
00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
real the real thing is to get the
 
00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.190 align:start position:0%
real the real thing is to get the
consult

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
consult
 
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
going so that we have facts that we can
 
00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:07.160 align:start position:0%
work with them on back and forth as to
 
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
what we want to do in those areas so yes
 
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
Charlie we're doing a separate proposal
 
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
aren't we for problem gaming because
 
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
these though if I remember right the
 
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
proposal we sent out for this one was
 
00:11:22.509 --> 00:11:22.519 align:start position:0%
Regulatory and Regulatory and and you
 
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
know Fe structure kind of laws um and I
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
thought we're doing a separate one for
 
00:11:30.629 --> 00:11:30.639 align:start position:0%
problem G we would yeah yeah
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
so and also the scope also includes um
 
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
sort of the natural Marketplace for New
 
00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:40.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well the Spectrum that's
 
00:11:43.389 --> 00:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
the third component for this right and
 
00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:44.839 align:start position:0%
we do have money given that the proposal
 
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
came in at about about 880,000
 
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
uh 778 but then there travel on top of
 
00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
that uh and we have what one well well
 
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
in that bucket we have 125 for
 
00:11:59.949 --> 00:11:59.959 align:start position:0%
Consultants right so there there's and I
 
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
would imagine that that can the
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
U the problem gaming one wouldn't be as
 
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
expensive but I don't know I wouldn't
 
00:12:09.389 --> 00:12:09.399 align:start position:0%
think so yeah I wouldn't think so you
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
want to do an RFP for uh responsible
 
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
gambling consultant Services it would be
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
right much
 
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
less so then if we're going to do that
 
00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:19.839 align:start position:0%
we should
 
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like then we should start
 
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
that process to to find a
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
consultant um okay so can we do do we
 
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
have names of
 
00:12:32.829 --> 00:12:32.839 align:start position:0%
maybe matter of fact our next agenda
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
item is to have Ed Albert who's really
 
00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
involved in the in problem gaming in our
 
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
state um in that regard it's probably
 
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
not unreasonable to sort of send an
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
email or a request to the National
 
00:12:46.509 --> 00:12:46.519 align:start position:0%
Council on problem gambling because they
 
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
would have the most upto-date national
 
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
statistics I think okay all right so we
 
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll we'll get that moving um
 
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
and give everybody an update on that in
 
00:12:59.470 --> 00:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
that regard they might even do it for
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
sort of a donation
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
essentially again I I I also think this
 
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
is the meat and potatoes right this is
 
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
the the what the really heavy heavy lift
 
00:13:11.069 --> 00:13:11.079 align:start position:0%
is the laws and regulations as they
 
00:13:13.629 --> 00:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
compare to other states it's problem
 
00:13:15.389 --> 00:13:15.399 align:start position:0%
gaming is much easier lift when you look
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
at statistical information and that kind
 
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
of stuff so I think again I know there
 
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
are several places like Miami University
 
00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:23.839 align:start position:0%
of Ohio has a whole college division
 
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
dedicated nothing but problem gaming and
 
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
researching problem gaming so there are
 
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
people out there that have speci just in
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
that field right okay well that's good
 
00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:34.839 align:start position:0%
so all right I'm glad glad that came up
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
and um we'll move that
 
00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
forward uh talking about problem gaming
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
um last meeting we had someone who was
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
really under your tutelage right under
 
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
your your stff no no your stff your
 
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
staff yeah was in our head of marketing
 
00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
yes right also appointed to the council
 
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
right and so we have somebody from uh
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
from the that's really in the trenches
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
let's say really looking at this issue
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
um and that's Ed Talbert we finally
 
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
tracked him down and here he is in
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
loving color so Ed the floor is yours um
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
organization and I put on everybody's
 
00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:19.639 align:start position:0%

my gambling addiction took just about
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
everything for me other than the promise
 
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:14.720 align:start position:0%

a decision to pass on that $100,000
 
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
renewal for three factors one a need to

services having worked in the public
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
sector in Massachusetts I know what it
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
was like to never have a budget ready at
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
the start of the year but in the Private
 
00:22:55.149 --> 00:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
Industry I wasn't ready to sign a
 
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
contract that would commit the council
 
00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
to a lot more money that we could
 
00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
actually afford we worked with them to
 
00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:03.559 align:start position:0%
parir it down cut back the services and
 
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
developed the budget that we felt we
 
00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
could handle with what we had and based
 
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
on what we could see foresee as income
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
coming in like contributions from
 
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
DraftKings $15,000 each year for a
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
three-year period and our participation
 
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:19.720 align:start position:0%
in charal gaming which now is has been
 
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.310 align:start position:0%
in charal gaming which now is has been
around

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:25.400 align:start position:0%
$30,000 the council was informed by one
 
00:23:26.669 --> 00:23:26.679 align:start position:0%
of the commissions that they were
 
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
seeking 250 ,000 and would be hiring
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
somebody with expertise in
 
00:23:34.149 --> 00:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
self-exclusion and let me read from the
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
email regarding our response to
 
00:23:39.269 --> 00:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
voluntary self-exclusion this is tricky
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
because we've discussed creating a
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
full-time position gambling responsible
 
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
gambling position at the lottery if that
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
position is created that person would be
 
00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of the work required for to
 
00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
set up a centralized bu voluntary
 
00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
self-exclusion process but it is
 
00:23:57.149 --> 00:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
dependent on getting the New Hampshire
 
00:23:59.950 --> 00:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
Council respons Cil gam funded restored
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
and that's still an open question so the
 
00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
bottom line is if the council got the
 
00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
250,000 they were going in a separate
 
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
Direction with this hired person in that
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
if the
 
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
100,000 uh were the the budget figure
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
then it would fall back on us which we
 
00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
felt we really couldn't handle something
 
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
extent so we made the decision to pass
 
00:24:26.269 --> 00:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
on that that does not mean that we not
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
participate in any opportunity to bid on
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
what we think we can do uh but that and
 
00:24:35.149 --> 00:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
the third reason I applaud the industry
 
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
for all the notice they take responsible
 
00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
gambling that's not our clientele uh our
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
clientele are not going back to gambling
 
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
we don't teach people that you can
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
gamble safely again most of the people
 
00:24:50.269 --> 00:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
we encounter have crossed the line and I
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
have to tell you from personal
 
00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
experience in 46 years of attending
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of Gamblers
 
00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
Anonymous meeting and talking to
 
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
thousands of problem gamblers I have
 
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
never heard a person who relapsed come
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
back in and say it wasn't as bad this
 
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
time it's a progressive disease it's
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
never going to get better you can arrest
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
it but you're not going to cure it so
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
that me was the basis for our decision
 
00:25:17.789 --> 00:25:17.799 align:start position:0%
uh not to seek funing this year I'd like
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
to talk a little bit about the helpl
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
line and then talk about what I see is
 
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
the most critical need in that is
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
voluntary self-exclusion uh I have
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
figures on the helpline calls over the
 
00:25:30.389 --> 00:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
last three years uh and the total number
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
of calls uh that we received in uh
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
2021 was approximately 200 I'm not sure
 
00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:38.440 align:start position:0%
some of the calls from December from the
 
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
previous year that but it was around 200
 
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
out of that we identified 65 people as
 
00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
problem Gams in
 
00:25:50.389 --> 00:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
2022 the calls went up to
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
227 57 were identified as problem
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
gamers in 2023 306 calls were received
 
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
78 were from problemin Gams and so far
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
this year we've received 72 calls and 13
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
of them were from Pro regarding or
 
00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
designated as persons with a problem
 
00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:13.549 align:start position:0%
designated as persons with a problem
with

00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
gambling we get many more calls a lot of
 
00:26:18.029 --> 00:26:18.039 align:start position:0%
the calls as you probably can imagine
 
00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
are from loved ones of The Gambler and
 
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
not most gamblers don't pick up the
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
phone and say hey I've got a problem
 
00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
they're referred by somebody else we
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
follow up with the contacts when we do
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
get one we follow up with them we get
 
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
calls from the media we get calls from
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
we get a call from a representative
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
regularly who wants to know why we can't
 
00:26:38.549 --> 00:26:38.559 align:start position:0%
be like game sense in Massachusetts and
 
00:26:40.669 --> 00:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
have people station in each one of the
 
00:26:43.789 --> 00:26:43.799 align:start position:0%
casinos well if you got a $3.6 million
 
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
budget like the mass Council and
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
compulsive family you can afford to do
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
that but on $100,000 we can't commit to
 
00:26:51.789 --> 00:26:51.799 align:start position:0%
something like that I think it's a great
 
00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
program and a great idea but we can't do
 
00:26:58.149 --> 00:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
that um we also get calls from groups to
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
do presentations on that so there are a
 
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
lot of other calls that come in not the
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
six calls is the six calls actually
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
represent a figure of what we feel is
 
00:27:08.669 --> 00:27:08.679 align:start position:0%
accurate information for the number of
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
PR gamblers who reach our help line I
 
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
just want to add one more figure to that
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
I said there were about 35 people who
 
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
normally attend the gamble Anonymous
 
00:27:20.909 --> 00:27:20.919 align:start position:0%
meeting on Tuesday night in
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester one quarter of those have
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
come through the uh New Hampshire
 
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
council help line there are two people
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
that are in that meeting now one who has
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
celebrated two years in recovery another
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
one approaching uh one year later this
 
00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
month with the help of Mora McAn in the
 
00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire lottery self-excluded
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
through the iot and that stuff and then
 
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
doing doing very very well um so it's
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
great to have that option and it calls
 
00:27:51.549 --> 00:27:51.559 align:start position:0%
out the need for that I re regarding
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
voluntary self-exclusion I'm so glad the
 
00:27:55.389 --> 00:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
commission is interested in addressing
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
that because I certainly believe a
 
00:27:59.789 --> 00:27:59.799 align:start position:0%
centralized system is essential in the
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
state two weeks ago I got a call from
 
00:28:06.029 --> 00:28:06.039 align:start position:0%
Mrs locken from G2 gaming would call the
 
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Lottery and they referred
 
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
here to me and I guess they oversee
 
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
their company overseas ocean gaming and
 
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
they wanted to know if the people who
 
00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
had self-excluded at their Casino were
 
00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:21.320 align:start position:0%
registered in our database well a we
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
don't have a database uh positively the
 
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
state should have one and I told her she
 
00:28:29.149 --> 00:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
was astonished she smoke states do I I
 
00:28:30.669 --> 00:28:30.679 align:start position:0%
understand we're trying to get something
 
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:31.799 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
developed uh hopefully in the future
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
that's and we'll be very happy to work
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
with one one of the things that I don't
 
00:28:41.389 --> 00:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
understand and I'm sure you'll all agree
 
00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:44.360 align:start position:0%
with this you take a person who admits
 
00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
to having a gambling problem and tell
 
00:28:48.909 --> 00:28:48.919 align:start position:0%
him he has to go to each and every one
 
00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
of these places to self-exclude you're
 
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
putting him in the gambling situation
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
itself uh and you hope that that's
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
satisfactory uh and they're not provided
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
with any treatment information uh
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
there's only three gambl and honorous
 
00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
meetings in Hampshire presently one in
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
um do on Monday night one in the
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester meting on Tuesday night uh
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
and a third one in Hamstead on uh
 
00:29:14.669 --> 00:29:14.679 align:start position:0%
Thursday night um that those are the
 
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
resources we have we have some councils
 
00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
for training now since we've gone and I
 
00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:22.120 align:start position:0%
want to say independent but since we
 
00:29:24.389 --> 00:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
passed an State funding some of the
 
00:29:26.909 --> 00:29:26.919 align:start position:0%
things that we have done is the website
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
had been developed by um title media on
 
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
the the New Hampshire lottery we've gone
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
independent we created our road website
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
uh we can make changes on the flight uh
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
my co-director was an expert in
 
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
computers and all that stuff I'm not she
 
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
makes the changes she handles all the um
 
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
show social media things so we have our
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
own website now um that has prompted a
 
00:29:52.909 --> 00:29:52.919 align:start position:0%
lot of donations as well um we have you
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
know PayPal on there so people can Don
 
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
donate to um finally uh we have created
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
what's probably the first I know in the
 
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
region is an intensive outpatient um
 
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
program developed with one of our Bor
 
00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
them Sister Mary Joseph uh on River
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
works for riverend Behavioral Health
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
which will provide intensive outpatient
 
00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
services to people with a gambling
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
problem we've never had such a group
 
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
they're off for substance abuse and
 
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
that's very very effective so a person
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
early in recovery would go to a group
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
like that we also have developed the
 
00:30:31.389 --> 00:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
Pilot Course for clinicians peer
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
Specialists and that will which we will
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
be offering in May um we're going to do
 
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
that free of charge for the first pilot
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
program and then after that we'll be
 
00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
charging we're working with New
 
00:30:43.509 --> 00:30:43.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire alcohol and drug council's
 
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
associate to provide that training uh
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
and finally uh next week Tuesday is um
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
National screening day for problem
 
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
gambling uh we will be doing a public
 
00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:56.120 align:start position:0%
screening with all clients who attend
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
River Bend's Church behavioral health

screened for the presence of gambling we
 
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
provide that information to um hav
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
university the division of addiction
 
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:09.919 align:start position:0%
where they coordinate all that and
 
00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
finally we'll be addressing on the same
 
00:31:14.509 --> 00:31:14.519 align:start position:0%
day on Tuesday a grou group of guidance
 
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
councils from schools in New Hampshire
 
00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:17.919 align:start position:0%
regarding problem gambling especially
 
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
with adolescence tonight I thank you
 
00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:21.880 align:start position:0%
very much for your attention and I
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
welcome any questions you may have let
 
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
me start so you get you get ,000 from
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
the state correct for three years for
 
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
three years that ended okay and that
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
ended and the rest is you fundraise
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
sounds like the rest we have in what we
 
00:31:42.669 --> 00:31:42.679 align:start position:0%
had left in the bank balance wasn't an
 
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
awful lot we're projecting $30,000 in
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
revenue from jwood gaming we're
 
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
projecting $155,000 in revenue from uh
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
DraftKings as the third year of their
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
installment to every Council in the
 
00:31:59.230 --> 00:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
United States gets $15,000 a year threee
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
period from traffing so that was when
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
they get the NFL contract so last
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
meeting we had an interesting discussion
 
00:32:08.629 --> 00:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
about breakage and part of the statute
 
00:32:10.509 --> 00:32:10.519 align:start position:0%
when the historic racing machines came
 
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:13.240 align:start position:0%
in breakage was supposed to go to this
 
00:32:16.629 --> 00:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
fund this problem gambling fund um um we
 
00:32:18.669 --> 00:32:18.679 align:start position:0%
found out that one of the vendors isn't
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
contributing because they don't have
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
that in their software but let's just
 
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
say the other two are contributing so
 
00:32:27.629 --> 00:32:27.639 align:start position:0%
this money is going somewhere is what is
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
the leg is it that the legislature has
 
00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:32.200 align:start position:0%
not appropriated you any money because
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
can you
 
00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:36.559 align:start position:0%
please so when you identify a revenue
 
00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:39.519 align:start position:0%
Source you also have to identify um the
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
budget amount and so the budget amount
 
00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
is $250,000 for this fiscal year and the
 
00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
source is breakage last year it was
 
00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
100,000 and Source was breakage it
 
00:32:54.269 --> 00:32:54.279 align:start position:0%
exceeded last year's amount it's not
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
quite as much this year as the 200,000
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't matter we still will
 
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
contribute the amount that you folks
 
00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
dictated in the budget so it's one of
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
the so then why so then who spends this
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
money so right now there's been no
 
00:33:12.269 --> 00:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
expenditure this year that I'm aware of
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
from that
 
00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
funds the the amount of the $3,000 is
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
just I don't think it's been spent all
 
00:33:21.629 --> 00:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
right well so it's just sitting there
 
00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:23.559 align:start position:0%
yeah because the legislature in the
 
00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
budget process hasn't appropriated any
 
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
money to nope Money's been appropriated
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
and it's in the budget it's just the
 
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
there's been no expenditure which is is
 
00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
um Ed suggested I think four three years
 
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
ago when it was Health and Human
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
Services or four I think there was
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
800,000 in the account that was not
 
00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
expended at the end of the year if it's
 
00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
not expended it literally just rolls
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
into our transfer amount for the for the
 
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
transfer the education trust fund right
 
00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
because as unex because our well look
 
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
back at a second by the terms of the
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution the lottery revenues are
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
revenues minus expenses equals transfer
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
to education trust fund and the way this
 
00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
this is set up the responsible gambling
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
is an expense of the lottery and if
 
00:34:13.629 --> 00:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
there's no expenditure than it's
 
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
literary rolls as as a as a transfer
 
00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:20.359 align:start position:0%
right so yeah Senator so my question is
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you don't have a contract
 
00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
with the lottery so is it just a matter
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
of we need a contract executed in order
 
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
to expend those funds and we've let the
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
contract lapse and you already have the
 
00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:33.399 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority correct so it so the
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
contract is only administered by us it's
 
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
not we're by Design as you could imagine
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not in charge of responsible
 
00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:42.919 align:start position:0%
building in the state that would be very
 
00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:44.919 align:start position:0%
much a conflict with my job and so
 
00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
there's a separate uh Council that's
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
supposed to manage that function and so
 
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
at this point so follow so again I'm
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
going trying to get pragmatically where
 
00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
we're stuck at where the where theak
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
where the problem is right where the
 
00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
breakage is
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
but um the breaket broken and so right
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
now we have stats to authority to have
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
that allow to pay them to continue to
 
00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
service problem gambling in the state we
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
just don't have a executed contract from
 
00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
them to whether it's DS so the
 
00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
commission on problem gaming who would
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
authorize the contract correct and
 
00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
there's money in the account to do that
 
00:35:19.589 --> 00:35:19.599 align:start position:0%
yeah well it's not money in the account
 
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
it's literally just a budget it's a line
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
item for us but yes so Ed I think G
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
March quarters you know we need to work
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
on getting the contract to the
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
commission so they get help fund your
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
our some of our problem gaming well is
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
there anybody I'm going to there's one
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
more question over here I know but is
 
00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
there anybody else it sounds like you
 
00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
are the group that is doing something in
 
00:35:40.589 --> 00:35:40.599 align:start position:0%
this front in this state with a lot of
 
00:35:40.599 --> 00:35:42.109 align:start position:0%
this front in this state with a lot of
volunteers

00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
volunteers
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
yeah is there anybody else that you know
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
of that's doing what you folks are doing
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
I do not know of anybody else who in the
 
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.200 align:start position:0%
state that's doing it I mean other
 
00:35:52.349 --> 00:35:52.359 align:start position:0%
states have conss and they do work and
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
all that um we are two part-time people
 
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
uh Dr Bergen also works for riverband in
 
00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
conquer hospital um I work part-time we
 
00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:04.520 align:start position:0%

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
services I do most of the administrative
 
00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
recovery support and the helpline work I
 
00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
handle a helpline almost exclusively I
 
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
was just on ruber for a week and Dr
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
Bergen took it for uh the week and Ruba
 
00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
cost me Co I hadn't I had dodged Co for
 
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
three years I came back and get that but
 
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
Dr Bergen handle that we also have
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
somebody in the recovery program if I
 
00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
need somebody to take place on the
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
helpline they'll handle that call right
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
but other than that all the heline calls
 
00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
go through thank you well you have a
 
00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
question over here and
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
then yeah I want to thank Mr taler for
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
his testimony it was very good if if
 
00:36:41.109 --> 00:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
it'd be possible here to have your
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
prepared remarks given over to our to
 
00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
our secretary and sent out to all the
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
members here emailed yep we'll make that
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
happen yes can you get us a
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
representative I'm I'm just wondering
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
what whether this has to be looked at
 
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
through the RFP process I was gonna that
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
was my next question as well that's why
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
I was asking others out
 
00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:11.910 align:start position:0%
I was asking others out
there

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
um I would imagine it has to be Charlie
 
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:15.880 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at
 
00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
you it does yeah it has to be anytime
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
it's a state contract has to be a bid
 
00:37:21.119 --> 00:37:22.710 align:start position:0%
it's a state contract has to be a bid
process

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
so another question I know there are
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
several um National organizations that
 
00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
handle it for a lot of States um and
 
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
they're usually the ones who respond to
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
the rfbs as well so all right
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
thanks Senator thank
 
00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:43.079 align:start position:0%
you first of all thank you very much for
 
00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:45.640 align:start position:0%
your testimony appreciate it very much
 
00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:46.589 align:start position:0%
your testimony appreciate it very much
the

00:37:46.589 --> 00:37:46.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
15,000 that was allocated because of the
 
00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
the what the
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
NFL because of 15,000 yes DraftKings yes
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
now how how was that a who receives it
 
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:01.720 align:start position:0%
and how was it received each Council in
 
00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
the United States state Council in the
 
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:08.200 align:start position:0%
United States gets that gets $115,000
 
00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.190 align:start position:0%
United States gets that gets $115,000
from

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
DraftKings so there's no State
 
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
involvement in that at all go goes
 
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
directly into your account deposit in
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
your account you're giving the account
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
information actually it was the last two
 
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
years we got it in January we haven't
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
got it yet so I don't know whether Draft
 
00:38:26.309 --> 00:38:26.319 align:start position:0%
Kings isn't a little tight right now I
 
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
can't imagine that but uh but that
 
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
that's due uh but they give each Council
 
00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
in the United States
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
$15,000 is that just for three years the
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
contract was for three years and this is
 
00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
the third year of the contract they
 
00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
haven't said anything about going any
 
00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
further they um sent out a survey every
 
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
year what have you done with the money
 
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
what you know what suggestions do you
 
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
have and that we've responded to that
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
all the
 
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:53.720 align:start position:0%
time that that's like the uh you know I
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
heard at the last meeting that 211 New
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh was somehow going to take
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
over the help line that we with new
 
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
two11 New Hampshire since 2015 that they
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
have all our contact information
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
somebody calls with a problem gambling
 
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
and that uh they refer to us uh if I
 
00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
could just make one suggestion regarding
 
00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:14.589 align:start position:0%
could just make one suggestion regarding
the

00:39:14.589 --> 00:39:14.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:17.560 align:start position:0%
250,000 um I really think that kind of
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
money would be well spent if you could
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
develop a voluntary self-exclusion that
 
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
would cover the entire State we we're
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
not that PE those people we're not going
 
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
to create a database and maintain a
 
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
database and that it's going to be
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
somebody else and that's what I said and
 
00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
I sent a separate note to Charlie that
 
00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
we're doing the things that we know we
 
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
can do physically and financially and um
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
Vol especially you as a volunteers uh
 
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
we're not you know we're not mass
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
counselors we don't have a budget of
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
$3.6 million in addition they got the
 
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
office of problem gambling services that
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
has spent $7.8 million on uh prevention
 
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
and $1.9 million on treatment in the
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
last 10 years and I think that what was
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
that called Public Health Trust Fund or
 
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
something that they all had to pay into
 
00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:09.400 align:start position:0%
yeah it's like some
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
years yeah yeah I mean huge sums of
 
00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
money so when you say use the words
 
00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:19.839 align:start position:0%
state recognized who recognized you you
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
know what I mean you said you you were
 
00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:22.270 align:start position:0%
know what I mean you said you you were
state

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
recognized by DraftKings I mean but who
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
who what what makes you the state
 
00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:32.200 align:start position:0%
recognized to me that means something we
 
00:40:35.069 --> 00:40:35.079 align:start position:0%
had the existing Council and problem G
 
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
we it's because we had a council and
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
we're functioning as a council we got
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
that money right all right well
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
then I first want to say thank you for
 
00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
being here and I think back to my first
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
meeting you when I was working on the
 
00:40:58.829 --> 00:40:58.839 align:start position:0%
gaming commission at that time in 2013
 
00:41:02.349 --> 00:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
or 12 or somewhere around then and uh
 
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
you were doing the good work that you're
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
doing now then and it obviously carried
 
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
on with it so many thanks for you
 
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
impressed me so much then because I
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't believe a representative was
 
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
down in Massachusetts attending as many
 
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
functions regarding problem gaming I say
 
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
talk about doing your homework so thank
 
00:41:23.829 --> 00:41:23.839 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you um I think a big
 
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
part of the I think there's a big
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
problem here that's structural that we
 
00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
need to address um right now we have a I
 
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
believe it's titled Council for
 
00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
responsible gaming do I have that right
 
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
yeah you just pulled it up how about
 
00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
that Council responsible G it's RSA
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
338b so we so that's that's a
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
statutory uh state established Council
 
00:41:56.829 --> 00:41:56.839 align:start position:0%
and the members I believe are appointed
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
by the governor and council is that what
 
00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
it is right um and um and that's where
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
the money that's that's the result of
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
breakage or whatever else that comes out
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
of the state's treasury is uh going and
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
then for allocation out um there are
 
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
structural problems one Charlie alluded
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
to that it
 
00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
um it's independent is compromised and
 
00:42:31.309 --> 00:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
Charlie's put in a difficult position
 
00:42:34.549 --> 00:42:34.559 align:start position:0%
having it essentially in his office um
 
00:42:36.829 --> 00:42:36.839 align:start position:0%
and we need to think about how that
 
00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
might be restructured I've talked um on
 
00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
previous occasions with Charlie about
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
positioning at uh over at uh uh Health
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
and Human Services and maybe that would
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
make sense uh but we never really got to
 
00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
the point of being confident enough to
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
push that so we need to think that
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
through and um I think we'll be helped
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
it's very helpful to have the input from
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
Mr talet that we've gotten today but
 
00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
also I'd love to hear from massachusett
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
which is sort of at the other end of the
 
00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:18.839 align:start position:0%
spectrum and and they've had as part of
 
00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
their big gambling bill when they jumped
 
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
into BigTime gambling they had a
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Commission and allocated a
 
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
stream of money that's going into
 
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
respons responsible G gambling
 
00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
automatically as as gambling proceeds so
 
00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:37.240 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to learn I think from
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
their experience that goes into both
 
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
research as well as uh treatment and
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
prevention um and so uh we've got our
 
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
work to do and I hope we'll be able to
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
um both got a good handle on what the
 
00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
world that we living in has to offer
 
00:43:59.950 --> 00:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and then what we
 
00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
might be able to do in the last meeting
 
00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
I think we talked about this Council but
 
00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
it sounded like it's not a very active
 
00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:09.880 align:start position:0%
Council yeah right do I have that
 
00:44:12.109 --> 00:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
correct Senator delandre do you have you
 
00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
end up before yeah just to finish up I I
 
00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
think represent AES is correct we got we
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
have there's a council but it's it's
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
it's a known entity in essence really
 
00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
because you don't have much anybody
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
that's number one and and number two you
 
00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:32.079 align:start position:0%
haven't got any people how how the hell
 
00:44:34.589 --> 00:44:34.599 align:start position:0%
do you do it without anybody without any
 
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
people and and we gotta we we've talked
 
00:44:42.549 --> 00:44:42.559 align:start position:0%
about it but uh we we Haven it we have
 
00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
it delivered and and I think two things
 
00:44:48.589 --> 00:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
ought to be made clear to the
 
00:44:52.109 --> 00:44:52.119 align:start position:0%
public in Most states you have to be 21
 
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
to go into a casino in New Hampshire you
 
00:44:57.069 --> 00:44:57.079 align:start position:0%
have to be 18
 
00:44:57.079 --> 00:44:58.190 align:start position:0%
have to be 18
huge

00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
huge
 
00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
differential right there and and that's
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's something that we ought to look
 
00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
at because my in involvement in this
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
game has been for a long period of time
 
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
and what what supposedly is happening
 
00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
across the country is younger people are
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
becoming involved particularly at as
 
00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
sports betting has been has been opened
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
up and the phone the sports betting and
 
00:45:28.549 --> 00:45:28.559 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're 18 because I I I
 
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
believe in in our surrounding states
 
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
it's 21 am I correct are you
 
00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
correct I don't know whether you saw it
 
00:45:38.109 --> 00:45:38.119 align:start position:0%
but there was recently a story in the
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
Boston Globe where the director of the
 
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Council on compul gambling
 
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
noticed that her son had $50 withdrawals
 
00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
coming out regularly out of the bank 18
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
years old he was involved with three
 
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
other guys and they were betting Sports
 
00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
in New
 
00:45:56.349 --> 00:45:56.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and this is the sign of the
 
00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:00.200 align:start position:0%
person directing the mass Council so
 
00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
okay so it sounds like we have some work
 
00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:07.160 align:start position:0%
to do here on this one
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
um suggested next
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
step I to that point fundamentally it's
 
00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
an operational issue not really a
 
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
a uh we all agree that we should fix
 
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
this issue the problem is we've
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
allocated enough money to look at the
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
problem but fix the problem and
 
00:46:30.549 --> 00:46:30.559 align:start position:0%
technology is great in the sense of you
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
know in both of the bills we drafted one
 
00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
for the internet one for sports betting
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
we mandated voluntary self exclusion as
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
well as limits you can set your own
 
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
limits um and also the technology behind
 
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
DraftKings and our Lottery platform is
 
00:46:47.549 --> 00:46:47.559 align:start position:0%
if you call our call center and you use
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
words that are troubling we actually
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
disable your account so those type of
 
00:46:56.069 --> 00:46:56.079 align:start position:0%
programs are great the problem is I it's
 
00:46:57.870 --> 00:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
where people are physically in locations
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
we can't do stuff like that so we have
 
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
to do the fundamental things of at each
 
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
location have folks available to talk to
 
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
people if they have a problem because I
 
00:47:08.069 --> 00:47:08.079 align:start position:0%
think Mr tala would agree with me that
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
it's when an individual identifies thems
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
as a problem that's the time to approach
 
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
them it's it's not a call from a family
 
00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:15.400 align:start position:0%
member because the Burse is probably not
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
ready yet um and so it's going to stand
 
00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839 align:start position:0%
up sort of a an agency on its own either
 
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
reporting Health Human Services or
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
I'd rather not say this but if it has to
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
be us it has to be us and have some
 
00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
operational people stand up a program
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's in every location as part of a
 
00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:37.480 align:start position:0%
mandatory self- exclusion program that
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
the operators have to absorb and um
 
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
permit now I was going to digress a
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
little bit I'm G look at the two folks
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
from um the industry
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
so I know in the historic racing Bill we
 
00:47:57.549 --> 00:47:57.559 align:start position:0%
had something to do with uh um problem
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
gambling but it was um having a plan to
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
identify problem gamblers if I recall
 
00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
yeah I can answer that if you want sure
 
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
yeah there is a plan um uh it is
 
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:12.200 align:start position:0%
submitted to us and then our agency
 
00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
refuses it Audits and and confirms that
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
it's occurring and every building has
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
cleared that audit process okay so I'm
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
going to look at the the facilities and
 
00:48:27.069 --> 00:48:27.079 align:start position:0%
ask uh it's nice to have a plan but do
 
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
do have you referred any any problem
 
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
gamblers I guess is what I'm getting at
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
identified and and
 
00:48:34.829 --> 00:48:34.839 align:start position:0%
referred um I don't have the exact
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
counts off the top of my head um but I
 
00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:39.880 align:start position:0%
know we have a proactive problem gaming
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
plan um we have a volunteer self-
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
exclusions 25 or lifetime but again it's
 
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%
only our properties because there's no
 
00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
link database right there's no right um
 
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
and we put every um employee through uh
 
00:48:56.109 --> 00:48:56.119 align:start position:0%
problem gaming training when they start
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure they could recognize and
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
proactively approach and like your
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
dealers and so forth can identify every
 
00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:03.400 align:start position:0%
everyone food and beverage to across the
 
00:49:08.589 --> 00:49:08.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
similar our facility is very similar we
 
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
have a very similar plan and I think our
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
biggest hurdle is just catching them at
 
00:49:19.789 --> 00:49:19.799 align:start position:0%
the door because we can't scan those IDs
 
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
and so it's you have to recognize them
 
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
catch their name as they come in so I'd
 
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
say that's our biggest hurdle but we do
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
track them once they use the rewards
 
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
card we can go over and say you self-
 
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
excluded you know
 
00:49:37.069 --> 00:49:37.079 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
00:49:39.549 --> 00:49:39.559 align:start position:0%
look the watch okay we we got to move
 
00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
forward now very great thank you uh
 
00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:43.960 align:start position:0%
you've really spawn a lot of thought
 
00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
here that's um we're goingon to be
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
talking to you more over time as oh
 
00:49:50.589 --> 00:49:50.599 align:start position:0%
that's question yes
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
yes Mr tal thank you again for your
 
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm uh Mark Delano and
 
00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
assistant an attorney general department
 
00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
of justice uh maybe you know or perhaps
 
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
some of the industry folks on the on the
 
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
commission may know uh do the uh
 
00:50:07.549 --> 00:50:07.559 align:start position:0%
substance abuse uh treatment facilities
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
or Services here in New Hampshire or
 
00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:11.960 align:start position:0%
maybe in other states of New England
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
offer programs around problem gaming uh
 
00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
and if so does anyone know whether or
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
not that's covered by medical
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
insurance very true um most substance
 
00:50:27.549 --> 00:50:27.559 align:start position:0%
abuse facilities uh problem gamblers
 
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
most problem gamblers or 76% of problem
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
gamblers also have a substance use
 
00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
disarm um so it's comorbidity is a big
 
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
big problem um they're very similar in
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
their treatment um however slight
 
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
differences for example you wouldn't
 
00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:45.160 align:start position:0%
smoke another joint or drink another
 
00:50:46.589 --> 00:50:46.599 align:start position:0%
beer and figure that's going to solve
 
00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
all your problems the gaml thinks the
 
00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
next bet he makes is going to take every
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
care of everything everybody will love
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
him and of course that doesn't happen so
 
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
he spiral down or if he does win that
 
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
just reinforces the fact that keep
 
00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
gambling uh so the treatment is a little
 
00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
bit different uh any substance of use
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
clinician could see a client billing is
 
00:51:14.589 --> 00:51:14.599 align:start position:0%
what is difficult some will cover it
 
00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:17.480 align:start position:0%
it's recognized under dsm5 now as a
 
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
disease um the health care model is in
 
00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
place uh but it's usually tracked under
 
00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:24.839 align:start position:0%
behavioral help I know when I was
 
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
providing in massach that was a special
 
00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
behavioral health code that would signal
 
00:51:33.069 --> 00:51:33.079 align:start position:0%
the M the money was coming because we
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
gambl disorder U but a lot of private
 
00:51:40.589 --> 00:51:40.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:43.309 --> 00:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
yet I do have one more question you had
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned problem gamblers it's
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
Anonymous I don't know if that's the
 
00:51:50.829 --> 00:51:50.839 align:start position:0%
exact title so is it your organization
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
that runs those meetings or are there
 
00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:56.440 align:start position:0%
other anonymous groups out there all
 
00:51:57.870 --> 00:51:57.880 align:start position:0%
those organizations are run
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
independently each group is independent
 
00:52:02.109 --> 00:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
okay but there are others around the
 
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
state yes okay smart recovery is another
 
00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
one but the three gamblers and honorous
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
meetings are DOA Hamstead and Manchester
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you thank you very
 
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
much for your time and uh committee uh
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
commission members we we got we've got
 
00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:18.200 align:start position:0%
to think about what we want to do next
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
with this issue but we're got to move
 
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
forward on the agenda here so uh we have
 
00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:24.880 align:start position:0%

for my first time and Charlie why don't
 
00:52:54.789 --> 00:52:54.799 align:start position:0%
you just update us yeah so as I
 
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
described earlier that we were going to
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
do a survey of the childwood gambling um
 
00:53:02.109 --> 00:53:02.119 align:start position:0%
area and we're working with UNH uh that
 
00:53:02.119 --> 00:53:03.630 align:start position:0%
area and we're working with UNH uh that
went

00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
went
 
00:53:08.349 --> 00:53:08.359 align:start position:0%
out eight days ago 10 days ago and um
 
00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
could be the the link will be uh over
 
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
this week of the 800 Charities I think
 
00:53:18.069 --> 00:53:18.079 align:start position:0%
so far we have at least as of last
 
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
Wednesday we had 260 responses so I
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
would anticipate more than 300 responses
 
00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:25.480 align:start position:0%
total which obviously n equals 300 is a
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
valid survey sample size um the the
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
questions include both you know
 
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
percentage click boxes like there's four
 
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
choices choose one as well as open-ended
 
00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
questions where they can respond with a
 
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
word or two so um it was like I said it
 
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
was drafted with the help of unh Andy
 
00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:46.280 align:start position:0%
Smith and I'll forward you the survey
 
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
when I get back to my office I didn't
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
have time this morning to print 20
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
copies so I didn't and and his team and
 
00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
his team is going to reduce the data for
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
us too yeah well exactly yeah yeah and
 
00:53:58.190 --> 00:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
then he will his team will come here
 
00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:01.720 align:start position:0%
present the results okay sounds good any
 
00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
questions on that I I thought that was a
 
00:54:04.829 --> 00:54:04.839 align:start position:0%
little faster than going out to bid and
 
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
a contract and because we have a
 
00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:08.440 align:start position:0%
research budget and obviously Char
 
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
gambling is part of our operation so
 
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:12.760 align:start position:0%

the on the Sea Coast same as our school
 
00:56:14.349 --> 00:56:14.359 align:start position:0%
system and we've been at the lucky Mo
 
00:56:17.549 --> 00:56:17.559 align:start position:0%
now for a couple years and the process
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
has been extremely easy and without
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
without the money that we raised from
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
them we could not do the programs that
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
we do
 
00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:29.720 align:start position:0%
um we've been able in our area add on to
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
what we
 
00:56:34.109 --> 00:56:34.119 align:start position:0%
do this last couple years we've added on
 
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:35.720 align:start position:0%
fuel assistance for those in need we've
 
00:56:37.069 --> 00:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
been going to the schools and finding
 
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
out single moms and and we're able to
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
help 22 different charities 22 different
 
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
families last two years on Heating and
 
00:56:46.349 --> 00:56:46.359 align:start position:0%
and uh I think that made a big
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
difference we support food Charities uh
 
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
it goes on and on ey
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
glasses um different surgeries and
 
00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
fundraising is getting harder all the
 
00:56:58.589 --> 00:56:58.599 align:start position:0%
time out here and this this has just
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
made life so much easier and and the
 
00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
lucky mov alone there's over 17 Lions
 
00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:05.799 align:start position:0%
organizations and I know this some down
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
at the brook also and talking to them
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
it's just it's made an incredible
 
00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
difference in the communities that we
 
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
that we take care of the other group
 
00:57:17.789 --> 00:57:17.799 align:start position:0%
that I represent is the New Hampshire
 
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
police fire and EMS Foundation we're
 
00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
501c3 that was
 
00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
organized how about I think 06
 
00:57:28.829 --> 00:57:28.839 align:start position:0%
um that is an organization that helps
 
00:57:31.349 --> 00:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
First Responders in time of need not
 
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:33.880 align:start position:0%
mostly work rated uh sometimes if they
 
00:57:37.109 --> 00:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
run out of work as comp is one thing but
 
00:57:38.589 --> 00:57:38.599 align:start position:0%
uh we help with like right now we're
 
00:57:41.549 --> 00:57:41.559 align:start position:0%
doing a pro helping a family uh out
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
firefighter out of Milford he has a set
 
00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
of three-year-old twins one of them just
 
00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:48.200 align:start position:0%
came down with a very acute case of
 
00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
Leukemia and is going undergoing 32
 
00:57:53.349 --> 00:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
treatments down in Boston and he's
 
00:57:56.029 --> 00:57:56.039 align:start position:0%
unable to work and and without it is
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
without pay we have taken up that
 
00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
project and for the next several months
 
00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
we'll be paying a minimum of $1,500 to
 
00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:05.960 align:start position:0%
help keep that family afloat it's that
 
00:58:08.109 --> 00:58:08.119 align:start position:0%
type of thing that we do a lot of cancer
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
problems uh and the longer the
 
00:58:12.069 --> 00:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
foundation's been around the bigger the
 
00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
need we do do other fun fundraises but
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
at this time it see I like to say that
 
00:58:20.309 --> 00:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
everybody out there is chasing the same
 
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:21.640 align:start position:0%
dollar with businesses and there's only
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
so much they can do uh the paper prod
 
00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
process the state has put together has
 
00:58:27.789 --> 00:58:27.799 align:start position:0%
helped us
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
tremendously uh and before this last
 
00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
couple years I think my wife has been
 
00:58:33.630 --> 00:58:33.640 align:start position:0%
fingerprinted more times than anybody in
 
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
the state with the two organizations
 
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's streamlined it's easy the
 
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
people at the lucky Mose are very easy
 
00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:43.400 align:start position:0%
to deal with and basically at this point
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know what would what we would do
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
without the help that the state helped
 
00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:49.720 align:start position:0%
us with I think it was a wonderful idea
 
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
to partnership with the Charities on the
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
state's part portion thank you for this
 
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do is let all three
 
00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:56.680 align:start position:0%
speak first and then we're gonna ask
 
00:58:57.990 --> 00:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
questions so they can all answer the
 
00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.270 align:start position:0%
questions so they can all answer the
same

00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%

01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
the local people who live there
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
full-time you know want to participate
 
01:00:15.309 --> 01:00:15.319 align:start position:0%
in it and support
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
it and as we were doing that as they
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%

everything we suddenly realized the
 
01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
profound F profound need in the North
 
01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
country you know for access to medical
 
01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:35.720 align:start position:0%
care and we we knew there was one there
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
but a lot of our volunteers said you
 
01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
know we need to start a full-time
 
01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:43.480 align:start position:0%
program you know a marketing Angel
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
Flight doing community outreach
 
01:00:47.829 --> 01:00:47.839 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire State and we found
 
01:00:50.109 --> 01:00:50.119 align:start position:0%
people especially in the North Country
 
01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
felt much more comfortable it was Angel
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
FL New Hampshire so we incorp par the
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
angel FL of New Hampshire back in
 
01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
2006 and in 201 um 12 well we start a
 
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
relationship with SEO funding which was
 
01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
the original poker room as many of you
 
01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:11.960 align:start position:0%

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:13.390 align:start position:0%
probably remember and through uh 2012
through

01:01:13.390 --> 01:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
15,879 from them and then when they
 
01:01:25.109 --> 01:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
transition to the Brooke uh from 2021
 
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
through 2024 we received over
 
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
$329,000 so in total we received as of
 
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.270 align:start position:0%
 
$480,500

01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
$480,500
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%

allow allows people to access health
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
care now we have over 450 volunteer
 
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
Pilots so whatever pilot flies the
 
01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
flight he or she picks up the entire
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
cost of their own pocket we also have
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
two major airline Partners JetBlue and
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
Cape Air and they give us unlimited

positive space seats on their flights
 
01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:24.440 align:start position:0%
for our patients when need the weather
 
01:02:27.269 --> 01:02:27.279 align:start position:0%
or distance precludes us flying in
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
little airplanes now our planes like
 
01:02:32.829 --> 01:02:32.839 align:start position:0%
four to eight seed planes you know and
 
01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
we uh we' flown out of we and we still
 
01:02:38.029 --> 01:02:38.039 align:start position:0%
do of course fly out 13 Hampshire
 
01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:41.640 align:start position:0%

we have FL what's remarkable when we
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
were doing these statistics to present
 
01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
to you today that people coming from 105
 
01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
communities and our very very F I'd like
 
01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
to tell you a few stories about our
 
01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
patients and our very first two patients
 
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
was Lieutenant Commander Dave Hill he
 
01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:15.640 align:start position:0%
was in the US Coast guide he was based
 
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:18.559 align:start position:0%
at peas and his wife took the year and a
 
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
half old son down to Delaware to visit
 
01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:21.990 align:start position:0%
half old son down to Delaware to visit
her

01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
her
 
01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:25.000 align:start position:0%
parents and while they were in Delaware
 
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
the baby had a m massive seizure and was
 
01:03:30.269 --> 01:03:30.279 align:start position:0%
admitted to the ICU while she took their
 
01:03:34.349 --> 01:03:34.359 align:start position:0%
only car so he called an 800 number and
 
01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
heard about
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
us and we flew him on May 31st a very
 
01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
very first patient you know from peas
 
01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
down to Delaware the second patient was
 
01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire resident it was
 
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
eight-year-old Patrick carac out of
 
01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Patrick had had diagnosed
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
with a Glo blast J brain tumor
 
01:03:56.829 --> 01:03:56.839 align:start position:0%
and he was operated at the Elliott
 
01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
hospital and he did very well initially
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
and then it came back about a year and a
 
01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
half later and they referred him to Dana
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
Faber and the brigam he went there for
 
01:04:10.349 --> 01:04:10.359 align:start position:0%
treatment and then they said well
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
there's nothing more we can do you know
 
01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
but there's a new protocol a new
 
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
clinical trial at NIH in say to Maryland
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
well at this time his mother Sharon
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
called us Patrick was only eight
 
01:04:27.549 --> 01:04:27.559 align:start position:0%
and they had exhausted the family funds
 
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
you know between co-pays and deductibles
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
and mom and dad being out of work and
 
01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
this is what happens with patients we
 
01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:36.920 align:start position:0%
see that we
 
01:04:40.269 --> 01:04:40.279 align:start position:0%
fly so we flew Patrick eight times in a
 
01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
clinical trial to Bethesda Maryland you
 
01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:44.589 align:start position:0%
clinical trial to Bethesda Maryland you
know

01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:44.599 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that clinical trial did
 
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
not prove ous and and Patrick did pass a
 
01:04:53.950 --> 01:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
few months later but we have been able
 
01:04:57.069 --> 01:04:57.079 align:start position:0%
to to fly as I said you know people from
 
01:05:00.670 --> 01:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
106 communities thousands and thousands
 
01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
of Grant Staters you know to uh 93
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
medical centers throughout the United
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
States and in my handout I gave you on
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
the fact sheet you know just a sample of
 
01:05:16.269 --> 01:05:16.279 align:start position:0%
some of those medical centers from
 
01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
Memorial slone catering Children's
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
Research Hospital in Colorado Duke
 
01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
University Cleveland Clinic the Mayo
 
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
Clinic Kennedy ker Institute in
 
01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
Baltimore Maryland plus all the Boston
 
01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals and I we featured um little
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
Adam on the front
 
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
cover Adam a small child from berkline
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
and he suffers from uh oi osteogenesis
 
01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
in perfecta it's a very very rare
 
01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
disease that's incurable and we fly him
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
to the ker Center uh in Baltimore uh
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
currently um I I I included this picture
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
one of our Pilots took of um uh Morgan
 
01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
she's 33 years old and she lives in
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
London dery and she has a brain tumor
 
01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
and we're flying her daily to uh bring
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
him a Women's Hospital in Boston but she
 
01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
has to be there at a very very certain
 
01:06:19.069 --> 01:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
time exact time for her treatment and so
 
01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
with weather issues this winter and
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
freezing levels and even though the lack
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
of know we've had an issue with snow
 
01:06:28.349 --> 01:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
it's easier for her if we buy her an
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
Uber so we'll purchase an Uber ticket
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
and put her from London uh I think it's
 
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
to Manchester and then we put her on
 
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
conquer bus lines down to Boston so
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
whether someone needs a flight or they
 
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
need an an Uber lift uh to get to a
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
larger airport or if for some reason uh
 
01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
they can't fly because of medical
 
01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
reasons you know recent nervous surgery
 
01:06:58.910 --> 01:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
or cardiac surgery that's what we'll do

01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
I I remembered it and back on December
 
01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
9th and it's in your booklet
 
01:07:38.829 --> 01:07:38.839 align:start position:0%
2010 uh there was a patient his name was
 
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
Ken from St Louis

neither were a
 
01:08:13.269 --> 01:08:13.279 align:start position:0%
match and now they start this
 
01:08:16.669 --> 01:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
experimental National donor matching
 
01:08:18.189 --> 01:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
program through
 
01:08:20.669 --> 01:08:20.679 align:start position:0%
niage and when they put them in the
 
01:08:24.070 --> 01:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
database they found that the people in
 
01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
St Louis with a match for the New
 
01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.199 align:start position:0%

patient was a match for the person in St
 
01:08:34.189 --> 01:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
Louis but now how are we going to do
 
01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
this so this was the first in region
 
01:08:40.110 --> 01:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
paired kidney transplant in history of
 
01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:40.789 align:start position:0%
paired kidney transplant in history of
the

01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
country so Dr Tika called us and we had

01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
with the hospitals we made sure we had a
 
01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
good weather window window again because
 
01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
these are small planes you know and they
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
decided to meet in
 
01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh so both donors the kidneys
 
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%

next um so let's start with you Larry
 
01:15:40.189 --> 01:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
because you're you're the newcomer to
 
01:15:43.229 --> 01:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
this so how how did you find out about
 
01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming and um how difficult
 
01:15:49.950 --> 01:15:49.960 align:start position:0%
was it to get dates because there there
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
are Charities well the way it works now
 
01:15:55.149 --> 01:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
each each each of the facilities manages
 
01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
their own Charities that that come to
 
01:16:01.149 --> 01:16:01.159 align:start position:0%
them and there's no real centralized way
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
for you know we're all filled up go to
 
01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
go up to the lakes to have dates that's
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
something we need to work on on this
 
01:16:10.229 --> 01:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
commission but just I'm interested
 
01:16:12.189 --> 01:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
knowing because you're new new to the
 
01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
game like you said how did you first
 
01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
find out and how easy was it to get
 
01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
dates uh I first found out about this
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity when an Air Force I'm
 
01:16:23.629 --> 01:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
retired Air Force and and a retired that
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
I know in the area who's on our board uh
 
01:16:29.709 --> 01:16:29.719 align:start position:0%
for wi Arrow mentioned that at the Sea
 
01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
Coast a uh nonprofit he was associated
 
01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
with was uh part of this charitable
 
01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
gambling initiative and I said what what
 
01:16:42.189 --> 01:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
is that all about and he explained it to
 
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
me I picked up the phone and called The
 
01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region casino and Mr glot said
 
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
come in and see me how's 2:00 sound and
 
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
there you go and and that was it now I
 
01:16:59.550 --> 01:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
did however uh try for the leadership
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
program um someone said go to the bigger
 
01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
casinos there's more opportunity there
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
and more opportunity sounded like more
 
01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
money to me so um I did approach the
 
01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:13.639 align:start position:0%
brook the lady was very cordial and
 
01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
pleasant but she had no vacancies and I
 
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
approached uh Gate City Casino again
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
very nice but they had no vacancies so I
 
01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
went back to the well uh to uh Lakes
 
01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
Region Casino in Belmont fortunately he
 
01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%

01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
question for everybody okay hi uh
 
01:19:07.709 --> 01:19:07.719 align:start position:0%
representative Ames um we um I was very
 
01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
reluctant at first about going to a
 
01:19:12.910 --> 01:19:12.920 align:start position:0%
casino I had never been in a casino I
 
01:19:15.870 --> 01:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
don't gamble I uh we had a convention
 
01:19:19.629 --> 01:19:19.639 align:start position:0%
one time out in Las Vegas that I went to
 
01:19:21.149 --> 01:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
and I was very very uncomfortable
 
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
walking through the C you know to get to
 
01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
my room I I you know I just you know
 
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
that's not my scene you know um I've
 
01:19:35.229 --> 01:19:35.239 align:start position:0%
always kind of uh uh equated to you know
 
01:19:38.189 --> 01:19:38.199 align:start position:0%
the mafia gambling Crooks and stuff like
 
01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
that so it made me uncomfortable but
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
what was amazing as you just said the
 
01:19:45.910 --> 01:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
experience at the brook and going back
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
to the poker room with lari and the
 
01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
management there they have the most
 
01:19:53.149 --> 01:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
wonderful kindest committed people
 
01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
people and when we filled out our
 
01:19:58.270 --> 01:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
application and met with them it wasn't
 
01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
what can Angel flake do for them is what
 
01:20:03.149 --> 01:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
can they do for Angel Flight and the
 
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
citizens of Na Hampshire and I've gone
 
01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
up there a couple of times and when we
 
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
pick up the check once a year or I stop
 
01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
by to say hello and they give us a tour
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
at the
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
casino and their function rooms and
 
01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:17.560 align:start position:0%
stuff like that and they said if there's
 
01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
anything ever we can do for you like if
 
01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:23.000 align:start position:0%

01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%

01:20:33.629 --> 01:20:33.639 align:start position:0%
know get better do an event here or else
 
01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh nothing I I'm Blown Away by the
 
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
goodness the genuine goodness of the
 
01:20:40.510 --> 01:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
people and and the leadership of the
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
brook you know let me ask you follow up
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
on that so do you do you get uh are you
 
01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
10 days all at once or do you did they
 
01:20:51.070 --> 01:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
break it up five days and five days or 3
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
days and seven days or it's always been
 
01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh I think since the days of the poker
 
01:20:58.669 --> 01:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
room yeah it's 10 days all at once okay
 
01:21:00.430 --> 01:21:00.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I think maybe for their accounting
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
and you get that daunting paperwork they
 
01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
send you you know probably because the
 
01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's
 
01:21:10.189 --> 01:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
requirements you know so it's been 10
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
days okay Senator Lang thank you soorry
 
01:21:15.229 --> 01:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
I think a piece of the question I think
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative am had was you I
 
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
remember chable gaming when it was Monte
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
Carlo night right and they would set up
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
the tables and you'd play local golf
 
01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
course or something like that and the
 
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
charity would collect its funds and they
 
01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
tear it all back down but the oblig it
 
01:21:30.990 --> 01:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
was a similar obligation that the
 
01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
charity would help promote the Monte
 
01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:35.880 align:start position:0%

01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
comments um we were never asked I was
 
01:22:44.030 --> 01:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
never asked to promote anything about
 
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
the Lakes Region Casino um I did promote
 
01:22:50.110 --> 01:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
it to our alumni in the leadership
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
program we've got about 46 60 alumni now
 
01:22:57.629 --> 01:22:57.639 align:start position:0%
in the 25 years and U I sent out an
 
01:22:59.950 --> 01:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
email saying hey you know here are some
 
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
dates I explain what the charitable
 
01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
gaming rules were and uh how this was a
 
01:23:07.709 --> 01:23:07.719 align:start position:0%
benefit for us uh I don't know if any of
 
01:23:09.229 --> 01:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
them took advantage or not but that was
 
01:23:11.310 --> 01:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
the only promotion we did and it was
 
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:22.270 --> 01:23:22.280 align:start position:0%
okay questions um oh go to I think we've
 
01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.790 align:start position:0%
okay questions um oh go to I think we've
already

01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
yeah what I'm going to ask again we've
 
01:23:27.229 --> 01:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
gone over before but basically we have
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
three Charities here that without the
 
01:23:34.669 --> 01:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming am I correct in saying
 
01:23:36.149 --> 01:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
that most
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
organizations the go-getters if you want
 
01:23:40.510 --> 01:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:23:42.990 --> 01:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
organization if you have a fundraiser
 
01:23:44.430 --> 01:23:44.440 align:start position:0%
they're there they're devoting their
 
01:23:46.830 --> 01:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
time to that fundraiser again to really
 
01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
increase the funds but it's the same
 
01:23:52.709 --> 01:23:52.719 align:start position:0%
individuals who basically turn around
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
and provide the service or try to get
 
01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
the the basic program so that you're
 
01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
basically burning them out if you've got
 
01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
to go over and really put their activity
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
into the fundraising aspect where charel
 
01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
bit it sounds like you know that first
 
01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
yeah that that's a problem all clubs are
 
01:24:23.390 --> 01:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
having this it's the 8020 R 20% of the
 
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
people do most of the work they'll come
 
01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
for the fundraiser and it's it's just
 
01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
been a very difficult time on the
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
outside fundraising these days and I've
 
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
been doing it since 1991 for several
 
01:24:36.189 --> 01:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
different charities this has definitely
 
01:24:38.790 --> 01:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
made a difference to keep us active with
 
01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:39.590 align:start position:0%
made a difference to keep us active with
the

01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:41.790 --> 01:24:41.800 align:start position:0%
communities and and I would Echo those
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
remarks too you know you can't go to the
 
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
well too many times you know and if
 
01:24:47.550 --> 01:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
we're doing something in Vermont or
 
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
something like that someone's going to
 
01:24:51.310 --> 01:24:51.320 align:start position:0%
put on a third party small golf event
 
01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:54.199 align:start position:0%
for us you can't ask the same people to
 
01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
go out and get auction items for you for
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
everything you do you know you burn them
 
01:25:00.830 --> 01:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
out and people get tired and you can't
 
01:25:03.109 --> 01:25:03.119 align:start position:0%
keep hitting up uh everyone on your
 
01:25:05.229 --> 01:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
donor database oh would you attend this
 
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
would you attend that would you go to
 
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
this would you go to that you know
 
01:25:10.149 --> 01:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
pretty soon they'll just take us off
 
01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
their mailing list you know or uh you
 
01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
know especially emails and everything so
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
that's a challenge like you said we face
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
too um good still good morning good
 
01:25:24.189 --> 01:25:24.199 align:start position:0%
morning thank you for coming here this
 
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
morning um do you folks have excess
 
01:25:30.109 --> 01:25:30.119 align:start position:0%
funds or do you spend your budget every
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
year from Char
 
01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
gam we we spend pretty D I have to watch
 
01:25:39.189 --> 01:25:39.199 align:start position:0%
it real close as we get to the end of
 
01:25:43.109 --> 01:25:43.119 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year we're lucky if we CT
 
01:25:45.629 --> 01:25:45.639 align:start position:0%
$2,000 so um if you were to get
 
01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:47.719 align:start position:0%
additional funds If the ratio of
 
01:25:49.709 --> 01:25:49.719 align:start position:0%
profitability for chatable gambling were
 
01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
to increase would you be able to assist
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
more citizens absolutely positively yes
 
01:25:58.910 --> 01:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
yes uh and so there's unserved need
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
that's not met by your
 
01:26:05.070 --> 01:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
organizations because of funding yes and
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
let me just give can I give you an
 
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
example of that can I speak to that
 
01:26:10.510 --> 01:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
let's just say in the North Country uh
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
we all know when you get above the notch
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh weather changes and and wealth
 
01:26:18.229 --> 01:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
changes yeah a lot of times if we're
 
01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
trying to fly someone out of Berlin or
 
01:26:23.790 --> 01:26:23.800 align:start position:0%
clamont or something like that say down
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
to a Boston or New York hospital because
 
01:26:28.109 --> 01:26:28.119 align:start position:0%
they've been referred because of a new
 
01:26:31.109 --> 01:26:31.119 align:start position:0%
clinical trial and for us equity and
 
01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
access and healthare is Paramount you
 
01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:36.030 align:start position:0%
access and healthare is Paramount you
know

01:26:36.030 --> 01:26:36.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
and it's a different weather system up
 
01:26:42.109 --> 01:26:42.119 align:start position:0%
there as we all know so might try to
 
01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
plan a flight you know out of uh
 
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
Whitefield you know our Berlin but the
 
01:26:51.229 --> 01:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
weather precludes us from doing it and
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
so many times times um we'll give a
 
01:26:58.189 --> 01:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
person a um a gas guide yeah we'll send
 
01:27:01.109 --> 01:27:01.119 align:start position:0%
them a gas guide say for $100 for gas
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
can you drive from there you know down
 
01:27:06.669 --> 01:27:06.679 align:start position:0%
to conquer or to Manchester to a bigger
 
01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:09.400 align:start position:0%
airport or lonia where the weather is
 
01:27:11.709 --> 01:27:11.719 align:start position:0%
more conducive you know when we're not
 
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
going to have freezing levels at a th000
 
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
feet you know icing issues and stuff
 
01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:17.390 align:start position:0%
feet you know icing issues and stuff
like

01:27:17.390 --> 01:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:27:19.870 --> 01:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
that the other big problem we have which
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
we're working on right now is community
 
01:27:25.270 --> 01:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
Outreach I mean I if I had a $2 million
 
01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
budget just for New Hampshire for
 
01:27:29.790 --> 01:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
community outreach I'd go through it
 
01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
it's a hardest thing in the world for us
 
01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
to keep the word out there that we exist
 
01:27:36.189 --> 01:27:36.199 align:start position:0%
you've probably never even heard of us
 
01:27:39.550 --> 01:27:39.560 align:start position:0%
you know and so the need to do Outreach
 
01:27:41.950 --> 01:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
into the communities and not only to the
 
01:27:45.390 --> 01:27:45.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals but Town Halls police fire
 
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
Social Media newspapers I mean it's a
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
daunting task you know to do that so I I
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
wish we had triple the money we're
 
01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
getting from that the gaming you know
 
01:27:59.350 --> 01:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
it'd be a god what we're getting now is
 
01:28:02.189 --> 01:28:02.199 align:start position:0%
a godsend and we're extremely extremely
 
01:28:05.350 --> 01:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
blessed and grateful to have it because
 
01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
if we were to fly you once or a thousand
 
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
times it would never ever ever ever cost
 
01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
you a penny and we would never accept a
 
01:28:17.310 --> 01:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
donation from you if we were flying you
 
01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
some people not many you know would send
 
01:28:23.709 --> 01:28:23.719 align:start position:0%
a donation to us thank you for flying us
 
01:28:25.470 --> 01:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
and we send it right back to them we
 
01:28:27.390 --> 01:28:27.400 align:start position:0%
just void the check and we send it back
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
to them because this is our time to take
 
01:28:32.669 --> 01:28:32.679 align:start position:0%
care of you because people when they
 
01:28:36.030 --> 01:28:36.040 align:start position:0%
call us they're running out of money
 
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
they're running out of Hope and they're
 
01:28:40.350 --> 01:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
running out of time and because of the
 
01:28:42.910 --> 01:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
co-pays and the deductibles and the out
 
01:28:45.669 --> 01:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
of pocket pharmaceutical expenses now
 
01:28:48.149 --> 01:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
here's a new clinical trial or protocol
 
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
that could save their life but they just
 
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
can't get to it you know and that's what
 
01:28:56.990 --> 01:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
we commit representative said Thank you
 
01:28:59.109 --> 01:28:59.119 align:start position:0%
And and thank you all for your
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
testimony this commission's tasked with
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
a A list of things that we should look
 
01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
out and look at and weigh and I'm kind
 
01:29:10.590 --> 01:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
of curious as much as the perspective of
 
01:29:14.830 --> 01:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
the percentage that a gaming uh room
 
01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
brings in more of that percentage going
 
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
to Charities
 
01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
also um unlike what Dawn experienced
 
01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
with uh Lakes Region a lot of these
 
01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
operators have a lengthy list of
 
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
Charities that are in the queue looking
 
01:29:32.350 --> 01:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
for those dates and that's something
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
that we get calls about often enough I
 
01:29:37.950 --> 01:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
guess what I would wait to especially
 
01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
substantial component father of your
 
01:29:46.350 --> 01:29:46.360 align:start position:0%
your charity uh that's very well known
 
01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
if if we are tasked with whether
 
01:29:53.709 --> 01:29:53.719 align:start position:0%
to and I'm just theorizing here you know
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
out loud with a lottery system say
 
01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
drawing you know blanks for dates for
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
Charities and you've been a part of
 
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming on the Sea Coast for a
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
long time and a benefit and and the
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
charity and the endus is you know
 
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
listening to the testimony it's
 
01:30:15.189 --> 01:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
phenomenal but I guess how would you
 
01:30:18.629 --> 01:30:18.639 align:start position:0%
look at it as Charities as to how we
 
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
would deal with as a commission the
 
01:30:23.870 --> 01:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
problem of Equitable equitable
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
distribution would it be
 
01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
something um we should look at and you
 
01:30:31.390 --> 01:30:31.400 align:start position:0%
also said you'd love to have three times
 
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
as much money I'm sure every charity
 
01:30:36.189 --> 01:30:36.199 align:start position:0%
would would love to have that but we're
 
01:30:38.350 --> 01:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
we we kind of have a quandry in that
 
01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
there are a lengthy list of
 
01:30:43.629 --> 01:30:43.639 align:start position:0%
Charities that are looking to get entry
 
01:30:47.709 --> 01:30:47.719 align:start position:0%
into this availability uh I'm involved
 
01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:51.560 align:start position:0%
with some in Salem many of them um and I
 
01:30:54.270 --> 01:30:54.280 align:start position:0%
I guess what's your perspective how
 
01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
should we view this should we should we
 
01:30:59.870 --> 01:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
be looking at maybe from 10 days to 3
 
01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
days or six days per charity to
 
01:31:06.430 --> 01:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
distribute that uh
 
01:31:09.109 --> 01:31:09.119 align:start position:0%
Revenue in a in a different fashion I
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
guess uh what would your input be should
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
should we look at a lottery system
 
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
should we look at you know the national
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
profile of a charity or the state
 
01:31:18.550 --> 01:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
profile of a
 
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
charity we're going to have that issue
 
01:31:23.709 --> 01:31:23.719 align:start position:0%
at the table and it's something that
 
01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
maybe some of your and and you're
 
01:31:27.189 --> 01:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
representing you know a number of
 
01:31:29.950 --> 01:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
different charities but your input May
 
01:31:31.709 --> 01:31:31.719 align:start position:0%
weigh in here and it's and it's a real
 
01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
problem that there's going to have to be
 
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
some equitable distribution of these
 
01:31:38.669 --> 01:31:38.679 align:start position:0%
funds to Charities and I know
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
everybody's protective of their own
 
01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
Charities but how would you suggest we
 
01:31:47.950 --> 01:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
subject well um if I could answer maybe
 
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
one of the first things now I have not
 
01:31:57.709 --> 01:31:57.719 align:start position:0%
had time to think of this right so this
 
01:32:01.109 --> 01:32:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
head I guess I W want look at the length
 
01:32:05.669 --> 01:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
of time charity has been involved with
 
01:32:07.629 --> 01:32:07.639 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming in the
 
01:32:11.109 --> 01:32:11.119 align:start position:0%
State uh the funds they've been
 
01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
receiving and how those funds impact the
 
01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
delivery of services by the
 
01:32:18.510 --> 01:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
charity and
 
01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
the the depth of impact that charity is
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
making for granite
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
status and are we talking
 
01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
about uh giving XM my dolls to
 
01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
say Friends of the library you know and
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
twin you know what impact what need do
 
01:32:41.629 --> 01:32:41.639 align:start position:0%
they have and what impact is that going
 
01:32:46.030 --> 01:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
to have in people's lives so being in
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
healthc care all my life and Healthcare
 
01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
Ministry we're talking about people's
 
01:32:54.109 --> 01:32:54.119 align:start position:0%
lives as far as we're
 
01:32:57.310 --> 01:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
concerned and 40% of the people we fly
 
01:32:59.910 --> 01:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
are children and of course the rest are
 
01:33:02.669 --> 01:33:02.679 align:start position:0%
adults and none of these are frivolous
 
01:33:06.750 --> 01:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
flights you know probably 80% of the
 
01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
people suffering from cancers and
 
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
different types of cancers are rear
 
01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
diseases and if because of the
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
relationship we have with the brook and
 
01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
this commission and the philosophy of
 
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
the state we can save hundreds and
 
01:33:27.229 --> 01:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
thousands of people's lives a year and
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
over time and bring them a level of hope
 
01:33:31.149 --> 01:33:31.159 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
unimaginable before they knew about us
 
01:33:37.149 --> 01:33:37.159 align:start position:0%
to me that's the test on the value of
 
01:33:37.159 --> 01:33:39.669 align:start position:0%
to me that's the test on the value of
charitable

01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
charitable
 
01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
giving just a follow up and and I
 
01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
understand appreciate and agree with you
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
but here's the problem here's the
 
01:33:51.149 --> 01:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
quandry I need what I'm looking from you
 
01:33:54.189 --> 01:33:54.199 align:start position:0%
for from you
 
01:33:57.070 --> 01:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
is something's going to change I'm not
 
01:33:58.750 --> 01:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
saying that's going to but in this
 
01:34:00.910 --> 01:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
scenario something's going to
 
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
change less dates the possibility of
 
01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
having no
 
01:34:09.629 --> 01:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
dates how do we choose charities in a a
 
01:34:12.270 --> 01:34:12.280 align:start position:0%
structured format and and you've already
 
01:34:16.470 --> 01:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
answered some of that what's our best
 
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
Avenue to approach this because I'm I'm
 
01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
not sure and we can probably get it from
 
01:34:24.109 --> 01:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
the oper is as to how many Charities are
 
01:34:26.109 --> 01:34:26.119 align:start position:0%
in the queue and I can tell you this
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
that you're you're uh in nashwa but your
 
01:34:32.510 --> 01:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
Charities aren't based in
 
01:34:35.390 --> 01:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
nsha all over
 
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
okay I'm I'm aware of many Charities
 
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
that that partake in towns that they're
 
01:34:44.270 --> 01:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
not based in because there's not a
 
01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
terriable gaming room in every town some
 
01:34:49.070 --> 01:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
towns or some rooms will favor the
 
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
Charities because they're in that town
 
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm looking for you to give us a
 
01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
little input usable input as to where's
 
01:34:59.950 --> 01:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
the god rails and where where should we
 
01:35:01.229 --> 01:35:01.239 align:start position:0%
stay as
 
01:35:04.750 --> 01:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
legislators in in in placing those God
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
rails because it's brought up many many
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
times to us that uh it's not necessarily
 
01:35:15.550 --> 01:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
fair and and you also testified to and I
 
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
have it in in the rooms that are in
 
01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
Salem that have been there since
 
01:35:22.030 --> 01:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
Inception Charities that have been
 
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
the Legacy Charities since the the
 
01:35:27.109 --> 01:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
beginning of charitable gaming some
 
01:35:29.070 --> 01:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
would argue well they they've had their
 
01:35:32.189 --> 01:35:32.199 align:start position:0%
share well is that necessarily Fair too
 
01:35:34.830 --> 01:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
we we need some real answers some real
 
01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
honest discussions from the Charities
 
01:35:38.590 --> 01:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
and every like I said everyone's going
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
to defend their own but what what's the
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
best way give us a little input on that
 
01:35:45.669 --> 01:35:45.679 align:start position:0%
from that perspective let me because I
 
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
had a similar kind of a thing so so when
 
01:35:50.350 --> 01:35:50.360 align:start position:0%
we did the historic Racing We doubled
 
01:35:51.709 --> 01:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
the number of Charities that involed now
 
01:35:53.590 --> 01:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
there's two dates it used to be one date
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
now there's two dates so we were able to
 
01:35:56.910 --> 01:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
double does your room have historic
 
01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:57.790 align:start position:0%
double does your room have historic
racing

01:35:57.790 --> 01:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
racing
 
01:36:00.669 --> 01:36:00.679 align:start position:0%
yet historic racing yes they do they do
 
01:36:03.870 --> 01:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
B has social they all three have racing
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
so here's the issue some of these places
 
01:36:10.990 --> 01:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
are growing and growing Brook big right
 
01:36:13.709 --> 01:36:13.719 align:start position:0%
so I'm sure you're reaching 100,000 no
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
problem in your 10
 
01:36:19.390 --> 01:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
days um you know and as these places
 
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
grow and some of the other ones that are
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
smaller are are adding and growing as
 
01:36:26.109 --> 01:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
well so is there a is there going to be
 
01:36:29.709 --> 01:36:29.719 align:start position:0%
a sealing of the dollar amount because
 
01:36:31.510 --> 01:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
the Dilemma of us doing something
 
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
drastic is that a lot of these Charities
 
01:36:36.070 --> 01:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
are dependent on this money now it to
 
01:36:38.189 --> 01:36:38.199 align:start position:0%
try to wean them off this money it's
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
very very hard so we have to be aware of
 
01:36:45.070 --> 01:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
that too so but I the way I'm thinking
 
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
is we we we may have to put a cap on as
 
01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
these some of these places grow and grow
 
01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
if they're going to double their
 
01:36:52.950 --> 01:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
business business in three years does
 
01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
that mean that the Charities do we go to
 
01:36:58.229 --> 01:36:58.239 align:start position:0%
three Charities you know based on you
 
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
know you know I'm big on trying to
 
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
protect even when we did the the two
 
01:37:05.669 --> 01:37:05.679 align:start position:0%
dates we we we we took care of trying to
 
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
the Legacy Charities to try to make sure
 
01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
they didn't lose too much when during
 
01:37:10.510 --> 01:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
that transition
 
01:37:14.430 --> 01:37:14.440 align:start position:0%
period so I mean would would if we were
 
01:37:16.990 --> 01:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
to say to you you know out of this
 
01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
commission you know we're going to we're
 
01:37:20.830 --> 01:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
going to put a ceiling on it but not
 
01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
hurt you
 
01:37:24.629 --> 01:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
where you are I mean so that other
 
01:37:27.070 --> 01:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
Charities could participate would that
 
01:37:29.830 --> 01:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
be a reasonable thing to do I think it
 
01:37:35.109 --> 01:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
would be I do too because that way uh we
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
could uh and there's no greed you could
 
01:37:41.310 --> 01:37:41.320 align:start position:0%
tell by that no I mean that way you can
 
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
plan on for your budget purposes you
 
01:37:48.510 --> 01:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
know usually how much You' get in that
 
01:37:51.589 --> 01:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
year right so you ought to put to help
 
01:37:53.709 --> 01:37:53.719 align:start position:0%
additional New Hampshire Charities uh
 
01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
that would be seem very reasonable given
 
01:37:57.390 --> 01:37:57.400 align:start position:0%
the number of of locations we have in
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
Hopper that could potentially
 
01:38:03.390 --> 01:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
open uh they you know there's going to
 
01:38:04.510 --> 01:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
be opportunity and some of these are
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
going to grow bigger and bigger um and
 
01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
that basically the way to handle this is
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
grow basically growing more
 
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue then we can cap those you know
 
01:38:19.030 --> 01:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
to a reasonable amount um and then and
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
then use the rest to maybe give to
 
01:38:24.669 --> 01:38:24.679 align:start position:0%
create more dates you know for for other
 
01:38:27.470 --> 01:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
Charities yeah we had uh one of our
 
01:38:29.790 --> 01:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
volunteers one of our Earth Angels our
 
01:38:30.990 --> 01:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
ground crew
 
01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
drivers um who lives in the Nash area
 
01:38:36.990 --> 01:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
came to me and says gee there a I forget
 
01:38:40.589 --> 01:38:40.599 align:start position:0%
was in Nash or some other Casino I never
 
01:38:42.669 --> 01:38:42.679 align:start position:0%
heard of you know I told them all about
 
01:38:46.030 --> 01:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
Angel Flight and they' like to off you a
 
01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
week for travel gambling but when they
 
01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
knew we were getting the Mone from the
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
BR they couldn't do it because they said
 
01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
you can only have one a 10day period a
 
01:39:00.990 --> 01:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
year yeah okay any other real okay sure
 
01:39:02.229 --> 01:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
good morning gentlemen thank you so much
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
for your testimony I'm Mark Delano
 
01:39:05.589 --> 01:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
Assistant Attorney General at the
 
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice as you can imagine
 
01:39:10.189 --> 01:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
our department is interested in things
 
01:39:12.310 --> 01:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
like accounting and accountability and
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
so I have a question for each of you
 
01:39:16.030 --> 01:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
it's a kind of a two-part question first
 
01:39:19.310 --> 01:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
part is how do you uh treat the monies
 
01:39:21.390 --> 01:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
that come in from charitable gaming on
 
01:39:23.470 --> 01:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
your books do they come in as just a
 
01:39:26.470 --> 01:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
general donation or do you track them as
 
01:39:28.950 --> 01:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
charitable Gaming revenue in some way
 
01:39:32.669 --> 01:39:32.679 align:start position:0%
and second part um are you able to track
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
the dollars that come in from charitable
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
gaming and see it applied to your
 
01:39:40.149 --> 01:39:40.159 align:start position:0%
various programs as opposed to things
 
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:46.990 align:start position:0%
 
administration

01:39:46.990 --> 01:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
administration
 
01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
well a little difficult to answer but
 
01:39:51.629 --> 01:39:51.639 align:start position:0%
when we have different fundraisers in
 
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
our alliance club for example and we we
 
01:39:57.109 --> 01:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
have a very said budget income and
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
expenses uh I our Treasurer and
 
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
secretary do a great job reporting it
 
01:40:04.669 --> 01:40:04.679 align:start position:0%
back to the state so it does go on our
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
our books as terrible gaming auction
 
01:40:09.229 --> 01:40:09.239 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be and then we have a
 
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
budget that basically
 
01:40:14.589 --> 01:40:14.599 align:start position:0%
just uh we vote on what we're going to
 
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
spend through the course of the year and
 
01:40:19.390 --> 01:40:19.400 align:start position:0%
part of gaming where we did make a lot
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
more we we took a like $115,000 of what
 
01:40:24.629 --> 01:40:24.639 align:start position:0%
we made and gave it right to right to
 
01:40:26.669 --> 01:40:26.679 align:start position:0%
fuel assistance so at the end of the
 
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
year we can tell you every dime that we
 
01:40:30.990 --> 01:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
spent on every charity that it came in I
 
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
can't say that that we
 
01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
Mark uh okay all the gaming money we we
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
pay for this because it does kind of go
 
01:40:40.830 --> 01:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
into general fund with other budgets
 
01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
with with other
 
01:40:46.270 --> 01:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
fundraises as far as the Ang perspective
 
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
too it's pretty much the same thing you
 
01:40:49.750 --> 01:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
know we uh have a very
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
sophisticated uh system of
 
01:40:53.149 --> 01:40:53.159 align:start position:0%
accountability and you know we're a
 
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
fourstar charity on charity Navigator
 
01:41:00.270 --> 01:41:00.280 align:start position:0%
and as donations come in our accountant
 
01:41:03.750 --> 01:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
our our external CPA and our internal a
 
01:41:06.990 --> 01:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
bookkeeper has a chat of accounts and is
 
01:41:10.510 --> 01:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
it a general donation is it a Beque is
 
01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
it a income from our annual appeal uh is
 
01:41:18.589 --> 01:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
it money from an event you know uh
 
01:41:21.229 --> 01:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
that's how we categorize the Monies and
 
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
then 100% of our monies go to program
 
01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
services so we need to recruit Pilots so
 
01:41:30.750 --> 01:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of them is pilot Recruitment and
 
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
training and you know maintaining their
 
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
resources to make sure that they're
 
01:41:38.270 --> 01:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
current they meet the FAA standards they
 
01:41:41.430 --> 01:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
meet our standards um that they're safe
 
01:41:44.270 --> 01:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
to fly you know people and their
 
01:41:46.709 --> 01:41:46.719 align:start position:0%
families so I think pilot resource
 
01:41:49.070 --> 01:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
management is very very key for us a
 
01:41:53.109 --> 01:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
community outreach uh into the area um
 
01:41:55.070 --> 01:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
and also flight Mission coordination
 
01:41:57.310 --> 01:41:57.320 align:start position:0%
because we have several full-time people
 
01:42:00.070 --> 01:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
the 24 hours a day answer the phone and
 
01:42:02.589 --> 01:42:02.599 align:start position:0%
coordinate all these flights and we have
 
01:42:02.599 --> 01:42:03.589 align:start position:0%
coordinate all these flights and we have
found

01:42:03.589 --> 01:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
found
 
01:42:06.510 --> 01:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
ourselves this past year um more
 
01:42:08.510 --> 01:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
recently spending thousands of dollars
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
that we did not anticipate on buying
 
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
people airline tickets you know when
 
01:42:17.070 --> 01:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
Jeff blue doesn't fly that route or the
 
01:42:20.229 --> 01:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
weather is too bad for our Pilots uh and
 
01:42:23.189 --> 01:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
pilot of ability is a crucial thing for
 
01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
us you know 10 years ago we had 1,200
 
01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
volunteer pilots and now we're down to
 
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
450 uh a lot of people have gotten out
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
of flying especially around Co when they
 
01:42:37.350 --> 01:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
you know they lost their jobs and they
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
had to cut back in their expenses or
 
01:42:41.550 --> 01:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
they have two kids or three kids in
 
01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:43.709 align:start position:0%
they have two kids or three kids in
college

01:42:43.709 --> 01:42:43.719 align:start position:0%
college
 
01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
now they first stop Flying for us they
 
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
were all in grar school they didn't have
 
01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
these college expenses
 
01:42:55.149 --> 01:42:55.159 align:start position:0%
so um it's just like the lady from uh
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
London der you know we're giving her
 
01:42:59.830 --> 01:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
money we pay for an Uber and then we pay
 
01:43:01.950 --> 01:43:01.960 align:start position:0%
for a bus trip yeah but I think I think
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
the question really was about the
 
01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
process that you go through yeah so we
 
01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
have a very sophisticated process it's
 
01:43:08.669 --> 01:43:08.679 align:start position:0%
very detailed and you know highly
 
01:43:13.870 --> 01:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
accountable right you follow up well
 
01:43:17.350 --> 01:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
after we're not very sophisticated uh I
 
01:43:19.870 --> 01:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
enter it in the bank account we have two
 
01:43:21.870 --> 01:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
accounts I enter it into the bank
 
01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
account as a donation for example
 
01:43:27.270 --> 01:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
payment number one Lakes Region Casino
 
01:43:29.669 --> 01:43:29.679 align:start position:0%
charity gaming and I entered the dollar
 
01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:32.360 align:start position:0%
amount in the account but then I share
 
01:43:35.229 --> 01:43:35.239 align:start position:0%
with our board obviously how we're doing
 
01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
and what that was and we immediately
 
01:43:42.629 --> 01:43:42.639 align:start position:0%
look at scholarships uh for uh either
 
01:43:44.030 --> 01:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
people coming into the leadership
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
program or for the students whose
 
01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
families simply can't afford the summer
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
camp the stem summer so we in our heads
 
01:43:57.229 --> 01:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
earmarked that funding for
 
01:44:00.430 --> 01:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
scholarships follow up follow up so you
 
01:44:02.790 --> 01:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
know just based on the operations that
 
01:44:06.669 --> 01:44:06.679 align:start position:0%
you folks work with or oversee um what
 
01:44:09.270 --> 01:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
are your thoughts on if the state
 
01:44:12.669 --> 01:44:12.679 align:start position:0%
required some kind of report uh from
 
01:44:15.870 --> 01:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
each of your Charities that uh listed on
 
01:44:18.070 --> 01:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
it where all of the charitable Gaming
 
01:44:20.350 --> 01:44:20.360 align:start position:0%
revenue went is that something that
 
01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
would be I guess offensive to your
 
01:44:24.629 --> 01:44:24.639 align:start position:0%
Charities would it be something that
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
would be difficult to produce or create
 
01:44:30.149 --> 01:44:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
burden well it would
 
01:44:37.229 --> 01:44:37.239 align:start position:0%
if uh I labor over that annual report
 
01:44:39.149 --> 01:44:39.159 align:start position:0%
and uh thankfully my wife has an
 
01:44:41.070 --> 01:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
accounting background and we have a
 
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
calculator so we bang it out together uh
 
01:44:46.629 --> 01:44:46.639 align:start position:0%
but yeah it would be it would be
 
01:44:48.709 --> 01:44:48.719 align:start position:0%
burdensome but I understand
 
01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
accountability and if the state required
 
01:44:54.910 --> 01:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
that we obviously would comply but it it
 
01:44:57.189 --> 01:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
would be we're all volunteers none of us
 
01:45:00.270 --> 01:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
gets a paycheck from the organization so
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh but it it would be a little bit of a
 
01:45:04.350 --> 01:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
burden but time
 
01:45:06.669 --> 01:45:06.679 align:start position:0%
consuming as far as Angel Flight goes
 
01:45:09.510 --> 01:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
we're used to that uh we have to give
 
01:45:13.390 --> 01:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
detailed reports to Jeff blue on all the
 
01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
vouchers used the patients names the
 
01:45:18.910 --> 01:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
ticket numbers the traveling uh we have
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
a large partnership with Lexi
 
01:45:23.790 --> 01:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical on rare disease patients
 
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh that they give us funding for lodging
 
01:45:27.950 --> 01:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
Transportation stuff like that so we
 
01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
have to give them extremely detailed
 
01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
reports and also the main Cancer
 
01:45:34.750 --> 01:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
Foundation so we have to detail where
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
where we spend every penny so it would
 
01:45:40.189 --> 01:45:40.199 align:start position:0%
be another report but if you we'd be
 
01:45:42.109 --> 01:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
happy to adore
 
01:45:44.830 --> 01:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
it I guess I'll Echo the other two it's
 
01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
it's something that I don't think we
 
01:45:47.470 --> 01:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
would like to see happen but if it did
 
01:45:49.390 --> 01:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
we could definitely cope with it with
 
01:45:51.310 --> 01:45:51.320 align:start position:0%
other other fundraisers is coming in we
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
just have to be more careful how we
 
01:45:56.109 --> 01:45:56.119 align:start position:0%
separate it and and what we amark what
 
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
do okay any other
 
01:46:05.629 --> 01:46:05.639 align:start position:0%
questions see none more thank you three
 
01:46:07.229 --> 01:46:07.239 align:start position:0%
of you very much thank you everybody
 
01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate very helpful thank you so
 
01:46:10.510 --> 01:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
very much and if we can ever be of help
 
01:46:13.470 --> 01:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
to you guys like you know representative
 
01:46:15.189 --> 01:46:15.199 align:start position:0%
said un answering some of those
 
01:46:16.709 --> 01:46:16.719 align:start position:0%
questions you know if you sent us
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
something we' do our best to respond to
 
01:46:21.189 --> 01:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
you uh in writing
 
01:46:21.199 --> 01:46:22.149 align:start position:0%
you uh in writing
you

01:46:22.149 --> 01:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:46:26.109 --> 01:46:26.119 align:start position:0%
know thank you thank you very much so
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to do a little speed dating
 
01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
here uh the next three items just to
 
01:46:33.669 --> 01:46:33.679 align:start position:0%
keep the discussion going on on the on
 
01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
the breakage discussion I'm still not
 
01:46:39.910 --> 01:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
comfortable that one one of the vendors
 
01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:40.830 align:start position:0%
comfortable that one one of the vendors
is

01:46:40.830 --> 01:46:40.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:46:44.109 --> 01:46:44.119 align:start position:0%
not contributing to the
 
01:46:46.830 --> 01:46:46.840 align:start position:0%
fund uh so we I still think we need to
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
come up with a solution to that um I
 
01:46:52.910 --> 01:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
know some said well the money's but it's
 
01:46:54.070 --> 01:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
but the Charities are getting the money
 
01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
or whatever but I think if if we have a
 
01:46:58.030 --> 01:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
process we should everybody should be
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
abiding about the same
 
01:47:01.870 --> 01:47:01.880 align:start position:0%
process you know and may maybe we just
 
01:47:03.790 --> 01:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
say we get rid of the breakage part and
 
01:47:07.070 --> 01:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
and uh and then this other other states
 
01:47:10.910 --> 01:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
charge the uh equipment people a fee to
 
01:47:12.870 --> 01:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
do business in the state we don't we
 
01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
really don't do that right a little bit
 
01:47:17.910 --> 01:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
little teeny bit no um manufacturers
 
01:47:20.430 --> 01:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
don't pay a few whatsoever and certainly
 
01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
I've talked to the manufacturer one
 
01:47:25.109 --> 01:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
specifically and they'd be happy to pay
 
01:47:27.589 --> 01:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
a fee versus change their programming uh
 
01:47:29.950 --> 01:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
and I think fundamentally I think it
 
01:47:31.870 --> 01:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
makes more sense to do away with
 
01:47:33.629 --> 01:47:33.639 align:start position:0%
breakage and charge a manufacturers
 
01:47:35.709 --> 01:47:35.719 align:start position:0%
annual fee but that's that's a
 
01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
legislative fix yep senator look the
 
01:47:40.510 --> 01:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
quau is going to be this I think
 
01:47:42.589 --> 01:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
challenge a you're going to have more
 
01:47:44.910 --> 01:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
and more machines so the breakage
 
01:47:46.229 --> 01:47:46.239 align:start position:0%
numbers are going to increase quite
 
01:47:48.229 --> 01:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
dramatically the more machines you have
 
01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
the more add of the breakage so it seem
 
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
to me that the fee makes
 
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
sense because everybody would be paying
 
01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
this paying the same it's it's how you
 
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
going to establish the the fee I think
 
01:48:02.589 --> 01:48:02.599 align:start position:0%
is is the key item the only thing you
 
01:48:05.790 --> 01:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
have to go on is what's happened prior
 
01:48:08.229 --> 01:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
prior to In terms in terms of the
 
01:48:10.589 --> 01:48:10.599 align:start position:0%
breakage for those who who represent it
 
01:48:13.149 --> 01:48:13.159 align:start position:0%
now Visa those that that don't but
 
01:48:14.830 --> 01:48:14.840 align:start position:0%
breakage is a very
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
significant player in this game
 
01:48:19.510 --> 01:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
particularly as you add more and more of
 
01:48:22.470 --> 01:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
the historic RAC machines
 
01:48:25.470 --> 01:48:25.480 align:start position:0%
right that's I
 
01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:27.709 align:start position:0%
right that's I
an

01:48:27.709 --> 01:48:27.719 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
okay again so yeah I think this is an
 
01:48:33.189 --> 01:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
either or kind of situation conversation
 
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
we either do away with breakage as a
 
01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
whole and either charge them either a
 
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
flat fee or a percentage of dgr
 
01:48:41.229 --> 01:48:41.239 align:start position:0%
percentage of handle and that would if
 
01:48:43.229 --> 01:48:43.239 align:start position:0%
we did a percentage of dgr percentage of
 
01:48:45.550 --> 01:48:45.560 align:start position:0%
handle that would adapt based on the
 
01:48:47.790 --> 01:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
size the industry grows um and the
 
01:48:49.629 --> 01:48:49.639 align:start position:0%
number as we have more machines and more
 
01:48:51.390 --> 01:48:51.400 align:start position:0%
things I'm not sure we're really talking
 
01:48:53.030 --> 01:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
about machines because breakage is
 
01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
generally out of um yeah so um but again
 
01:49:00.629 --> 01:49:00.639 align:start position:0%
if as a as that industry grows and we
 
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
know that money goes to problem gaming
 
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
that money would grow to go to problem
 
01:49:07.870 --> 01:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
gaming um and I I you know I'm just not
 
01:49:09.229 --> 01:49:09.239 align:start position:0%
sure if the answer is percentage of
 
01:49:11.149 --> 01:49:11.159 align:start position:0%
handle or percentage of ggr but that's
 
01:49:13.310 --> 01:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
the way I would approach it to make it
 
01:49:14.830 --> 01:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
and just do away with the you know
 
01:49:16.510 --> 01:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
return breakage Let The Operators do
 
01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
what they want to do with the breakage
 
01:49:18.790 --> 01:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
either roll it back into the pool or
 
01:49:20.669 --> 01:49:20.679 align:start position:0%
whatever they do but
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
they would have a fixed C they would
 
01:49:23.870 --> 01:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
have a fixed they would know that I have
 
01:49:26.350 --> 01:49:26.360 align:start position:0%
to pay you know quarter of a point on
 
01:49:27.910 --> 01:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
you know on my gross handle to go to
 
01:49:29.149 --> 01:49:29.159 align:start position:0%
probably damage but again it would be
 
01:49:31.030 --> 01:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
interesting to uh to find out what other
 
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
states do with this I mean there's a
 
01:49:34.270 --> 01:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
plenty of gambling going on in a lot of
 
01:49:37.149 --> 01:49:37.159 align:start position:0%
other states uh that they do charge I
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
know it sounded like they do charge for
 
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
the for the vendors to be to to Hardware
 
01:49:46.750 --> 01:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
the uh uh in our case historic ring to
 
01:49:47.870 --> 01:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
to pay a
 
01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
fee substantial fee actually
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean certainly it varies buying
 
01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
whether it's a upfront fee to to
 
01:49:58.350 --> 01:49:58.360 align:start position:0%
business it's a per machine raid if it's
 
01:50:01.229 --> 01:50:01.239 align:start position:0%
uh Senator Lang suggested a percentage
 
01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
of tgr certainly a breakage right now
 
01:50:05.550 --> 01:50:05.560 align:start position:0%
isn't going to the operator in these
 
01:50:06.830 --> 01:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
context it's going back to the player
 
01:50:11.070 --> 01:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
base in terms of the the pool so um okay
 
01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
all right I think we're getting a little
 
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
closer here and I think we're um
 
01:50:20.550 --> 01:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
okay but what I mean by that is the the
 
01:50:23.669 --> 01:50:23.679 align:start position:0%
weight is now should be changed okay now
 
01:50:25.109 --> 01:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
how it's going to change we have to fill
 
01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
in the gaps in the next couple meetings
 
01:50:32.470 --> 01:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
so um all right uh you know we heard
 
01:50:35.790 --> 01:50:35.800 align:start position:0%
about opt in opt out now right now in
 
01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
the pipeline and senators and the chair
 
01:50:44.069 --> 01:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
and chair over here where are we with um
 
01:50:46.310 --> 01:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
limiting the number of facilities where
 
01:50:48.069 --> 01:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
does that all stand I don't know the
 
01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
different there competing bills or
 
01:50:54.189 --> 01:50:54.199 align:start position:0%
where are we so we have what was the
 
01:50:56.669 --> 01:50:56.679 align:start position:0%
bill number you sent back over 112 oh
 
01:50:59.390 --> 01:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's so one bit 112 back
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
over to the Senate we haven't acted on
 
01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
it yet from the house with the change um
 
01:51:07.790 --> 01:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
the Senate did pass um I forgot the bill
 
01:51:10.069 --> 01:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
number I'm drawing blank on it um but
 
01:51:11.709 --> 01:51:11.719 align:start position:0%
the uh that creates a seven-year
 
01:51:13.629 --> 01:51:13.639 align:start position:0%
moratorium allows for the incremental
 
01:51:15.550 --> 01:51:15.560 align:start position:0%
growth um for the applicants that
 
01:51:17.709 --> 01:51:17.719 align:start position:0%
already have applications in play and
 
01:51:19.270 --> 01:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
that's passed the Senate I believe
 
01:51:21.069 --> 01:51:21.079 align:start position:0%
that's over in the house now we should
 
01:51:23.390 --> 01:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
be going to the house well after after
 
01:51:25.390 --> 01:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
cross you think well we've been setting
 
01:51:27.069 --> 01:51:27.079 align:start position:0%
them early so I already have two hous
 
01:51:28.830 --> 01:51:28.840 align:start position:0%
for for Senate ways of means so I know
 
01:51:31.069 --> 01:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
we're sending the bills over early so I
 
01:51:32.669 --> 01:51:32.679 align:start position:0%
don't know where that bill stands in the
 
01:51:36.109 --> 01:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
house that that Bill had
 
01:51:38.669 --> 01:51:38.679 align:start position:0%
um the the seven year with the and we
 
01:51:41.350 --> 01:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
added in municipality piece um on that
 
01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
bill so municipalities get a certain uh
 
01:51:45.510 --> 01:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
number of days subm to a charity but
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
only if there's no charity Avil um for
 
01:51:49.470 --> 01:51:49.480 align:start position:0%
the days that's how we ended up coming
 
01:51:51.149 --> 01:51:51.159 align:start position:0%
to an agreement
 
01:51:52.629 --> 01:51:52.639 align:start position:0%
I can't I just can't remember if there's
 
01:51:54.750 --> 01:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
a competing Bill well the competing bill
 
01:51:57.390 --> 01:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
is 112 that I'm holding which is a
 
01:52:00.589 --> 01:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
permanent I'm not sure you might
 
01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
remember does that have the incremental
 
01:52:03.709 --> 01:52:03.719 align:start position:0%
growth in it as well
 
01:52:07.189 --> 01:52:07.199 align:start position:0%
112 you'll have to explain I hav read
 
01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
this this other piece so incr what do
 
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
you mean incremental well the people I
 
01:52:13.470 --> 01:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
can't remember whether 112 had the
 
01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
everybody who already applied up to
 
01:52:17.189 --> 01:52:17.199 align:start position:0%
October yes it has it is in there as
 
01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
well so the only difference in between
 
01:52:21.750 --> 01:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
the 112 then the bill that we sent over
 
01:52:24.910 --> 01:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
is the man piece and sevene moratorium
 
01:52:28.030 --> 01:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
as compared to a perent Mortor okay yeah
 
01:52:30.589 --> 01:52:30.599 align:start position:0%
I'm correct it's year more time is that
 
01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
up to does that bring us up to about 19
 
01:52:36.030 --> 01:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
licenses well both bills about to bills
 
01:52:37.790 --> 01:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
yeah both bills would allow for the I
 
01:52:40.189 --> 01:52:40.199 align:start position:0%
think Charlie us said there was five
 
01:52:42.270 --> 01:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
pending applications or something I
 
01:52:44.229 --> 01:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
don't I don't I don't he changed my
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
answer so
 
01:52:49.069 --> 01:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
yeah the an of the room well there's
 
01:52:49.079 --> 01:52:50.830 align:start position:0%
yeah the an of the room well there's
there's

01:52:50.830 --> 01:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
there's five applications in the process
 
01:52:54.189 --> 01:52:54.199 align:start position:0%
so we don't know whether
 
01:52:58.390 --> 01:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
they're yeah up two up two would bring
 
01:53:01.350 --> 01:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
us up to 20 total and and we're talking
 
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
about opt in opt out and that wouldn't
 
01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
affect any of these applications so what
 
01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
does it matter I mean going forward if
 
01:53:09.990 --> 01:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
7-year moratorium at the that number
 
01:53:15.149 --> 01:53:15.159 align:start position:0%
yeah we're talking specifically about H
 
01:53:17.910 --> 01:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
not about future gaming operations then
 
01:53:19.390 --> 01:53:19.400 align:start position:0%
they're grandfathered into the old
 
01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:20.790 align:start position:0%
they're grandfathered into the old
statute

01:53:20.790 --> 01:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:53:23.790 --> 01:53:23.800 align:start position:0%
that do not have this requirement of op
 
01:53:26.229 --> 01:53:26.239 align:start position:0%
asking a community to opt in or out is
 
01:53:26.239 --> 01:53:27.030 align:start position:0%
asking a community to opt in or out is
that

01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:53:30.189 --> 01:53:30.199 align:start position:0%
correct right so then it becomes kind of
 
01:53:32.109 --> 01:53:32.119 align:start position:0%
moot in the you
 
01:53:35.310 --> 01:53:35.320 align:start position:0%
know um it's just just the way historic
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
I mean historic Char game has grown up
 
01:53:39.910 --> 01:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
never had an optin and out out clause
 
01:53:43.589 --> 01:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
for communities and it was uh always
 
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
handled to some degree through
 
01:53:48.350 --> 01:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
ordinances in terms of okay you can have
 
01:53:49.830 --> 01:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
it but you can have it over here not
 
01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:50.790 align:start position:0%
it but you can have it over here not
over

01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:52.629 align:start position:0%
over
here

01:53:52.629 --> 01:53:52.639 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:53:56.430 --> 01:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
just just another uh thing that I became
 
01:54:01.069 --> 01:54:01.079 align:start position:0%
aware of uh there's a non-gain Amendment
 
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
um that's been uh that's being offered
 
01:54:06.270 --> 01:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
and will be heard by Municipal and
 
01:54:09.470 --> 01:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
charal gaming in the house um this
 
01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
Wednesday um I believe representative
 
01:54:15.589 --> 01:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
Ros for is the prime sponsor of that um
 
01:54:17.950 --> 01:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
it's under house bill 1223 but it
 
01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
essentially removes all the wording in
 
01:54:23.830 --> 01:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
that right using his vehicle and it's uh
 
01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's a uh it's a little bit unclear
 
01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
to me but it it establishes a local
 
01:54:34.990 --> 01:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
option that applies to horse racing
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
machines and it also applies to
 
01:54:41.390 --> 01:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
charitable games games of chance and um
 
01:54:43.229 --> 01:54:43.239 align:start position:0%
leaves the
 
01:54:45.870 --> 01:54:45.880 align:start position:0%
Kino system in place so it doesn't
 
01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
change that um but it essentially allows
 
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
for provides for enables a vote at the
 
01:54:58.069 --> 01:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
Town level to um have or not have these
 
01:55:00.390 --> 01:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
games just the way I understand the
 
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
question is let's say you pass
 
01:55:06.990 --> 01:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
this um it sounds like that it would not
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
affect those that are in the pipeline or
 
01:55:10.430 --> 01:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
do you think it would I don't know it's
 
01:55:11.790 --> 01:55:11.800 align:start position:0%
a little
 
01:55:14.750 --> 01:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
unclear what do you think I don't know
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
has anybody seen
 
01:55:22.350 --> 01:55:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:25.229 --> 01:55:25.239 align:start position:0%
so the effective dates July 1 2024 which
 
01:55:29.790 --> 01:55:29.800 align:start position:0%
is the same effective date as
 
01:55:34.870 --> 01:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
um as the sevene moror bill so right so
 
01:55:37.510 --> 01:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
this is okay we're not going to solve
 
01:55:40.350 --> 01:55:40.360 align:start position:0%
this information I have no involvement
 
01:55:42.069 --> 01:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
in this I just was told thank you for
 
01:55:43.709 --> 01:55:43.719 align:start position:0%
that though that's great to
 
01:55:46.669 --> 01:55:46.679 align:start position:0%
know so we'll we that we'll come back to
 
01:55:49.870 --> 01:55:49.880 align:start position:0%
that next meeting uh I did add one one
 
01:55:52.750 --> 01:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
that that this is just for us to
 
01:55:55.470 --> 01:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
consider um I want to learn a little bit
 
01:55:57.390 --> 01:55:57.400 align:start position:0%
more about license transfer how that
 
01:56:01.550 --> 01:56:01.560 align:start position:0%
works when a when a facility is
 
01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:03.109 align:start position:0%
works when a when a facility is
sold

01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
sold
 
01:56:08.069 --> 01:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
um but trans the company shares are sold
 
01:56:10.990 --> 01:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
to to all right so the shares are sold
 
01:56:11.950 --> 01:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to understand
 
01:56:15.950 --> 01:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so Shares are sold yes that's the
 
01:56:17.790 --> 01:56:17.800 align:start position:0%
way that the and the license is part of
 
01:56:21.229 --> 01:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
the asset right whatever is transferred
 
01:56:23.390 --> 01:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
whatever is bought as part of that
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
company that is bought the company that
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
had a license to
 
01:56:29.950 --> 01:56:29.960 align:start position:0%
operate the company that operates the
 
01:56:32.790 --> 01:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
facility is sold to another
 
01:56:36.189 --> 01:56:36.199 align:start position:0%
entity that's it maintains its license
 
01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
the license isn't transferred the
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
corporation owns the license and it's
 
01:56:42.430 --> 01:56:42.440 align:start position:0%
part of the corporate assets let us take
 
01:56:45.310 --> 01:56:45.320 align:start position:0%
a real life example conquered conquered
 
01:56:49.270 --> 01:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
Casino I really wish you didn't oh let's
 
01:56:50.790 --> 01:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
do that scaring this under the table
 
01:56:53.910 --> 01:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
over here I've never said it I've never
 
01:56:55.830 --> 01:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
said it all these meetings I've never
 
01:56:59.069 --> 01:56:59.079 align:start position:0%
brought them up uh but but but there
 
01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
there's well all right so Charlie again
 
01:57:04.270 --> 01:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
if I understand correctly the way it
 
01:57:06.589 --> 01:57:06.599 align:start position:0%
works is that it again where a business
 
01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
is the license is an asset of the LLC or
 
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
the sorp or the C Corp whatever form of
 
01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
go business it is yeah if someone buys
 
01:57:15.830 --> 01:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
that business that's an asset just like
 
01:57:18.750 --> 01:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
any other asset of the business however
 
01:57:20.589 --> 01:57:20.599 align:start position:0%
because it's a regulated industry
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
anybody who buys that uh and has more
 
01:57:25.830 --> 01:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
than is it 10% 10% or more ownership has
 
01:57:27.589 --> 01:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
to go through the background checks
 
01:57:30.550 --> 01:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
Financial checks and everything else so
 
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
the newent the new owners have to go
 
01:57:34.510 --> 01:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
through all of that Rec correct yes they
 
01:57:36.709 --> 01:57:36.719 align:start position:0%
it's a very as some folks table know
 
01:57:39.669 --> 01:57:39.679 align:start position:0%
it's a very very lengthy comprehensive
 
01:57:43.149 --> 01:57:43.159 align:start position:0%
process yes and I I bring it up just for
 
01:57:45.109 --> 01:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
thoroughness you know something I was
 
01:57:46.390 --> 01:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
thinking about and I go you know we
 
01:57:49.750 --> 01:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
should talk about it uh it sounds like
 
01:57:51.629 --> 01:57:51.639 align:start position:0%
but the vibe I'm getting here is that
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
people are comfortable with the statute
 
01:57:57.669 --> 01:57:57.679 align:start position:0%
as it is right now is that Mr chair Okay
 
01:58:01.069 --> 01:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
no Okay we want the AG put on this so
 
01:58:02.470 --> 01:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
this is very similar to how
 
01:58:05.270 --> 01:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
environmental permits work so if if
 
01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang owned a solid waste
 
01:58:09.069 --> 01:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
facility and he was going to sell it to
 
01:58:11.470 --> 01:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
waste management for instance um he
 
01:58:13.109 --> 01:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't sell the asset he'd sell his
 
01:58:14.950 --> 01:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
entity because that way the dees
 
01:58:17.149 --> 01:58:17.159 align:start position:0%
permitting would go with it so it's it's
 
01:58:20.750 --> 01:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
not unlike that um statute scheme right
 
01:58:23.069 --> 01:58:23.079 align:start position:0%
or I should say regulatory
 
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
scheme yeah
 
01:58:27.910 --> 01:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
representa meeting curious quick
 
01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
question maybe Charlie can answer do
 
01:58:34.109 --> 01:58:34.119 align:start position:0%
these buyers because we've seen a few uh
 
01:58:36.790 --> 01:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
get B bought out do they go through the
 
01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
process prior to completing the sale
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
with or is it something they go after
 
01:58:45.510 --> 01:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
after the fact if I um I don't want to
 
01:58:47.310 --> 01:58:47.320 align:start position:0%
get to to in the weeds but it's bot
 
01:58:52.229 --> 01:58:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:53.870 --> 01:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
they do expend significant resources
 
01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
prior to yeah again I've ched many of
 
01:58:58.750 --> 01:58:58.760 align:start position:0%
these and I I'm always thinking about
 
01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
the final report and that's in November
 
01:59:03.149 --> 01:59:03.159 align:start position:0%
but I'm already thinking about it and so
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
this one you know I want to say that we
 
01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
discussed this and that we're
 
01:59:08.550 --> 01:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
comfortable with it I mean it's there
 
01:59:11.790 --> 01:59:11.800 align:start position:0%
may be this much in the report but that
 
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679 align:start position:0%
we touch touch that base now does it
 
01:59:16.390 --> 01:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
mean we don't discuss it again I think
 
01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
probably when we write the for we
 
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
approve the report that'll be in there
 
01:59:22.589 --> 01:59:22.599 align:start position:0%
but if anybody has any other issues with
 
01:59:25.510 --> 01:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
the way this process works you know
 
01:59:27.709 --> 01:59:27.719 align:start position:0%
bring it up and uh but before now it
 
01:59:29.790 --> 01:59:29.800 align:start position:0%
sounds like we're we're okay with with
 
01:59:33.870 --> 01:59:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
situation Senator just the current the
 
01:59:41.310 --> 01:59:41.320 align:start position:0%
current situation still is a bit unclear
 
01:59:44.149 --> 01:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
to me based on the decision that was
 
01:59:47.430 --> 01:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
made by the by the individual who who
 
01:59:49.950 --> 01:59:49.960 align:start position:0%
heard the case
 
01:59:52.189 --> 01:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
there's an appell process that could be
 
01:59:54.109 --> 01:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
exercised by the
 
01:59:56.709 --> 01:59:56.719 align:start position:0%
individual and they have a period of
 
02:00:01.109 --> 02:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
time which to which to dispose of of the
 
02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
license now I'm not sure that people I I
 
02:00:06.750 --> 02:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
didn't understand when you dispose of
 
02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
the license you're you're disposing of
 
02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:09.950 align:start position:0%
the license you're you're disposing of
the

02:00:09.950 --> 02:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:00:13.830 --> 02:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
LLC so the you're disposing of the LLC
 
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
but within the CL flages of this sale
 
02:00:18.830 --> 02:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
are all of the amenities that comprise
 
02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:20.270 align:start position:0%
are all of the amenities that comprise
that

02:00:20.270 --> 02:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:22.030 align:start position:0%
that
LC

02:00:22.030 --> 02:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
LC
 
02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:23.790 align:start position:0%
LC
uh

02:00:23.790 --> 02:00:23.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:00:27.149 --> 02:00:27.159 align:start position:0%
we does does that mean any debt that the
 
02:00:31.229 --> 02:00:31.239 align:start position:0%
LLC is incurring or or any financial
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
problems that the LLC has or any legal
 
02:00:37.830 --> 02:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
problems that the LLC has are all
 
02:00:41.069 --> 02:00:41.079 align:start position:0%
acquired by the the individual who's
 
02:00:42.430 --> 02:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
acquiring the
 
02:00:46.229 --> 02:00:46.239 align:start position:0%
LLC this is a pending matter um so i'
 
02:00:48.069 --> 02:00:48.079 align:start position:0%

until hopefully the other matter is
 
02:01:02.350 --> 02:01:02.360 align:start position:0%
