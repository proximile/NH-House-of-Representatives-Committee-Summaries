okay we good CLK no I don't care about
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
clerk you have something to write
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
on yeah I forgot that I could just write
 
00:08:56.509 --> 00:08:56.519 align:start position:0%
that sheet okay all right okay we'll
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
open up the public
 
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.790 align:start position:0%
open up the public
hearing

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
on 1406 and here from the prime sponsor
 
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
representative Reed good morning
 
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.870 align:start position:0%
representative Reed good morning
representative

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
Reed good morning Mr chair and thank you
 
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
honorable members for welcoming to your
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
Ellen Reed I represent New Market and
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
newfields and um before you I have a
 
00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
bill 1406 that would um effectively ban
 
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
the pricing of goods services on the
 
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
basis of gender you may have heard this
 
00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:36.519 align:start position:0%
phenomenon called the pink tax um not to
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
be confused there's some confusion
 
00:09:40.829 --> 00:09:40.839 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of different ways
 
00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
in which women spend more just to live
 
00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
than men and sometimes um it's confused
 
00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
with the idea that there in some states
 
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
not here obviously there's a tax on
 
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:53.320 align:start position:0%
menstrual products this is not that this
 
00:09:56.829 --> 00:09:56.839 align:start position:0%
is literally pricing for example the
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
go-to example is Gillette makes a black
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
razor um it is black and silver and it
 
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:06.200 align:start position:0%
costs $4 the same exact razor in pink
 
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
costs seven that is gender based pricing
 
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
so this is a Barbie tax a Barbie tax if
 
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
you will yes um and there are two states
 
00:10:21.389 --> 00:10:21.399 align:start position:0%
that have um passed similar
 
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:24.200 align:start position:0%
legislation uh this is drawn directly
 
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
from one of those uh functioning laws
 
00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:30.519 align:start position:0%
that currently exist
 
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
so I've I've known about this phenomenon
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
for a while it was about a year ago that
 
00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:37.519 align:start position:0%
um I kind of got up in arms over it
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
because I went to WR Aid to buy a small
 
00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
pair of like manicure type scissors and
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
I was unwilling in the manicure area to
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
pay the $10 that the scissors were were
 
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
priced at and then I had the genius idea
 
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
knowing that this was a phenomenon to go
 
00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
over to the men's section and wouldn't
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
you know not only a pair of scissors but
 
00:10:59.150 --> 00:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
a much better quality pair of scissors
 
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
cost $4 instead of
 
00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:04.839 align:start position:0%
$110 um and I was just so mad in that
 
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
moment I'm like I'm putting this in next
 
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
year I'm definitely doing it finally so
 
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's my personal story on
 
00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:15.639 align:start position:0%
this so on average and this is a very
 
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
well-studied phenomenon on average uh
 
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
products that are identical in cost of
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
manufacture in ingredients and and in um
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
materials uh cost
 
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
7% higher when they are marketed to
 
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:35.240 align:start position:0%
women um for only the marketing process
 
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's the color of the packaging
 
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
or what have you um but that's average
 
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
on uh on the low end you have 4% but on
 
00:11:45.629 --> 00:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
the high end you have as much as double
 
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
um or even more in some some particular
 
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
cases I've given you a handout where you
 
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
see a number of uh of examples my
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
favorite one by the way if you look at
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
the calculators you can't see but the
 
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
darker looking calculator has pink
 
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
buttons and you can see the price
 
00:12:04.829 --> 00:12:04.839 align:start position:0%
differential there for the same exact
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
calculator that has pink buttons rather
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
than white
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
buttons so because of that it is
 
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
estimated now this is from 1994 data uh
 
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
women spend
 
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
$1,350 more per year to just exist than
 
00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
men however that's $1
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
1994 uh in today's dollars it's closer
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
to $2,400 a year a woman and spends more
 
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
just to buy the same types of things
 
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
shampoo soap what have you this is by
 
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:37.720 align:start position:0%
the way not including actual sex based
 
00:12:39.629 --> 00:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
products so for example things like
 
00:12:41.629 --> 00:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
menstrual products or what have you this
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
that would not be gender based that
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
would be sex based because you're
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
actually using something that men would
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
never use but this is just the
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
difference in how it's marketed with all
 
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
other uh materials and cost being the
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
same um and what that $2,400 per year
 
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
means is that on the the adult
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
consumptive lifespan of the average
 
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
woman women are spending
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
$100,000 more just to live during their
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
consumptive adult
 
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
life so as I said two states have
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
already banned this pink tax this
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
gender-based pricing um the bill before
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
you repeatedly exempts anything that
 
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to do so if it's you know
 
00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
you have to compare the cost of the the
 
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:25.720 align:start position:0%
actual manufacturer or the cost of the
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
service the time it gives um it takes to
 
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
give the service the difficulty of
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
service if it's a service uh the
 
00:13:33.629 --> 00:13:33.639 align:start position:0%
ingredients everything um has to be
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
taken into consideration so that it is
 
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
only the gender that it's marketed too
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
that is the
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
difference and I guess I'll just kind of
 
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
like uh I don't think I have a lot of
 
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
opposition in the room other than the
 
00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:49.399 align:start position:0%
AG's office who will tell you that this
 
00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:52.959 align:start position:0%
will anytime you pass a law that makes
 
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
something illegal they have to
 
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
potentially do some more work but um and
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
I understand that but um the arguments
 
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
that I can foresee is well isn't this
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
the free market um and I
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
mean yes
 
00:14:12.629 --> 00:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
but is it free when so the idea of the
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
free market is kind of oversimplified
 
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
because anybody who's taken more than
 
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
one economics class can tell you that it
 
00:14:20.269 --> 00:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't just always boil down to supply
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
and demand but the idea is that those
 
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
are free forces that are able to
 
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:26.519 align:start position:0%
negotiate with each other freely but the
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
problem is when you have an industry
 
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
that sees that they can prevent any
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
other options from existing for the
 
00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
demand side the demand side gets
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
hamstrung and they don't have any other
 
00:14:39.389 --> 00:14:39.399 align:start position:0%
choices so for example and I hate to
 
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
bring up a triggering example but it's
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
it's probably the most recent and famous
 
00:14:45.749 --> 00:14:45.759 align:start position:0%
example of price scouching um was during
 
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
covid when there were people who were
 
00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
stockpiling toilet paper and stockpiling
 
00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:51.160 align:start position:0%
hand sanitizer and then charging like
 
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
$50 for a bottle of hand sanitizer in
 
00:14:56.509 --> 00:14:56.519 align:start position:0%
the beginning days of that so we kind of
 
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
universally agree that that's kind of
 
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
egregious Behavior but that in effect is
 
00:15:02.749 --> 00:15:02.759 align:start position:0%
what these industries have been doing
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
across the board because it's it's
 
00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
effective price fixing they know that if
 
00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:10.519 align:start position:0%
they don't provide any uh lower cost or
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
more fairly um priced options that the
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
demand side has no choice but to pay for
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
those things so um I guess I'll open up
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
oh and the last piece of that is we do
 
00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
regulate that type of behavior right we
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
do say that you can't discriminate on
 
00:15:30.509 --> 00:15:30.519 align:start position:0%
the basis of sex or gender in commercial
 
00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
activities like housing or employment
 
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
you can't discriminate on the basis of
 
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
sex or gender um for commercial public
 
00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
amenities so I think that it makes sense
 
00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:43.240 align:start position:0%
that we say actually if it's if it costs
 
00:15:46.829 --> 00:15:46.839 align:start position:0%
you a dollar and you're charging $2 then
 
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't matter whether you're
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
selling to men or women I think that's
 
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
just kind of Common Sense and I'll take
 
00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:55.839 align:start position:0%
questions represent representative M
 
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you Mr chairman um I
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
have I have two questions uh both very
 
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
very simple uh and not substantive but
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
um on um page two uh line
 
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
20 where it says different price for two
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
goods shouldn't that say two goods or
 
00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:23.079 align:start position:0%
services um you are correct
 
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative and I'm happy if the
 
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
committee sees fit to want to work with
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
this bill and in in hopes of finding a a
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
version that passes I'm happy to work
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
with the committee to prepare that okay
 
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
uh the second one is a little harder um
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
oh I apologize representative I think
 
00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
that no no you're right I was thinking
 
00:16:42.749 --> 00:16:42.759 align:start position:0%
the previous section addressed uh
 
00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
services but yes go ahead okay um uh and
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
that is um shouldn't this bill have an
 
00:16:50.639 --> 00:16:51.949 align:start position:0%
that is um shouldn't this bill have an
appropriation

00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:51.959 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
attached an appropriation for the the
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office uh if you look
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
at the fiscal note it says uh does this
 
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
bill provide sufficient funding to cover
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
estimated expenditures and the answer is
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
no and then on the next page um there's
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh estimated costs for personnel um I
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
don't know that three people would
 
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily be needed um but uh I think
 
00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
the the estimation certainly for for an
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
additional person is probably not
 
00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
unreasonable um and therefore shouldn't
 
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
there be something to cover that so the
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
the three salaries given in that um as
 
00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:33.039 align:start position:0%
it it stated was just an example of what
 
00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
those salaries would be but the
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
department did not come back and say it
 
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
would cost them a specific you know
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
amount of extra labor hours so if the
 
00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
department were to give us an idea of
 
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
how much extra they would want or just
 
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:48.200 align:start position:0%
even a ballpark to enforce it then yes
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy again to work with the
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
committee to amend it to put in
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for one extra staff
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
person I'm sure that the um uh
 
00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
representative behind not repres
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative representative but the
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
person behind me that's from the AG's
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
office will uh speak more in depth to
 
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative M thank
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
question of Reed um I often have my
 
00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
razors stolen for that very reason um
 
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
but I I will ask you just this state
 
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
simple question
 
00:18:26.669 --> 00:18:26.679 align:start position:0%
um can anyone buy any product from the
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
top or the bottom row freely without
 
00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:29.990 align:start position:0%
top or the bottom row freely without
restriction

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
restriction
 
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
now yes and you know I kind of
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
anticipated this question um and this
 
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:38.200 align:start position:0%
kind of touches on a much broader
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
subject that you know I I want to make
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
sure that we focus on this bill but what
 
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
you're really asking is what is gender
 
00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
and gender is the set of no I wasn't
 
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:49.640 align:start position:0%
asking what is gend if you would allow
 
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
me to to let her go where she wants to
 
00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
go the the thing is is that I'm here in
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
a skirt and makeup today as is as are
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
many of the women here because we grew
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
up in a society that told us that's how
 
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
we are expected to appear and present
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
ourselves and the gentlemen here are
 
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
wearing suits for the same reason and
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
with that societal pressure I mean I
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
personally would love to see a world
 
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
where that ended where there's no more
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
expectation placed on people for how
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
they appear for their characteristics
 
00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
for their roles in society or aptitudes
 
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
based on their body parts that they were
 
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
born with however I'm not trying to go
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
after that larger concept cept I'm
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
saying that if we're going to have that
 
00:19:32.669 --> 00:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
societal pressure and we're going to say
 
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
that people are expected to be to behave
 
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
a certain way then we can't say one half
 
00:19:38.669 --> 00:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
of those people who have this
 
00:19:41.149 --> 00:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
expectation have to pay
 
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
more further question me inquir thank
 
00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thanks for taking a
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
quick followup um it seems like it kind
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
of corrected itself in the toothbrush
 
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
Market I tend to stockpile toothbrushes
 
00:19:54.909 --> 00:19:54.919 align:start position:0%
I like to have a few of them and the
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what color they are
 
00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
they're all about the same same price I
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
think I've currently got a you know
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
orange one and a purple one and
 
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes that confuses Julie she takes
 
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
the purple one thinks it's you know the
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
more Fe feminine color reminder that's
 
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
my toothbrush right at the moment right
 
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
so um you can say that as of this moment
 
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
tooth care is not a highly gendered
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
Market but it goes there like I said I I
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
gave you the example of the um the
 
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
calculators but I'm not sure if I
 
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
included the picture or not when I was
 
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
looking through all the pictures didn't
 
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
want to give you 50 pages of pictures
 
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.950 align:start position:0%
want to give you 50 pages of pictures
but

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
ducula has a blue box and a pink box
 
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
with the same ingredient the same dosage
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
of the ingredient and the pink box costs
 
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
more so I presume we all have the same
 
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
bowels and it's not you know affecting
 
00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:46.919 align:start position:0%
us differently since it's the same
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
ingredient so it is very very pervasive
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
into Industries ands and products that
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
shouldn't really logically have anything
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
to do with gender and just because it
 
00:21:00.029 --> 00:21:00.039 align:start position:0%
hasn't yet you know affected the
 
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
toothbrush Market doesn't mean it might
 
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
not one day I could imagine Barbie
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
toothbrushes and
 
00:21:10.029 --> 00:21:10.039 align:start position:0%
whatnot okay we got lots of questions
 
00:21:12.909 --> 00:21:12.919 align:start position:0%
Z thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
taking our question uh my wife wants me
 
00:21:21.269 --> 00:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
to buy her a uh 6inch electric chainsaw
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
and she wants a she wants a pink one and
 
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
I told her uh let's think about it
 
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
because it's they're very dangerous
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
tools but the pink one is I think a few
 
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
dollars more than the regular one so
 
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
this is a conversation going on um but
 
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that certain uh certain
 
00:21:39.549 --> 00:21:39.559 align:start position:0%
products that are different colors might
 
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
cost more and uh would you believe that
 
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
if it's a shorter run of production that
 
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
that would cost more because the scale
 
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
of the efficiency of scale isn't there
 
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
so like for instance if you price out a
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
car and you want a a special color from
 
00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
the dealership they might charge you
 
00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
another th000 because they not they're
 
00:22:02.269 --> 00:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
not cranking those out regularly would
 
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
you believe that the market sort of
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh that's a market
 
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
determination because of the smaller
 
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
scale because of the smaller scale even
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
if that color has nothing necessarily to
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
do with gender marketing this bill
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
covers that so it says if it costs you
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
more to make then or it costs you more
 
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
to buy then you can't then it's fine you
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
can charge a different amount it's only
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
if it costs the same amount it's only if
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
the materials and the manufacturing
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
everything was the same that and the
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
gender marketing was different that that
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
was the differential that's that's what
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
this goes after specifically so that's
 
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
all Exempted no I did see that loophole
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh or excuse me that that exemption um
 
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
but having said that it seemed like a
 
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
potential loophole because now if the
 
00:22:51.789 --> 00:22:51.799 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office calls up and
 
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
say we think you you know charging
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
overcharging and now that Merchant or
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
the business the manufact is now going
 
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559 align:start position:0%
to you know have to defend you know
 
00:23:04.269 --> 00:23:04.279 align:start position:0%
lawyer up and and the lawyer says well
 
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
you know how many runs did you make of
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
this or that can't you didn't use that
 
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
as an excuse
 
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:13.240 align:start position:0%
so you really are just you're actually
 
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
discriminating against
 
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
pink you are implying that pink is a
 
00:23:24.149 --> 00:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
feminine product as though no men would
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
want pink you are actually you are
 
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
actually that's why when I said Barbie
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
because that the whole point of
 
00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
marketing is to appeal to the
 
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
consumer and so if the consumer a
 
00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:45.400 align:start position:0%
woman prefers pink duux because that
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
means oh it it's it's okay for women
 
00:23:50.909 --> 00:23:50.919 align:start position:0%
maybe I don't know why they think that
 
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
you're saying oh because they did that
 
00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
that it you know they they should be
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
lawyer up and and they got to get try
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
you they got to you know they got to
 
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
change their pricing they got to do all
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
that when it really is a marketing issue
 
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
here's my problem there's a bunch of
 
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
points here I bought I bought a backpack
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
for my wife and I was looking for the
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
sale price well the only one that was on
 
00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
green and they were out of them and said
 
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
and I said' well how what it's your
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
replacement well you have black but you
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
got to pay more for that
 
00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
so companies are actually marketing that
 
00:24:35.389 --> 00:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
price the color the color change
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
whatever is their choice it's their
 
00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:42.200 align:start position:0%
marketing choice and it really I my
 
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
question to you is you are basically are
 
00:24:46.909 --> 00:24:46.919 align:start position:0%
discriminating against the color pink
 
00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:49.240 align:start position:0%
because is there any other color is
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
there any other shade that you think is
 
00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
the word pink is not in the bill to be
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
very clear but you all agree everyone
 
00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
agrees that pink is what you're going to
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
use for discrimination because if it
 
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
wasn't pink if there was a one product
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
was black and the other one is green and
 
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
it says and are you going to say is did
 
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
it save for women on the package if I
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
may be allowed to respond to some of
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
those multiple points so um maybe I'll
 
00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
work I'll I'll try to work in in order
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
of the notes that I've taken here so
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
this idea that um well there was a
 
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
limited production of this thing so now
 
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
the AG's office is going after them I
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
think it's really clear um and it would
 
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
be a very simple you know two-minute
 
00:25:39.269 --> 00:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
process for the AG's office to check
 
00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not a particular company has
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
put out the same Gillette we'll say has
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
put out you know so many millions of of
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
razors marketed for women versus razors
 
00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
marketed for men if it's a limited
 
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
production then again that's excluded in
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
the bill so that would be an easy like
 
00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
well I guess we're not going to go after
 
00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:01.559 align:start position:0%
them it's up to the asg's office whether
 
00:26:03.149 --> 00:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
they go after someone if they think even
 
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
a claim of a limited production or an
 
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
increased cost of any kind um is you
 
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
know reasonable that they don't feel
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
like they want to go after and pursue
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
that line of arguing um so the idea that
 
00:26:17.549 --> 00:26:17.559 align:start position:0%
I'm discriminating against pink in a
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
bill that's saying you have to price
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
things the same regardless of the color
 
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
how they're marketed so not regardless
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
of the color because that was also a bit
 
00:26:28.269 --> 00:26:28.279 align:start position:0%
of a of a
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
misconception there's no like color
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
issue in this we call it the pink tax
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
and I think that's where we're getting
 
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
because it is frequently the color pink
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
or purple or whatever what's considered
 
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
feminine colors in a particular issue
 
00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:45.039 align:start position:0%
but it's about is it marketed to a
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
particular gender and let me be very
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
very specific because you brought up
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
well what if a guy prefers the color
 
00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:54.039 align:start position:0%
pink okay in fact there are makeup
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
companies now that have as their models
 
00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
men wearing the makeup so it's really
 
00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:02.120 align:start position:0%
not about sex it's about are you
 
00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
marketing to a particular gender is it
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
feminine or is it masculine and I don't
 
00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
mean like is it a product that only
 
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
women use I mean is it feminized or
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
masculinized in the marketing when every
 
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
other factor means that it has the same
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
cost of production that is what it's
 
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
getting to and if in a bill that's
 
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
saying you have to level that out I
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
don't understand the allegation that I
 
00:27:27.149 --> 00:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
am discriminating against something I am
 
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
undiscriminating you more because we are
 
00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:52.120 align:start position:0%
marketing it to
 
00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
a the woman can buy the the man version
 
00:27:57.549 --> 00:27:57.559 align:start position:0%
the way I read this bill that man
 
00:27:59.870 --> 00:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
version has to be exactly the same as
 
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
the woman's version the only thing
 
00:28:04.909 --> 00:28:04.919 align:start position:0%
different is the
 
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
packaging if that is true there is
 
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
nothing stopping a woman from buying
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
that package not and they're not going
 
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
to get charged more and because that is
 
00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
why I'm saying you're discriminating
 
00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
against the the fact that the package
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
might say for
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
women rather than for men what what
 
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
you're saying is that they need them
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
advertise that it's uh the men's version
 
00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
or the cheaper version they need to say
 
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
on this for
 
00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
everybody no they don't need to say for
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
everybody they have to not charge a
 
00:28:40.269 --> 00:28:40.279 align:start position:0%
different amount it can still be
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
marketed towards women it just can't
 
00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
cost more and by the way I don't didn't
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
hear a question in any of that but um so
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm worried this is turned into a
 
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
debate more than a hearing but having
 
00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.070 align:start position:0%
debate more than a hearing but having
said

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:28:58.509 --> 00:28:58.519 align:start position:0%
that um I I don't going back to the
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
previous thing you're you're you're
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
saying that women I mean I answered this
 
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
question earlier women can buy like I
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
did with the scissors the masculine
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
product but we live in a society that we
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
say we expect as all of the women here
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
are wearing some feminine thing our
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
clothing it may cost the same amount to
 
00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
make this shirt as your shirt and yet I
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.149 align:start position:0%
 
issue

00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
okay represent uh Gibbs has already had
 
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:31.240 align:start position:0%
a question anybody had not
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert has not had a
 
00:29:34.269 --> 00:29:34.279 align:start position:0%
question yet
 
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
um you said that two states have uh
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
passed this bill um I'd like to know
 
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
what the states are and uh get a sense
 
00:29:47.789 --> 00:29:47.799 align:start position:0%
if you have any feedback coming from
 
00:29:50.669 --> 00:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
those two states as to how the bill has
 
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
been effective or not effective I just
 
00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
would like to know what happened in
 
00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
those two states thank you very much um
 
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
at the risk of triggering some people
 
00:30:04.269 --> 00:30:04.279 align:start position:0%
those two states are New York State and
 
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
California and all reports so far are
 
00:30:10.509 --> 00:30:10.519 align:start position:0%
positive you can you can feel free to
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
look up just even just look up the words
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
pink tax um it's it there's a wealth of
 
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
information online and virtually no one
 
00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
thinks that this is an okay
 
00:30:26.669 --> 00:30:26.679 align:start position:0%
practice okay representative Gibbs thank
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh this is a followup on some of the
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
questions uh asked by my colleagues um
 
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry that the gentleman um on
 
00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
that side uh has left the room because
 
00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:41.480 align:start position:0%
that train of questions uh actually
 
00:30:44.669 --> 00:30:44.679 align:start position:0%
started with his but um uh this is
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
essentially would you believe um that uh
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
while indeed um if the men's razor and
 
00:30:54.509 --> 00:30:54.519 align:start position:0%
the women's razor are the same uh but
 
00:30:56.269 --> 00:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
one is marked for men and one is marked
 
00:30:58.990 --> 00:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
for women regardless the color uh I can
 
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
buy the men's if I want um but if I go
 
00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
to the cleaners with a woman's Blazer I
 
00:31:09.789 --> 00:31:09.799 align:start position:0%
have discovered that it costs more to
 
00:31:12.269 --> 00:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
get the woman's Blazer clean than a
 
00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:15.320 align:start position:0%
man's jacket and I do not have the
 
00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:18.440 align:start position:0%
choice to turn my woman's Blazer into a
 
00:31:21.909 --> 00:31:21.919 align:start position:0%
man's jacket I have to pay more for it
 
00:31:23.149 --> 00:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
would you believe that I would
 
00:31:24.629 --> 00:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely believe that and I would
 
00:31:27.549 --> 00:31:27.559 align:start position:0%
further believe that women's haircuts
 
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
and you can't go into the the salon and
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
say that I'm not a woman unless you feel
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
like trying to you know change your
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
gender identity for the day um cost more
 
00:31:40.669 --> 00:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
than men's haircuts for the same exact
 
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
cut even with short hair even with you
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
know the Simplicity of the cut um many
 
00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:49.240 align:start position:0%
services Geared for women are charged
 
00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:53.320 align:start position:0%
more for women than for men um I I when
 
00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
I get a a manicure for example I always
 
00:31:59.509 --> 00:31:59.519 align:start position:0%
they they mark at Men's manicures I
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
never want polish the only difference
 
00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
between the men's manicure and the
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
women's manicure is the lack of Polish
 
00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:06.440 align:start position:0%
in the men's manicure but I still get
 
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
charged for the women's manicure even
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
though I'm not getting polish and am
 
00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
effectively getting the men's
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
manicure representative Amon has a
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
question I just have one last question
 
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:19.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your good-natured
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
testimony today thank you here's my
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
question you you referenced uh the the
 
00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
women on our committee today and and you
 
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
also said that gender is a social
 
00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:32.200 align:start position:0%
construct how do you know which of us is
 
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:34.360 align:start position:0%
a woman on the on the committee I don't
 
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
know your biological sex I I can tell
 
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
from how people present themselves that
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
they are presenting themselves in a
 
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
feminine manner or a masculine Manner
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
and that is gender your biological sex
 
00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:48.039 align:start position:0%
is none of my business um it should
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
really be only your business your sexual
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
partner's business and your doctor's
 
00:32:53.549 --> 00:32:53.559 align:start position:0%
business further question you see where
 
00:32:55.389 --> 00:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
this is going to go so when this is
 
00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
where I was afraid like this is
 
00:32:58.509 --> 00:32:58.519 align:start position:0%
literally not about that but okay I
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
guess we're going to have to go there
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
just a clarification when you say woman
 
00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
do you mean biological sex or do you
 
00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:07.960 align:start position:0%
mean gender for the purposes of this so
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of this bill this is
 
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
only the concept of feminine and
 
00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
masculine not anything to do with
 
00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
Biology and in fact as I already said if
 
00:33:18.909 --> 00:33:18.919 align:start position:0%
it's something that you are biologically
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
using because you're a woman then that's
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
not in this bill because there's no
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
equal counterpart on the male side so
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
there's no such thing as the
 
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
gender-based pricing for example on
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
feminine products I mean by feminine
 
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
products I mean sanitation products uh
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
tampons and what have you because
 
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
there's no masculine version of
 
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
Walsh thank you Mr chairman uh this is
 
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
we'll have a question but it's also
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
would you believe being a biological
 
00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
woman and planning on staying that way
 
00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh I've noticed all of my life
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
everything that has said here thank you
 
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
that we always have to pay more and I in
 
00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
total agreement with this Bill thank you
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
for writing it and that the fact that
 
00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
yes it's a free market but not all women
 
00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:15.399 align:start position:0%
are going to go and hunt and search and
 
00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
Peck for down other aisles to see if
 
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
there's a a less expensive you know
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
marketed to men's version of whatever it
 
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
is they're looking for I mean when it's
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
easy when it's such as I think this is a
 
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
deodorant or whatever this is shamp I
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
think shampoo when they're right next to
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
each other yes it's F it's easy to see
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
the difference but that's also easy to
 
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
see that they're blatantly different and
 
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
charging more for the one that is
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
marketed towards women gray bottle
 
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
versus white bottle right so uh my
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
question would be if if this were to uh
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
be passed what type of enforcement is
 
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:01.599 align:start position:0%
there uh to this oh read the so so this
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
is she needs to put in a fiscal note no
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
no no the bill in front of you to be
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
fair you don't have to read the fiscal
 
00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
note for the the enforcement is in the
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
bill the enforcement is in the bill and
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
this but again because the issue was
 
00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
brought up can't a woman just go get the
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
masculine version what you are saying
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
therefore not sex but gender that women
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
in order to merely just pay the same
 
00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
amount that men do in life must undergo
 
00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:32.440 align:start position:0%
a process by which they change how they
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
express their gender in the world
 
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
because I have to buy masculine items I
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
have to buy masc if if the woman's
 
00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
blouse and the skirt cost more than the
 
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
man's shirt and the the suit pants then
 
00:35:46.349 --> 00:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
I have to buy those things instead of
 
00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
those things uh because that's the only
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
way for me to you know pay the same as a
 
00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:53.720 align:start position:0%
man is to dress like a man and buy men's
 
00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
products that all of my razors have to
 
00:35:57.829 --> 00:35:57.839 align:start position:0%
be black and all of my bottles have to
 
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
be black and and gray or what have you
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
so that's what you're saying is that
 
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
well if you want to save money then be
 
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079 align:start position:0%
masculine by masculine products that's
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
that's no that's been the argument
 
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
consistently is that well can't a woman
 
00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
go by from the men's aisle or from the
 
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:14.599 align:start position:0%
men's section and get the gray thing or
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
the thing without the pink isn't that
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
the case and my point is in a society
 
00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
where we do enforce
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
gender then you are saying that a woman
 
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
has to present and by buying products
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
that are meant for men present uh more
 
00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
in a masculine
 
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
fashion okay so um would you like to
 
00:36:37.309 --> 00:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
hear a story that's very similar to this
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
legislation I I it's because I you I
 
00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
heard you don't you only want a question
 
00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
from me but Donna
 
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
Susi actually brought a
 
00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
bill and and I talked to her about it it
 
00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
was her very first term she was a House
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
member and brought it to this committee
 
00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
and the issue was dry cleaner
 
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
and the issue was and she brought it
 
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
that the button- down shirt she brought
 
00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
two man and woman and I didn't even know
 
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
this at the time but she said you can
 
00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
tell the difference is because the
 
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
buttons go the other way correct but I
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
never knew that until that that hearing
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
and uh the goes back to equestrianism by
 
00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:24.839 align:start position:0%
the way which I'm the bill died and the
 
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
the blur on the committee the committee
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
was cavior mtor which is yes the buyers
 
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
a woman needs to be
 
00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
aware that just because the packaging is
 
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
is aimed towards them they don't have to
 
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
buy that more expensive product simply
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
to fit The Stereotype of that pink means
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
that they're supposed to buy pink that
 
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
they not have to be Barbie they could be
 
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
Ken and buy the black said what I said a
 
00:37:59.390 --> 00:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
second ago you don't have to be Barbie
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
you can be Ken meaning I if I want to to
 
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
to to pay the same amount to live in
 
00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
this world as a man have to buy
 
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
masculinized products which therefore
 
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
means to some degree as far as clothing
 
00:38:12.589 --> 00:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
and other things that are visible my
 
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
products that I will have to present in
 
00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
a more masculine form to the rest of the
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
world because I have been forced in
 
00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
order to save the money to buy more
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
masculine items and what I'm saying is
 
00:38:26.829 --> 00:38:26.839 align:start position:0%
if you don't want to challenge the IDE a
 
00:38:28.349 --> 00:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
that we have gender if you want to
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
accept the fact that we have gender
 
00:38:32.589 --> 00:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
norms and that people are expected to
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
present in a way that that you know
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
shows their gender then at the least you
 
00:38:40.109 --> 00:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
can do is not penalize one gender when
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
they go to actually buy the products to
 
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
present themselves in that way and you
 
00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:45.640 align:start position:0%
get the final word thank you very much
 
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
well thank
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:55.520 --> 00:39:03.270 align:start position:0%

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
red is on or red is off red is hot red
 
00:39:18.109 --> 00:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
good good morning Mr chairperson members
 
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Brandon Gad
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
I'm a senior Assistant Attorney General
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
chief of the consumer protection and an
 
00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
trust Bureau at the New Hampshire
 
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office I'm here today
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
not to take a position one way or the
 
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
other on this bill but simply to point
 
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
out some concerns that the Attorney
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
General's office have um not only in the
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact but also in our ability to
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
enforce it and you know I'd just like to
 
00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
take the time to point out that you know
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General is here often
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
testifying that a change in the law that
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
puts new responsibilities into the lap
 
00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
of the AGS would necessitate additional
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
resources that does happen frequently
 
00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
but it's not every time um we look very
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
carefully at every bill and we look at
 
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
what we anticipate the bill would
 
00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:07.240 align:start position:0%
require us to do how much work it has
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
the potential to generate and whether we
 
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
could do that with the resources that we
 
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
currently have and if the answer is yes
 
00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
you will not hear us over here saying
 
00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
you know this is more work therefore we
 
00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
need more resources and a great example
 
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
of that is the bill that's on following
 
00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
this bill um which would add a new
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
requirement to the consumer protection
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
act I will not be here testifying on
 
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
that saying that it would have a fiscal
 
00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:31.720 align:start position:0%
impact on the AG's office because I
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
don't think that it would um it's a very
 
00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
careful analysis that is done on every
 
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
single bill to make sure that if we are
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
entrusted with a new responsibility that
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
we are able to do it both in the volume
 
00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
and able to do it meaningfully so that a
 
00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility that has been entrusted
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
to our office can be carried out
 
00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
meaningfully and we can enforce that law
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
as it's written so with that context you
 
00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
know the this specific Bill while you
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
know first of all I I just want to say
 
00:41:05.069 --> 00:41:05.079 align:start position:0%
that you know as a general concept being
 
00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
charged the same amount for the same
 
00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:07.839 align:start position:0%
product regardless of your gender or
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
your race or anything else I would hope
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
is something that everybody can agree on
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
certainly something that you know the
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office would strongly
 
00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
support and you in this bill it has two
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
different you know tracks that we would
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
be enforcing one for goods and one for
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
services the comments that you're going
 
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
to hear from me today are almost
 
00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:28.839 align:start position:0%
entirely geared towards the goods arm of
 
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
this bill because I think the
 
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
requirements as to services are largely
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable en forceable and could
 
00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
potentially you know be handled you know
 
00:41:39.069 --> 00:41:39.079 align:start position:0%
maybe with additional resources but
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
maybe even without it's really the goods
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
portion of this that you know is
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
problematic so you know and the reason I
 
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
say that is if you look at Services you
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
know the the example was raised uh
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
haircuts and dry cleaning if a salon is
 
00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
offering you know a buzz cut cut and a
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
man wants a buzz cut and a woman woman
 
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
wants a buzz cut and they're charging
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
two different prices it is very easy for
 
00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:07.079 align:start position:0%
us to go in investigate look at you know
 
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
exactly what the product or the service
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
that's being offered is and determine
 
00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:13.480 align:start position:0%
that they are substantially the same and
 
00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:15.640 align:start position:0%
say no you're charging the exact same
 
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
thing for the exact same service for two
 
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
different people because one is a man
 
00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
and one is a woman and that violates
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
this law and we could take action to
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
enforce that that is doable and that is
 
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
enforcable you know as anticipated by
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
the statute I would imagine probably the
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
same with the dry cleaning example that
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
was given you know if two different
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
let's say a man's jacket and a woman's
 
00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
blouse you know there's two different
 
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
prices to dry clean them to apply
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
certain chemicals wash them I don't know
 
00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
how see my ignorance on how dry cleaning
 
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
works but you know if the service is
 
00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
exactly the same and the price is
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
different you know we could do that
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
investigation we could make a
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
determination whether that service is
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
substantially similar you know for the
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
man's service and the woman's service
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
but I think it's very very difficult if
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
not impossible to do the same thing as
 
00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
it you know pertains to goods and I'll
 
00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
do my best to explain why but it's the
 
00:43:10.589 --> 00:43:10.599 align:start position:0%
goods portion of this that you know
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
going back to resources and you know a
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact on
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
doj potentially what could happen if
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
this bill was you know signed into law
 
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
as written is that consumers across the
 
00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
state could file a complaint with the
 
00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:25.720 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office for every
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
single type of product every single
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
brand of product every single type of
 
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
product where there is a man's version
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
and a woman's version and say the price
 
00:43:34.109 --> 00:43:34.119 align:start position:0%
is different I want the Attorney
 
00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
General's office to investigate that has
 
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
the potential for an enormous influx of
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
complaints into the Attorney General's
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
office which we would not be capable of
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
handling with the resources that we
 
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
currently have so that is why your
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that you saw in my testimony
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
here today um is specifically here about
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
the need for additional resources in
 
00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
order to enforce this bill it's not just
 
00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
that it would be more work it's that the
 
00:43:59.630 --> 00:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
specific work that would be required to
 
00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:01.640 align:start position:0%
handle what could be an enormous influx
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
of complaints is beyond the capabilities
 
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
of the resources that we currently have
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
and it's relatively impossible to
 
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
anticipate the number of complaints and
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
how many additional resources we would
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
need to do it um potentially a way to
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
determine that would be to inquire with
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
New York and California to see how it is
 
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
played out there but we simply don't
 
00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:22.839 align:start position:0%
know at this time but in addition to the
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
the resources question you there are
 
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
concerns that I have as it pertains to
 
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
Goods in terms of our ability to enforce
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
this again not the intention behind the
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
bill because I think the intention is
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
good but I don't want and the Attorney
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
General's office doesn't want
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that it can't deliver
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
on it doesn't want to create an
 
00:44:43.069 --> 00:44:43.079 align:start position:0%
expectation that you know we are going
 
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:44.680 align:start position:0%
to make sure that this law is upheld in
 
00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
the state and then we don't have the
 
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
ability to do it because of the way it's
 
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
drafted and I think that's what you have
 
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
here on the goods portion um there is an
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
inherent complexity in determining
 
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
whether two goods are substantially
 
00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
similar um and there are four factors
 
00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:01.640 align:start position:0%
that are listed in this bill that we can
 
00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
use to determine whether so not four I'm
 
00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:07.240 align:start position:0%
sorry there's actually six factors um
 
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
the amount of time it took to
 
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
manufacture such Goods or provide such
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
services so again for services that's
 
00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
easy we could figure that out but for
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
goods I mean if you use the two razor
 
00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:20.200 align:start position:0%
blade examples the ability to figure out
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
how much manufacturing time went into a
 
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
specific razor is not something that is
 
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
easily done um we have certain
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
investigative techniques that we can use
 
00:45:31.309 --> 00:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
we can issue subpoenas to company we can
 
00:45:34.069 --> 00:45:34.079 align:start position:0%
ask them to tell us how much time um but
 
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:35.720 align:start position:0%
even if they respond and say it took
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
this many hours for this one and this
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
many hours for this one it's very
 
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
difficult if not impossible to verify
 
00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
that that's truthful short of going to
 
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
their plant where they manufacture these
 
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
products and watching them do it and
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
determining that one took longer to
 
00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:49.640 align:start position:0%
manufacture than the other one and that
 
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:51.640 align:start position:0%
same complexity and that same difficulty
 
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
applies throughout these number of
 
00:45:55.069 --> 00:45:55.079 align:start position:0%
factors that we would be entrusted with
 
00:45:56.589 --> 00:45:56.599 align:start position:0%
evaluating every every time a complaint
 
00:45:58.349 --> 00:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
about a good was filed in order to
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
determine whether it was substantially
 
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:02.079 align:start position:0%
similar or not um the difficulty in
 
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturing such Goods or offering
 
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
such Services I mean difficulty is not
 
00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:08.200 align:start position:0%
something that can be measurable in
 
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
response to a subpoena you know
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
difficulty speaks to difficulty what
 
00:46:14.589 --> 00:46:14.599 align:start position:0%
amount of skill is required to do it you
 
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
know what type of machine is used how
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
complex is that machine how many people
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
does it take to run that machine you
 
00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:21.640 align:start position:0%
know these are not the types of things
 
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
that we have the ability to meaningfully
 
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
and accurately investigate in order to
 
00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
perform that analysis of whether two
 
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
goods truly are substantially similar or
 
00:46:32.549 --> 00:46:32.559 align:start position:0%
not and I think that can be applied
 
00:46:34.549 --> 00:46:34.559 align:start position:0%
almost across the board in the various
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
different areas where you have a men's
 
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
version and a women's version of a
 
00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
product such as you know shampoos and
 
00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
body washes clothing you know if two
 
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
different sweatshirts two different
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
pairs of shoes I think it's much bigger
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
than you know if you I guess what I'll
 
00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
say is if you truly have a
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
scenario where the only difference in a
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
product is the color since we spent so
 
00:46:58.750 --> 00:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
much sh on color you know perhaps that
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
example is easier and could be done but
 
00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
that is not often the case I mean men's
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
razors look different than women's
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
razors sometimes they have more blades
 
00:47:11.309 --> 00:47:11.319 align:start position:0%
one has more blades than the other
 
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes they have different qualities
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
of blades I think you know I I just
 
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
don't know and none of us know because
 
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
we're not expertise we don't have that
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
expertise in the industry so we would be
 
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
entrusted with answering that question
 
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
every single time that a consumer file a
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
complaint and it's wouldn't be as simple
 
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
as just you know all right somebody's
 
00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
going to file a complaint against
 
00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:32.359 align:start position:0%
Gillette and then we're going to look at
 
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
all of gillette's products you know
 
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
every single brand of Razor would could
 
00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:38.079 align:start position:0%
be potentially investigated every single
 
00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:39.640 align:start position:0%
model of each razor and that's just
 
00:47:42.549 --> 00:47:42.559 align:start position:0%
razors I mean it's you know bicycles
 
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
calculators backpacks you know the the
 
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
materials that were provided give a
 
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
number of different examples and every
 
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
single one of these companies every
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
single one of these models um would be
 
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
fodder for investigation by the Attorney
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
General's office in order to determine
 
00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not the two products if
 
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
priced differently are substantially
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
similar or not based on you know the
 
00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:05.559 align:start position:0%
factors that are included in the statute
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
and I I just like to point out two other
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
you know concerns not necessarily
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
related to the substantially similar but
 
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
in reference to the relief that the AG's
 
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
office can bring and some clarifying
 
00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
that I think would be helpful there if
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
the committee decides to move forward
 
00:48:23.069 --> 00:48:23.079 align:start position:0%
with this um currently it anticipates
 
00:48:26.349 --> 00:48:26.359 align:start position:0%
that we can get restitution through a
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
court if we find that you know two
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
products are being sold that are
 
00:48:32.589 --> 00:48:32.599 align:start position:0%
substantially similar at different
 
00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
prices um it's unclear as to how we
 
00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
would go about determining the
 
00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate number of is is rest so if I
 
00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:43.640 align:start position:0%
mean one way that you could do it is it
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
would require determining every single
 
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%
product of that type of product that was
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
sold in the state ordering the company
 
00:48:52.349 --> 00:48:52.359 align:start position:0%
to pay the difference between the two
 
00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:54.079 align:start position:0%
and then administering some sort of
 
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
restitution fund where the the Attorney
 
00:48:57.789 --> 00:48:57.799 align:start position:0%
General's office is cutting checks to
 
00:48:59.950 --> 00:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
every single person in the state that
 
00:49:02.109 --> 00:49:02.119 align:start position:0%
bought one type of product and then
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
sending checks across the board I mean
 
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
that that really also goes to you know
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
the resources question and why we're
 
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
here testifying about this today and you
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
know finally Roman three under
 
00:49:17.309 --> 00:49:17.319 align:start position:0%
enforcements speaks to um we can impose
 
00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
a civil penalty not to exceed 250 for
 
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
each violation and then you know a
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
subsequent penalty for a subsequent
 
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
violation but the bill as written does
 
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
not provide any guidance as to how we
 
00:49:31.349 --> 00:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
determine what amounts to a violation in
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
order to determine how we can find a
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
business you know is a violation each
 
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
product that is sold is a violation each
 
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
type or model of a product that is put
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
into the marketplace is a violation each
 
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
day that this product is out there or is
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
a violation something else you know
 
00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:49.079 align:start position:0%
these are questions that we have to have
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
the answer to in order to be able to go
 
00:49:52.829 --> 00:49:52.839 align:start position:0%
into a court and ask them for this type
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
of relief um and if
 
00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
this does move forward I would strongly
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to think very
 
00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:01.640 align:start position:0%
carefully about defining what amounts to
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
a violation um so that the Attorney
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
General's office would have some clarity
 
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:07.880 align:start position:0%
in being able to enforce that provision
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
of the statute if it became necessary
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
questions okay representative
 
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
burrow yes thanks for taking my question
 
00:50:19.789 --> 00:50:19.799 align:start position:0%
I I was thinking about your uh example
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
that might be easier with services and I
 
00:50:23.549 --> 00:50:23.559 align:start position:0%
I mean I just thought of the buzz what
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
you suggested the buds buzz cut example
 
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
could actually be very different if a
 
00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
woman has long hair to do a buzz cut I
 
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
would think it might take more time than
 
00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
a male or if like I wanted to get my
 
00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:38.839 align:start position:0%
legs waxed and representative Terry
 
00:50:40.829 --> 00:50:40.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to get his legs waxed my guess is
 
00:50:42.789 --> 00:50:42.799 align:start position:0%
his might take more time than mine I beg
 
00:50:42.799 --> 00:50:43.589 align:start position:0%
his might take more time than mine I beg
your

00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
pardon all right I'll use chairman hunt
 
00:50:48.829 --> 00:50:48.839 align:start position:0%
as the example so you know I think that
 
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
that could be problematic too just in
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
terms of time and it would have to be
 
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
very carefully defined I think that
 
00:50:57.549 --> 00:50:57.559 align:start position:0%
you're right and but I think what this
 
00:50:59.670 --> 00:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
bill is seeking to guard against and it
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
does do a good job of this is
 
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
determining you know if in order to
 
00:51:04.789 --> 00:51:04.799 align:start position:0%
determine whether services are
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
substantially similar those are the
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
exact type of factors that we could look
 
00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
at and a business could say yeah here's
 
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
the justification you know this person
 
00:51:14.789 --> 00:51:14.799 align:start position:0%
came in but you know the the the problem
 
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
with that is that there are women out
 
00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
there that just have a buzz cut and you
 
00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
know may want to maintain their buzzcut
 
00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:21.880 align:start position:0%
and for that woman who wants to go and
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
just have her buzzcut maintain the same
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
way that a man does it may not take any
 
00:51:27.069 --> 00:51:27.079 align:start position:0%
extra time so I think that is the
 
00:51:28.829 --> 00:51:28.839 align:start position:0%
scenario that this is guarding against
 
00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:31.880 align:start position:0%
and you know if this portion of the bill
 
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
that deals with Services were enacted
 
00:51:35.309 --> 00:51:35.319 align:start position:0%
that's why I say you know under that
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
exact scenario where the services truly
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
are exactly the same there's no
 
00:51:40.829 --> 00:51:40.839 align:start position:0%
additional time required we probably
 
00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
that representative Bilo thank you this
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
is in regards to Services uh as well um
 
00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
in a salon you have many um salons have
 
00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
menus men's
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
women's a woman can go in and point at
 
00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
the men's side and just say I want a
 
00:52:08.589 --> 00:52:08.599 align:start position:0%
men's cut and I'm not sure what the
 
00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist would do but if that
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
person wants a men's cut and it's listed
 
00:52:17.309 --> 00:52:17.319 align:start position:0%
men's and women's they can point to I
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
want this men's cut or if you're going
 
00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
in for a um uh manicure again I want a
 
00:52:28.829 --> 00:52:28.839 align:start position:0%
men's manicure even if it's a female I
 
00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:32.200 align:start position:0%
think you can ask that I'm not sure I'm
 
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
a cosmetologist so you can you can well
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
the question would be is if they have a
 
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
listed price right is that
 
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
discriminatory if someone a woman says
 
00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:47.240 align:start position:0%
Okay I want that product that man's cut
 
00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
isn't that discriminatory if they say no
 
00:52:51.309 --> 00:52:51.319 align:start position:0%
you can't have it or we're going to have
 
00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
to charge you more wouldn't that be
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
discrimination which is what the intent
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
of this legislation I think that it
 
00:52:58.950 --> 00:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
certainly would
 
00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
violate this
 
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
legislation if what you had is arbitrary
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
pricing for the exact same Services
 
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
determined only by the gender of the
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
person who's asking for the service well
 
00:53:13.710 --> 00:53:13.720 align:start position:0%
the reason I say that is because to me I
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
I I look at the consumer protection act
 
00:53:18.589 --> 00:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
is is to to make the consumer whole you
 
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
know to to you know the restitution is
 
00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
yes it's true we have triple damages but
 
00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day the the idea is to
 
00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:29.240 align:start position:0%
get the Merchant or get to to not um not
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh discriminate or and so I'm looking at
 
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
the Discrimination aspect here and that
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh if if someone is is
 
00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
overcharging okay simply because of
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
their sex um I guess would go to the
 
00:53:45.309 --> 00:53:45.319 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission you could take
 
00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
it but our consumer protection statute
 
00:53:50.349 --> 00:53:50.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any language around that
 
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:53.240 align:start position:0%
the fact that you could not charge more
 
00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
simply because of your sex I'm not sure
 
00:53:57.870 --> 00:53:57.880 align:start position:0%
I agree with that and I think that you
 
00:54:00.589 --> 00:54:00.599 align:start position:0%
know that that that is a point that I
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
overlooked and it's a good one to make
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
which is that our consumer protection
 
00:54:08.349 --> 00:54:08.359 align:start position:0%
act currently Outlaws unfair or
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
deceptive Acts or practices and there's
 
00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
a substantial body of case law that
 
00:54:15.309 --> 00:54:15.319 align:start position:0%
defines what is a deceptive practice um
 
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
and it's pretty well defined and pretty
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
easy to spot you know saying something
 
00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
is something when it's something else
 
00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
you know saying something is endorsed by
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
someone when it isn't basically lying to
 
00:54:25.789 --> 00:54:25.799 align:start position:0%
people in order to get them to buy
 
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
something they would otherwise wouldn't
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
buy but the unfairness prong is very
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
open to interpretation and basically
 
00:54:34.589 --> 00:54:34.599 align:start position:0%
looks to you know is the practice
 
00:54:37.109 --> 00:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
unconscionable is the practice you
 
00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
know would it raise the eyebrow of
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
somebody in in the world of Commerce and
 
00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
charging the exact same price for no
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
other arbitrary reason other than you
 
00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:48.200 align:start position:0%
know the perceived gender of the person
 
00:54:50.109 --> 00:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
requesting the service could that be an
 
00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
unfair practice under the consumer
 
00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:55.480 align:start position:0%
protection act absolutely okay so that's
 
00:54:58.270 --> 00:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
my question is that if that is then I
 
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
think the issue that we all agree on is
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
that no no one should ever be charged
 
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
more because of their sex right but that
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
if if if that they can get that service
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
like service and at that same price so
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
you feel confident that the consumer
 
00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
protection act would protect for that
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
situation or should we should we drop
 
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
another line in there to uh clarify
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
that I will not say that I feel
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
confident because unfairness is defi I
 
00:55:29.549 --> 00:55:29.559 align:start position:0%
mean there's no clear way to define
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
unfairness other than when you see
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
something and you say we think this
 
00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
practice is unfair you investigate it
 
00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
you determine the purpose behind the
 
00:55:39.309 --> 00:55:39.319 align:start position:0%
practice the impact of the practice and
 
00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
you know whether the practice is
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
something that is so contrary to what's
 
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
acceptable in our society that it you
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
know it shocks the conscience and it's a
 
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
case by case analysis that has to be
 
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
done and is always dependent on the
 
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
specific facts of the specific practice
 
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
ice you're looking at so I absolutely
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
think I will say I am confident that
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
under the right circumstances if you had
 
00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:05.480 align:start position:0%
a business that was charging different
 
00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
amounts for the exact same services with
 
00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely no other basis other than you
 
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
know gender race age anything else you
 
00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:19.240 align:start position:0%
know some arbitrary you know thing like
 
00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
that that had absolutely no bearing on
 
00:56:23.549 --> 00:56:23.559 align:start position:0%
you know the cost of providing the
 
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
product or the service all the things
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
that that I I as the consumer protection
 
00:56:28.829 --> 00:56:28.839 align:start position:0%
bureau chief would investigate that as
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
an unfair practice and whe whether a
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
court would ultimately agree or not I
 
00:56:35.069 --> 00:56:35.079 align:start position:0%
can't so we're going to take this up in
 
00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:37.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee in u the first week of
 
00:56:39.069 --> 00:56:39.079 align:start position:0%
February or so so it'll give you some
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
time to think that one through but that
 
00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of you feel
 
00:56:44.829 --> 00:56:44.839 align:start position:0%
comfortable because I think that is a
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
that's a the loose end here question
 
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
here um that that we would certainly
 
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
hope the consumer protection act would
 
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
protect a consumer from a merchant
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
saying no you can't have that price you
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
can't have that I mean again you know I
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
don't know that I'm going to be able to
 
00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
you know think it over and be able to
 
00:57:02.349 --> 00:57:02.359 align:start position:0%
provide a more clear answer because it
 
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
all depends on the circumstances okay
 
00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
but in that like the perfect storm of
 
00:57:09.870 --> 00:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
what is needed under this statute which
 
00:57:13.309 --> 00:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
is identical service identical product
 
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely no difference other than
 
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
we're charging a woman more for this
 
00:57:19.309 --> 00:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
than a man I think that is an unfair
 
00:57:22.029 --> 00:57:22.039 align:start position:0%
practice and I would if that complaint
 
00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:23.799 align:start position:0%
came into my office and my Bureau and I
 
00:57:27.549 --> 00:57:27.559 align:start position:0%
looked at it I would invest perfect
 
00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:29.960 align:start position:0%
representa you have another question and
 
00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:31.720 align:start position:0%
I see we have some other hands here um
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony you you
 
00:57:33.839 --> 00:57:36.029 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony you you
mentioned

00:57:36.029 --> 00:57:36.039 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:37.480 align:start position:0%
discrimination you mentioned
 
00:57:40.029 --> 00:57:40.039 align:start position:0%
discrimination on the basis of
 
00:57:42.829 --> 00:57:42.839 align:start position:0%
age could that be applied to say a
 
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
senior discount where uh someone over
 
00:57:49.069 --> 00:57:49.079 align:start position:0%
the age of 55 is charged 20% less than
 
00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
someone under the age of 55 would would
 
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection Clause apply to
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
that scenario on age
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
in that giving seniors a discount is an
 
00:57:59.119 --> 00:58:00.349 align:start position:0%
in that giving seniors a discount is an
unfair

00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
unfair
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
practice yes that's what he say you you
 
00:58:04.829 --> 00:58:04.839 align:start position:0%
mentioned you mentioned discrimination
 
00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:07.240 align:start position:0%
on the basis of age and that's that I'm
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
just asking if that applies well I think
 
00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
there's a difference
 
00:58:14.589 --> 00:58:14.599 align:start position:0%
between charging people more for
 
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
something for no reason other than you
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
know I see where you're going yeah I
 
00:58:23.069 --> 00:58:23.079 align:start position:0%
think that our society has commonly
 
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:25.160 align:start position:0%
accepted that you know seniors citizens
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
are entitled to discounts on things from
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
time to time and I do not think that is
 
00:58:32.309 --> 00:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
an unfair practice to apply those and
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
this this is what I mean about you know
 
00:58:35.829 --> 00:58:35.839 align:start position:0%
shocks the conscience you know under the
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act you have an
 
00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:39.400 align:start position:0%
unfairness standard and you know whether
 
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
the practice shocks the conscience of
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
society is one of the key factors that
 
00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
we look at to determine whether it
 
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
amounts to unfairness as anticipated by
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
that statute I think that as a society
 
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
we routinely and regularly you know give
 
00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:53.240 align:start position:0%
senior citizens discounts on various
 
00:58:55.549 --> 00:58:55.559 align:start position:0%
things with good reason so I do not
 
00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
think that it would fit that definition
 
00:58:58.990 --> 00:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
just one quick followup thank you Mr
 
00:59:01.109 --> 00:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
chair uh how do you determine what
 
00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
shocks the conscience of society how do
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
you make that determination just just
 
00:59:07.029 --> 00:59:07.039 align:start position:0%
curious because this is a a bigger
 
00:59:08.789 --> 00:59:08.799 align:start position:0%
discussion I think thank you it's Case
 
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
by case you know you look at the
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
practice you look at if the practice is
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
an outlier in the industry you know it's
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
completely contrary to what everyone
 
00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839 align:start position:0%
else is doing what you know people deem
 
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
acceptable um there's the standard that
 
00:59:24.029 --> 00:59:24.039 align:start position:0%
has been adopted that you know it says
 
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
that the the actor practice you know is
 
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
sufficient has a sufficient level of
 
00:59:31.029 --> 00:59:31.039 align:start position:0%
rascality that it would raise the
 
00:59:33.029 --> 00:59:33.039 align:start position:0%
eyebrow of those that are familiar with
 
00:59:35.549 --> 00:59:35.559 align:start position:0%
the world of Commerce so if people that
 
00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
are familiar with the world of Commerce
 
00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:39.160 align:start position:0%
look at a practice and say whoa that's
 
00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
way out of line you know that's there's
 
00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
no reason for that that's bad that's
 
00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
predatory you know that's but it's a
 
00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:48.280 align:start position:0%
squishy analysis there's no like one
 
00:59:50.109 --> 00:59:50.119 align:start position:0%
factor that you can look at and say if
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
this then shocks the conscience it's a
 
00:59:54.029 --> 00:59:54.039 align:start position:0%
caseby casee basis and that's why I say
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
I can't say I'm comfortable that you
 
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
know the consumer protection act would
 
00:59:59.029 --> 00:59:59.039 align:start position:0%
cover this because it would depend on
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
the very specific facts of the practice
 
01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
how long it would be going on for what
 
01:00:04.990 --> 01:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
the basis was what the impact was the
 
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
exact specifics of what was going on all
 
01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:08.680 align:start position:0%
those things are relevant to doing a
 
01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
much bigger legal analysis of whether or
 
01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
not it potentially violates our statute
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay so um I see seven hands and we're
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
already have again getting behind
 
01:00:23.710 --> 01:00:23.720 align:start position:0%
ourselves so or would you be willing to
 
01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:26.200 align:start position:0%
stay around so these reps who have more
 
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
questions should you would be able to
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
take them out in the hallway for us is
 
01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
that like right now yeah like right now
 
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
otherwise you could call
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
him I think he should go back call
 
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
somebody in California and New York and
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
they have all the answers and then the
 
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
next comes here we wouldn't be he would
 
01:00:49.109 --> 01:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
have the answers right talk into the
 
01:00:51.069 --> 01:00:51.079 align:start position:0%
microphone please so the question the
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
question is being posed is that uh given
 
01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
that we will be having a subcommittee in
 
01:00:59.309 --> 01:00:59.319 align:start position:0%
early February is he willing to call
 
01:01:03.069 --> 01:01:03.079 align:start position:0%
people in California and New York and
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
see how they address these issues but I
 
01:01:10.109 --> 01:01:10.119 align:start position:0%
I don't to me it's pointless because
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
everybody's consumer every State's
 
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
consumer protection statute is separate
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
is different and ours is unique and this
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
is the man who's in charge of enforcing
 
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
our consumer protection statute so I
 
01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
have full confidence that if ever
 
01:01:27.029 --> 01:01:27.039 align:start position:0%
someone had a complaint or has a problem
 
01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
and they call him up and he will respond
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
that and because he's actually got a
 
01:01:33.029 --> 01:01:33.039 align:start position:0%
whole he got volunteer you still have
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
the volunteers that help that help out
 
01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
and help people and that they can
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
address these these issues I'd be more
 
01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:43.160 align:start position:0%
than happy to provide my contact
 
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
information if folks have questions they
 
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
can follow up with me I don't think it
 
01:01:50.029 --> 01:01:50.039 align:start position:0%
would be meaningful to Simply call New
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
York and say hey how's it going New York
 
01:01:53.789 --> 01:01:53.799 align:start position:0%
is a very different state than New
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um their attorney general's
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
office is significantly larger than ours
 
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
is and it is just not a fair comparison
 
01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
um however you know I think one inquiry
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
that could potentially be helpful you
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
know if the resources were allocated to
 
01:02:17.269 --> 01:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
us to enforce this would be to see
 
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
whether any enforcement actions have
 
01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:21.880 align:start position:0%
been brought under the goods prong of
 
01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
this in either New York or California
 
01:02:26.269 --> 01:02:26.279 align:start position:0%
assuming that this legislation is
 
01:02:28.269 --> 01:02:28.279 align:start position:0%
identical and whether there were any
 
01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
issues okay okay all right is that okay
 
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
for those who want to keep asking more
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
questions and we're already behind well
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
I actually had a comment at the ex
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
director of The Human Rights Commission
 
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
that I thought might be helpful I think
 
01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:43.960 align:start position:0%
you can you can do that in the
 
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I will the subcommittee
 
01:02:48.029 --> 01:02:48.039 align:start position:0%
would be great to hear I will do that
 
01:02:50.029 --> 01:02:50.039 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chairperson could you you
 
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
provide my contact information to the
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
committee if anybody has followup
 
01:02:56.029 --> 01:02:56.039 align:start position:0%
questions best thing to do is that um if
 
01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
you if you email and just say email
 
01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
house Commerce with your information and
 
01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
that will go to everybody in the
 
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
committee room what's the specific
 
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
at I'll figure it
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
out I'm sorry I appreciate you uh doing
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
this for me thank you no problem okay
 
01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
thanks all right so I will I will close
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on
 
01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
1406 I didn't read the blue sheet uh
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:39.589 align:start position:0%
 
there

01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
and and since since we're there's
 
01:03:44.269 --> 01:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
nothing on how about 1071 might as well
 
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
bring it over while we're at okay all
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
right we're g to Now open up uh the
 
01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
public heing and House Bill 1071 the
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
right to repair certain educational
 
01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
technology and do I
 
01:03:58.630 --> 01:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
have the pink cards do you did you fill
 
01:04:01.069 --> 01:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
out a pink card no you can do it later
 
01:04:08.349 --> 01:04:08.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
later so I also have um an amendment to
 
01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:15.309 align:start position:0%
later so I also have um an amendment to
pass

01:04:15.309 --> 01:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:15.319 --> 01:04:17.589 align:start position:0%
 
around

01:04:17.589 --> 01:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
um yeah right so we've had a right to
 
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
repair type legislation in the past and
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
somewhat similar
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
so okay go ahead so hi I'm uh Eric
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
gallager uh representative for maram
 
01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
County District 20 um which is conquered
 
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
W 6 and I'm here to introduce HB 1071
 
01:04:48.349 --> 01:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
relative to the right to repair sir and
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
educational technology so yeah you're
 
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
right that um I did actually have a
 
01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
previous right to repair bill um earlier
 
01:05:01.309 --> 01:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
this term um the main difference there
 
01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
between them is um just what specific
 
01:05:09.309 --> 01:05:09.319 align:start position:0%
type of product is focusing on um the
 
01:05:09.319 --> 01:05:10.309 align:start position:0%
type of product is focusing on um the
previous

01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
previous
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
one was more focused on uh home
 
01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
appliances so stuff like blenders or
 
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
mixers or irons um close irons or stuff
 
01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
like that and then this one's more
 
01:05:28.589 --> 01:05:28.599 align:start position:0%
focused on um educational
 
01:05:31.269 --> 01:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
technology so the specific motivating
 
01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
case for this one um is for cases where
 
01:05:41.269 --> 01:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
um where school districts have bought a
 
01:05:45.309 --> 01:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
large number of Chromebooks and then
 
01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
been unable to repair them because
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
Google won't
 
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
um refuses to repair them anymore and
 
01:05:56.069 --> 01:05:56.079 align:start position:0%
also refuses to let um anyone else
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
repair them either um since apparently
 
01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
doing so
 
01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
would require information that they're
 
01:06:10.829 --> 01:06:10.839 align:start position:0%
not willing to give out um so actually
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
um since having filed this bill um the
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
case where the court case where um
 
01:06:23.269 --> 01:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
Google and um school districts were
 
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
fighting this out Court actually um got
 
01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:32.200 align:start position:0%
settled and Google agreed to um allow
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
them allow these Chromebooks to be
 
01:06:40.269 --> 01:06:40.279 align:start position:0%
repairable um but I still think having
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
the law on the
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
books is good anyways just in case they
 
01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
later change their minds or in case
 
01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with some other um
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
just in case there's a problem with some
 
01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:54.990 align:start position:0%
just in case there's a problem with some
other

01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
educational technology provider refusing
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
to repair
 
01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
stuff um so yeah the
 
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.870 align:start position:0%
stuff um so yeah the
um

01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
and this will save School District's
 
01:07:12.029 --> 01:07:12.039 align:start position:0%
money um since yeah if they can repair
 
01:07:13.269 --> 01:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
their products they don't have to be
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
buying new ones as much and spending
 
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
taxpayers dollars on that um and so to
 
01:07:25.549 --> 01:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
um address the amendment
 
01:07:28.029 --> 01:07:28.039 align:start position:0%
um a bit um there was one little
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
drafting issue
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
um where um with the definition of
 
01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
necessary software updates
 
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:07:43.549 --> 01:07:43.559 align:start position:0%
um yeah if you look at how it's
 
01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:46.839 align:start position:0%
currently written um just it's a runon
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
sense with
 
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
um commas so necessary the existing text
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
necessary software updates means
 
01:07:57.150 --> 01:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
security updates to patch exploits that
 
01:07:59.910 --> 01:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
if left un addressed leave the user
 
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to cyber crime bu bug fixes
 
01:08:05.269 --> 01:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
patches Corrections it sounds like those
 
01:08:06.910 --> 01:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
last three bug fixes patches and
 
01:08:09.029 --> 01:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
Corrections are the things being that
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
the users being left vulnerable to but
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
um it's not actually uh modifying that
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
um it goes with the security updates
 
01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
from previously so um the amendment just
 
01:08:25.829 --> 01:08:25.839 align:start position:0%
kind of clarifies that wording there um
 
01:08:29.309 --> 01:08:29.319 align:start position:0%
by splitting it into a separate sentence
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
um and also just some um updates on the
 
01:08:35.149 --> 01:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
state of other right to repair
 
01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
legislation around the country um so
 
01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
California has
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
passed um some of their right to repair
 
01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:47.239 align:start position:0%
legislation um and I think that's kind
 
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
of an instructive case to look at um
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
because I remember getting questions
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
here at the previous hearing oh well
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
won't this be burdensome on the um
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
companies that have to comply with it
 
01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:08.759 align:start position:0%
and that was the um that was the AR
 
01:09:11.309 --> 01:09:11.319 align:start position:0%
argument that Apple was making at first
 
01:09:14.189 --> 01:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
against California's law um but then
 
01:09:16.749 --> 01:09:16.759 align:start position:0%
after looking for it some looking at it
 
01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
some more they realized oh actually we
 
01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:21.759 align:start position:0%
can comply with this and it'll be fine
 
01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
and then um they ended up supporting it
 
01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
in the end um so yeah I think that would
 
01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
be the same case
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
here um if and so Minnesota's also
 
01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
passed right to repair um and the FTC
 
01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
has also been making taking steps
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
towards um
 
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh doing federal administrative rulle
 
01:09:53.349 --> 01:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
making um about right to repair but um
 
01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
having talked with uh some people in
 
01:09:59.189 --> 01:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
contact with them they do say that it
 
01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
would be also good to do this at the
 
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
state level as well um
 
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
just you know to kind of show that
 
01:10:10.590 --> 01:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
there's momentum behind it and that
 
01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
people actually want this um
 
01:10:18.270 --> 01:10:18.280 align:start position:0%
so yeah
 
01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
um that's HB 1071 uh I'll take questions
 
01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:24.669 align:start position:0%
um that's HB 1071 uh I'll take questions
now

01:10:24.669 --> 01:10:24.679 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
great any questions from committee
 
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
members representative
 
01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you um uh representative
 
01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um in the original bill um and
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
in the amendment um uh I'm looking at
 
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh this is line three uh
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
it refers to security updates used to
 
01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:48.870 align:start position:0%
it refers to security updates used to
patch

01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
patch
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
exploits um and I I'm not sure that that
 
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
exploits is is really the word that
 
01:10:57.790 --> 01:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
should be there um maybe errors I I'm
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
not sure what no exploits is the correct
 
01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
word that's the term of Art in the um
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
computer security word for world for um
 
01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:10.280 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities that uh an attacker
 
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
could potentially take advantage of it
 
01:11:15.390 --> 01:11:15.400 align:start position:0%
it is a term of art yeah I'll take your
 
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
word for it thank
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
you okay any other questions from the
 
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
committee members seeing none thank you
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
very much all right um thanks I have one
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
other card here Chris Gil
 
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
techet representative G you you will
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
fill out a card right yeah okay great go
 
01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
ahead thank
 
01:11:43.870 --> 01:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
you oh yeah you
 
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
gotta better uh my name is Chris gilrain
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
I represent TechNet in the Northeast
 
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
TechNet is a trade Association uh
 
01:11:53.149 --> 01:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
comprised of over a 100 companies in the
 
01:11:56.110 --> 01:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
innovation economy uh here in opposition
 
01:11:59.550 --> 01:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
to age 1071 uh techet member companies
 
01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh that do manufacture technology like
 
01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
this uh strive to offer a broad network
 
01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
of trained authorized repair Outlets uh
 
01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
for technology like this to be repaired
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
uh these are complex systems uh that
 
01:12:15.070 --> 01:12:15.080 align:start position:0%
also tend to house a significant amount
 
01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
of personal data uh so in this case it
 
01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
would be you know student teacher School
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
District data uh on on these uh devices
 
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
using authorized repair channels uh make
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
has uh accountability both for the
 
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
safety of the repair particularly when
 
01:12:33.790 --> 01:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
we're talking about things like lithium
 
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
I ion batteries as well as the security
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
of the data that is housed on those
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
devices uh for those reasons uh we
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
oppose h171 uh as it uh does not include
 
01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
uh necessary protections for that data
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
or uh necessary training for the people
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
who would be uh doing these repairs
 
01:12:54.990 --> 01:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time and happy to take
 
01:12:57.629 --> 01:12:57.639 align:start position:0%

members of the committee thank you for
 
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
allowing me to introduce house pill 1624
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is scw Wallace
 
01:14:26.110 --> 01:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
rocking County District 8 the town of
 
01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
Danville uh once again I'm introducing
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
my bill that would remove the proabition
 
01:14:33.070 --> 01:14:33.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire on the uh home
 
01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
distillation of spirits as you're all
 
01:14:38.830 --> 01:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
probably aware we just became legally
 
01:14:40.629 --> 01:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
able to make our own wine and beer here
 
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
in the state in 2012 or 13 Even though
 
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
the craft brewing Act was signed into
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
law by President coder in
 
01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
1978 um as we all know the Liquor
 
01:14:53.070 --> 01:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
Commission has a Kung Fu grip on all
 
01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
things things liquor uh and as such
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
without that uh permission slip from The
 
01:14:59.430 --> 01:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission you can't do anything
 
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
related to that uh that being said we
 
01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
did get successfully the ability to brew
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
wine and beer uh about a decade ago and
 
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
this is just the natural um evolution of
 
01:15:12.189 --> 01:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
the hobby if you will um my bill would
 
01:15:14.669 --> 01:15:14.679 align:start position:0%
allow uh those of us that Brew wine and
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
beer at home um in the particular
 
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
quantities that were allowed to 100
 
01:15:20.910 --> 01:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
gallons maximum per household with a
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
single individual insid household or up
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
to 200 gallons of wine or beer um with
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
two or more individuals in that
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
household only that amount of wine or
 
01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
beer also known as wash or Mash in the
 
01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
trade uh could be used to produce
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
alcohol which would give you roughly a
 
01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
10% yield so maybe somewhere between you
 
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
know 10 to 20 gallons as a function of
 
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
your household side and how ambitious
 
01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
you might be in the in the pursuit of
 
01:15:49.950 --> 01:15:49.960 align:start position:0%
this um the bill has been amended a
 
01:15:52.669 --> 01:15:52.679 align:start position:0%
couple of times over the years and as
 
01:15:54.149 --> 01:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
introduced this is how the bill was
 
01:15:55.629 --> 01:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
amended most
 
01:15:58.830 --> 01:15:58.840 align:start position:0%
recently um currently there are nine
 
01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
states um that allow home desolation of
 
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
spirits uh some of our neighbors
 
01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
including Maine Massachusetts and Rhode
 
01:16:09.390 --> 01:16:09.400 align:start position:0%
Island most nearby others are spread
 
01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
throughout the country Alaska uh Arizona
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
in Iowa and Indiana I believe in
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
Missouri was the first um historically
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh we've had an issue getting it out of
 
01:16:22.629 --> 01:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
committee uh on the basis that this is
 
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
not lawful federally um well that
 
01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to matter in these nine
 
01:16:28.590 --> 01:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
other states they've moved this forward
 
01:16:30.629 --> 01:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
and um New Hampshire does have a
 
01:16:32.310 --> 01:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
tradition of doing things on our own
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
despite what the federal Regulators or
 
01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
our federal overlords might say um if we
 
01:16:39.709 --> 01:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
consider we've got um medical marijuana
 
01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
program here in the state already um
 
01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
this very committee has several bills
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
that they're considering moving forward
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
that would um legalize cannabis
 
01:16:50.830 --> 01:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
recreationally despite the federal
 
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
prohibition on that activity and also
 
01:16:55.229 --> 01:16:55.239 align:start position:0%
Firearms we were we're at 2A Sanctuary
 
01:16:59.310 --> 01:16:59.320 align:start position:0%
State as of last bium so we won't um
 
01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
under the color of law help to enforce
 
01:17:03.510 --> 01:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
any federal firearms laws promulgated
 
01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
after uh one January 20th 2021 at this
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
so I think that that uh that argument
 
01:17:13.709 --> 01:17:13.719 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't move this forward
 
01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
based on it being uh unlawful federally
 
01:17:17.790 --> 01:17:17.800 align:start position:0%
is that's probably in the riew mayor at
 
01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
this point
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
um interestingly uh there was a a
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
lawsuit filed in um the end of December
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
of last year uh out of Tampa district
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
court or Tampa federal court excuse me I
 
01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
haven't read the pleadings yet it's it's
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
very new but this lawsuit argues that um
 
01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
the prohibition on hobby distillation at
 
01:17:43.470 --> 01:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
the federal level is in uh is
 
01:17:45.229 --> 01:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional based on the repeal of
 
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
olet act which was Prohibition as you
 
01:17:49.709 --> 01:17:49.719 align:start position:0%
know so it'll be very interesting to see
 
01:17:52.270 --> 01:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
how that lawsuit moves forward and what
 
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
the outcome of
 
01:17:57.390 --> 01:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
of it is um additionally going back
 
01:17:59.070 --> 01:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
eight years ago when I first introduced
 
01:18:01.149 --> 01:18:01.159 align:start position:0%
this bill um we've had a little bit of
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
movement at The Liquor Commission
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
initially they weren't all on board and
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
I think they've moved to kind of a
 
01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
neutral position at this point um I
 
01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
expect they'll be uh testifying behind
 
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
me to their actual position so don't
 
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
take my word for it um so that's where
 
01:18:18.189 --> 01:18:18.199 align:start position:0%
we're at at this point in time this is a
 
01:18:19.950 --> 01:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
uh an upand cominging activity for the
 
01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
for the home distillers and um we're
 
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
making progress throughout the country
 
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
and um I'm asking that you would uh
 
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
support us in this endeavor I'd be happy
 
01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
to take any questions okay so I I have
 
01:18:33.390 --> 01:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
the the most straightforward question
 
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
yes sir have you ever applied for a
 
01:18:37.390 --> 01:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
federal license
 
01:18:40.030 --> 01:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
no do you know therefore you have no
 
01:18:42.629 --> 01:18:42.639 align:start position:0%
idea what a federal license would cost
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
we've looked into it it's uh in order to
 
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
do this even the smallest federal
 
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
license is about a $1,600 that's not
 
01:18:50.510 --> 01:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
what I
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
heard so why don't you do a little
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
investigated work and find out what
 
01:18:58.910 --> 01:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
exactly the federal government is
 
01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
requiring so that maybe we could pass a
 
01:19:04.510 --> 01:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
law that says that youve got if you got
 
01:19:07.870 --> 01:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
your federal license you can absolutely
 
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
home still you're missing the point
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt the point of the bill is
 
01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
to remove the state prohibition the
 
01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
federal government has already granted
 
01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
us authority to make the alcohol alcohol
 
01:19:20.669 --> 01:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
as you know is produced during the
 
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
fermentation process which is already
 
01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:23.470 align:start position:0%
fermentation process which is already
lost

01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
lost
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
in all 50 states and territories so the
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
act of distilling is merely
 
01:19:30.189 --> 01:19:30.199 align:start position:0%
concentrating the already lawful
 
01:19:31.950 --> 01:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
production of alcohol that is that
 
01:19:34.350 --> 01:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
occurs at the fermentation process we
 
01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
have a chicken or yeg problem
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
here clearly the federal government has
 
01:19:43.030 --> 01:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
a law whether they enforce it or
 
01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
not it's not you know
 
01:19:48.629 --> 01:19:48.639 align:start position:0%
we're the end of the day they expect us
 
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
to enforce their
 
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
laws and all I'm saying to you is what I
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
want to know is what it would cost for
 
01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
you as an individual to get a
 
01:20:03.149 --> 01:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
license it doesn't cost anything to get
 
01:20:05.470 --> 01:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
a license to make beer or wine because
 
01:20:07.390 --> 01:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't exist and that is the point
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
at which alcohol which is the key
 
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
ingredient is created and the creation
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
is the issue fair enough okay
 
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
additionally i' I'd turn that around and
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
say what are you even taking up cannabis
 
01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
for in this committee it's not legal
 
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
federally so
 
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
we absolutely the commission as a member
 
01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
of that commission what it was made
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
clear to us is that at this
 
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
point and it could change the Attorney
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
General's office the federal attorney
 
01:20:40.510 --> 01:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
general's office does not allocate any
 
01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
money for enforcement of marijuana
 
01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
statute and so therefore that is the
 
01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
reason why states are able to go ahead
 
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
and do it but at any moment
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
at any moment a drop of a hat the
 
01:20:59.669 --> 01:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
Attorney General might decide that they
 
01:21:02.629 --> 01:21:02.639 align:start position:0%
do want to prosecute and then there
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
would be a problem across the country it
 
01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
sure would but what I've heard lately is
 
01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
that President Biden has uh there is
 
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
already a proposal to remove moove it
 
01:21:16.709 --> 01:21:16.719 align:start position:0%
from schedule one to schedule three
 
01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
correct and this there's been a um an
 
01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
Unwritten shall we say non- enforcement
 
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
of the of the home distillers
 
01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
Moonshiners that's a completely
 
01:21:26.629 --> 01:21:26.639 align:start position:0%
different subject matter and a
 
01:21:28.629 --> 01:21:28.639 align:start position:0%
completely different scale and uh that's
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of Revenue production um
 
01:21:32.629 --> 01:21:32.639 align:start position:0%
but this is not if you want to use that
 
01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
analogy about the
 
01:21:36.510 --> 01:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
marijuana I have no idea where the
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's has any money or the
 
01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
or the DEA has any money to go enforce
 
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
the home distilling
 
01:21:47.070 --> 01:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
statute theoretically if they're
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
not there's nothing stopping anybody to
 
01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:50.709 align:start position:0%
not there's nothing stopping anybody to
home

01:21:50.709 --> 01:21:50.719 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:21:53.070 --> 01:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
distill I can assure you are liqu
 
01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
commission is not out there looking for
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
anybody they're not trying to enforce
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
anything unless somebody drops a you
 
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
know a dime on them so if you want to
 
01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
use the marijuana analogy I say you
 
01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
should go ahead and just keep home
 
01:22:08.350 --> 01:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
distilling because nobody's going to
 
01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:09.629 align:start position:0%
distilling because nobody's going to
enforce

01:22:09.629 --> 01:22:09.639 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
01:22:12.669 --> 01:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
it but but the fact remains that they
 
01:22:15.270 --> 01:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
could so that's why we're here to do
 
01:22:17.629 --> 01:22:17.639 align:start position:0%
this the right way well I'm say all
 
01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
those states have passed it have all
 
01:22:23.669 --> 01:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
said with a caveat that just by the way
 
01:22:26.590 --> 01:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
it's not legal
 
01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:28.830 align:start position:0%
it's not legal
correct

01:22:28.830 --> 01:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:22:31.629 --> 01:22:31.639 align:start position:0%
okay we have a representative
 
01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:34.639 align:start position:0%
representative mcve how are you sir good
 
01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
good lot of shoveling this morning okay
 
01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
um a question yes I'm a little confused
 
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
here but I think you might have
 
01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
inadvertently answered my question
 
01:22:47.229 --> 01:22:47.239 align:start position:0%
you're only talking about distilling
 
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
from wine and beer is that because you
 
01:22:52.030 --> 01:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
don't need a license to do that so this
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't include include grains and corn
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
and anything like that no actually uh
 
01:22:59.669 --> 01:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
wine beer mash and wash they're all
 
01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
synon they're all the same yes I mean
 
01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
beer is often made from grains uh not
 
01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
just uh barley and and hops or rice wine
 
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
is typically made from grapes uh but
 
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes fruit um so anything that you
 
01:23:16.629 --> 01:23:16.639 align:start position:0%
can ferment can be distilled so you
 
01:23:19.149 --> 01:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
could use sorghum you could use you know
 
01:23:22.270 --> 01:23:22.280 align:start position:0%
strawberries bananas coconut anything
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
anything with a sugar in it or a starch
 
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
can be fermented and produce alcohol
 
01:23:28.350 --> 01:23:28.360 align:start position:0%
quick follow F question you you you
 
01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
could make bourbon you could make Jin
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
you could make vodka you can make all
 
01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:34.639 align:start position:0%
those things correct okay thank you very
 
01:23:39.149 --> 01:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
much sorry melair sorry
 
01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
sorry okay haven't seen you so long I
 
01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
gave the wrong name to you okay all
 
01:23:48.350 --> 01:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
post would would would you believe that
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
I believe it was in 2022 I passed a bill
 
01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
Liquors we did file it last year this is
 
01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:07.719 align:start position:0%
fourth or fifth time around at this
 
01:24:10.270 --> 01:24:10.280 align:start position:0%
point it pass you may have voted for it
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
but it was it did pass no we we we have
 
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
not passed it because we didn't want to
 
01:24:18.270 --> 01:24:18.280 align:start position:0%
send the false impression to anyone that
 
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
that it was actually legal to do it if
 
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
you go past it if we stay pass it and
 
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%
the Govern Governor signs it everybody
 
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
oh well we can go out and do it and then
 
01:24:28.590 --> 01:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
when the feds show up or some you know
 
01:24:30.830 --> 01:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
get S gets enforced or someone drops a
 
01:24:32.669 --> 01:24:32.679 align:start position:0%
dime and all of a sudden you've got you
 
01:24:36.030 --> 01:24:36.040 align:start position:0%
know the ATF not the DEA the ATF
 
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
visiting you you might want to blame the
 
01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:41.560 align:start position:0%
Hamshire legislature for passing
 
01:24:46.510 --> 01:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
it any other okay did so you're all said
 
01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
okay and representative
 
01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
Ammon thank you representative for
 
01:24:52.510 --> 01:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
taking our questions of course and and
 
01:24:54.109 --> 01:24:54.119 align:start position:0%
full disclosure I'm a co-sponsor on this
 
01:24:57.229 --> 01:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
so um are you allowed to ask questions
 
01:24:58.830 --> 01:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
uh I think I can ask questions or
 
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
testify I can't do both correct it's
 
01:25:05.390 --> 01:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
fine just not both um you gave the uh
 
01:25:09.149 --> 01:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
the uh example of us being a second
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
amendment Sanctuary State could could we
 
01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
do something similar with with liquor
 
01:25:15.550 --> 01:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement that uh you know the the
 
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
state resources wouldn't be used to
 
01:25:21.669 --> 01:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
enforce Federal home home distilling uh
 
01:25:21.679 --> 01:25:22.990 align:start position:0%
enforce Federal home home distilling uh
enforcement

01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
it um it sounds like a potential
 
01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment representative Ammon that's
 
01:25:29.310 --> 01:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
what he's saying yes I don't see why we
 
01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:31.229 align:start position:0%
what he's saying yes I don't see why we
couldn't

01:25:31.229 --> 01:25:31.239 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay okay anything basically uh if I
 
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
understand it correctly is we would pass
 
01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
a statute that would say that the Liquor
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
Commission would not enforce the
 
01:25:44.830 --> 01:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
statute which would be a similar
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
position to the state of Iowa it's they
 
01:25:48.990 --> 01:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
don't specifically that's what they did
 
01:25:50.830 --> 01:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
they've taken a position that they
 
01:25:53.070 --> 01:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
haven't said it's okay but they're they
 
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
they also they're not going to uhfor say
 
01:25:57.870 --> 01:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
that it's unlawful they're neutral on it
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
do what you want all
 
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
right thank you very
 
01:26:03.870 --> 01:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
much I have one other card here
 
01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
representative canton's from comp
 
01:26:12.590 --> 01:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
sorry good morning Mr chair and thank
 
01:26:18.229 --> 01:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
you members of the committee um I'm here
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
to support I'm also a co-sponsor on this
 
01:26:24.910 --> 01:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
bill and I'm coming at it from a kind of
 
01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
a different angle um we've been toying
 
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
around with the idea of buying a
 
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
still um for experimentation purposes
 
01:26:35.629 --> 01:26:35.639 align:start position:0%
because I have a farm and I grow
 
01:26:35.639 --> 01:26:36.910 align:start position:0%
because I have a farm and I grow
specialty

01:26:36.910 --> 01:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
specialty
 
01:26:40.830 --> 01:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
berries um but Stills are kind of
 
01:26:43.830 --> 01:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
expensive uh you you know in the scheme
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
of things uh especially if you're not
 
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
sure about the legality of it and I've
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
heard here said that it won't be
 
01:26:55.950 --> 01:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
enforced but if you're going to drop you
 
01:26:58.709 --> 01:26:58.719 align:start position:0%
know $1 to $5,000 on a still you want to
 
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that that's not money thrown
 
01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
out the
 
01:27:05.310 --> 01:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
window um we're growing a specialty crop
 
01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:10.280 align:start position:0%
that is used for gin in around the world
 
01:27:12.109 --> 01:27:12.119 align:start position:0%
and we would like the chance to
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
experiment with
 
01:27:17.709 --> 01:27:17.719 align:start position:0%
recipes however because we don't have
 
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
hobby distillation being
 
01:27:24.910 --> 01:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
legal I am not willing to risk my farm
 
01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:25.990 align:start position:0%
legal I am not willing to risk my farm
for

01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
that and I think it's really
 
01:27:33.310 --> 01:27:33.320 align:start position:0%
important that as a farmer that we have
 
01:27:35.629 --> 01:27:35.639 align:start position:0%
different Outlets to for value added
 
01:27:37.629 --> 01:27:37.639 align:start position:0%
products and this would be a value added
 
01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
product for
 
01:27:43.229 --> 01:27:43.239 align:start position:0%
farms and to experiment with recipes
 
01:27:46.270 --> 01:27:46.280 align:start position:0%
before spending the money um for
 
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
licensing to see if this is viable Etc I
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
think is extremely important
 
01:27:57.229 --> 01:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
uh and the other thing is is that there
 
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
are a lot of universities online and in
 
01:28:03.950 --> 01:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
person that are available to people to
 
01:28:05.149 --> 01:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
learn about
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
Distillery and
 
01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:08.070 align:start position:0%
Distillery and
Distilling

01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
Distilling
 
01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:09.510 align:start position:0%
Distilling
[Music]

01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
um and as my former colleague said this
 
01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:13.830 align:start position:0%
um and as my former colleague said this
is

01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
important Massachusetts and Maine have
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
both passed laws similar to this where
 
01:28:23.229 --> 01:28:23.239 align:start position:0%
it is legal to distill alcohol in those
 
01:28:23.239 --> 01:28:26.590 align:start position:0%
it is legal to distill alcohol in those
two

01:28:26.590 --> 01:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:29.950 --> 01:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
states and to say
 
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
that we can't pass this law because it's
 
01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
not legal federally we do this all the
 
01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I would urge this committee
 
01:28:46.109 --> 01:28:46.119 align:start position:0%
to seriously consider passing this
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
law because there's some of us that want
 
01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
to do it the right way and we don't want
 
01:28:53.070 --> 01:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
to go through the licensing and we don't
 
01:28:55.109 --> 01:28:55.119 align:start position:0%
want to spend the money for a still
 
01:28:58.990 --> 01:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
unless we can do it because it is state
 
01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
law and I'm open for
 
01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
questions I don't understand you're
 
01:29:05.669 --> 01:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
getting a Distillery or you you can't
 
01:29:08.350 --> 01:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
sell it I don't want to sell it but we
 
01:29:10.270 --> 01:29:10.280 align:start position:0%
want to experiment with recipes on our
 
01:29:13.550 --> 01:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
own before we decide if this is an
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
Avenue we'd like to really go delve into
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
and then then sell it and then we would
 
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
then we would have to apply for the
 
01:29:23.709 --> 01:29:23.719 align:start position:0%
licenses and everything else
 
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
federally but if we can't but we have to
 
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
have a still
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
first and evidently I'm you can easily
 
01:29:33.709 --> 01:29:33.719 align:start position:0%
get you can buy one from Amazon well you
 
01:29:35.550 --> 01:29:35.560 align:start position:0%
can get them there is a Still Company in
 
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire yes but to make it legal I
 
01:29:39.550 --> 01:29:39.560 align:start position:0%
can't make it
 
01:29:41.310 --> 01:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
legally got
 
01:29:45.149 --> 01:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
it okay any questions from the committee
 
01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
members thank you very much thank you uh
 
01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
Chief are you willing to uh come over
 
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:03.390 --> 01:30:03.400 align:start position:0%
you and we have a
 
01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
deputy yes who is
 
01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
a thank you has a legal background
 
01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
so so he brought his
 
01:30:16.350 --> 01:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
counsel uh thank you chairman uh for the
 
01:30:18.350 --> 01:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
record my name is Mark armaganian I'm
 
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
the chief of enforcement for the Liquor
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
Commission with me here today is
 
01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
Danielle ston our deputy chief um as as
 
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
we were with the original version of
 
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
this bill we are neutral on it um but
 
01:30:34.270 --> 01:30:34.280 align:start position:0%
we're here to take any questions that
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
you may have so what exactly does our
 
01:30:40.709 --> 01:30:40.719 align:start position:0%
statute said do we actually statutorily
 
01:30:42.830 --> 01:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
say no distilling or we just never
 
01:30:45.149 --> 01:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
allowed it we just never we didn't put
 
01:30:47.350 --> 01:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
it into what is
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
allowable correct it there is no I don't
 
01:30:52.189 --> 01:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
believe the language specific speically
 
01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
says no
 
01:30:56.430 --> 01:30:56.440 align:start position:0%
distilling it says if you going to the
 
01:30:59.189 --> 01:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
the statue only allows for beer and wine
 
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
and then if you're going to um sell or
 
01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:04.719 align:start position:0%
make it you need the license to do so a
 
01:31:06.189 --> 01:31:06.199 align:start position:0%
license to do so but we don't have a
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
license that allows it so is it possible
 
01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
that how I mean I guess you can't answer
 
01:31:14.430 --> 01:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
this question you obviously you have to
 
01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
take it back to the chairman but that if
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
we were to pass a statute that says that
 
01:31:26.709 --> 01:31:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:28.990 --> 01:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
regulation I would hope that there's a
 
01:31:31.709 --> 01:31:31.719 align:start position:0%
better way to get there uh Mr chairman
 
01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
because I would not want to have to
 
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
change our position on our enforcement
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
ability so if there was another Avenue
 
01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
to get there I I would definitely be
 
01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
open to those oh good so you you'll go
 
01:31:50.510 --> 01:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
way uh I'd like to talk to the
 
01:31:55.629 --> 01:31:55.639 align:start position:0%
representative uh who who brought up the
 
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
issue of an amendment just to see what
 
01:32:01.229 --> 01:32:01.239 align:start position:0%
the ideas are behind it right it's
 
01:32:03.870 --> 01:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
just I I guess I don't know do we do
 
01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
this know this second Amendment you say
 
01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
that we have some oh yeah
 
01:32:11.229 --> 01:32:11.239 align:start position:0%
so for yes I think it was House Bill
 
01:32:11.239 --> 01:32:13.109 align:start position:0%
so for yes I think it was House Bill
1178

01:32:13.109 --> 01:32:13.119 align:start position:0%
1178
 
01:32:15.870 --> 01:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
uh last year or this year it was two
 
01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
years ago two years ago yeah and that uh
 
01:32:21.189 --> 01:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
it it's specifically said that the state
 
01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
will not use our resources to assist the
 
01:32:26.510 --> 01:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
federal government in enforcing Second
 
01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:33.390 align:start position:0%
 
2021

01:32:33.390 --> 01:32:33.400 align:start position:0%
2021
 
01:32:38.430 --> 01:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:40.830 --> 01:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
us do you know what statute that
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
specifically fell under I could look it
 
01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:44.470 align:start position:0%
specifically fell under I could look it
up

01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:50.639 --> 01:32:56.629 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:59.709 --> 01:32:59.719 align:start position:0%
all right anybody have any questions for
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
yes represent
 
01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:10.270 --> 01:33:10.280 align:start position:0%
yeah that bill 1178 says that uh we
 
01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
won't help the feds and uh right we will
 
01:33:14.109 --> 01:33:14.119 align:start position:0%
not facilitate that doesn't mean the
 
01:33:16.109 --> 01:33:16.119 align:start position:0%
feds can't come in and do something that
 
01:33:18.669 --> 01:33:18.679 align:start position:0%
is true so I don't know how that's going
 
01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
to help in this case well it's like I
 
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
say learn with in the marijuana
 
01:33:25.629 --> 01:33:25.639 align:start position:0%
commission is is that it's basically
 
01:33:27.550 --> 01:33:27.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's allocation of resources yeah
 
01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
no I understand so if the ATF says that
 
01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
we're not going to we're not going to go
 
01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
out and and uh chase down people right
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh uh unless you know unless they L I
 
01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
think what I would think is that they'll
 
01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
chase you down if they think you're
 
01:33:44.790 --> 01:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
selling it if you're trying to sell
 
01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
which is CH that's but yeah okay go
 
01:33:53.110 --> 01:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
ahead so I just it's a RSA 159 d
 
01:33:53.120 --> 01:34:03.310 align:start position:0%
ahead so I just it's a RSA 159 d

hearing
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:50.480 --> 02:10:47.229 align:start position:0%
 
there

02:10:47.229 --> 02:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:47.239 --> 02:45:44.070 align:start position:0%
 
for

02:45:44.070 --> 02:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:44.080 --> 02:49:43.710 align:start position:0%
 
for

02:49:43.710 --> 02:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:43.720 --> 03:02:42.550 align:start position:0%
 
for

03:02:42.550 --> 03:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:42.560 --> 03:21:36.710 align:start position:0%
 
for

03:21:36.710 --> 03:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:39.870 --> 03:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
okay uh what are we doing we're doing uh
 
03:21:42.510 --> 03:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
relative to liquor stores 11
 
03:21:45.590 --> 03:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
98 thank you very much so today dealing
 
03:21:47.070 --> 03:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
with a somewhat simpler topic and I'm
 
03:21:49.150 --> 03:21:49.160 align:start position:0%
actually in favor I don't think I've
 
03:21:50.990 --> 03:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
ever seen you so often in our community
 
03:21:52.469 --> 03:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
I know it's like probably more than I
 
03:21:54.349 --> 03:21:54.359 align:start position:0%
needed to do but I've had a good time
 
03:21:56.189 --> 03:21:56.199 align:start position:0%
anyway so it's always always fun over
 
03:21:57.510 --> 03:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
here at least at least if you're a
 
03:21:59.910 --> 03:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
visitor and you did do a card right I
 
03:22:03.870 --> 03:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:10.750 --> 03:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:10.760 --> 03:22:12.309 align:start position:0%
 
are

03:22:12.309 --> 03:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:22:14.469 --> 03:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
all right course now you have now you R
 
03:22:16.630 --> 03:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
grass SE so we very good-looking guy we
 
03:22:19.030 --> 03:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
look I think we look a little alike so
 
03:22:22.429 --> 03:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
white hair the square head but right I
 
03:22:24.670 --> 03:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
don't know he he has a better haircut
 
03:22:28.750 --> 03:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
than you did oh he does yes okay so
 
03:22:31.670 --> 03:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
anyways yes so I'm still represent
 
03:22:33.229 --> 03:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
Timothy Oregon I continue to represent
 
03:22:34.990 --> 03:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
straford County District 10 which is the
 
03:22:38.950 --> 03:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
towns of just the town of Durham and uh
 
03:22:41.070 --> 03:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
actually we actually don't have a state
 
03:22:42.389 --> 03:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
liquor store yet you have to go to Lee
 
03:22:45.950 --> 03:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
or do to uh get to partake of their
 
03:22:48.550 --> 03:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
products but um we still we still like
 
03:22:50.030 --> 03:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
the State Liquor Commission and Durham
 
03:22:53.070 --> 03:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
too so I'm uh and this is a repeat of an
 
03:22:55.710 --> 03:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
early bill from 2022 and
 
03:22:57.870 --> 03:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
actually actually Mr chairman you and
 
03:22:59.269 --> 03:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
the committee were helpful to me because
 
03:23:00.990 --> 03:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
the thing I came up with was much more
 
03:23:03.429 --> 03:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
complicated had some uh and you boiled
 
03:23:05.389 --> 03:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
it down to like the most interesting
 
03:23:06.790 --> 03:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
part of it so it's now it's pretty
 
03:23:09.910 --> 03:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
simple and it actually came very close
 
03:23:11.990 --> 03:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
it sailed to the house without much
 
03:23:14.429 --> 03:23:14.439 align:start position:0%
trouble and then it came it it went
 
03:23:15.830 --> 03:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
halfway to the Senate but they sent it
 
03:23:18.469 --> 03:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
around the finance who then uh didn't
 
03:23:20.229 --> 03:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
see the wisdom of it but maybe they'll
 
03:23:22.189 --> 03:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
like hopefully they'll feel differently
 
03:23:25.469 --> 03:23:25.479 align:start position:0%
about it this time so um so is it just
 
03:23:28.870 --> 03:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
the way we sent it exactly exactly yes
 
03:23:30.269 --> 03:23:30.279 align:start position:0%
well then it's dead on the Senate why
 
03:23:33.550 --> 03:23:33.560 align:start position:0%
would we do that again um I ironically
 
03:23:34.830 --> 03:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
it was the finance committee and
 
03:23:36.830 --> 03:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
actually there's no the financial part
 
03:23:38.990 --> 03:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
of it was actually like unimpeachable
 
03:23:40.590 --> 03:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
was more on the principle of it and what
 
03:23:43.150 --> 03:23:43.160 align:start position:0%
the principle of it is is that well
 
03:23:45.590 --> 03:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
right now the liquor stores keep stores
 
03:23:47.429 --> 03:23:47.439 align:start position:0%
on Main routs where traffic is heavy
 
03:23:49.750 --> 03:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
open on Sunday or any legal holiday but
 
03:23:51.990 --> 03:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
there's three exceptions which is Easter
 
03:23:54.950 --> 03:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving and Christmas and so uh
 
03:23:56.870 --> 03:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving Christmas are defined in
 
03:23:59.429 --> 03:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
existing law there's actually Easter is
 
03:24:00.830 --> 03:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
actually not a legal holiday and there
 
03:24:04.469 --> 03:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
isn't really I isn't really any simple
 
03:24:06.469 --> 03:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
way to define it in in the in the law
 
03:24:08.110 --> 03:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
books it moves around from year to year
 
03:24:09.429 --> 03:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
and actually different religious groups
 
03:24:11.110 --> 03:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
observe it on different Sundays because
 
03:24:13.349 --> 03:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
has to do with with uh it's the first
 
03:24:16.229 --> 03:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
Sunday after the Spring Equinox but
 
03:24:18.349 --> 03:24:18.359 align:start position:0%
there's various opinions about how
 
03:24:20.750 --> 03:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
whether how to calculate that so that's
 
03:24:22.510 --> 03:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
why it moves around a lot there's also
 
03:24:24.710 --> 03:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
the Jewish fees of Passover which is
 
03:24:26.189 --> 03:24:26.199 align:start position:0%
basically the same holiday and that's
 
03:24:29.269 --> 03:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
actually fixed on a exact date in the
 
03:24:31.389 --> 03:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
Hebrew calendar but that but then they
 
03:24:33.510 --> 03:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
the Hebrew calendar keeps up with the
 
03:24:36.189 --> 03:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
fact keeps up with the fact that like
 
03:24:37.830 --> 03:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
there aren't there
 
03:24:40.510 --> 03:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
365.25 days in year rather than 360 by
 
03:24:41.670 --> 03:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
every so often adding a whole whole
 
03:24:43.309 --> 03:24:43.319 align:start position:0%
extra month but that's I've already gone
 
03:24:45.950 --> 03:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
off into the um ibly should have just
 
03:24:48.910 --> 03:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
read my um testimony out out loud so
 
03:24:50.790 --> 03:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
it's a simple piece of enabling
 
03:24:53.070 --> 03:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
legislation doesn't require these stores
 
03:24:54.670 --> 03:24:54.680 align:start position:0%
to be open on those three days it just
 
03:24:57.630 --> 03:24:57.640 align:start position:0%
gives the commission the option of uh
 
03:24:58.910 --> 03:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
ordering they're free to keep them
 
03:25:01.269 --> 03:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
closed instead and full-time employees
 
03:25:02.910 --> 03:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
be guaranteed at least one and a half
 
03:25:05.229 --> 03:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
times the regular pay and all other work
 
03:25:08.150 --> 03:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
rules will still apply and it's a uh
 
03:25:10.389 --> 03:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a union Shop with a very
 
03:25:11.950 --> 03:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
strong union but has a good ation with
 
03:25:13.469 --> 03:25:13.479 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission so I'm sure that
 
03:25:15.910 --> 03:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
part of it will be uh that part of be
 
03:25:17.710 --> 03:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
that part of it will be worked out and
 
03:25:19.150 --> 03:25:19.160 align:start position:0%
the purpose is simply to better serve
 
03:25:20.269 --> 03:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
the public by giving them more
 
03:25:22.910 --> 03:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to buy wine and spirits on
 
03:25:24.870 --> 03:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
those three days and to enjoy them
 
03:25:27.070 --> 03:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
responsibly I was mostly thinking of
 
03:25:28.550 --> 03:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
Travelers who need to pick up a few
 
03:25:30.150 --> 03:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
bottles for responsible enjoyment at
 
03:25:32.269 --> 03:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
their holiday gett togethers though may
 
03:25:33.710 --> 03:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
also be useful for restaurants and
 
03:25:35.870 --> 03:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
Caterers who are open on one of those
 
03:25:38.790 --> 03:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
three holidays and I think um the fiscal
 
03:25:40.990 --> 03:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
note um as it did last time
 
03:25:43.269 --> 03:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
demonstration Liquor Commission will um
 
03:25:45.510 --> 03:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
i' say certainly almost certainly make
 
03:25:48.429 --> 03:25:48.439 align:start position:0%
more money if HP 1198 passes so the
 
03:25:50.750 --> 03:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
sales in Easter Sunday it's fair to
 
03:25:52.070 --> 03:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
assume they'll probably be similar to
 
03:25:55.030 --> 03:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
any other Sunday in in March or April
 
03:25:57.670 --> 03:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
and those uh apparently average about a
 
03:25:59.830 --> 03:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars in gross sales and then
 
03:26:02.469 --> 03:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
the uh labor cost which is the main cost
 
03:26:04.590 --> 03:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
of opening the store and the date was
 
03:26:08.309 --> 03:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
closed would amount to about 53,000 so
 
03:26:10.429 --> 03:26:10.439 align:start position:0%
um so it looks like they would make
 
03:26:12.189 --> 03:26:12.199 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
03:26:14.309 --> 03:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
$947,000 if they're open on Easter
 
03:26:16.309 --> 03:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
Sunday I they may cannibalize some sales
 
03:26:19.030 --> 03:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
from earlier earlier in the season but
 
03:26:20.150 --> 03:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
probably it'll be about the same
 
03:26:21.550 --> 03:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving Christmas a little bit
 
03:26:24.189 --> 03:26:24.199 align:start position:0%
harder to hard of dict that is their
 
03:26:25.990 --> 03:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
busy season the fiscal note describes
 
03:26:28.110 --> 03:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
the sales as robust and if you've ever
 
03:26:30.830 --> 03:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
visited one of our excellent stores of
 
03:26:33.830 --> 03:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
which we're all a uh all like basic all
 
03:26:35.150 --> 03:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
of us are citizens New Hampshire are
 
03:26:37.030 --> 03:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
essentially shareholders in US those
 
03:26:39.150 --> 03:26:39.160 align:start position:0%
stores are indeed very busy right before
 
03:26:42.469 --> 03:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving and Christmas I and I enjoy
 
03:26:43.469 --> 03:26:43.479 align:start position:0%
going there but right before
 
03:26:44.990 --> 03:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving Christmas and getting some
 
03:26:46.910 --> 03:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
bottles of New Hampshire made wine to
 
03:26:49.189 --> 03:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
bring down to relatives in Massachusetts
 
03:26:52.309 --> 03:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
um but the break even point for opening
 
03:26:55.429 --> 03:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
of those two days is about 5.3% of the
 
03:26:58.189 --> 03:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
uh regular of the uh of the of the
 
03:26:59.870 --> 03:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
regular sales I'm sure the sales will be
 
03:27:02.429 --> 03:27:02.439 align:start position:0%
more than 5.3% of what they would be on
 
03:27:04.229 --> 03:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
a regular day and as I said once again
 
03:27:06.750 --> 03:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
it's just enabling legislation so no
 
03:27:10.309 --> 03:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
stores that aren't they're closed now
 
03:27:11.750 --> 03:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
they only have to they can only have to
 
03:27:13.269 --> 03:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
open it's just a business decision they
 
03:27:14.870 --> 03:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
can make if if if they feel it's
 
03:27:16.469 --> 03:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
worthwhile opening the store on those
 
03:27:19.030 --> 03:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
days which I from a business standpoint
 
03:27:20.790 --> 03:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
I believe it would be so that basically
 
03:27:23.870 --> 03:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
uh is my bill I made it it's probably
 
03:27:26.349 --> 03:27:26.359 align:start position:0%
even simpler than I made it sounds um
 
03:27:28.189 --> 03:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
and oh believe me you don't want to try
 
03:27:29.990 --> 03:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
to Define Eastern law I did that two
 
03:27:31.910 --> 03:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
years ago and it was just a nightmare
 
03:27:35.349 --> 03:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and fortunately if we pass
 
03:27:36.950 --> 03:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
this bill there's only one reference to
 
03:27:38.830 --> 03:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
Easter left in all of the rsas and
 
03:27:41.630 --> 03:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
that's to a celebration called C our
 
03:27:43.030 --> 03:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
Mother's Day which is the Sunday after
 
03:27:44.670 --> 03:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
Easter and the governor will still be
 
03:27:47.070 --> 03:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
able to sign a proclamation celebrating
 
03:27:49.189 --> 03:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
that regardless of whether we pass this
 
03:27:52.710 --> 03:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
because because um because what it what
 
03:27:54.189 --> 03:27:54.199 align:start position:0%
it actually does we're just crossing out
 
03:27:56.189 --> 03:27:56.199 align:start position:0%
one sentence from the RSA about when the
 
03:27:58.590 --> 03:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
liquor stores can be open so I may happy
 
03:28:02.750 --> 03:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:06.309 --> 03:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
questions representative buo yeah thank
 
03:28:07.550 --> 03:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
03:28:10.630 --> 03:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
question why are you bringing this bill
 
03:28:15.110 --> 03:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
forward how how would it affect the
 
03:28:19.469 --> 03:28:19.479 align:start position:0%
state residents yourself I just don't
 
03:28:21.469 --> 03:28:21.479 align:start position:0%
get it well I had the original version
 
03:28:23.070 --> 03:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
of my bill had a couple of other issues
 
03:28:24.950 --> 03:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
in it but those were not worth pursuing
 
03:28:27.750 --> 03:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
this time so it's just uh I just feel
 
03:28:30.469 --> 03:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
it's a worthwhile to have some of these
 
03:28:33.349 --> 03:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
Outlets open I mean even aside from uh
 
03:28:34.870 --> 03:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
buying their excellent products there
 
03:28:37.309 --> 03:28:37.319 align:start position:0%
they're also like uh they also always
 
03:28:39.710 --> 03:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
have clean restrooms they've also uh
 
03:28:41.229 --> 03:28:41.239 align:start position:0%
they also now have vehicle charging
 
03:28:43.510 --> 03:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
stations which the back of many which I
 
03:28:44.750 --> 03:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
guess is more an initiative of the
 
03:28:47.790 --> 03:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
landlords so there's I just think it's
 
03:28:49.349 --> 03:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
worthwhile having them open especially
 
03:28:51.030 --> 03:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
the we have two and I guess they're
 
03:28:52.870 --> 03:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
planning to build more that are at rest
 
03:28:54.429 --> 03:28:54.439 align:start position:0%
areas too and the rest areas are open
 
03:28:57.070 --> 03:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
anyway so we may as well have uh you
 
03:28:59.790 --> 03:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
know this part of the rest area open too
 
03:29:02.110 --> 03:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
for those people who for whatever reason
 
03:29:03.590 --> 03:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
good or bad find themselves traveling on
 
03:29:05.870 --> 03:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
the holiday I know I know I quite
 
03:29:07.429 --> 03:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
frequently find myself driving down
 
03:29:09.110 --> 03:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
there on especially on Thanksgiving day
 
03:29:11.950 --> 03:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
to visit relatives um on the other side
 
03:29:18.790 --> 03:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:20.990 --> 03:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
thanks okay any other questions from the
 
03:29:23.309 --> 03:29:23.319 align:start position:0%
committee members yeah thank you very
 
03:29:24.590 --> 03:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
much I'll just say Mr chair this version
 
03:29:25.750 --> 03:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
of the bill is much better than my
 
03:29:27.269 --> 03:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
original one from two years ago but
 
03:29:28.990 --> 03:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
that's thank you that's because we did
 
03:29:29.000 --> 03:29:30.590 align:start position:0%
that's thank you that's because we did
it

03:29:30.590 --> 03:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:29:33.510 --> 03:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
thanks that was my point thanks but it
 
03:29:36.030 --> 03:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
deal still died in the
 
03:29:39.070 --> 03:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
Senate my advice to you is is that when
 
03:29:41.469 --> 03:29:41.479 align:start position:0%
a bill dies in the first year of a year
 
03:29:43.550 --> 03:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
session don't bother bringing back in
 
03:29:46.150 --> 03:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
the second year just you got to wait
 
03:29:48.590 --> 03:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
till some people
 
03:29:51.070 --> 03:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
changed in that other body and then
 
03:29:53.670 --> 03:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
bring it back this coming back every
 
03:29:56.110 --> 03:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
year then then well this was in the
 
03:29:58.150 --> 03:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
second year of the previous by any and
 
03:30:00.229 --> 03:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
now it's the second year of this one so
 
03:30:01.710 --> 03:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
I let it rest for same people on the
 
03:30:03.590 --> 03:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
Senate side well it's the same let me
 
03:30:04.830 --> 03:30:04.840 align:start position:0%

of the Commerce Committee who didn't
 
03:30:08.030 --> 03:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
like it the last time yes and I don't
 
03:30:09.990 --> 03:30:10.000 align:start position:0%

excessively and
 
03:53:00.950 --> 03:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
33.1% of the driving
 
03:53:06.309 --> 03:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:09.510 --> 03:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
alcohol my rep my fellow represent
 
03:53:12.149 --> 03:53:12.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a
 
03:53:16.309 --> 03:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
problem we have a serious
 
03:53:18.790 --> 03:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
problem HB
 
03:53:22.830 --> 03:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
1621 is one way to address this by
 
03:53:27.429 --> 03:53:27.439 align:start position:0%
reaching out to the public and educating
 
03:53:32.429 --> 03:53:32.439 align:start position:0%
them on alcoholic abuse as well as what
 
03:53:36.870 --> 03:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
resources are exist in their community
 
03:53:40.309 --> 03:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
that can help them
 
03:53:42.710 --> 03:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
I thank you for uh this opportunity to
 
03:53:46.550 --> 03:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
speak I will answer your questions and I
 
03:53:49.910 --> 03:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
do have a written statement to be
 
03:53:57.389 --> 03:53:57.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:06.070 --> 03:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:09.950 --> 03:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
or you take questions yes I will okay
 
03:54:12.269 --> 03:54:12.279 align:start position:0%
representative thank you thank you Mr
 
03:54:15.510 --> 03:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
chairman I'll start um I didn't catch
 
03:54:17.189 --> 03:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
the source of the data the where you
 
03:54:19.990 --> 03:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
said 21% of all New Hampshire
 
03:54:22.950 --> 03:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
adults uh drink excessively so I'd love
 
03:54:24.670 --> 03:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
to know that that was with the Robert
 
03:54:27.429 --> 03:54:27.439 align:start position:0%
Wood Johnson foundation and the
 
03:54:29.469 --> 03:54:29.479 align:start position:0%
University of Wisconsin was a special
 
03:54:30.910 --> 03:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
report that was
 
03:54:33.469 --> 03:54:33.479 align:start position:0%
prepared thanks so my further question
 
03:54:37.550 --> 03:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:41.710 --> 03:54:41.720 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of places you can get
 
03:54:45.710 --> 03:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
alcohol like in a restaurant or a bar I
 
03:54:47.790 --> 03:54:47.800 align:start position:0%
understand yeah so I don't actually know
 
03:54:49.670 --> 03:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
I bet someone here does know know the
 
03:54:52.149 --> 03:54:52.159 align:start position:0%
breakdown of you know what percentage of
 
03:54:54.670 --> 03:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
alcohol is purchased in State Stores
 
03:54:54.680 --> 03:54:56.309 align:start position:0%
alcohol is purchased in State Stores
versus

03:54:56.309 --> 03:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
versus
 
03:55:02.070 --> 03:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
lenses so why why why just do this in
 
03:55:05.070 --> 03:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
the liquor stores especially when many
 
03:55:06.950 --> 03:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
of those customers are repeat customers
 
03:55:08.910 --> 03:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to get the same brochure
 
03:55:11.710 --> 03:55:11.720 align:start position:0%
or you know once a month or twice a week
 
03:55:13.790 --> 03:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
or whatever they do and throw it away
 
03:55:16.429 --> 03:55:16.439 align:start position:0%
well however they decide to distribute
 
03:55:19.030 --> 03:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
the brochure is one thing and I think
 
03:55:22.670 --> 03:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
the intent of this was to try to start
 
03:55:27.229 --> 03:55:27.239 align:start position:0%
with the um state liquor stores and if
 
03:55:29.469 --> 03:55:29.479 align:start position:0%
that was effective we could move on but
 
03:55:32.189 --> 03:55:32.199 align:start position:0%
at I think that was the intent was just
 
03:55:34.870 --> 03:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
to start with what we
 
03:55:34.880 --> 03:55:36.469 align:start position:0%
to start with what we
could

03:55:36.469 --> 03:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:55:39.389 --> 03:55:39.399 align:start position:0%
control what can I ask one more question
 
03:55:41.349 --> 03:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
thank you so you said if that's
 
03:55:43.830 --> 03:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
effective we'd move on how will how we
 
03:55:45.790 --> 03:55:45.800 align:start position:0%
know I don't know that for sure it's
 
03:55:47.590 --> 03:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
effective yeah I don't know how if we
 
03:55:50.149 --> 03:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
would move on if this was the intent but
 
03:55:53.870 --> 03:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
I think this is a good start to
 
03:55:56.309 --> 03:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
accomplish what we're trying to aim and
 
03:55:58.870 --> 03:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
that is to educate the public that
 
03:56:02.269 --> 03:56:02.279 align:start position:0%
alcohol is a disease it's toxic to one's
 
03:56:07.710 --> 03:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:07.720 --> 03:56:11.429 align:start position:0%
 
death

03:56:11.429 --> 03:56:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:11.439 --> 03:56:12.469 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:56:12.469 --> 03:56:12.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:56:16.070 --> 03:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
pusk uh thank you Mr chairman I notice
 
03:56:21.469 --> 03:56:21.479 align:start position:0%
on the hand out uh in 2022 the Robert
 
03:56:24.070 --> 03:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
Wood Johnson Foundation found that New
 
03:56:26.910 --> 03:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire had the highest consumption
 
03:56:30.510 --> 03:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
per capita of 4.6 gallons is this based
 
03:56:35.590 --> 03:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
on uh product sold yes okay realizing
 
03:56:38.670 --> 03:56:38.680 align:start position:0%
that probably half of the alcohol sold
 
03:56:40.670 --> 03:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire is to
 
03:56:44.269 --> 03:56:44.279 align:start position:0%
Residents outside of the State of New
 
03:56:44.279 --> 03:56:45.830 align:start position:0%
Residents outside of the State of New
Hampshire

03:56:45.830 --> 03:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:56:48.670 --> 03:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
um it could be I I don't know I don't
 
03:56:50.750 --> 03:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
know what how they came up with this
 
03:56:53.710 --> 03:56:53.720 align:start position:0%
number but it is alarmingly high when
 
03:56:56.630 --> 03:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
you consider the other states follow up
 
03:56:58.429 --> 03:56:58.439 align:start position:0%
further question being inquire thank you
 
03:57:02.750 --> 03:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh I know for a fact that uh
 
03:57:07.030 --> 03:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
two of the uh State stores on Interstate
 
03:57:10.229 --> 03:57:10.239 align:start position:0%
93 typically have no less than a half a
 
03:57:14.149 --> 03:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
dozen vehicles uh Panel trucks vans with
 
03:57:16.630 --> 03:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
out ofate license plates and they are
 
03:57:20.070 --> 03:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
loading them up with trolleys of liquor
 
03:57:24.830 --> 03:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
to go out of state and be sold at uh
 
03:57:26.510 --> 03:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
some other
 
03:57:29.830 --> 03:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
place you would you believe oh I would
 
03:57:31.910 --> 03:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
believe that I see that all the time as
 
03:57:34.309 --> 03:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
I'm driving two and fourth from
 
03:57:37.269 --> 03:57:37.279 align:start position:0%
conquered and I see the license
 
03:57:40.269 --> 03:57:40.279 align:start position:0%
place um I understand that and if we can
 
03:57:42.469 --> 03:57:42.479 align:start position:0%
educate the outer Staters that's great
 
03:57:45.429 --> 03:57:45.439 align:start position:0%
too but we've got to start with the
 
03:57:47.149 --> 03:57:47.159 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire and see if we
 
03:57:49.469 --> 03:57:49.479 align:start position:0%
can bring this rate down and the number
 
03:57:49.479 --> 03:57:55.229 align:start position:0%
can bring this rate down and the number
of

03:57:55.229 --> 03:57:55.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:00.670 --> 03:58:00.680 align:start position:0%
debts representative Gibbs thank you um
 
03:58:03.309 --> 03:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your testimony uh
 
03:58:06.309 --> 03:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
considering the uh fiscal note on this
 
03:58:08.550 --> 03:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
bill shouldn't this bill have an
 
03:58:08.560 --> 03:58:10.469 align:start position:0%
bill shouldn't this bill have an
appropriation

03:58:10.469 --> 03:58:10.479 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
03:58:13.389 --> 03:58:13.399 align:start position:0%
attached yes and it will probably go to
 
03:58:15.389 --> 03:58:15.399 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee
 
03:58:18.110 --> 03:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
afterwards I'm sorry I didn't hear that
 
03:58:20.990 --> 03:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
probably we'll go to the uh finance
 
03:58:24.550 --> 03:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
committee for a fiscal note and to
 
03:58:27.189 --> 03:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
determine what amount of money should
 
03:58:30.110 --> 03:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
would be spent to do thank you should I
 
03:58:31.990 --> 03:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
don't have my copy it should say on the
 
03:58:35.550 --> 03:58:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:43.349 --> 03:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:43.359 --> 03:58:47.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:58:47.510 --> 03:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:50.070 --> 03:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
right sorry so that the finance
 
03:58:53.269 --> 03:58:53.279 align:start position:0%
committee would deal with attaching the
 
03:58:56.070 --> 03:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation thank
 
03:59:00.269 --> 03:59:00.279 align:start position:0%
you okay uh well actually representative
 
03:59:03.189 --> 03:59:03.199 align:start position:0%
walls just hasn't asked a question
 
03:59:07.110 --> 03:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
yet uh just a another Point uh following
 
03:59:09.990 --> 03:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
up with representative p
 
03:59:11.910 --> 03:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
I live alone and when I go to the state
 
03:59:13.910 --> 03:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
Lor store I might buy a few bottles of
 
03:59:15.229 --> 03:59:15.239 align:start position:0%
wine that doesn't mean I'm going to
 
03:59:17.149 --> 03:59:17.159 align:start position:0%
consume those bottles of wine it could
 
03:59:20.149 --> 03:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
take me a year to consume those or I
 
03:59:22.990 --> 03:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
might be buying them as gifts for others
 
03:59:25.990 --> 03:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
so I think you know to his point in mine
 
03:59:29.030 --> 03:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
that that's not considered as part of
 
03:59:31.189 --> 03:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
this it makes you know this kind of
 
03:59:33.389 --> 03:59:33.399 align:start position:0%
makes New Hampshire sound like we really
 
03:59:35.550 --> 03:59:35.560 align:start position:0%
have a huge problem when I don't think
 
03:59:37.990 --> 03:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
it's that we do have a big problem I
 
03:59:39.630 --> 03:59:39.640 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's that big a problem
 
03:59:42.429 --> 03:59:42.439 align:start position:0%
but we do have a problem okay all right
 
03:59:42.439 --> 03:59:46.710 align:start position:0%
but we do have a problem okay all right
thank

03:59:46.710 --> 03:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:50.710 --> 03:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
you representative uh M
 
03:59:53.309 --> 03:59:53.319 align:start position:0%
first thank thank you Mr chairman I just
 
03:59:55.189 --> 03:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
want to go down the road of things that
 
03:59:58.349 --> 03:59:58.359 align:start position:0%
are harmful and are likely to cause your
 
04:00:00.070 --> 04:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
death sooner than your natural death
 
04:00:03.189 --> 04:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
like alcohol there's also smoking heart
 
04:00:05.670 --> 04:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
disease is a number one killer should we
 
04:00:09.349 --> 04:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
put a pamphlet in with every bagged up
 
04:00:11.950 --> 04:00:11.960 align:start position:0%
McDonald's fast food order because
 
04:00:15.469 --> 04:00:15.479 align:start position:0%
that's statistically way more likely in
 
04:00:17.229 --> 04:00:17.239 align:start position:0%
terms of heart disease to kill you and I
 
04:00:18.349 --> 04:00:18.359 align:start position:0%
don't actually also don't think your
 
04:00:20.670 --> 04:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
your data is reliable as we pointed out
 
04:00:23.149 --> 04:00:23.159 align:start position:0%
well okay I I I think it is so guess
 
04:00:25.229 --> 04:00:25.239 align:start position:0%
we'll have to disagree on that but
 
04:00:27.670 --> 04:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
McDonald's is saying McDonald's is doing
 
04:00:31.950 --> 04:00:31.960 align:start position:0%
their part by on their menu saying how
 
04:00:35.550 --> 04:00:35.560 align:start position:0%
much fat content is in their products
 
04:00:37.309 --> 04:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
right that's a good step and an
 
04:00:37.319 --> 04:00:38.990 align:start position:0%
right that's a good step and an
indication

04:00:38.990 --> 04:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
indication
 
04:00:41.670 --> 04:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
um and I think other
 
04:00:44.870 --> 04:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
responsible restaurants the tobacco
 
04:00:48.349 --> 04:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
industry has a label on their packages
 
04:00:51.750 --> 04:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
now I don't know if people re seiz that
 
04:00:54.950 --> 04:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
but I know that they have put an effort
 
04:00:58.309 --> 04:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
to reduce and to educate the public on
 
04:01:00.070 --> 04:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
deaths from
 
04:01:02.790 --> 04:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
tobacco and I don't think we're doing
 
04:01:05.670 --> 04:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
that for alcohol excessive alcohol
 
04:01:07.790 --> 04:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
consumption fair enough yeah we we
 
04:01:12.469 --> 04:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
actually well it is required on alcohol
 
04:01:14.389 --> 04:01:14.399 align:start position:0%
yeah the preg you know pregnant women
 
04:01:17.229 --> 04:01:17.239 align:start position:0%
and then yes yeah it's those
 
04:01:21.229 --> 04:01:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:24.189 --> 04:01:24.199 align:start position:0%
alcohol so now representa
 
04:01:26.590 --> 04:01:26.600 align:start position:0%
bil thank you it's just a comment I'm
 
04:01:29.550 --> 04:01:29.560 align:start position:0%
I'm a co-sponsor of this bill and I
 
04:01:33.030 --> 04:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
think it's a great start um I think
 
04:01:35.229 --> 04:01:35.239 align:start position:0%
there is a huge problem in the state
 
04:01:38.269 --> 04:01:38.279 align:start position:0%
with alcoholism and if we can do any
 
04:01:42.149 --> 04:01:42.159 align:start position:0%
anything to educate people
 
04:01:42.159 --> 04:01:43.990 align:start position:0%
anything to educate people
regarding

04:01:43.990 --> 04:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
04:01:49.110 --> 04:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
the excessive um use of alcohol I think
 
04:01:50.870 --> 04:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
the Liquor
 
04:01:53.590 --> 04:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
Commission and other concerned citizens
 
04:01:57.510 --> 04:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
could come together and find a way to
 
04:02:00.550 --> 04:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
place something in the liquor stores um
 
04:02:00.560 --> 04:02:02.110 align:start position:0%
place something in the liquor stores um
to

04:02:02.110 --> 04:02:02.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:02:05.790 --> 04:02:05.800 align:start position:0%
educate just like cigarette companies do
 
04:02:08.910 --> 04:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
I agree I agree yeah
 
04:02:10.710 --> 04:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
representative post do you have a
 
04:02:14.630 --> 04:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
question yes um would would you be aware
 
04:02:18.429 --> 04:02:18.439 align:start position:0%
that um since 1989 in the United States
 
04:02:20.950 --> 04:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
warning label labels on alcoholic
 
04:02:23.830 --> 04:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
beverages are currently required to warn
 
04:02:25.630 --> 04:02:25.640 align:start position:0%
of the risk of drinking and driving
 
04:02:27.429 --> 04:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
operating Machinery drinking while
 
04:02:30.750 --> 04:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
pregnant and other General health risks
 
04:02:33.550 --> 04:02:33.560 align:start position:0%
including cancer and colon
 
04:02:36.349 --> 04:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
cancer that's already on the bottles yes
 
04:02:39.070 --> 04:02:39.080 align:start position:0%
but I guess is not working in New hampsh
 
04:02:42.269 --> 04:02:42.279 align:start position:0%
so I think a poster in a good strategic
 
04:02:46.309 --> 04:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
place of saying this is a this is a
 
04:02:48.990 --> 04:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
problem this is a disease and by
 
04:02:51.750 --> 04:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
consuming it you risk your
 
04:02:56.110 --> 04:02:56.120 align:start position:0%
lives um you and a possible early
 
04:02:59.149 --> 04:02:59.159 align:start position:0%
death but thank you for bringing that
 
04:02:59.159 --> 04:03:01.149 align:start position:0%
death but thank you for bringing that
up

04:03:01.149 --> 04:03:01.159 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:03:06.910 --> 04:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
followup so a person who knows that this
 
04:03:08.510 --> 04:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
is not good for them because I think
 
04:03:11.469 --> 04:03:11.479 align:start position:0%
most adults do and I think even uh young
 
04:03:15.309 --> 04:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
adults do um what would make them have
 
04:03:18.510 --> 04:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
that effect on them just seeing a poster
 
04:03:21.870 --> 04:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
if they already know that language is
 
04:03:24.030 --> 04:03:24.040 align:start position:0%
they know that it can be harmful to
 
04:03:27.189 --> 04:03:27.199 align:start position:0%
their lives I I think it's just
 
04:03:30.149 --> 04:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
the the view of the poster and the
 
04:03:32.870 --> 04:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
marketing of the poster if it's
 
04:03:35.630 --> 04:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
strategic it will it will cut to your
 
04:03:38.710 --> 04:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
heart and you'll say h maybe I have a
 
04:03:42.070 --> 04:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
problem and maybe I should look in to
 
04:03:46.189 --> 04:03:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:51.070 --> 04:03:51.080 align:start position:0%
myself and I think that is you know for
 
04:03:54.910 --> 04:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
the bang of the buck it's it's worth
 
04:03:58.269 --> 04:03:58.279 align:start position:0%
seeing something that applies to you and
 
04:04:01.710 --> 04:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
if you stop to think about it and you
 
04:04:04.710 --> 04:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
say yes I do have a problem yes I may
 
04:04:07.229 --> 04:04:07.239 align:start position:0%
only have a glass of wine or two glasses
 
04:04:10.790 --> 04:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
of wine and night but if that's every
 
04:04:13.910 --> 04:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
night then I have a problem I'm addicted
 
04:04:13.920 --> 04:04:15.429 align:start position:0%
night then I have a problem I'm addicted
to

04:04:15.429 --> 04:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:04:23.910 --> 04:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:26.950 --> 04:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
expectancy okay represent
 
04:04:29.349 --> 04:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
Burrows thank you for taking my question
 
04:04:31.870 --> 04:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say would you believe that
 
04:04:33.429 --> 04:04:33.439 align:start position:0%
um whenever I go to a medical
 
04:04:36.269 --> 04:04:36.279 align:start position:0%
appointment um there are posters in the
 
04:04:40.349 --> 04:04:40.359 align:start position:0%
bathrooms in the in the in the um in the
 
04:04:42.429 --> 04:04:42.439 align:start position:0%
exam rooms that say you know if you're a
 
04:04:44.670 --> 04:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
victim of domestic or sexual violence
 
04:04:47.189 --> 04:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
here's where you go for help so and I
 
04:04:49.710 --> 04:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
think those are incredibly effective and
 
04:04:51.630 --> 04:04:51.640 align:start position:0%
I think given that this may have a phone
 
04:04:54.269 --> 04:04:54.279 align:start position:0%
number or a place you can go this could
 
04:04:57.149 --> 04:04:57.159 align:start position:0%
also potentially help people yeah yeah I
 
04:05:01.630 --> 04:05:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:05.790 --> 04:05:05.800 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you very much okay thank
 
04:05:15.429 --> 04:05:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:20.950 --> 04:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:24.670 --> 04:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
Aid okay would you like to offer up
 
04:05:24.680 --> 04:05:29.550 align:start position:0%
Aid okay would you like to offer up
something

04:05:29.550 --> 04:05:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:29.560 --> 04:05:31.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:05:31.950 --> 04:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:05:36.870 --> 04:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
he so I I missed this this is
 
04:05:39.710 --> 04:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
24 good day my name is Aiden Moore I'm
 
04:05:41.030 --> 04:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
the legal coordinator for the State
 
04:05:44.550 --> 04:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission and uh we're not
 
04:05:46.510 --> 04:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
opposed or supporting the bill we're
 
04:05:47.790 --> 04:05:47.800 align:start position:0%
here I'm just here to see if I can
 
04:05:51.510 --> 04:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
answer any any questions uh when this
 
04:05:53.510 --> 04:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
bill was originally introduced I
 
04:05:56.710 --> 04:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
contacted the sponsor I contacted the
 
04:05:59.670 --> 04:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
sponsor um to try to figure out what it
 
04:06:02.670 --> 04:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
is that he was looking for in in his
 
04:06:07.990 --> 04:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
process and I think what we talked about
 
04:06:10.550 --> 04:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
largely was based on what information do
 
04:06:13.710 --> 04:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
you want to get out and how how would
 
04:06:17.030 --> 04:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
you want it to to to be disseminated and
 
04:06:19.830 --> 04:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
as a part of that um we talked about
 
04:06:22.070 --> 04:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
posters we talked about Flyers we talked
 
04:06:24.710 --> 04:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
about a number of things and as you can
 
04:06:28.229 --> 04:06:28.239 align:start position:0%
see by our fiscal note each of those um
 
04:06:30.670 --> 04:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
comes with a bit of a cost which is not
 
04:06:33.950 --> 04:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
in our budget um I talked to graphic
 
04:06:36.309 --> 04:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
Services about a single page
 
04:06:38.630 --> 04:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
three-fold um
 
04:06:41.269 --> 04:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
considering the fact that the bill
 
04:06:43.590 --> 04:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
speaks to liquor but I'm assuming that
 
04:06:45.670 --> 04:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
that would apply to wine sales as well
 
04:06:47.990 --> 04:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
because that's that's not quite in the
 
04:06:51.269 --> 04:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
language but there were over 10 million
 
04:06:55.950 --> 04:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
individual sales that occurred um in
 
04:07:01.149 --> 04:07:01.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2023 2022 and 2023 so
 
04:07:04.149 --> 04:07:04.159 align:start position:0%
there's a significant amount
 
04:07:08.269 --> 04:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
of manual stuffing of information
 
04:07:10.990 --> 04:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
putting up posters um and we're not
 
04:07:13.710 --> 04:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
really sure exactly what the information
 
04:07:15.269 --> 04:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
it is that we're supposed to include on
 
04:07:19.309 --> 04:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
a poster talks about Bill talks about um
 
04:07:21.229 --> 04:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
resources and that was part of our
 
04:07:23.070 --> 04:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
conversation with
 
04:07:25.590 --> 04:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
representative do are you do you are you
 
04:07:28.149 --> 04:07:28.159 align:start position:0%
pointing them to a certain agency are
 
04:07:29.469 --> 04:07:29.479 align:start position:0%
you pointing them to a certain phone
 
04:07:31.189 --> 04:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
number or website where where are you
 
04:07:34.429 --> 04:07:34.439 align:start position:0%
pointing them and it wasn't really
 
04:07:38.309 --> 04:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
clear what uh the sponsor want wanted
 
04:07:39.670 --> 04:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
and I know there are more than one
 
04:07:42.309 --> 04:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor now but really wasn't clear to
 
04:07:44.590 --> 04:07:44.600 align:start position:0%
us what it is that they wanted us to
 
04:07:49.910 --> 04:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
promote um and so that therefore um we
 
04:07:52.990 --> 04:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
we think that this uh the concept
 
04:07:55.630 --> 04:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
certainly the commission is engaged in
 
04:07:57.389 --> 04:07:57.399 align:start position:0%
promoting Public Safety we have an
 
04:07:59.469 --> 04:07:59.479 align:start position:0%
educational excellent educational
 
04:08:02.550 --> 04:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
programs that we offer around the state
 
04:08:06.469 --> 04:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
uh to lenses and civilians alike um the
 
04:08:08.710 --> 04:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement and Licensing is dedicated
 
04:08:10.269 --> 04:08:10.279 align:start position:0%
to making sure Public Safety is the
 
04:08:13.790 --> 04:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
number one priority so we also
 
04:08:15.469 --> 04:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
distribute posters dealing with
 
04:08:18.349 --> 04:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
identification etc for lenses so we're
 
04:08:22.349 --> 04:08:22.359 align:start position:0%
not unfamiliar with this type of process
 
04:08:25.910 --> 04:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh but this seems a little bit vague to
 
04:08:28.349 --> 04:08:28.359 align:start position:0%
us uh and especially where there's no
 
04:08:32.349 --> 04:08:32.359 align:start position:0%
appropriation attached to it um you know
 
04:08:35.229 --> 04:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
it would look it would appear to us that
 
04:08:37.550 --> 04:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
the cost initially would be over $200
 
04:08:41.630 --> 04:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
,000 just to print the trifold U
 
04:08:44.790 --> 04:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
handouts and of course Distributing them
 
04:08:47.349 --> 04:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
is going to slow down some of the
 
04:08:50.229 --> 04:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
process uh especially possibly during
 
04:08:54.030 --> 04:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
holidays Etc where we're uh employees
 
04:08:55.790 --> 04:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
are going to have to continue to get
 
04:08:58.469 --> 04:08:58.479 align:start position:0%
these materials put them into bags or uh
 
04:09:00.389 --> 04:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
everything that goes out so we think
 
04:09:03.309 --> 04:09:03.319 align:start position:0%
there are some significant challenges
 
04:09:05.030 --> 04:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
that uh if the bill is going to move
 
04:09:06.630 --> 04:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
forward that we think should be
 
04:09:06.640 --> 04:09:11.830 align:start position:0%
forward that we think should be
addressed

04:09:11.830 --> 04:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:13.950 --> 04:09:13.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for take my question thank you
 
04:09:17.990 --> 04:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
if we if a nonprofit um would come up
 
04:09:21.910 --> 04:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
with a a poster with uh The Liquor
 
04:09:24.510 --> 04:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
Commission and there was one poster in
 
04:09:27.950 --> 04:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
each liquor store just giving people
 
04:09:30.229 --> 04:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
information about where they can go if
 
04:09:33.349 --> 04:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
they have you know alcoholic you know
 
04:09:36.750 --> 04:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
issues if they're alcoholics or you know
 
04:09:39.990 --> 04:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh Recovery Center um would that be
 
04:09:41.790 --> 04:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
possible it would just be a poster that
 
04:09:44.910 --> 04:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
we could probably produce with the lur
 
04:09:46.910 --> 04:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
commission and a nonprofit that deals
 
04:09:49.710 --> 04:09:49.720 align:start position:0%
with alcoholism would that be possible
 
04:09:51.429 --> 04:09:51.439 align:start position:0%
we could probably amend this bill to
 
04:09:53.469 --> 04:09:53.479 align:start position:0%
just get rid of the language of this
 
04:09:56.189 --> 04:09:56.199 align:start position:0%
bill and maybe just introduce posters
 
04:09:58.149 --> 04:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
and liquor stores well I I would need to
 
04:10:00.550 --> 04:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
speak with uh chairman mik to see
 
04:10:03.990 --> 04:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
exactly um what his feelings are about
 
04:10:06.389 --> 04:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
that uh the commission does display a
 
04:10:09.149 --> 04:10:09.159 align:start position:0%
lot of responsible uh Mater material now
 
04:10:10.710 --> 04:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
and it stores certainly dealing with
 
04:10:13.510 --> 04:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
underage drinking Etc and over service
 
04:10:17.109 --> 04:10:17.119 align:start position:0%
so I think that um I'm really not in a
 
04:10:19.710 --> 04:10:19.720 align:start position:0%
position to say yes but I think I I
 
04:10:21.870 --> 04:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
would be happy to bring your request to
 
04:10:24.109 --> 04:10:24.119 align:start position:0%
the chairman to see how he feels about
 
04:10:26.109 --> 04:10:26.119 align:start position:0%
that okay thanks well in terms of
 
04:10:28.910 --> 04:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
followup on that um obviously there was
 
04:10:31.630 --> 04:10:31.640 align:start position:0%
200 to 450 and you just said that you
 
04:10:33.590 --> 04:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
know the major cost is probably that
 
04:10:38.830 --> 04:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
three the three-sided folded right color
 
04:10:43.349 --> 04:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
glossy handout so did you do a breakdown
 
04:10:47.030 --> 04:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
on your when you did your uh fiscal note
 
04:10:49.910 --> 04:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
did how like I would assume if we just
 
04:10:52.950 --> 04:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
put posters you know 110 posters
 
04:10:54.870 --> 04:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't cost us much money at
 
04:10:56.750 --> 04:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
all compared I would think it's the
 
04:10:59.429 --> 04:10:59.439 align:start position:0%
three-fold so so we we would save a lot
 
04:11:01.870 --> 04:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
of you know well the the posters
 
04:11:03.870 --> 04:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
themselves we talked to graphic services
 
04:11:09.229 --> 04:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
and um they wereing us a figure of
 
04:11:12.030 --> 04:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
800 uh I didn't see the back side would
 
04:11:13.830 --> 04:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
that would because these would be posted
 
04:11:16.149 --> 04:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
in our liquor stores so that's that's a
 
04:11:18.429 --> 04:11:18.439 align:start position:0%
fairly insignificant amount of money
 
04:11:22.790 --> 04:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
considering um it's the uh brochure and
 
04:11:24.750 --> 04:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
the information included on the brochure
 
04:11:28.269 --> 04:11:28.279 align:start position:0%
and in some cases um that may be if that
 
04:11:30.229 --> 04:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
information is outdated or it needs to
 
04:11:32.109 --> 04:11:32.119 align:start position:0%
be updated now you're we're talking
 
04:11:35.870 --> 04:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
about a lot of information which um
 
04:11:37.550 --> 04:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
would have to keep track of you even
 
04:11:41.469 --> 04:11:41.479 align:start position:0%
though HHS is part of this equation um
 
04:11:43.550 --> 04:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
they they're pretty much much
 
04:11:46.109 --> 04:11:46.119 align:start position:0%
sanctioning our the message that's being
 
04:11:48.429 --> 04:11:48.439 align:start position:0%
delivered as opposed to uh providing
 
04:11:50.469 --> 04:11:50.479 align:start position:0%
what the content would
 
04:11:52.429 --> 04:11:52.439 align:start position:0%
be thank
 
04:11:55.590 --> 04:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
you yeah I would I would think that um I
 
04:11:57.750 --> 04:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
mean I know we have we the big push now
 
04:12:02.469 --> 04:12:02.479 align:start position:0%
is 988 for mental health services that
 
04:12:05.229 --> 04:12:05.239 align:start position:0%
if we work with them in conjunction and
 
04:12:08.070 --> 04:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
you know a poster but it's seem to me
 
04:12:10.309 --> 04:12:10.319 align:start position:0%
you you really just can't stop it but
 
04:12:11.750 --> 04:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
you almost have to have a little that
 
04:12:14.910 --> 04:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
little holder in the front with a card
 
04:12:17.710 --> 04:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
that you could take with a phone number
 
04:12:20.429 --> 04:12:20.439 align:start position:0%
and with a contact information but it
 
04:12:22.109 --> 04:12:22.119 align:start position:0%
still be a lot cheaper than trying to
 
04:12:26.349 --> 04:12:26.359 align:start position:0%
put a something in every package well I
 
04:12:30.030 --> 04:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
and um this is
 
04:12:32.109 --> 04:12:32.119 align:start position:0%
probably I probably shouldn't suggest
 
04:12:34.189 --> 04:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
this but as you know the commission is
 
04:12:37.590 --> 04:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
is introducing its new uh computer
 
04:12:40.550 --> 04:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
system uh very soon and a lot of the
 
04:12:42.670 --> 04:12:42.680 align:start position:0%
information that's printed on the
 
04:12:45.510 --> 04:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
receipts is programmable right so you go
 
04:12:47.469 --> 04:12:47.479 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea too you could uh
 
04:12:49.750 --> 04:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
04:12:52.389 --> 04:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
um uh where you could
 
04:12:54.990 --> 04:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
potentially print a a message that says
 
04:12:56.710 --> 04:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
if you need help call this phone number
 
04:12:59.630 --> 04:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
Etc um and now that's accomplished
 
04:13:01.710 --> 04:13:01.720 align:start position:0%
automatically and it's a right then we
 
04:13:02.870 --> 04:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
don't have to think about that it's
 
04:13:05.950 --> 04:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
already on the receipt that's something
 
04:13:09.269 --> 04:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:11.670 --> 04:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:13:14.830 --> 04:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
for attorney more see none thank you
 
04:13:14.840 --> 04:13:15.670 align:start position:0%
for attorney more see none thank you
very

04:13:15.670 --> 04:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:13:19.830 --> 04:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
much is there anybody else would like to
 
04:13:28.630 --> 04:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:36.149 --> 04:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:36.159 --> 04:19:13.269 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:19:13.269 --> 04:19:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:16.550 --> 04:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
so um this will is one of many that you
 
04:19:18.750 --> 04:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
will see with my name on the bill but
 
04:19:21.950 --> 04:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
frankly I have very little contact
 
04:19:24.149 --> 04:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
whatsoever with what the intent of these
 
04:19:26.630 --> 04:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
Department bills I would say that uh
 
04:19:29.630 --> 04:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
whether it's liquor or banking or
 
04:19:32.710 --> 04:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
Insurance um and you know in other years
 
04:19:35.269 --> 04:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
it's been Securities and whatever when
 
04:19:37.469 --> 04:19:37.479 align:start position:0%
when I bring in a a these bills are
 
04:19:39.389 --> 04:19:39.399 align:start position:0%
Department bills so they are that this
 
04:19:44.389 --> 04:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
is they're carrying the flag and uh um
 
04:19:46.149 --> 04:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
but I'm more than willing to to put my
 
04:19:49.349 --> 04:19:49.359 align:start position:0%
name on it to in that way making sure it
 
04:19:53.910 --> 04:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
gets properly handled if nothing else so
 
04:19:56.790 --> 04:19:56.800 align:start position:0%

04:19:59.790 --> 04:19:59.800 align:start position:0%

HB

04:20:26.990 --> 04:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
HB
 
04:20:30.070 --> 04:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
1243 uh this bill was d uh drafted at
 
04:20:32.229 --> 04:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
the request of the banking Department um
 
04:20:35.510 --> 04:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
it revises RSA chapter
 
04:20:39.790 --> 04:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
361a holistically um with a goal towards
 
04:20:41.870 --> 04:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
modernizing it and streamlining it and
 
04:20:43.830 --> 04:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
making it consistent with our other
 
04:20:46.149 --> 04:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
statutes we do have a handout that I
 
04:20:47.950 --> 04:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
think is going around that pretty much
 
04:20:49.750 --> 04:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
covers what Seth and I are going to talk
 
04:20:51.070 --> 04:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
about but we're just going to go over it
 
04:20:54.149 --> 04:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
in high level detail and happy to answer
 
04:20:57.870 --> 04:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
any questions that may come up RSA 361a
 
04:21:00.830 --> 04:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
generally covers um Auto licenser and
 
04:21:02.710 --> 04:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
regulation of auto financing by the
 
04:21:02.720 --> 04:21:03.750 align:start position:0%
regulation of auto financing by the
banking

04:21:03.750 --> 04:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
banking
 
04:21:06.510 --> 04:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
Department this is um this has been an
 
04:21:08.030 --> 04:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
ongoing effort at the banking Department
 
04:21:11.469 --> 04:21:11.479 align:start position:0%
to to make all of our statutes read
 
04:21:15.070 --> 04:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
nicely look similar contain similar
 
04:21:17.510 --> 04:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
Provisions really to facilitate smooth
 
04:21:20.189 --> 04:21:20.199 align:start position:0%
regulation of our licensed entities as
 
04:21:22.750 --> 04:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
well as to provide sufficient consumer
 
04:21:26.630 --> 04:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
protection uh one of the purposes of
 
04:21:30.149 --> 04:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
this overarching rewrite was to um try
 
04:21:32.030 --> 04:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
to get out ahead of some consumer
 
04:21:33.349 --> 04:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
protection issues that we had been
 
04:21:35.590 --> 04:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
seeing cropping up I'd say over the last
 
04:21:37.870 --> 04:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
several years there's been a moderate
 
04:21:40.149 --> 04:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
increase in consumer complaints filed
 
04:21:43.510 --> 04:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
against um auto dealers who facilitate
 
04:21:47.309 --> 04:21:47.319 align:start position:0%
financing um of auto trans uh sale
 
04:21:50.469 --> 04:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
transactions and so we rewrote this
 
04:21:52.109 --> 04:21:52.119 align:start position:0%
statute with a goal of trying to get out
 
04:21:53.670 --> 04:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
ahead of some of those issues before
 
04:21:56.469 --> 04:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
they become big issues um in that
 
04:21:58.910 --> 04:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
process we did an initial draft and then
 
04:22:01.309 --> 04:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
we ran it by the Auto Dealers
 
04:22:03.550 --> 04:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
Association um and they provided us with
 
04:22:05.750 --> 04:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
really helpful feedback and we were able
 
04:22:08.269 --> 04:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
to work out a few a few tweaks that um
 
04:22:09.590 --> 04:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
Seth is going to talk about that
 
04:22:11.830 --> 04:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can work on as an amendment
 
04:22:14.830 --> 04:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
to the bill as it stands now um so with
 
04:22:17.070 --> 04:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to let Seth um talk about
 
04:22:19.910 --> 04:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
some of the details of the bill and the
 
04:22:19.920 --> 04:22:21.710 align:start position:0%
some of the details of the bill and the
amendment

04:22:21.710 --> 04:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:22:24.070 --> 04:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
good good afternoon Mr chair members of
 
04:22:26.189 --> 04:22:26.199 align:start position:0%
the committee um I very briefly wanted
 
04:22:28.070 --> 04:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
to touch on some of the specific changes
 
04:22:31.590 --> 04:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
in this bill to RSA 361a uh first I
 
04:22:33.630 --> 04:22:33.640 align:start position:0%
think most importantly this reinforces
 
04:22:35.950 --> 04:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
and clarifies the banking Department's
 
04:22:38.229 --> 04:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
exam mination authority over retail
 
04:22:41.229 --> 04:22:41.239 align:start position:0%
sellers um going forward uh with the
 
04:22:42.389 --> 04:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill the banking
 
04:22:44.030 --> 04:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
department will include the retail
 
04:22:47.269 --> 04:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
sellers in our regular examination cycle
 
04:22:48.830 --> 04:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
so they'd be examined once every two
 
04:22:52.670 --> 04:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
years um this is designed to ensure uh
 
04:22:53.990 --> 04:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
retail seller compliance with New
 
04:22:56.710 --> 04:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law um it also ensures regular
 
04:22:58.070 --> 04:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
communication between the banking
 
04:23:00.030 --> 04:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
department and Retail sellers so we
 
04:23:01.670 --> 04:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
think this is good for both the business
 
04:23:05.349 --> 04:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
Community as well as for consumers um
 
04:23:07.349 --> 04:23:07.359 align:start position:0%
there's some some technical changes to
 
04:23:10.710 --> 04:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
the uh changes to the bill uh or changes
 
04:23:13.750 --> 04:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
to RSA 361a as well um there are some
 
04:23:15.910 --> 04:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
additional annual reporting and filing
 
04:23:17.830 --> 04:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
requirements which are designed to
 
04:23:19.710 --> 04:23:19.720 align:start position:0%
achieve the same goals in terms of
 
04:23:21.750 --> 04:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
regular communication between us and the
 
04:23:25.030 --> 04:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
business Community um the the law will
 
04:23:27.149 --> 04:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
now impose a net worth requirement on
 
04:23:29.109 --> 04:23:29.119 align:start position:0%
all lenses of
 
04:23:31.149 --> 04:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
$25,000 um there are some other
 
04:23:33.510 --> 04:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
technical changes to clear up some
 
04:23:35.830 --> 04:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
ambiguities that that we've encountered
 
04:23:39.309 --> 04:23:39.319 align:start position:0%
in the law over the past years um which
 
04:23:41.070 --> 04:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
have made it difficult for the banking
 
04:23:43.309 --> 04:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
depart for for the businesses to follow
 
04:23:45.710 --> 04:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
the law and for us to administer the law
 
04:23:47.750 --> 04:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
and this bill is designed to clear those
 
04:23:51.550 --> 04:23:51.560 align:start position:0%
up um as the commissioner mentioned um
 
04:23:54.590 --> 04:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
we will also be offering an amendment um
 
04:23:58.229 --> 04:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
to this this bill that um we worked on
 
04:23:59.950 --> 04:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
over the past uh few months in
 
04:24:02.590 --> 04:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
collaboration with the auto dealers um
 
04:24:04.109 --> 04:24:04.119 align:start position:0%
the amendment that you will see is
 
04:24:06.870 --> 04:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
really designed to do four things first
 
04:24:08.950 --> 04:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
it would revise the effective date of
 
04:24:11.229 --> 04:24:11.239 align:start position:0%
the bill current in the current version
 
04:24:13.550 --> 04:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
uh the effective date is July 1st of
 
04:24:15.309 --> 04:24:15.319 align:start position:0%
this year it would push it about six
 
04:24:17.389 --> 04:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
months to or six months exactly to
 
04:24:20.630 --> 04:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
January 1st of next year um both the
 
04:24:23.149 --> 04:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
banking department and um the auto
 
04:24:25.590 --> 04:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
dealers I think would benefit from that
 
04:24:28.349 --> 04:24:28.359 align:start position:0%
six additional months to prepare for the
 
04:24:31.070 --> 04:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
changes that are there um it the
 
04:24:33.229 --> 04:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
amendment would modify the definition of
 
04:24:36.189 --> 04:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
significant event um that exists in thew
 
04:24:39.630 --> 04:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
law um under the law lenses would be
 
04:24:41.269 --> 04:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
required to report what are called
 
04:24:43.670 --> 04:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
significant events so for example a
 
04:24:46.149 --> 04:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
significant lawsuit that impacts the the
 
04:24:49.590 --> 04:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
lenses business and um as we worked on
 
04:24:51.030 --> 04:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
this with the auto dealers the goal was
 
04:24:54.070 --> 04:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
to strike the right balance between um
 
04:24:57.030 --> 04:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
requiring lenses to report to us what we
 
04:24:58.590 --> 04:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
think we need to know in order to
 
04:25:00.750 --> 04:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
properly regulate them but also not
 
04:25:02.910 --> 04:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
placing an unreasonable burden on on the
 
04:25:06.469 --> 04:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
business Community um the next Amendment
 
04:25:08.590 --> 04:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
will be to modify a section of the bill
 
04:25:10.910 --> 04:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
that pertains to the initial license
 
04:25:14.189 --> 04:25:14.199 align:start position:0%
term for lenses and that's basically a
 
04:25:15.790 --> 04:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
technical change that is designed to
 
04:25:15.800 --> 04:25:17.229 align:start position:0%
technical change that is designed to
align

04:25:17.229 --> 04:25:17.239 align:start position:0%
align
 
04:25:20.830 --> 04:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
361a with our other laws that that
 
04:25:23.189 --> 04:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
govern our other licenses and also
 
04:25:26.229 --> 04:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
aligns with the system of record for uh
 
04:25:27.870 --> 04:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
retail seller licenses the national
 
04:25:31.070 --> 04:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
multi-state licensing system and finally
 
04:25:33.070 --> 04:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
there are some technical sort of
 
04:25:35.309 --> 04:25:35.319 align:start position:0%
clarifying changes to the examination
 
04:25:39.149 --> 04:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
section um of the bill uh the banking
 
04:25:40.830 --> 04:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
department and the auto dealers I think
 
04:25:42.550 --> 04:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
spent the most time on that particular
 
04:25:45.429 --> 04:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
section to ensure that businesses know
 
04:25:48.309 --> 04:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
what to expect from our examination
 
04:25:52.670 --> 04:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
process um and um and to to make to make
 
04:25:55.590 --> 04:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
those changes clear um with that if I'd
 
04:25:56.790 --> 04:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions that
 
04:25:56.800 --> 04:25:57.950 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions that
you

04:25:57.950 --> 04:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:25:57.960 --> 04:26:03.750 align:start position:0%
you
have

04:26:03.750 --> 04:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:06.910 --> 04:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
okay yes thank you Mr chairman
 
04:26:09.510 --> 04:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned um considerable
 
04:26:12.990 --> 04:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
consumer complaints is there any
 
04:26:15.149 --> 04:26:15.159 align:start position:0%
anything in particular that that sort of
 
04:26:18.309 --> 04:26:18.319 align:start position:0%
overwhelms all other complaints any
 
04:26:22.030 --> 04:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
particular uh instances or or or that
 
04:26:25.109 --> 04:26:25.119 align:start position:0%
sort of follow in a pattern
 
04:26:27.790 --> 04:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
um trying to think so consumer
 
04:26:29.590 --> 04:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
complaints are confidential so I have to
 
04:26:31.149 --> 04:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
try carefully about what I say but
 
04:26:33.790 --> 04:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
generally speaking I think what we were
 
04:26:36.269 --> 04:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
seeing was a lot of educational
 
04:26:38.550 --> 04:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
opportunities where if we had been able
 
04:26:40.670 --> 04:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
to get out ahead of it and do an
 
04:26:43.790 --> 04:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
examination we could have helped educate
 
04:26:47.309 --> 04:26:47.319 align:start position:0%
the lensey to about what our law says
 
04:26:49.070 --> 04:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
and they could have fixed the problem
 
04:26:52.830 --> 04:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
before it became a big problem um for
 
04:26:55.630 --> 04:26:55.640 align:start position:0%
example we have a component in our law
 
04:26:57.950 --> 04:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
that requires pay off when you go and
 
04:27:00.950 --> 04:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
trade in a car and get a new car um with
 
04:27:06.309 --> 04:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
a loan they the um lender has to pay off
 
04:27:08.309 --> 04:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
or the auto dealer has to pay off the
 
04:27:11.229 --> 04:27:11.239 align:start position:0%
old loan within a certain amount of time
 
04:27:13.269 --> 04:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
and some people just weren't aware of
 
04:27:15.030 --> 04:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
that component of the law and if we had
 
04:27:16.870 --> 04:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
been out there doing examinations we
 
04:27:18.389 --> 04:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
probably could have gotten out ahead of
 
04:27:20.990 --> 04:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
that and Ed done some education um but
 
04:27:22.910 --> 04:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
we don't the way the law currently sits
 
04:27:25.189 --> 04:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
we don't do those regular examinations
 
04:27:26.950 --> 04:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
unless there's a big big problem that we
 
04:27:28.030 --> 04:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
find out about through the Consumer
 
04:27:30.790 --> 04:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
complaint process so we weren't able to
 
04:27:34.790 --> 04:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
like know that that was such an issue um
 
04:27:37.429 --> 04:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
so it's it was mostly like I'd say a lot
 
04:27:40.990 --> 04:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
of Education driven issues thank you
 
04:27:41.000 --> 04:27:42.550 align:start position:0%
of Education driven issues thank you
very

04:27:42.550 --> 04:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:27:44.590 --> 04:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
much represent of
 
04:27:46.630 --> 04:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
Ammon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:27:49.790 --> 04:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
coming and testifying um I just had two
 
04:27:52.149 --> 04:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
two separate but related questions um
 
04:27:53.910 --> 04:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
could you tell us about the penalty
 
04:27:56.630 --> 04:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
portion of the law uh what's the worst
 
04:27:58.550 --> 04:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
that can happen to a a dealer that is
 
04:28:01.830 --> 04:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
out of compliance and then uh I'll ask a
 
04:28:04.710 --> 04:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
followup if that's okay okay so
 
04:28:07.189 --> 04:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
generally it's the I know that it's
 
04:28:09.349 --> 04:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
nearly identical to our other laws um
 
04:28:10.670 --> 04:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
maybe you can speak to that a little bit
 
04:28:12.750 --> 04:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
more specifically yeah the the penalty
 
04:28:14.550 --> 04:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
Provisions have been restructured to
 
04:28:16.149 --> 04:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
align with our other laws but they
 
04:28:17.710 --> 04:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
really haven't been changed I would say
 
04:28:19.309 --> 04:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
some of the most severe penalties would
 
04:28:22.670 --> 04:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
be a revocation of a license a bar from
 
04:28:24.710 --> 04:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
being able to receive a license and
 
04:28:26.510 --> 04:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
there could be uh potentially
 
04:28:29.030 --> 04:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
significant monetary penalties um and
 
04:28:31.070 --> 04:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
that depends on the number of violations
 
04:28:34.149 --> 04:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
under the law um so those are the main
 
04:28:36.830 --> 04:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
sorts of um in terms of the most severe
 
04:28:38.710 --> 04:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
penalties that that's what I would
 
04:28:40.630 --> 04:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
consider but again just to emphasize I
 
04:28:42.229 --> 04:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
don't think that's changing we just
 
04:28:43.750 --> 04:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
changed the way it's written to make it
 
04:28:45.790 --> 04:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
more clear and so if somebody's looking
 
04:28:47.389 --> 04:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
at the penalty Provisions they go oh
 
04:28:48.790 --> 04:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
this looks just like the penalty
 
04:28:52.630 --> 04:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
Provisions in RSA 997a okay yeah but
 
04:28:56.469 --> 04:28:56.479 align:start position:0%
over the years um we have instituted
 
04:28:59.429 --> 04:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
restitution and that that you have have
 
04:29:01.710 --> 04:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
the ability to order restitution yes
 
04:29:03.590 --> 04:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
that's not changing we have all the same
 
04:29:06.030 --> 04:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
Authority that we do under current law
 
04:29:08.189 --> 04:29:08.199 align:start position:0%
but and just a quick followup for the
 
04:29:13.149 --> 04:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
question inquir uh so separate topic um
 
04:29:14.710 --> 04:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:29:19.109 --> 04:29:19.119 align:start position:0%
proportionality of the compliance burden
 
04:29:20.870 --> 04:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking of the largest auto
 
04:29:23.349 --> 04:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
dealer group versus the smallest Auto
 
04:29:25.269 --> 04:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
Deal group uh does it advantage or
 
04:29:28.630 --> 04:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
disadvantage one size outfit over
 
04:29:31.910 --> 04:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
another um Michael and the audience can
 
04:29:32.870 --> 04:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
probably come up and speak to this
 
04:29:34.630 --> 04:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
better than I can but I'll give it a go
 
04:29:37.590 --> 04:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
um so we um tailor our exams to the size
 
04:29:39.189 --> 04:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
of the entity to the size and complexity
 
04:29:42.070 --> 04:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
of the entity so you've got a big big
 
04:29:44.070 --> 04:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
entity that does lots of business we
 
04:29:46.469 --> 04:29:46.479 align:start position:0%
might assign two examiners to it do it
 
04:29:48.950 --> 04:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
in x amount of time if you got a mom and
 
04:29:51.670 --> 04:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
pop shop that's done just a handful of
 
04:29:53.950 --> 04:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
loans we're going to maybe do a one-day
 
04:29:57.309 --> 04:29:57.319 align:start position:0%
exam or a desk review of that um we also
 
04:29:59.229 --> 04:29:59.239 align:start position:0%
have the ability to accept exams from
 
04:30:01.950 --> 04:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
other states and do multi-state exams um
 
04:30:05.269 --> 04:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
in terms of the auto dealers who just do
 
04:30:07.750 --> 04:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
the retail who just have a retail seller
 
04:30:10.349 --> 04:30:10.359 align:start position:0%
license most they're they're not
 
04:30:12.030 --> 04:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
licensed in every state so that's a
 
04:30:13.950 --> 04:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
little tricky for doing a multi-state
 
04:30:16.149 --> 04:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
but for the big sales finance companies
 
04:30:18.309 --> 04:30:18.319 align:start position:0%
like Toyota finance they're licensed in
 
04:30:20.070 --> 04:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
50 states so lots of times we can take
 
04:30:22.389 --> 04:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
advantage of doing a multi-state exam or
 
04:30:24.590 --> 04:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
accepting other states examinations so
 
04:30:26.109 --> 04:30:26.119 align:start position:0%
we try to tailor it to the size and
 
04:30:33.189 --> 04:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:36.630 --> 04:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
entity very much thank you
 
04:30:36.640 --> 04:30:53.070 align:start position:0%
entity very much thank you
okay

04:30:53.070 --> 04:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:55.469 --> 04:30:55.479 align:start position:0%

communities of the state so uh we're
 
04:31:17.510 --> 04:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
here today um on hb1 1243 to say uh we
 
04:31:20.790 --> 04:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
support it uh with the amendment um that
 
04:31:23.109 --> 04:31:23.119 align:start position:0%
was just spoken to we've done a lot of
 
04:31:26.149 --> 04:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
work um with the banking Department uh
 
04:31:28.630 --> 04:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
we'd like to thank and um appreciate
 
04:31:30.910 --> 04:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
them for the hard work that went into it
 
04:31:32.990 --> 04:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
um attorneys on both sides had a lot of
 
04:31:35.109 --> 04:31:35.119 align:start position:0%
back and forth uh we think we came up
 
04:31:37.429 --> 04:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
with an amendment that is um that is
 
04:31:39.910 --> 04:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
positive that's that's business friendly
 
04:31:41.550 --> 04:31:41.560 align:start position:0%
um we support the need for the banking
 
04:31:42.950 --> 04:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
Department to do the
 
04:31:45.710 --> 04:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
modernization um it really does set the
 
04:31:48.750 --> 04:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
bar and also level the playing field uh
 
04:31:50.349 --> 04:31:50.359 align:start position:0%
so we think that there's some positive
 
04:31:53.269 --> 04:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
things to to come from the amendment um
 
04:31:56.469 --> 04:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
and so as mentioned um we support both
 
04:31:59.149 --> 04:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
the 35-page bill and the two and a half
 
04:32:04.469 --> 04:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:04.479 --> 04:32:06.429 align:start position:0%
 
submitted

04:32:06.429 --> 04:32:06.439 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
04:32:10.550 --> 04:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
any questions from committee members see
 
04:32:13.510 --> 04:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much thank you sir
 
04:32:15.870 --> 04:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else would like to
 
04:32:18.630 --> 04:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
speak so uh since we have a a little bit
 
04:32:20.830 --> 04:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
of time here I I'm going to use this as
 
04:32:23.990 --> 04:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to tell a story and that
 
04:32:24.000 --> 04:32:25.070 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to tell a story and that
is

04:32:25.070 --> 04:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:32:28.790 --> 04:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
um story time yeah story time because I
 
04:32:32.710 --> 04:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
got time so so at any rate uh imagine
 
04:32:37.030 --> 04:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
how long ago this was uh Kelly a aot was
 
04:32:39.309 --> 04:32:39.319 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General all
 
04:32:43.910 --> 04:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
right and the issue at the time was the
 
04:32:45.750 --> 04:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
who is exempt from the consumer
 
04:32:47.950 --> 04:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
protection act now we had you know
 
04:32:50.030 --> 04:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
Brendan Ganon was in here today you know
 
04:32:51.389 --> 04:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
talking about the consumer protection
 
04:32:54.630 --> 04:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
act and in the consumer protection act
 
04:32:58.550 --> 04:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
we have um we had several exemptions uh
 
04:33:00.870 --> 04:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
and we visit we have visited this issue
 
04:33:03.189 --> 04:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
multiple times over the years uh I would
 
04:33:04.629 --> 04:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
say the good news is we don't have any
 
04:33:07.310 --> 04:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
bills this year here to revisit it again
 
04:33:09.150 --> 04:33:09.160 align:start position:0%
but we have because some people don't
 
04:33:11.869 --> 04:33:11.879 align:start position:0%
like some of the exemptions and in those
 
04:33:14.429 --> 04:33:14.439 align:start position:0%
exemptions um is we have four which is
 
04:33:16.789 --> 04:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission the bank
 
04:33:19.470 --> 04:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
Department the insurance department and
 
04:33:22.590 --> 04:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
the Securities division uh what occurred
 
04:33:25.189 --> 04:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
was that uh we had a little incident
 
04:33:28.269 --> 04:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
with an auto dealer who uh argued that
 
04:33:30.429 --> 04:33:30.439 align:start position:0%
they were exempt from the consumer
 
04:33:34.629 --> 04:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
protection act because they had uh BR
 
04:33:36.429 --> 04:33:36.439 align:start position:0%
they were the banking department they
 
04:33:39.189 --> 04:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
had they were registered uh to do
 
04:33:41.109 --> 04:33:41.119 align:start position:0%
financing and they had a little
 
04:33:42.709 --> 04:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
parchment on the wall that says that
 
04:33:45.150 --> 04:33:45.160 align:start position:0%
they're a licy and so they thought that
 
04:33:47.910 --> 04:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
they could get license out out of it um
 
04:33:50.990 --> 04:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
it was quite a struggle and uh but we we
 
04:33:53.910 --> 04:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
were able to stick in the consumer so if
 
04:33:55.310 --> 04:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
you ever look at the consumer protection
 
04:33:57.029 --> 04:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
act and under the exemption you'll see
 
04:34:00.470 --> 04:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
the last sentence says except auto
 
04:34:03.390 --> 04:34:03.400 align:start position:0%
dealers who are have this
 
04:34:05.949 --> 04:34:05.959 align:start position:0%
license to to the
 
04:34:08.269 --> 04:34:08.279 align:start position:0%
financing uh and so the reason why I
 
04:34:09.750 --> 04:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
think it's important for everyone to
 
04:34:12.670 --> 04:34:12.680 align:start position:0%
understand is is that
 
04:34:15.189 --> 04:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
um what we ended up doing in that
 
04:34:18.109 --> 04:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
consumer was uh to get to solve the
 
04:34:19.470 --> 04:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
whole thing of the exemptions to the
 
04:34:22.109 --> 04:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act was the power
 
04:34:24.990 --> 04:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
restitution and that is that the banking
 
04:34:27.269 --> 04:34:27.279 align:start position:0%
Department insurance department were did
 
04:34:29.470 --> 04:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
at the time did not have it and we were
 
04:34:31.429 --> 04:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
able to give it to them was that they
 
04:34:33.230 --> 04:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
can make a consumer whole if a
 
04:34:35.109 --> 04:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
consumer's been harmed then make them
 
04:34:37.949 --> 04:34:37.959 align:start position:0%
whole whole and so yes in the same case
 
04:34:40.551 --> 04:34:40.561 align:start position:0%
with this with the an auto auto dealer
 
04:34:42.349 --> 04:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
if there was a problem with the
 
04:34:44.789 --> 04:34:44.799 align:start position:0%
financing obviously if it's something
 
04:34:46.789 --> 04:34:46.799 align:start position:0%
related to the car or those other things
 
04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
there's a separate statute related to
 
04:34:50.910 --> 04:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
all that but more importantly that is
 
04:34:53.869 --> 04:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
that um these four exemptions done under
 
04:34:56.750 --> 04:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act um all three
 
04:34:58.670 --> 04:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
all of them have what the consumer
 
04:35:01.949 --> 04:35:01.959 align:start position:0%
protection act has which is the power of
 
04:35:04.230 --> 04:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
which power of restitution and so they
 
04:35:07.510 --> 04:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
made the consumer whole and so I I'm I'm
 
04:35:09.429 --> 04:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
just saying this because I think in
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
terms of globally trying to understand
 
04:35:14.470 --> 04:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
um what we did because we have all these
 
04:35:16.470 --> 04:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
bills and related to you know Brendon
 
04:35:18.949 --> 04:35:18.959 align:start position:0%
was here and we related to the consumer
 
04:35:21.510 --> 04:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
protection Division and what its job and
 
04:35:24.070 --> 04:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
what its mission is which is to is that
 
04:35:26.109 --> 04:35:26.119 align:start position:0%
power restitute is to make you the
 
04:35:28.310 --> 04:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
consumer make the New Hampshire consumer
 
04:35:30.629 --> 04:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
whole from the from whatever happened
 
04:35:33.029 --> 04:35:33.039 align:start position:0%
whatever in terms of the transaction but
 
04:35:34.269 --> 04:35:34.279 align:start position:0%
this is something that's been on the
 
04:35:35.830 --> 04:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
books in a while and it's worked really
 
04:35:40.070 --> 04:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
well and uh and uh I think that we have
 
04:35:40.080 --> 04:35:41.551 align:start position:0%
well and uh and uh I think that we have
a

04:35:41.551 --> 04:35:41.561 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:35:44.189 --> 04:35:44.199 align:start position:0%
great situation in terms of how we
 
04:35:47.310 --> 04:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
understand the where where where the
 
04:35:50.390 --> 04:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act begins and ends
 
04:35:53.789 --> 04:35:53.799 align:start position:0%
so that was my five minute
 
04:35:57.029 --> 04:35:57.039 align:start position:0%
story all right uh so we have another 10
 
04:36:00.109 --> 04:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
minutes and then we're back to
 
04:36:00.119 --> 04:36:03.709 align:start position:0%
minutes and then we're back to
liquor

04:36:03.709 --> 04:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:07.830 --> 04:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:10.150 --> 04:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
you know we haven't had any sign in
 
04:36:14.510 --> 04:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
sheets well I picked one up earlier I I
 
04:36:18.750 --> 04:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:21.910 --> 04:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
yesterday no no you oh very important if
 
04:36:24.830 --> 04:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
you want to get paid you got to do the
 
04:36:24.840 --> 04:36:25.789 align:start position:0%
you want to get paid you got to do the
machine

04:36:25.789 --> 04:36:25.799 align:start position:0%
machine
 
04:36:28.590 --> 04:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
downstairs so this this sheet here
 
04:36:30.349 --> 04:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
actually never leaves the committee room
 
04:36:32.789 --> 04:36:32.799 align:start position:0%
oh okay and it's really it is uh it's
 
04:36:34.789 --> 04:36:34.799 align:start position:0%
supposed to so that you could if people
 
04:36:36.949 --> 04:36:36.959 align:start position:0%
want wanted to see whether you were here
 
04:36:38.470 --> 04:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
today in the committee room then you
 
04:36:40.510 --> 04:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
know you could have signed in and and
 
04:36:43.510 --> 04:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
never showed up to the committee room so
 
04:36:44.830 --> 04:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
but that's true I didn't I haven't
 
04:36:47.551 --> 04:36:47.561 align:start position:0%
signed that I don't think Le well that's
 
04:36:48.670 --> 04:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
right yesterday wouldn't be the first
 
04:36:59.390 --> 04:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:01.551 --> 04:37:01.561 align:start position:0%
commissioner and he's gone
 
04:37:33.990 --> 04:37:34.000 align:start position:0%

04:37:50.240 --> 04:38:03.910 align:start position:0%
 
just

04:38:03.910 --> 04:38:03.920 align:start position:0%

got

04:40:03.750 --> 04:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:03.760 --> 04:40:06.590 align:start position:0%

oh
 
04:40:33.708 --> 04:40:33.718 align:start position:0%

04:47:17.190 --> 04:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
okay we'll open up the public Hearing in
 
04:47:20.470 --> 04:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1227 and here from the prime
 
04:47:23.310 --> 04:47:23.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Jessica Grill
 
04:47:26.110 --> 04:47:26.120 align:start position:0%
welcome to the Commerce
 
04:47:28.628 --> 04:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
Committee thank you Mr chairman and uh
 
04:47:30.190 --> 04:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
thank you to The Honorable members of
 
04:47:33.070 --> 04:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
the committee um as the title suggests
 
04:47:36.390 --> 04:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
HB 1227 extends the time that alcoholic
 
04:47:38.750 --> 04:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
beverages can be served on site from 1:
 
04:47:40.910 --> 04:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
to 2:00 a.m. Statewide and it also
 
04:47:42.868 --> 04:47:42.878 align:start position:0%
enables cities and towns to authorize a
 
04:47:45.230 --> 04:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
3: a.m. limit if they so choose this
 
04:47:47.030 --> 04:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
bill will give bars restaurants and
 
04:47:48.750 --> 04:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
event venues more freedom to serve their
 
04:47:51.270 --> 04:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
customers expand nightlife opportunities
 
04:47:52.948 --> 04:47:52.958 align:start position:0%
and encourage people to patronize New
 
04:47:55.628 --> 04:47:55.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses currently we have
 
04:47:57.190 --> 04:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
one of the earliest Statewide closing
 
04:47:59.548 --> 04:47:59.558 align:start position:0%
times in the country most States set a 2
 
04:48:01.628 --> 04:48:01.638 align:start position:0%
a last call including many states of the
 
04:48:03.030 --> 04:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
in the Northeast like Vermont and
 
04:48:05.190 --> 04:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and allowing
 
04:48:07.350 --> 04:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities to approve a 2A on last
 
04:48:09.350 --> 04:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
call in 2013 was a step in the right
 
04:48:11.150 --> 04:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
direction however there have been no
 
04:48:13.030 --> 04:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
changes to the law
 
04:48:16.868 --> 04:48:16.878 align:start position:0%
since hb1 1227 will align our liquor
 
04:48:18.948 --> 04:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
laws more closely with our neighbors and
 
04:48:21.190 --> 04:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
will make our state more competitive for
 
04:48:22.788 --> 04:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
example someone might be more likely to
 
04:48:23.910 --> 04:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
choose New Hampshire as their
 
04:48:26.070 --> 04:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
destination for a corporate retreat over
 
04:48:28.708 --> 04:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or Vermont with more young
 
04:48:30.310 --> 04:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
people looking to build their careers
 
04:48:32.270 --> 04:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
here and tourism being such a large part
 
04:48:34.590 --> 04:48:34.600 align:start position:0%
of our economy it's past time to take
 
04:48:36.310 --> 04:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
another look at closing
 
04:48:38.788 --> 04:48:38.798 align:start position:0%
time another benefit of this bill is
 
04:48:40.868 --> 04:48:40.878 align:start position:0%
local control many of our cities and
 
04:48:43.910 --> 04:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
towns including burlin nasua and lonia
 
04:48:45.430 --> 04:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
have already opted to set their last
 
04:48:48.190 --> 04:48:48.200 align:start position:0%
call at 2: a.m. under current law giving
 
04:48:50.390 --> 04:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
them the option of a 3:00 a.m. last call
 
04:48:52.830 --> 04:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
will give them more flexibility a city
 
04:48:54.750 --> 04:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
could enact an ordinance authorizing a
 
04:48:57.030 --> 04:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
3:00 a.m last call for special events
 
04:48:59.230 --> 04:48:59.240 align:start position:0%
like New Year's Eve or the 4th of July
 
04:49:01.190 --> 04:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
much like how lonia currently allows
 
04:49:02.868 --> 04:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
alcohol to be served until 2: a.m.
 
04:49:04.868 --> 04:49:04.878 align:start position:0%
during Bike Week
 
04:49:06.708 --> 04:49:06.718 align:start position:0%
to address some public safety concerns
 
04:49:08.270 --> 04:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
I'd first like to speak to the issue of
 
04:49:10.548 --> 04:49:10.558 align:start position:0%
drunk driving when the RSA was last
 
04:49:12.948 --> 04:49:12.958 align:start position:0%
updated customers had far fewer options
 
04:49:15.350 --> 04:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
for a safe ride home than they do now as
 
04:49:17.150 --> 04:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
ride sharing Services have grown and
 
04:49:18.750 --> 04:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
state agencies have invested in
 
04:49:20.948 --> 04:49:20.958 align:start position:0%
educational campaigns New Hampshire saw
 
04:49:23.708 --> 04:49:23.718 align:start position:0%
a 13.9% decrease in drunk driving deaths
 
04:49:27.548 --> 04:49:27.558 align:start position:0%
per capita from 2010 to 2019 um I also
 
04:49:29.230 --> 04:49:29.240 align:start position:0%
want to call out that while we did
 
04:49:31.150 --> 04:49:31.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately see drunk driving increase
 
04:49:34.788 --> 04:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
in 2020 and 2021 um this was during a
 
04:49:36.548 --> 04:49:36.558 align:start position:0%
period where bars and restaurants were
 
04:49:39.190 --> 04:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
either closed or had um very limited
 
04:49:41.150 --> 04:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
service which indicates that there are
 
04:49:43.190 --> 04:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
other factors at play besides Bar and
 
04:49:45.948 --> 04:49:45.958 align:start position:0%
Restaurant closing time while you may
 
04:49:47.270 --> 04:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
also be worried about potential
 
04:49:50.310 --> 04:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
increases in overall crime a 2017 study
 
04:49:51.750 --> 04:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
showed that increased foot traffic is
 
04:49:53.750 --> 04:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
linked to lower crime rates although
 
04:49:55.788 --> 04:49:55.798 align:start position:0%
correlation does not equal colation and
 
04:49:58.070 --> 04:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
we've seen other study results are mixed
 
04:49:59.430 --> 04:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
this suggests that residents and
 
04:50:00.830 --> 04:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
visitors are more engaged with their
 
04:50:03.030 --> 04:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
communities when commercial activity is
 
04:50:05.470 --> 04:50:05.480 align:start position:0%
present additionally allowing bars to
 
04:50:07.230 --> 04:50:07.240 align:start position:0%
serve drinks later is not a permission
 
04:50:10.110 --> 04:50:10.120 align:start position:0%
slip for unsafe and illegal Behavior
 
04:50:12.150 --> 04:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
vendors can and should still be held
 
04:50:13.590 --> 04:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
responsible for over serving their
 
04:50:16.150 --> 04:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
customers serving alcohol to miners or
 
04:50:17.948 --> 04:50:17.958 align:start position:0%
allowing other unsafe behavior on their
 
04:50:20.350 --> 04:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
premises we must continue to empower our
 
04:50:22.628 --> 04:50:22.638 align:start position:0%
local police to enforce the laws and
 
04:50:25.190 --> 04:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
keep our community safe essentially this
 
04:50:27.030 --> 04:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
bill is about Choice it will expand
 
04:50:29.590 --> 04:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
Commerce for businesses Statewide while
 
04:50:31.750 --> 04:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
giving cities more options to meet the
 
04:50:33.830 --> 04:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
needs of their residents whether that
 
04:50:35.990 --> 04:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
means keeping last call at 2: a.m.
 
04:50:38.390 --> 04:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
extending it to 3:00 a.m. um or doing so
 
04:50:40.470 --> 04:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
on a permanent or temporary
 
04:50:42.670 --> 04:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
basis if a business owner doesn't want
 
04:50:44.590 --> 04:50:44.600 align:start position:0%
to stay open that late they won't be
 
04:50:46.350 --> 04:50:46.360 align:start position:0%
required to just as they can close
 
04:50:50.150 --> 04:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
earlier than 1: a.m. now HB 1227 simply
 
04:50:51.788 --> 04:50:51.798 align:start position:0%
puts more control over closing time
 
04:50:54.110 --> 04:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
where it belongs in the hands of local
 
04:50:55.628 --> 04:50:55.638 align:start position:0%
communities and the businesses that
 
04:50:57.470 --> 04:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
serve them thank you I'm happy to take
 
04:50:57.480 --> 04:51:00.830 align:start position:0%
serve them thank you I'm happy to take
any

04:51:00.830 --> 04:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:03.110 --> 04:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
questions okay I guess that's pretty
 
04:51:04.990 --> 04:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
straightforward bill
 
04:51:05.000 --> 04:51:06.708 align:start position:0%
straightforward bill
represent

04:51:06.708 --> 04:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:51:09.590 --> 04:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
bilio thank you for taking my question
 
04:51:13.070 --> 04:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
have you talked with um um bartenders
 
04:51:14.510 --> 04:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
about this
 
04:51:18.548 --> 04:51:18.558 align:start position:0%
Bill yes I have and in general they're
 
04:51:20.670 --> 04:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
all in favor um from the ones I've
 
04:51:22.788 --> 04:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
spoken to um obviously limited sample
 
04:51:25.150 --> 04:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
size I um haven't been able to survey
 
04:51:27.030 --> 04:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
every bartender in the state but the
 
04:51:28.628 --> 04:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
ones I talk to are excited about the
 
04:51:31.150 --> 04:51:31.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities for um more revenue for
 
04:51:33.470 --> 04:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
their businesses more more tips frankly
 
04:51:33.480 --> 04:51:34.270 align:start position:0%
their businesses more more tips frankly
and

04:51:34.270 --> 04:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:51:36.788 --> 04:51:36.798 align:start position:0%
um helping increase that foot traffic
 
04:51:38.910 --> 04:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
that that brings in money just a
 
04:51:40.750 --> 04:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
followup so if there's a bartender that
 
04:51:43.110 --> 04:51:43.120 align:start position:0%
really can't you know work until 3 but
 
04:51:44.470 --> 04:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
the restaurant
 
04:51:47.110 --> 04:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
owner wants the restaurant to be opened
 
04:51:49.750 --> 04:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
up at 3 uh it might cause some issues
 
04:51:51.910 --> 04:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
with some employees maybe maybe not I
 
04:51:54.350 --> 04:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
don't know I I definitely think that's a
 
04:51:57.230 --> 04:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
valid point and um that's an issue
 
04:51:58.990 --> 04:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
that's not uncommon in the restaurant
 
04:52:00.708 --> 04:52:00.718 align:start position:0%
industry I think scheduling conflicts
 
04:52:02.750 --> 04:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
are always going to be an issue there's
 
04:52:04.510 --> 04:52:04.520 align:start position:0%
people who prefer to work the night
 
04:52:06.390 --> 04:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
shift there's people who absolutely
 
04:52:08.910 --> 04:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
can't work the night shift um this bill
 
04:52:12.030 --> 04:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't address any of those concerns I
 
04:52:14.670 --> 04:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
um so I I unfortunately can't speak to
 
04:52:16.110 --> 04:52:16.120 align:start position:0%
the specifics there but I would
 
04:52:18.430 --> 04:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
encourage um you know bartenders who are
 
04:52:19.990 --> 04:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
concerned to speak with their managers
 
04:52:21.548 --> 04:52:21.558 align:start position:0%
and and try to work out a schedule
 
04:52:23.708 --> 04:52:23.718 align:start position:0%
that's better fit for their their own

speak with them yet but it looks like
they're

04:52:46.430 --> 04:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:51.030 --> 04:52:51.040 align:start position:0%

04:52:53.520 --> 04:52:55.310 align:start position:0%
to okay get off
easy

04:52:55.310 --> 04:52:55.320 align:start position:0%

04:52:57.910 --> 04:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
re thank you Mr chairman thank you thank
 
04:52:59.110 --> 04:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
you representative grill for taking the
 
04:53:02.070 --> 04:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
question um did you do you have any data
 
04:53:03.868 --> 04:53:03.878 align:start position:0%
on do drunk driving increase after a
 
04:53:05.788 --> 04:53:05.798 align:start position:0%
certain hour of the evening you know
 
04:53:08.510 --> 04:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
like likelihood of drunk driving deaths
 
04:53:11.270 --> 04:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
or injuries or whatever after 2 am. or
 
04:53:13.510 --> 04:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
whatever I uh did some research through
 
04:53:15.390 --> 04:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
the um New Hampshire Department of
 
04:53:16.628 --> 04:53:16.638 align:start position:0%
Transportation unfortunately I wasn't
 
04:53:18.708 --> 04:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
able to find any time specific data for
 
04:53:20.788 --> 04:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um I've seen studies
 
04:53:22.590 --> 04:53:22.600 align:start position:0%
Nationwide and those have seen mixed
 
04:53:25.430 --> 04:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
results um some other states and other
 
04:53:27.788 --> 04:53:27.798 align:start position:0%
countries as well have seen increased in
 
04:53:29.788 --> 04:53:29.798 align:start position:0%
increased drunk driving um incidents
 
04:53:32.628 --> 04:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
late at night some have seen decreases
 
04:53:35.110 --> 04:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
um so it was unfortunately impossible to
 
04:53:37.350 --> 04:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
to draw a clear conclusion of the
 
04:53:40.270 --> 04:53:40.280 align:start position:0%
relationship between the
 
04:53:44.750 --> 04:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
two okay everybody else
 
04:53:48.750 --> 04:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
said okay thank you very much is this
 
04:53:51.310 --> 04:53:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:51.320 --> 04:53:53.628 align:start position:0%
 
person

04:53:53.628 --> 04:53:53.638 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:54:00.310 --> 04:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:07.430 --> 04:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:10.150 --> 04:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
stay he was making a p fast joke so it's
 
04:54:12.190 --> 04:54:12.200 align:start position:0%
good now you can turn your mic on turn
 
04:54:15.230 --> 04:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
hit the button oh we're on okay how
 
04:54:17.470 --> 04:54:17.480 align:start position:0%
about that um appreciate the opportunity
 
04:54:20.310 --> 04:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
to speak today um so uh my name is
 
04:54:21.948 --> 04:54:21.958 align:start position:0%
Michael Strand I am a Bedford Town
 
04:54:23.990 --> 04:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
counselor I manage a small business in
 
04:54:26.830 --> 04:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
Bedford and I am a dad I guess would be
 
04:54:30.750 --> 04:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
the qualifiers um so I think this bill
 
04:54:33.830 --> 04:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
is really common sense in my opinion and
 
04:54:38.430 --> 04:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
I'll explain why um admittedly um you
 
04:54:40.070 --> 04:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
know I'm not going to admit my age here
 
04:54:41.230 --> 04:54:41.240 align:start position:0%
but as somebody with a 10-year-old I
 
04:54:43.670 --> 04:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
don't get to spend a ton of time out at
 
04:54:45.390 --> 04:54:45.400 align:start position:0%
bars or engaged in the best of what
 
04:54:47.470 --> 04:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
Manchester Portsmith you know nightlife
 
04:54:50.150 --> 04:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
has to offer um but I do know plenty of
 
04:54:53.110 --> 04:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
people who work in the service industry
 
04:54:55.990 --> 04:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
um I am speaking in favor of this bill
 
04:54:59.750 --> 04:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
as well um so I did myself for years
 
04:55:01.110 --> 04:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
work in the service industry sometimes
 
04:55:04.270 --> 04:55:04.280 align:start position:0%
as a second job often as a first job
 
04:55:08.628 --> 04:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
um and you know I'll tell you that along
 
04:55:08.638 --> 04:55:09.990 align:start position:0%
um and you know I'll tell you that along
with

04:55:09.990 --> 04:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:55:12.868 --> 04:55:12.878 align:start position:0%
um you know the the bill yesterday that
 
04:55:15.030 --> 04:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
I could only submit written testimony
 
04:55:17.510 --> 04:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
for and I hope you read it I think this
 
04:55:20.628 --> 04:55:20.638 align:start position:0%
is a common sense um prob business a
 
04:55:23.590 --> 04:55:23.600 align:start position:0%
political bipartisan bill um you know we
 
04:55:25.990 --> 04:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
all work or did at some point in our
 
04:55:29.868 --> 04:55:29.878 align:start position:0%
lives right um so my question uh to this
 
04:55:32.708 --> 04:55:32.718 align:start position:0%
committee would be what's an hour worth
 
04:55:35.510 --> 04:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
um when we talk about extending um you
 
04:55:37.830 --> 04:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
know sales of of alcohol um you know
 
04:55:40.350 --> 04:55:40.360 align:start position:0%
more importantly what's an hour worth
 
04:55:43.670 --> 04:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
when your hourly wage is plus or minus
 
04:55:47.150 --> 04:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
five bucks an hour you rely over 90% on
 
04:55:48.948 --> 04:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
your tip-based sales revenue of which
 
04:55:51.590 --> 04:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
your employer takes none because they
 
04:55:53.548 --> 04:55:53.558 align:start position:0%
got 100% of the gross margin on your
 
04:55:55.910 --> 04:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
sales minus wages um and more
 
04:55:58.750 --> 04:55:58.760 align:start position:0%
importantly you know you're a
 
04:56:01.310 --> 04:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
bartender so you know I think you know
 
04:56:02.910 --> 04:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
serving the highest demand product since
 
04:56:05.230 --> 04:56:05.240 align:start position:0%
the beginning of time uh in the only
 
04:56:07.830 --> 04:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
privatized direct service retail setting
 
04:56:09.390 --> 04:56:09.400 align:start position:0%
where you can capitalize the sale of
 
04:56:10.510 --> 04:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
that product without government
 
04:56:13.070 --> 04:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
government intervention um is a is a
 
04:56:15.270 --> 04:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
relevant thing to talk about or think
 
04:56:18.150 --> 04:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
about um you know in short you sell
 
04:56:21.590 --> 04:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
liquor beer um you know and in the only
 
04:56:22.868 --> 04:56:22.878 align:start position:0%
place you're allowed to sell it and get
 
04:56:26.628 --> 04:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
TI for your services so I think when we
 
04:56:29.310 --> 04:56:29.320 align:start position:0%
have these broader conversations about
 
04:56:32.030 --> 04:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
you know the role of government from a
 
04:56:34.110 --> 04:56:34.120 align:start position:0%
macro standpoint or the impact on
 
04:56:36.510 --> 04:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
business and individuals uh we we kind
 
04:56:38.670 --> 04:56:38.680 align:start position:0%
of live in a funny state sometimes U
 
04:56:38.680 --> 04:56:39.430 align:start position:0%
of live in a funny state sometimes U
don't

04:56:39.430 --> 04:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:56:41.670 --> 04:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
we you know we're talking about the last
 
04:56:45.030 --> 04:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
hour you know last call uh the final two
 
04:56:47.230 --> 04:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
rounds you know when responsible best
 
04:56:49.548 --> 04:56:49.558 align:start position:0%
practices uh you know with regards to
 
04:56:51.788 --> 04:56:51.798 align:start position:0%
avoiding you know over serving or
 
04:56:53.910 --> 04:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
employed um but this is the best time to
 
04:56:55.150 --> 04:56:55.160 align:start position:0%
sell your product it's the best time to
 
04:56:57.628 --> 04:56:57.638 align:start position:0%
make money um you know pay your bills
 
04:56:59.990 --> 04:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
support your family and you know live
 
04:57:02.628 --> 04:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
free without having to die for it um
 
04:57:05.708 --> 04:57:05.718 align:start position:0%
Live Free or I is kind of our funny way
 
04:57:09.430 --> 04:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
of framing policy in many cases um and
 
04:57:11.510 --> 04:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's a turn of phrase capable
 
04:57:14.190 --> 04:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
encompassing uh all manner of evil or
 
04:57:16.868 --> 04:57:16.878 align:start position:0%
you know in this case I think good U
 
04:57:19.350 --> 04:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
this is about the freedom to work in my
 
04:57:22.510 --> 04:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
opinion um if the concern is Public
 
04:57:25.510 --> 04:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
Safety I'd have to try not to laugh to
 
04:57:28.390 --> 04:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
be honest with you um you know I
 
04:57:30.510 --> 04:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
actually pulled some um you know
 
04:57:33.390 --> 04:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
ancillary data regarding differences
 
04:57:36.628 --> 04:57:36.638 align:start position:0%
between DUI charges death rates per you
 
04:57:40.830 --> 04:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
know uh capita um and match them I'm
 
04:57:45.390 --> 04:57:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:45.400 --> 04:57:48.670 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:57:48.670 --> 04:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:54.070 --> 04:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
oh okay I apologize um so um you know
 
04:57:57.948 --> 04:57:57.958 align:start position:0%
there's actually no uh identifiable
 
04:58:00.270 --> 04:58:00.280 align:start position:0%
correlation between states that close it
 
04:58:03.190 --> 04:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
to and and higher rates of alcohol
 
04:58:05.868 --> 04:58:05.878 align:start position:0%
related crime uh from a first glance um
 
04:58:07.070 --> 04:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
you know I'd encourage you to do a deep
 
04:58:09.788 --> 04:58:09.798 align:start position:0%
dive but um you know particularly in
 
04:58:11.830 --> 04:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
this state you know we're a small State
 
04:58:13.030 --> 04:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh we have a great law enforcement
 
04:58:14.510 --> 04:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
community and I think we do tend to
 
04:58:16.670 --> 04:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
respect each other's rights and act
 
04:58:18.670 --> 04:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
pretty responsibly I don't view that as
 
04:58:21.628 --> 04:58:21.638 align:start position:0%
a you know any increased you know public
 
04:58:24.390 --> 04:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
safety hazard um but I don't even think
 
04:58:26.708 --> 04:58:26.718 align:start position:0%
we should have to talk about that really
 
04:58:29.430 --> 04:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
um because you know having a
 
04:58:30.750 --> 04:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
conversation about whether we should
 
04:58:32.948 --> 04:58:32.958 align:start position:0%
regulate you know cutof times it's going
 
04:58:35.470 --> 04:58:35.480 align:start position:0%
to defer to the the choice of the
 
04:58:39.430 --> 04:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
business owner anyhow um and really to
 
04:58:41.070 --> 04:58:41.080 align:start position:0%
zoom out for a second the government
 
04:58:43.470 --> 04:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
pre-regulated businesses or individuals
 
04:58:45.590 --> 04:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
you know commercial rights out a
 
04:58:46.868 --> 04:58:46.878 align:start position:0%
speculative assumption regarding
 
04:58:48.670 --> 04:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
individual New Hampshire citizens
 
04:58:52.110 --> 04:58:52.120 align:start position:0%
behavior is just not a winning formula
 
04:58:56.230 --> 04:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
um it's like regulating pre- crime you
 
04:58:59.708 --> 04:58:59.718 align:start position:0%
know I wouldn't do it um I would even
 
04:59:02.030 --> 04:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
potentially make the argument that to
 
04:59:02.040 --> 04:59:03.708 align:start position:0%
potentially make the argument that to
not

04:59:03.708 --> 04:59:03.718 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:59:04.948 --> 04:59:04.958 align:start position:0%
put this bill on the floor with an not
 
04:59:08.150 --> 04:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
to pass you know could amount to however
 
04:59:09.788 --> 04:59:09.798 align:start position:0%
unintentional you know legal
 
04:59:11.310 --> 04:59:11.320 align:start position:0%
discrimination against the whole class
 
04:59:13.070 --> 04:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
of workers in the granite state you know
 
04:59:14.948 --> 04:59:14.958 align:start position:0%
inhibiting their ability to do business
 
04:59:17.750 --> 04:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
support their families um so to me this
 
04:59:20.670 --> 04:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
is an easy one um I'm happy to take any
 
04:59:23.190 --> 04:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
questions but I think uh you know it's
 
04:59:24.868 --> 04:59:24.878 align:start position:0%
apolitical and it's an easy move to
 
04:59:28.270 --> 04:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
deregulate and help business and and
 
04:59:31.868 --> 04:59:31.878 align:start position:0%
people u i just ironically that the
 
04:59:34.430 --> 04:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
argument was the when we changed it to
 
04:59:37.990 --> 04:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
one it was 11 and that it that was the
 
04:59:40.628 --> 04:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
argument of why we needed to go to one
 
04:59:42.628 --> 04:59:42.638 align:start position:0%
was to give the person who had the
 
04:59:45.070 --> 04:59:45.080 align:start position:0%
second shift interesting I guess now
 
04:59:47.150 --> 04:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
you're going farther out you're now deep
 
04:59:49.070 --> 04:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
into I didn't I didn't realize it was 11
 
04:59:51.030 --> 04:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's pretty pretty
 
04:59:53.230 --> 04:59:53.240 align:start position:0%
crazy thanks for taking my question this
 
04:59:55.548 --> 04:59:55.558 align:start position:0%
is more of a would you believe um I live
 
04:59:57.750 --> 04:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
in Bartlett which is a more rural
 
05:00:00.670 --> 05:00:00.680 align:start position:0%
community and we do not have um ride
 
05:00:03.390 --> 05:00:03.400 align:start position:0%
services like Lyft and Uber so would you
 
05:00:05.150 --> 05:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
believe I do appreciate the fact that
 
05:00:06.868 --> 05:00:06.878 align:start position:0%
you're leaving this to local control
 
05:00:08.990 --> 05:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
because I have a real concern about
 
05:00:11.430 --> 05:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
people not having a ride um we have more
 
05:00:13.310 --> 05:00:13.320 align:start position:0%
moose and deer at that hour than we do
 
05:00:15.990 --> 05:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
people but um I I also want to protect
 
05:00:18.350 --> 05:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
the wildlife so I appreciate that it's
 
05:00:20.150 --> 05:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
local control
 
05:00:22.470 --> 05:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
sure well I want to protect people too I
 
05:00:23.750 --> 05:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
don't say
 
05:00:26.430 --> 05:00:26.440 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
05:00:29.070 --> 05:00:29.080 align:start position:0%
repr thank you Mr chairman Mr strand did
 
05:00:30.390 --> 05:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
you say that you don't believe there's
 
05:00:33.788 --> 05:00:33.798 align:start position:0%
any correlation between uh
 
05:00:36.910 --> 05:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
more accidents from DUI and would you
 
05:00:38.628 --> 05:00:38.638 align:start position:0%
believe that the prime sponsor testified
 
05:00:40.030 --> 05:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
to the contrary just before he walked in
 
05:00:43.830 --> 05:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
the door uh no I did not realize that um
 
05:00:45.390 --> 05:00:45.400 align:start position:0%
again I I just took a a rough
 
05:00:47.270 --> 05:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
correlative glance at you know different
 
05:00:49.150 --> 05:00:49.160 align:start position:0%
states and what the rates were who had
 
05:00:51.030 --> 05:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
you know on average higher you know
 
05:00:53.470 --> 05:00:53.480 align:start position:0%
later uh you know times that they served
 
05:00:56.868 --> 05:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
so I just you know again I frame that
 
05:00:58.590 --> 05:00:58.600 align:start position:0%
argument in the fact that I don't
 
05:01:00.430 --> 05:01:00.440 align:start position:0%
believe we should need it because I
 
05:01:02.868 --> 05:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
think you know that's an overstep I mean
 
05:01:04.628 --> 05:01:04.638 align:start position:0%
I mean you know what individuals choose
 
05:01:08.270 --> 05:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
to do um you know whether right or wrong
 
05:01:10.030 --> 05:01:10.040 align:start position:0%
that's a separate criminal issue it's a
 
05:01:14.230 --> 05:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
separate legal issue and um you know I I
 
05:01:18.030 --> 05:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
don't know that this body or we have the
 
05:01:21.070 --> 05:01:21.080 align:start position:0%
purview you know to to legislate based
 
05:01:22.868 --> 05:01:22.878 align:start position:0%
on what could happen again it's
 
05:01:24.230 --> 05:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
legislating pre- crime which I
 
05:01:26.070 --> 05:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
fundamentally have a little bit of a
 
05:01:30.910 --> 05:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:34.548 --> 05:01:34.558 align:start position:0%
slope yes represent
 
05:01:36.910 --> 05:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
we deal with a lot of liquor bills and
 
05:01:36.920 --> 05:01:40.070 align:start position:0%
we deal with a lot of liquor bills and
um

05:01:40.070 --> 05:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:42.750 --> 05:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
the if an individual is in the
 
05:01:44.150 --> 05:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
restaurant or in the bar in the
 
05:01:46.390 --> 05:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
restaurant and they're there until 3 o'
 
05:01:49.670 --> 05:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
in the morning um do you think they're
 
05:01:51.430 --> 05:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
going to be drinking more because they
 
05:01:55.590 --> 05:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
have one more hour or less or yeah I I
 
05:01:56.670 --> 05:01:56.680 align:start position:0%
think it that's where you're going to
 
05:02:00.110 --> 05:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
get a high level of variability across
 
05:02:01.910 --> 05:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know across different businesses
 
05:02:04.350 --> 05:02:04.360 align:start position:0%
you know based on policy Best Practices
 
05:02:06.070 --> 05:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
I mean there's pretty stringent guidance
 
05:02:08.750 --> 05:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
on you know not over serving which I've
 
05:02:09.948 --> 05:02:09.958 align:start position:0%
you know I don't have a ton of
 
05:02:11.990 --> 05:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
experience you know seeing this but I
 
05:02:14.230 --> 05:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
know at least in our area um you know
 
05:02:16.708 --> 05:02:16.718 align:start position:0%
restaurant owners and folks who are
 
05:02:18.110 --> 05:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
concerned about their own level of
 
05:02:21.548 --> 05:02:21.558 align:start position:0%
exposure or liability are are pretty you
 
05:02:23.788 --> 05:02:23.798 align:start position:0%
know pretty attentive to this and I
 
05:02:27.548 --> 05:02:27.558 align:start position:0%
don't know that it'd be 3:00 a.m. um but
 
05:02:30.070 --> 05:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
um you know I think typically you know
 
05:02:32.910 --> 05:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
if you extend it to two you know you
 
05:02:35.070 --> 05:02:35.080 align:start position:0%
would have things winding down long
 
05:02:36.670 --> 05:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
before two I don't think people would be
 
05:02:39.868 --> 05:02:39.878 align:start position:0%
there until three um I think you know
 
05:02:42.190 --> 05:02:42.200 align:start position:0%
also individual Common Sense people who
 
05:02:43.788 --> 05:02:43.798 align:start position:0%
work in the industry have had plenty of
 
05:02:45.708 --> 05:02:45.718 align:start position:0%
experiences good good bad and ugly and
 
05:02:47.990 --> 05:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
they are going to be proactive in terms
 
05:02:49.750 --> 05:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
of making their own lives safer and
 
05:02:53.430 --> 05:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
easier as well so um you know I tend to
 
05:02:55.990 --> 05:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
trust uh individual business
 
05:02:58.350 --> 05:02:58.360 align:start position:0%
prerogatives here and individual
 
05:03:01.070 --> 05:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
people all right thank you
 
05:03:05.628 --> 05:03:05.638 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so uh Before I Let You Go and
 
05:03:10.150 --> 05:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
um that I've been around here long time
 
05:03:12.190 --> 05:03:12.200 align:start position:0%
I was here when we change it from 11 to
 
05:03:14.948 --> 05:03:14.958 align:start position:0%
one and we did have the discussion at
 
05:03:17.310 --> 05:03:17.320 align:start position:0%
that time about leaving it up to
 
05:03:20.270 --> 05:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
different towns and letting them and the
 
05:03:23.788 --> 05:03:23.798 align:start position:0%
reason why that didn't make it was the
 
05:03:23.798 --> 05:03:25.590 align:start position:0%
reason why that didn't make it was the
concern

05:03:25.590 --> 05:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
concern
 
05:03:28.430 --> 05:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
that um it would it spot it would be
 
05:03:31.390 --> 05:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
call spot zoning spot so that if one
 
05:03:33.190 --> 05:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
town say really out of they don't they
 
05:03:34.910 --> 05:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
don't want anybody drinking driving
 
05:03:37.670 --> 05:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
through their town after a certain hour
 
05:03:40.868 --> 05:03:40.878 align:start position:0%
sure but this other town next door does
 
05:03:45.270 --> 05:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
pass it and they're upset that now
 
05:03:47.990 --> 05:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
everybody's driving back and forth and
 
05:03:50.590 --> 05:03:50.600 align:start position:0%
yeah and consu if they had if they had
 
05:03:53.590 --> 05:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
consumed too much then it creates a
 
05:03:56.110 --> 05:03:56.120 align:start position:0%
hazard to that to their community and
 
05:03:58.830 --> 05:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
that's why we ended up not doing that
 
05:03:58.840 --> 05:04:00.628 align:start position:0%
that's why we ended up not doing that
last

05:04:00.628 --> 05:04:00.638 align:start position:0%
last
 
05:04:03.910 --> 05:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
time right the neigh so I think that's a
 
05:04:05.510 --> 05:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
fair concern you know particularly when
 
05:04:08.150 --> 05:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
we talk about one community's ability to
 
05:04:09.830 --> 05:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
to negatively impact or infringe upon
 
05:04:11.350 --> 05:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
the rights of another you know assuming
 
05:04:14.510 --> 05:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
we go back to a local control model um
 
05:04:16.070 --> 05:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
but I mean I think you can see this sort
 
05:04:18.350 --> 05:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
of nuance local legislation you know
 
05:04:19.708 --> 05:04:19.718 align:start position:0%
both in the state and nationally even
 
05:04:21.670 --> 05:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
when you go back to uh coming out of
 
05:04:23.708 --> 05:04:23.718 align:start position:0%
prohibition years and Which counties and
 
05:04:26.150 --> 05:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
towns were dry and what time you know
 
05:04:27.708 --> 05:04:27.718 align:start position:0%
they could sell retail obviously in New
 
05:04:28.788 --> 05:04:28.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's different because you
 
05:04:30.788 --> 05:04:30.798 align:start position:0%
know the state runs um you know retail
 
05:04:32.830 --> 05:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
liquor store uh excuse me ret retail
 
05:04:35.470 --> 05:04:35.480 align:start position:0%
liquor sales through the stores but um
 
05:04:37.070 --> 05:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
you know we're also making assumptions
 
05:04:39.788 --> 05:04:39.798 align:start position:0%
here that you know and yes people make
 
05:04:42.110 --> 05:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
mistakes and drink and drive and often
 
05:04:43.670 --> 05:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
pay the price and unfortunately do hurt
 
05:04:46.390 --> 05:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
other people sometimes but um people
 
05:04:48.230 --> 05:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be drinking and driving period
 
05:04:53.350 --> 05:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
so to you know to try and you know
 
05:04:56.910 --> 05:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
curtail uh you know rights in one regard
 
05:04:58.868 --> 05:04:58.878 align:start position:0%
you know to prevent other crimes from
 
05:05:00.470 --> 05:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
happening and we could we could run that
 
05:05:03.070 --> 05:05:03.080 align:start position:0%
experiment up and down government and
 
05:05:06.708 --> 05:05:06.718 align:start position:0%
have quadruple the laws that we have and
 
05:05:08.310 --> 05:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
I just I don't think that's the answer I
 
05:05:09.548 --> 05:05:09.558 align:start position:0%
people shouldn't be drinking and driving
 
05:05:12.230 --> 05:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
period they shouldn't have two in drive
 
05:05:13.670 --> 05:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
you know they should make reasonable
 
05:05:15.390 --> 05:05:15.400 align:start position:0%
accommodations they should have a friend
 
05:05:17.430 --> 05:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
who we mandate that there' be a
 
05:05:19.510 --> 05:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
designated driver I don't know how you'd
 
05:05:22.030 --> 05:05:22.040 align:start position:0%
enforce it talk about inexpedient to you
 
05:05:23.470 --> 05:05:23.480 align:start position:0%
pull over and there isn't one then
 
05:05:25.430 --> 05:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to get bust for sure well
 
05:05:27.030 --> 05:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
you know and I'll say this living in a
 
05:05:28.868 --> 05:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
community that is very much uh you know
 
05:05:31.230 --> 05:05:31.240 align:start position:0%
historically was you know a Crossroads
 
05:05:32.750 --> 05:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
you know to the state and certainly is
 
05:05:35.510 --> 05:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
now if you ever drive down 101 um you
 
05:05:37.548 --> 05:05:37.558 align:start position:0%
know I also tend to trust call me naive
 
05:05:39.430 --> 05:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
but I trust law enforcement you know I
 
05:05:42.310 --> 05:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
think they get a lot of these folks who
 
05:05:44.830 --> 05:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
are not following the law and when you
 
05:05:48.270 --> 05:05:48.280 align:start position:0%
combine that uh you know pretty strong
 
05:05:50.628 --> 05:05:50.638 align:start position:0%
guardrail which is there for a reason
 
05:05:52.628 --> 05:05:52.638 align:start position:0%
you know in existing laws around
 
05:05:55.590 --> 05:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
consumption from public intoxication to
 
05:05:56.708 --> 05:05:56.718 align:start position:0%
you know driving well under the
 
05:05:58.830 --> 05:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
influence you combine that very broad
 
05:06:01.110 --> 05:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
governmental broad guard rail which I
 
05:06:04.390 --> 05:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
think is effective both in terms of uh
 
05:06:07.230 --> 05:06:07.240 align:start position:0%
catching those who do it and you know
 
05:06:09.310 --> 05:06:09.320 align:start position:0%
being a clear signal that prevents
 
05:06:11.350 --> 05:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
people from making the wrong choice and
 
05:06:12.948 --> 05:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
you combine that with good common sense
 
05:06:14.150 --> 05:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
so people don't want to kill themselves
 
05:06:15.990 --> 05:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
or others and they have friends who
 
05:06:18.270 --> 05:06:18.280 align:start position:0%
might be willing to you know to start
 
05:06:20.230 --> 05:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
drinking water for the last two hours or
 
05:06:22.110 --> 05:06:22.120 align:start position:0%
whatever the case may be or not drink at
 
05:06:25.110 --> 05:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
all um I don't think that there's a need
 
05:06:28.310 --> 05:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
to to change sales related business
 
05:06:32.868 --> 05:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
policies as a result of fear over this
 
05:06:35.190 --> 05:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very
 
05:06:38.750 --> 05:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
much okay thanks for your time okay I
 
05:06:42.070 --> 05:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
have two cards left and we have
 
05:06:46.030 --> 05:06:46.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement and Deputy enforcer are we
 
05:06:49.270 --> 05:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
doing it separately or are we
 
05:06:59.830 --> 05:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:03.510 --> 05:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
up so Mike are you to testify or you
 
05:07:10.350 --> 05:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:13.628 --> 05:07:13.638 align:start position:0%
say I used to give Jim demur a hard time
 
05:07:16.470 --> 05:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
when he would do that to me all the time
 
05:07:19.350 --> 05:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you Mr chairman and uh
 
05:07:22.110 --> 05:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
honorable committee members again uh for
 
05:07:24.590 --> 05:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
the record my name is uh Mark armaganian
 
05:07:26.628 --> 05:07:26.638 align:start position:0%
I'm the chief enforcement and Licensing
 
05:07:28.868 --> 05:07:28.878 align:start position:0%
for the Liquor Commission also with me
 
05:07:32.510 --> 05:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
here today is Deputy Chief Danielle ston
 
05:07:36.948 --> 05:07:36.958 align:start position:0%
um and and we will probably pull at uh
 
05:07:40.230 --> 05:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
Danielle's previous job being uh field
 
05:07:44.868 --> 05:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
commander for uh the field area so uh
 
05:07:47.350 --> 05:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
what the way we look at this uh first of
 
05:07:49.110 --> 05:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
all I I think the
 
05:07:51.868 --> 05:07:51.878 align:start position:0%
representatives uh for what they what
 
05:07:54.230 --> 05:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
they have put together uh as a proposed
 
05:07:58.470 --> 05:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
bill at the same time I think there's
 
05:08:01.150 --> 05:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
uh we're looking at this from an
 
05:08:03.390 --> 05:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
industry stamp point and I think we need
 
05:08:06.510 --> 05:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
to look at this from a safety standpoint
 
05:08:08.868 --> 05:08:08.878 align:start position:0%
and and a law enforcement standpoint
 
05:08:11.670 --> 05:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
also uh you brought up a very good point
 
05:08:14.670 --> 05:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman um this is going to be
 
05:08:16.868 --> 05:08:16.878 align:start position:0%
looked up as all of you know and most of
 
05:08:19.628 --> 05:08:19.638 align:start position:0%
you know that have been here a while um
 
05:08:21.310 --> 05:08:21.320 align:start position:0%
six and a half years ago when this
 
05:08:23.110 --> 05:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
Administration got together in
 
05:08:26.230 --> 05:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement we only regulate to the
 
05:08:29.070 --> 05:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
level of community and Industry Safety
 
05:08:30.990 --> 05:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
we believe that there should be local
 
05:08:33.868 --> 05:08:33.878 align:start position:0%
control and and this issue specifically
 
05:08:36.310 --> 05:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
has local control attached to it and
 
05:08:38.190 --> 05:08:38.200 align:start position:0%
Danielle will be able to speak more
 
05:08:40.708 --> 05:08:40.718 align:start position:0%
about how only three jurisdictions in
 
05:08:42.430 --> 05:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
this whole state have actually pulled
 
05:08:44.590 --> 05:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
out that availability that you mentioned
 
05:08:49.350 --> 05:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um this uh in speaking to uh
 
05:08:53.948 --> 05:08:53.958 align:start position:0%
the Chiefs even if we if we take um
 
05:08:56.150 --> 05:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
let's take let's say we take Hillsboro
 
05:08:58.470 --> 05:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
County uh because most of the sponsors
 
05:09:01.070 --> 05:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
are from the Hillsboro County area we're
 
05:09:04.830 --> 05:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
looking at 32 municipalities in that
 
05:09:07.830 --> 05:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
area out of that two two-ish cities
 
05:09:10.750 --> 05:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
maybe three depending on how they're
 
05:09:13.948 --> 05:09:13.958 align:start position:0%
established um and we have an unfunded
 
05:09:17.708 --> 05:09:17.718 align:start position:0%
ma mandate once you create longevity
 
05:09:20.230 --> 05:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
with ours of service enforcement has to
 
05:09:22.670 --> 05:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
be out longer you have the unintended
 
05:09:24.910 --> 05:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
consequence of the jurisdictions that
 
05:09:27.628 --> 05:09:27.638 align:start position:0%
don't want this to happen they have to
 
05:09:30.150 --> 05:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
put resources on the road and I feel
 
05:09:33.350 --> 05:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
that this is a um a burden that's going
 
05:09:35.430 --> 05:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
to be put on the taxpayer at the end of
 
05:09:38.150 --> 05:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
the day which I we've always been
 
05:09:41.390 --> 05:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
looking at this as saving resources we
 
05:09:43.548 --> 05:09:43.558 align:start position:0%
have an industry that stop that shuts
 
05:09:46.830 --> 05:09:46.840 align:start position:0%
down at 1:00 drinks off the table by
 
05:09:49.628 --> 05:09:49.638 align:start position:0%
1:30 um if they extend
 
05:09:52.150 --> 05:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
service um through either their
 
05:09:54.788 --> 05:09:54.798 align:start position:0%
municipality or through us uh we're
 
05:09:57.310 --> 05:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
looking at an extra hour on that so we
 
05:10:01.390 --> 05:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
know what the stop is I know how long
 
05:10:04.230 --> 05:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
that we have to create
 
05:10:08.230 --> 05:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
coverage um and and I I would hope at
 
05:10:11.470 --> 05:10:11.480 align:start position:0%
some point but good people make mistakes
 
05:10:14.990 --> 05:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
as as was stated um you know that
 
05:10:17.590 --> 05:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
everybody acts appropriately and service
 
05:10:20.190 --> 05:10:20.200 align:start position:0%
is done appropriately and it doesn't
 
05:10:22.230 --> 05:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
always happen that way that's reality
 
05:10:25.310 --> 05:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
and that's why we exist so uh with that
 
05:10:27.948 --> 05:10:27.958 align:start position:0%
in mind I I'd like to give U the floor
 
05:10:32.270 --> 05:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
to Danielle to to speak further on this
 
05:10:35.590 --> 05:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon um so I think it's
 
05:10:37.070 --> 05:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
important just to point out the law as
 
05:10:38.750 --> 05:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
it is right now the law right now allows
 
05:10:41.948 --> 05:10:41.958 align:start position:0%
lenses to sell till 1 patrons can
 
05:10:44.110 --> 05:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
consume their alcohol till
 
05:10:47.030 --> 05:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
1:30 um there is the provision in the
 
05:10:49.270 --> 05:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
law that allows the local municipalities
 
05:10:51.510 --> 05:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
to extend the service till 2 which
 
05:10:55.110 --> 05:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
allows patrons to drink until 2:30 only
 
05:10:56.750 --> 05:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
three municipalities in the state have
 
05:10:59.110 --> 05:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
done that um as stated by the the
 
05:11:02.590 --> 05:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
sponsor Berlin lonia and nasua Kia's
 
05:11:04.350 --> 05:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
provision is limited to the were's Beach
 
05:11:07.030 --> 05:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
area Nash's provision is Li is limited
 
05:11:09.548 --> 05:11:09.558 align:start position:0%
to only those licenses that also hold
 
05:11:12.590 --> 05:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
tradable gaming licenses so we don't see
 
05:11:14.990 --> 05:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
this as a significant push throughout
 
05:11:19.030 --> 05:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
the state to move the the hour until
 
05:11:22.430 --> 05:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
2:00 um and like the chief said the
 
05:11:23.948 --> 05:11:23.958 align:start position:0%
there's also a provision that allows
 
05:11:25.788 --> 05:11:25.798 align:start position:0%
lenses if there is a specific event
 
05:11:27.708 --> 05:11:27.718 align:start position:0%
where they wish to extend their hours
 
05:11:29.190 --> 05:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
they can do that through the commission
 
05:11:30.510 --> 05:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
and the commission can grant that
 
05:11:32.868 --> 05:11:32.878 align:start position:0%
exception we actually have a significant
 
05:11:34.830 --> 05:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
amount of lenses that do this during New
 
05:11:37.788 --> 05:11:37.798 align:start position:0%
Year's Eve they request to to extend
 
05:11:40.070 --> 05:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
their hours of service for that that day
 
05:11:41.670 --> 05:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
or for a particular event so that
 
05:11:43.590 --> 05:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
provision is Al also already in the
 
05:11:48.670 --> 05:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:51.868 --> 05:11:51.878 align:start position:0%
that as I mentioned earlier I think also
 
05:11:55.470 --> 05:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
that um and I know Beth was here earlier
 
05:11:58.510 --> 05:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
uh the chiefs of police uh specifically
 
05:12:00.310 --> 05:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
the one of the largest jurisdictions
 
05:12:03.030 --> 05:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
being the Queen City Manchester
 
05:12:05.470 --> 05:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
um the chief would actually be here
 
05:12:07.310 --> 05:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
saying stating the same thing that we
 
05:12:10.310 --> 05:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
are it's just it puts a burden on
 
05:12:13.788 --> 05:12:13.798 align:start position:0%
resources that um would actually have to
 
05:12:15.990 --> 05:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
be relayed to the
 
05:12:19.190 --> 05:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayer it's more people more people on
 
05:12:21.030 --> 05:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
the street more police officers on the
 
05:12:23.788 --> 05:12:23.798 align:start position:0%
street more enforcement investigators to
 
05:12:26.868 --> 05:12:26.878 align:start position:0%
actually make sure that our mission
 
05:12:30.030 --> 05:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
keeping this industry and the community
 
05:12:33.310 --> 05:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
safe um is is adhered
 
05:12:38.470 --> 05:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:42.030 --> 05:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
questions do you um
 
05:12:44.708 --> 05:12:44.718 align:start position:0%
knowing in each Community where which
 
05:12:47.590 --> 05:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
establishment is going to take advantage
 
05:12:51.548 --> 05:12:51.558 align:start position:0%
of this do you then stick around all the
 
05:12:54.548 --> 05:12:54.558 align:start position:0%
time to that closing hour and we do
 
05:12:56.310 --> 05:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
after hours checks to make sure that
 
05:12:58.510 --> 05:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
they're closed so maybe maybe there
 
05:13:01.150 --> 05:13:01.160 align:start position:0%
should be an added fee maybe we should
 
05:13:04.190 --> 05:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
you know have a license to stay open
 
05:13:07.948 --> 05:13:07.958 align:start position:0%
later and uh to to offset our state cost
 
05:13:10.350 --> 05:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
to have enforcement
 
05:13:15.708 --> 05:13:15.718 align:start position:0%
there um that as as always uh we remain
 
05:13:18.390 --> 05:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
neutral on these suggestions uh that are
 
05:13:21.788 --> 05:13:21.798 align:start position:0%
brought up by this committee um but uh
 
05:13:24.070 --> 05:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
one thing I did want to mention is in
 
05:13:26.548 --> 05:13:26.558 align:start position:0%
that in that jurisdictional area the
 
05:13:30.470 --> 05:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
county let's say of Hillsboro we have
 
05:13:32.750 --> 05:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
330 I'm sorry sorry
 
05:13:37.390 --> 05:13:37.400 align:start position:0%
530 lenses in that county through those
 
05:13:40.910 --> 05:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions um I couldn't tell you
 
05:13:44.270 --> 05:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
what the number of uh not only
 
05:13:47.030 --> 05:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
traditional law enforcement but uh
 
05:13:49.910 --> 05:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
liquor investigators there would be to
 
05:13:53.830 --> 05:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
actually um have oversight of of this uh
 
05:13:58.230 --> 05:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
because know that when people are are
 
05:14:00.628 --> 05:14:00.638 align:start position:0%
letting out of these establishments they
 
05:14:03.150 --> 05:14:03.160 align:start position:0%
find other EST establishments to go to
 
05:14:05.628 --> 05:14:05.638 align:start position:0%
like breakfast
 
05:14:08.150 --> 05:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
establishments and and places that don't
 
05:14:12.948 --> 05:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
sell alcohol so this um this extension
 
05:14:16.030 --> 05:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
of hours will now go into the Wii
 
05:14:19.390 --> 05:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
morning uh the Wii uh hours of the
 
05:14:23.510 --> 05:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
morning uh we're we're looking at if if
 
05:14:27.070 --> 05:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
it's 3 o' with drinks off the table at
 
05:14:30.708 --> 05:14:30.718 align:start position:0%
3:30 we're looking at 4:30 possibly 5:00
 
05:14:33.590 --> 05:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
and now we're 24-hour coverage so we're
 
05:14:36.270 --> 05:14:36.280 align:start position:0%
coming here for more manpower and going
 
05:14:38.548 --> 05:14:38.558 align:start position:0%
to fiscal it's
 
05:14:43.390 --> 05:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
it's it I like the the idea uh for
 
05:14:47.948 --> 05:14:47.958 align:start position:0%
Commerce but the negative outweighs the
 
05:14:51.868 --> 05:14:51.878 align:start position:0%
positive in our view in our
 
05:14:51.878 --> 05:14:54.708 align:start position:0%
positive in our view in our
view

05:14:54.708 --> 05:14:54.718 align:start position:0%
view
 
05:14:57.590 --> 05:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
okay you guys one more point one more
 
05:15:00.470 --> 05:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
Point um as we run into now with the
 
05:15:03.150 --> 05:15:03.160 align:start position:0%
current lot as as it is we would ask if
 
05:15:05.430 --> 05:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
this does move forward that there is a
 
05:15:07.110 --> 05:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
requirement for the local jurisdiction
 
05:15:09.150 --> 05:15:09.160 align:start position:0%
to notify us that they have extended the
 
05:15:11.190 --> 05:15:11.200 align:start position:0%
hours um that hasn't been the case in
 
05:15:13.190 --> 05:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
the past so we usually find out through
 
05:15:15.910 --> 05:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
the newspaper or or walking into the
 
05:15:18.590 --> 05:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
establishment so say If This Were to
 
05:15:21.230 --> 05:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
move forward we would request a at least
 
05:15:22.788 --> 05:15:22.798 align:start position:0%
a notification to us so we were aware
 
05:15:25.030 --> 05:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
that that municipality has extended
 
05:15:25.040 --> 05:15:25.948 align:start position:0%
that that municipality has extended
their

05:15:25.948 --> 05:15:25.958 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:15:28.110 --> 05:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
hours okay yep we do have another
 
05:15:30.670 --> 05:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
question represen just quick question uh
 
05:15:33.390 --> 05:15:33.400 align:start position:0%
so the current statute as as it stands
 
05:15:35.350 --> 05:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
it says the license he may sell until 2
 
05:15:38.868 --> 05:15:38.878 align:start position:0%
a.m. under conditions authorized by the
 
05:15:40.510 --> 05:15:40.520 align:start position:0%
legisl by I think I just answer my own
 
05:15:43.750 --> 05:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
question so the legislative body locally
 
05:15:45.510 --> 05:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
can put conditions you mentioned where's
 
05:15:50.310 --> 05:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
beach only or cor uh betting casinos uh
 
05:15:52.030 --> 05:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
in Nashville only correct that would be
 
05:15:57.390 --> 05:15:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:01.948 --> 05:16:01.958 align:start position:0%
you okay we're all set thank you uh
 
05:16:01.958 --> 05:16:03.470 align:start position:0%
you okay we're all set thank you uh

them right now I just want to I saw the
 
05:16:35.150 --> 05:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
the bill and the the importance of the
 
05:16:36.948 --> 05:16:36.958 align:start position:0%
bill and I just felt like a little bit
 
05:16:38.868 --> 05:16:38.878 align:start position:0%
of my work experience might be able to
 
05:16:40.628 --> 05:16:40.638 align:start position:0%
uh might be give a good uh I can give
 
05:16:43.070 --> 05:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
you good feedback uh I work for 18 years
 
05:16:44.510 --> 05:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
in the hospitality industry in the food
 
05:16:46.708 --> 05:16:46.718 align:start position:0%
and beverage uh I was a director uh
 
05:16:49.030 --> 05:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
Director of Events C banquet captain at
 
05:16:51.270 --> 05:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
the omnimon Washington hotel up in Bon
 
05:16:53.750 --> 05:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
Woods uh also at the mountain bu Grand
 
05:16:55.070 --> 05:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
in Whitefield New Hampshire doing
 
05:16:58.628 --> 05:16:58.638 align:start position:0%
Banquets events for about 18 years 18 19
 
05:17:01.830 --> 05:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
years almost so all I want to say is uh
 
05:17:04.110 --> 05:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
I discussed this bill with a few of my
 
05:17:05.830 --> 05:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
current uh friends that are still
 
05:17:07.590 --> 05:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
working in the business and what they
 
05:17:09.430 --> 05:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
asked me to to to kind of present to you
 
05:17:11.788 --> 05:17:11.798 align:start position:0%
is like the a few of them especially in
 
05:17:13.788 --> 05:17:13.798 align:start position:0%
the management world that they really
 
05:17:16.470 --> 05:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
agree with the the concept of this bill
 
05:17:17.628 --> 05:17:17.638 align:start position:0%
because they want to make sure that they
 
05:17:20.670 --> 05:17:20.680 align:start position:0%
increase the sales now with that said
 
05:17:23.270 --> 05:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh there's a lot of ongoing
 
05:17:25.350 --> 05:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
already training going on in this in
 
05:17:27.510 --> 05:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
these premises uh I was team trained
 
05:17:30.390 --> 05:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
certified for I think 12 years to be
 
05:17:32.670 --> 05:17:32.680 align:start position:0%
able to provide the best the best uh you
 
05:17:34.788 --> 05:17:34.798 align:start position:0%
know um management of the alcohol sales
 
05:17:37.708 --> 05:17:37.718 align:start position:0%
to to our patrons uh another another
 
05:17:39.190 --> 05:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
common occurrence that happened to us
 
05:17:41.670 --> 05:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
while working at the hotel uh especially
 
05:17:45.150 --> 05:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
doing weddings uh when because we end so
 
05:17:48.230 --> 05:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
early many of our uh the clients the
 
05:17:50.510 --> 05:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
guests will go somewhere else to find
 
05:17:52.830 --> 05:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
alcohol so what this bill maybe
 
05:17:55.150 --> 05:17:55.160 align:start position:0%
implicitly try to help us is to be able
 
05:17:57.750 --> 05:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
to uh keep all those folks in one place
 
05:17:59.910 --> 05:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to monitor it better uh we
 
05:18:01.628 --> 05:18:01.638 align:start position:0%
have a lot of instances where they go
 
05:18:04.150 --> 05:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
off site they go drinking on their own
 
05:18:06.150 --> 05:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
and that's when uh a lot of the those
 
05:18:08.030 --> 05:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
issues with the uh local law enforcement
 
05:18:10.470 --> 05:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
happen uh uh it happened to me many
 
05:18:12.070 --> 05:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
times in different in both of those
 
05:18:15.190 --> 05:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
properties and uh it is it is really
 
05:18:16.390 --> 05:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
important that we also take in
 
05:18:18.948 --> 05:18:18.958 align:start position:0%
consideration that these places uh put a
 
05:18:21.310 --> 05:18:21.320 align:start position:0%
lot of effort into training uh I'm just
 
05:18:22.788 --> 05:18:22.798 align:start position:0%
speaking for those two properties I'm
 
05:18:24.190 --> 05:18:24.200 align:start position:0%
pretty sure that happens all around the
 
05:18:27.030 --> 05:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
state but um they they would like to to
 
05:18:28.750 --> 05:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to you guys consider this
 
05:18:30.708 --> 05:18:30.718 align:start position:0%
bill for uh to be able to keep more
 
05:18:32.230 --> 05:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
businesses to keep business in New
 
05:18:33.750 --> 05:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because a lot of those uh
 
05:18:35.510 --> 05:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
guests uh that come out of the state
 
05:18:37.310 --> 05:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
they look at our legal laws and says hey
 
05:18:39.430 --> 05:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
you guys are closing too early uh we're
 
05:18:41.350 --> 05:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
not going to come here uh it happen many
 
05:18:43.590 --> 05:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
times too so I just want to kind of uh
 
05:18:45.350 --> 05:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
see if you have any questions I know the
 
05:18:46.910 --> 05:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
percentage bu you ask about if you know
 
05:18:49.070 --> 05:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
if you talk to our bartender I have
 
05:18:51.788 --> 05:18:51.798 align:start position:0%
myself and and a few of them are in
 
05:18:53.750 --> 05:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
support of this bill because you will
 
05:18:55.310 --> 05:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
increase their you know the amount of
 
05:18:57.110 --> 05:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
money that they bring home because they
 
05:18:58.510 --> 05:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
want to make money you know serving
 
05:19:00.868 --> 05:19:00.878 align:start position:0%
alcohol is is definitely how they do it
 
05:19:02.430 --> 05:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
but the time they want to do it in a
 
05:19:04.390 --> 05:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
responsible way they'll be able to put
 
05:19:06.390 --> 05:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh our our guests the clients the peders
 
05:19:09.150 --> 05:19:09.160 align:start position:0%
are safe while also bring some money to
 
05:19:11.350 --> 05:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
to their home so I just want to kind of
 
05:19:12.628 --> 05:19:12.638 align:start position:0%
uh if you have any questions I'll be
 
05:19:14.708 --> 05:19:14.718 align:start position:0%
more than happy to hopefully uh some of
 
05:19:16.670 --> 05:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
the experience I have in that field uh
 
05:19:20.230 --> 05:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
might be able to representative buroughs
 
05:19:21.990 --> 05:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question um you
 
05:19:23.948 --> 05:19:23.958 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you know you had you
 
05:19:25.670 --> 05:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
worked in Whitefield and yes spret and
 
05:19:27.910 --> 05:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
woods and patrons may go somewhere else
 
05:19:29.990 --> 05:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
I I just looked there are no bars in
 
05:19:32.788 --> 05:19:32.798 align:start position:0%
Whitefield that are open after 8:00 p.m.
 
05:19:34.590 --> 05:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
and um I don't know of any bars in
 
05:19:36.708 --> 05:19:36.718 align:start position:0%
Breton Woods that might be open after 1:
 
05:19:39.548 --> 05:19:39.558 align:start position:0%
p.m. I mean there's just nowhere to
 
05:19:41.750 --> 05:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
go my apologies there there are bars
 
05:19:43.990 --> 05:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
opening Whitefield later than that uh uh
 
05:19:46.430 --> 05:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
we have a view in the common area of
 
05:19:48.190 --> 05:19:48.200 align:start position:0%
Whitefield uh they just they just brand
 
05:19:49.548 --> 05:19:49.558 align:start position:0%
new you might not have it on your list
 
05:19:51.708 --> 05:19:51.718 align:start position:0%
but there's some in there uh a bon Woods
 
05:19:53.150 --> 05:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
what happens is many of those guests
 
05:19:54.910 --> 05:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
they come they know they're staying for
 
05:19:56.670 --> 05:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
a couple days so they bring their own
 
05:19:58.910 --> 05:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
alcohol with them and they they do they
 
05:20:00.990 --> 05:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
go to the rooms right and they just you
 
05:20:03.150 --> 05:20:03.160 align:start position:0%
know they they just stay there longer
 
05:20:05.430 --> 05:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
than expected and and but it's hard for
 
05:20:07.390 --> 05:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
for uh us employees to monitor what's
 
05:20:08.910 --> 05:20:08.920 align:start position:0%
happening in those rooms you know it's
 
05:20:10.510 --> 05:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
not really we're not going to knock on
 
05:20:11.990 --> 05:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
the doors every single time say what are
 
05:20:14.150 --> 05:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
you drinking or you know there under AG
 
05:20:15.708 --> 05:20:15.718 align:start position:0%
people drinking on those rooms that's
 
05:20:17.868 --> 05:20:17.878 align:start position:0%
something really that uh is extremely
 
05:20:19.708 --> 05:20:19.718 align:start position:0%
hard for us but we you know by doing it
 
05:20:21.430 --> 05:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
maybe by passing this bill and extending
 
05:20:23.390 --> 05:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
the hours of service might be able to
 
05:20:25.430 --> 05:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
contain him in uh in the banquet venue
 
05:20:26.788 --> 05:20:26.798 align:start position:0%
we may be able to have you know the BART
 
05:20:28.788 --> 05:20:28.798 align:start position:0%
chanders the barbs and everybody else is
 
05:20:30.030 --> 05:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
working including the captain and
 
05:20:32.150 --> 05:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
management to be able to watch them uh
 
05:20:34.548 --> 05:20:34.558 align:start position:0%
more closely and keep an eye on them
 
05:20:38.030 --> 05:20:38.040 align:start position:0%

05:20:53.390 --> 05:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
yeah we all been in the Cave the Cave uh
 
05:20:56.548 --> 05:20:56.558 align:start position:0%
and then uh 12 30 last call 1:00 drinks
 
05:20:59.110 --> 05:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
of the bar uh and that was still fairly
 
05:21:01.270 --> 05:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
early so they could take advantage the
 
05:21:03.708 --> 05:21:03.718 align:start position:0%
current law and extend it but they
 
05:21:06.430 --> 05:21:06.440 align:start position:0%
they've never gone to the town and and
 
05:21:08.310 --> 05:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
Brent Woods and ask him to get that
 
05:21:10.670 --> 05:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
extra hour I I think that's you know
 
05:21:11.910 --> 05:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
that's kind of like just internal
 
05:21:14.350 --> 05:21:14.360 align:start position:0%
management you know uh it's kind of like
 
05:21:16.830 --> 05:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
a corporation as well you know so they
 
05:21:19.590 --> 05:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
they run things differently a it venture
 
05:21:23.110 --> 05:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
to wonder is maybe you how about the the
 
05:21:26.230 --> 05:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh the Whitefield the uh what it the
 
05:21:28.190 --> 05:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
Grand View right Mountain View
 
05:21:31.350 --> 05:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
gring so what time do they close uh the
 
05:21:33.150 --> 05:21:33.160 align:start position:0%
same same hours for events and I'm just
 
05:21:35.350 --> 05:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
talking about the events the rest there
 
05:21:36.910 --> 05:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
could be a possibility that these people
 
05:21:39.070 --> 05:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
are pretty happy closing when they're
 
05:21:41.390 --> 05:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
closing now and they don't really want
 
05:21:44.110 --> 05:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
that extra time uh I can say for
 
05:21:45.750 --> 05:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
experience that that wasn't the case
 
05:21:48.110 --> 05:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
many times uh they they always want to
 
05:21:50.548 --> 05:21:50.558 align:start position:0%
extend the hours they also wants to uh
 
05:21:52.910 --> 05:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
you know they they feel like because in
 
05:21:54.990 --> 05:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
other states in the around us uh is a
 
05:21:56.788 --> 05:21:56.798 align:start position:0%
little later that they feel that they
 
05:21:59.350 --> 05:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
can do it later uh when when in reality
 
05:22:00.628 --> 05:22:00.638 align:start position:0%
that's not the case in New Hampshire we
 
05:22:03.548 --> 05:22:03.558 align:start position:0%
have to for Force what the laws are uh
 
05:22:04.990 --> 05:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
right but the law says they could stay
 
05:22:08.430 --> 05:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
open till 2:30 right but that's just
 
05:22:10.470 --> 05:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
they haven't chose so I'm just I'm
 
05:22:12.310 --> 05:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
playing Devil's Advocate with you I'm
 
05:22:14.590 --> 05:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
saying is Gee the law already allows
 
05:22:17.030 --> 05:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
them to stay open later why would we
 
05:22:18.590 --> 05:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
need to pass this when they're not even
 
05:22:20.590 --> 05:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
willing to take the hour the law that we
 
05:22:22.910 --> 05:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
already have on the books then maybe
 
05:22:24.750 --> 05:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
maybe they really don't want to stay
 
05:22:26.510 --> 05:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
open later maybe they really don't want
 
05:22:28.670 --> 05:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
to keep their employees around longer
 
05:22:30.670 --> 05:22:30.680 align:start position:0%
maybe they're that that you know that
 
05:22:32.670 --> 05:22:32.680 align:start position:0%
seems seem to me that we did find the
 
05:22:35.548 --> 05:22:35.558 align:start position:0%
right spot given that that's what time
 
05:22:38.190 --> 05:22:38.200 align:start position:0%
they're willing to close at right now I
 
05:22:39.670 --> 05:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
think they'll be I mean I I would love
 
05:22:41.390 --> 05:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
to have uh the team the management team
 
05:22:43.070 --> 05:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
from any of those properties to come in
 
05:22:44.910 --> 05:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
and testify or not to be honest when you
 
05:22:46.948 --> 05:22:46.958 align:start position:0%
see them urge them to send us letters we
 
05:22:49.628 --> 05:22:49.638 align:start position:0%
won't be taking action on this Mill in a
 
05:22:52.030 --> 05:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks so uh you know flood our
 
05:22:54.230 --> 05:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
mailboxes with interet or Internet
 
05:22:56.390 --> 05:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
mailboxes with telling us to convince
 
05:22:57.788 --> 05:22:57.798 align:start position:0%
that that there's a great demand for
 
05:22:59.150 --> 05:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
this you can all visit the North country
 
05:23:00.628 --> 05:23:00.638 align:start position:0%
and stay at those beautiful hotels as
 
05:23:05.310 --> 05:23:05.320 align:start position:0%
well I stay I stay at the nain Inn yes
 
05:23:06.990 --> 05:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm very upset with the Omni because
 
05:23:09.110 --> 05:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
they won't serve me dinner because I'm
 
05:23:12.150 --> 05:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
not staying at the hotel oh wow so I
 
05:23:14.150 --> 05:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
love to be able to stay there but they
 
05:23:16.628 --> 05:23:16.638 align:start position:0%
won't let me stay there for dinner but
 
05:23:18.628 --> 05:23:18.638 align:start position:0%
um I have been to the cave and I would
 
05:23:21.670 --> 05:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
say that those big hotels would be the
 
05:23:24.030 --> 05:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
ones who you would make sense to be open
 
05:23:25.708 --> 05:23:25.718 align:start position:0%
to stay up later and that's why I'm kind
 
05:23:26.910 --> 05:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
of shocked that they haven't taken
 
05:23:29.030 --> 05:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
advantage of the current law I think
 
05:23:31.310 --> 05:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
that's based on every special you know
 
05:23:33.670 --> 05:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
every client is different you know every
 
05:23:35.150 --> 05:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
client decides how long they're going to
 
05:23:36.788 --> 05:23:36.798 align:start position:0%
serve and you know that's just the
 
05:23:39.750 --> 05:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
specifics of each of each client okay
 
05:23:40.990 --> 05:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you chairman
 
05:23:45.510 --> 05:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:47.590 --> 05:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
Mike and I would say you're going to be
 
05:23:49.470 --> 05:23:49.480 align:start position:0%
the last card but Amanda's put her card
 
05:23:51.470 --> 05:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
in so she's going to respond to whatever
 
05:23:51.480 --> 05:23:53.070 align:start position:0%
in so she's going to respond to whatever
you

05:23:53.070 --> 05:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:23:57.270 --> 05:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
say do I dare okay so I was going to
 
05:23:59.510 --> 05:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
hold my remarks until the work session
 
05:24:01.110 --> 05:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
as this committee loves to do work
 
05:24:04.948 --> 05:24:04.958 align:start position:0%
sessions but I guess I'll jump in now um
 
05:24:07.750 --> 05:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
just for P for recognition so my name is
 
05:24:09.350 --> 05:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
Mike Summers I'm the president CEO of
 
05:24:10.670 --> 05:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire lodging and Restaurant
 
05:24:12.430 --> 05:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
Association we have about 1300
 
05:24:14.270 --> 05:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
restaurants hotels and other attractions
 
05:24:17.190 --> 05:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
Etc as members from all over the state
 
05:24:19.590 --> 05:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
um uh my experience in the industry
 
05:24:21.470 --> 05:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
directly was not as long as the previous
 
05:24:22.910 --> 05:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
speaker I was only in the industry about
 
05:24:25.030 --> 05:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
15 years but I worked everything from a
 
05:24:26.948 --> 05:24:26.958 align:start position:0%
dishwasher to the general manager so
 
05:24:28.990 --> 05:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
I've tended bar I've waited tables I've
 
05:24:30.430 --> 05:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
done all of it certainly been there and
 
05:24:34.030 --> 05:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
done that that um normally I would be up
 
05:24:35.788 --> 05:24:35.798 align:start position:0%
here testifying in wholehearted support
 
05:24:37.310 --> 05:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
for something like this as it's less of
 
05:24:40.030 --> 05:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
a restriction on businesses but um after
 
05:24:42.150 --> 05:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
speaking with our board and our uh
 
05:24:44.070 --> 05:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
membership we did kind of a straw poll
 
05:24:46.270 --> 05:24:46.280 align:start position:0%
survey uh last week and not knowing
 
05:24:49.070 --> 05:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
where everyone would be um we kind of
 
05:24:50.788 --> 05:24:50.798 align:start position:0%
came out with somewhat of an unofficial
 
05:24:52.270 --> 05:24:52.280 align:start position:0%
position we won't adopt it till next
 
05:24:54.110 --> 05:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
week but uh at this point it looks like
 
05:24:56.628 --> 05:24:56.638 align:start position:0%
we're about 60 to 40 opposed to this
 
05:24:59.430 --> 05:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
bill um I suspect and again looking at
 
05:25:01.670 --> 05:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
the the businesses that respond fed um
 
05:25:03.390 --> 05:25:03.400 align:start position:0%
the late night drinking places where
 
05:25:05.470 --> 05:25:05.480 align:start position:0%
Hospitality employees love to frequent
 
05:25:07.750 --> 05:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh very supportive of this um but then
 
05:25:09.628 --> 05:25:09.638 align:start position:0%
many restaurants hotels and other
 
05:25:11.310 --> 05:25:11.320 align:start position:0%
actually weren't which kind of surprised
 
05:25:12.830 --> 05:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
me a little bit and I think to your
 
05:25:14.310 --> 05:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
comments a moment ago Mr chairman I
 
05:25:15.868 --> 05:25:15.878 align:start position:0%
think a lot of these hotels Clos down
 
05:25:17.310 --> 05:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
because more than anything staffing
 
05:25:19.070 --> 05:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
issues they don't want to stay home with
 
05:25:20.628 --> 05:25:20.638 align:start position:0%
any later because they can't they can't
 
05:25:20.638 --> 05:25:21.708 align:start position:0%
any later because they can't they can't
cover

05:25:21.708 --> 05:25:21.718 align:start position:0%
cover
 
05:25:25.470 --> 05:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
it um I will also uh I do want to Echo
 
05:25:28.190 --> 05:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
the last U person who testified these
 
05:25:29.830 --> 05:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
comments on training I think our
 
05:25:32.310 --> 05:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
industry DS uh uh an an exceptional job
 
05:25:34.788 --> 05:25:34.798 align:start position:0%
in training again it's not 100% but it's
 
05:25:37.270 --> 05:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
a it's it's a pretty high bar uh many of
 
05:25:38.910 --> 05:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
these businesses invest a lot of time
 
05:25:40.430 --> 05:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
effort and resources making sure that
 
05:25:42.708 --> 05:25:42.718 align:start position:0%
their stabs are trained appropriately
 
05:25:44.750 --> 05:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
visible signs of intoxication what
 
05:25:46.390 --> 05:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
constitutes over service those kinds of
 
05:25:47.510 --> 05:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
things so I just want to make sure we
 
05:25:50.030 --> 05:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
put that on the record um but I I think
 
05:25:51.910 --> 05:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
that this is a rather complicated issue
 
05:25:54.628 --> 05:25:54.638 align:start position:0%
for the industry and it really gets down
 
05:25:56.590 --> 05:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
to it's it's not just about it's an
 
05:25:58.590 --> 05:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
extra hour it's more sales because it's
 
05:26:00.628 --> 05:26:00.638 align:start position:0%
much more than that under some of the
 
05:26:02.548 --> 05:26:02.558 align:start position:0%
lies that these businesses carry they're
 
05:26:04.270 --> 05:26:04.280 align:start position:0%
required to have food available while
 
05:26:06.430 --> 05:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
these alcohols are being served so then
 
05:26:08.390 --> 05:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
that's not just a couple of bartenders
 
05:26:09.910 --> 05:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
it's you got to have at least one person
 
05:26:11.310 --> 05:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
in the kitchen that person has to be
 
05:26:12.948 --> 05:26:12.958 align:start position:0%
Serv safe trained because of the person
 
05:26:14.830 --> 05:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
in charge rule under the food safety
 
05:26:17.750 --> 05:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
rules you have to have the the the
 
05:26:18.910 --> 05:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
equipment turned on you have to have the
 
05:26:20.708 --> 05:26:20.718 align:start position:0%
hood system running so this it becomes
 
05:26:22.230 --> 05:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
ancillary costs that are attached to
 
05:26:24.310 --> 05:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
that and one of the ancillary costs that
 
05:26:26.070 --> 05:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
I think we often forget in these
 
05:26:28.470 --> 05:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
discussions is liability insurance which
 
05:26:30.910 --> 05:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
comes up more often than uh than we care
 
05:26:33.868 --> 05:26:33.878 align:start position:0%
to admit but I think that U right now
 
05:26:35.750 --> 05:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
there is some flexibility in the system
 
05:26:37.830 --> 05:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
where municipalities can already adopt
 
05:26:39.948 --> 05:26:39.958 align:start position:0%
the 2 a.m. I don't know that 3:00 a.m.
 
05:26:42.270 --> 05:26:42.280 align:start position:0%
is is a necessity uh for for New
 
05:26:44.788 --> 05:26:44.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but um certainly open to the
 
05:26:47.510 --> 05:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
discussion when we get to a um to work
 
05:26:49.788 --> 05:26:49.798 align:start position:0%
session um and I think the other one
 
05:26:51.990 --> 05:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's worth noting too in some of these
 
05:26:53.590 --> 05:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
more builtup areas where you might
 
05:26:55.708 --> 05:26:55.718 align:start position:0%
actually find ride shares there becomes
 
05:26:57.548 --> 05:26:57.558 align:start position:0%
a staff safety issue about you know
 
05:26:59.390 --> 05:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
folks walking out of a bar with a pocket
 
05:27:02.070 --> 05:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
full of cash at you know 2 3 4:00 in the
 
05:27:04.030 --> 05:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
morning so um that certainly was
 
05:27:05.910 --> 05:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned but I will say that in our
 
05:27:07.948 --> 05:27:07.958 align:start position:0%
straw pole survey the number one comment
 
05:27:09.708 --> 05:27:09.718 align:start position:0%
that we got back from all the members
 
05:27:11.868 --> 05:27:11.878 align:start position:0%
Oppo opposed to this was nothing good
 
05:27:14.670 --> 05:27:14.680 align:start position:0%
happens after midnight so I'm sure we've
 
05:27:16.150 --> 05:27:16.160 align:start position:0%
all used that phrase I know I've
 
05:27:18.548 --> 05:27:18.558 align:start position:0%
certainly heard it um and I would also
 
05:27:20.868 --> 05:27:20.878 align:start position:0%
just uh Echo a comment from
 
05:27:22.868 --> 05:27:22.878 align:start position:0%
representative burrow about ride share
 
05:27:24.430 --> 05:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
you know ride share might work in
 
05:27:26.310 --> 05:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester it works in Boston and other
 
05:27:28.030 --> 05:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
major municipalities it doesn't work
 
05:27:30.030 --> 05:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
anywhere outside of those kinds of areas
 
05:27:31.470 --> 05:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
unless you have have a significant rural
 
05:27:33.628 --> 05:27:33.638 align:start position:0%
buildup there really are no ride shares
 
05:27:35.910 --> 05:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
so the later you go I think to uh
 
05:27:38.670 --> 05:27:38.680 align:start position:0%
representative Moo's uh comments earlier
 
05:27:41.150 --> 05:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
I think that you do uh raise the risk
 
05:27:42.990 --> 05:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
and hence the uh increase the liability
 
05:27:46.750 --> 05:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
insurance exposure for these businesses
 
05:27:50.390 --> 05:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
um with that I will stop save it for the
 
05:27:52.430 --> 05:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
next work session and happy to try to
 
05:27:54.788 --> 05:27:54.798 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
05:27:56.868 --> 05:27:56.878 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very
 
05:28:01.350 --> 05:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
much good that's great thank you
 
05:28:14.070 --> 05:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:16.708 --> 05:28:16.718 align:start position:0%
say it's been a minute since I've
 
05:28:19.150 --> 05:28:19.160 align:start position:0%
testified on anything um I just came to
 
05:28:21.830 --> 05:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
watch but thought I'd make a couple of
 
05:28:23.990 --> 05:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
points I'm Amanda Balden uh rep from
 
05:28:28.590 --> 05:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester W five um there's um when it
 
05:28:30.430 --> 05:28:30.440 align:start position:0%
comes to selling more alcohol more food
 
05:28:32.030 --> 05:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
late at night there's more meals or
 
05:28:35.030 --> 05:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
rooms tax coming with that um so it's
 
05:28:37.868 --> 05:28:37.878 align:start position:0%
not like the expense of enforcement just
 
05:28:41.628 --> 05:28:41.638 align:start position:0%
goes up in a vacuum um there's benefit
 
05:28:46.230 --> 05:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
to the additional late night sales also
 
05:28:49.270 --> 05:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
um you know just did a little Google and
 
05:28:52.430 --> 05:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
it looks like um only like less than 10
 
05:28:55.750 --> 05:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
states in the country don't have a 2 am
 
05:28:58.390 --> 05:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
last call the vast majority do Alaska
 
05:29:00.590 --> 05:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
has a 5: a.m. last call I don't know
 
05:29:02.070 --> 05:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
that's because of how little sunlight
 
05:29:04.548 --> 05:29:04.558 align:start position:0%
they get maybe they have like a 6 PM
 
05:29:06.070 --> 05:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
last call at other parts of the year I
 
05:29:10.470 --> 05:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
have no idea but um and interestingly
 
05:29:13.070 --> 05:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
Vermont has a 2 am last call and has
 
05:29:15.110 --> 05:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
fewer drunk driving deaths than New
 
05:29:16.990 --> 05:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I think it's worth noting
 
05:29:19.270 --> 05:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
you know that it is since none of us are
 
05:29:21.750 --> 05:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
data scientists it probably would be
 
05:29:24.470 --> 05:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily difficult to draw any
 
05:29:27.030 --> 05:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
links between any one policy and the
 
05:29:29.750 --> 05:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
other but it certainly seems Pro
 
05:29:33.548 --> 05:29:33.558 align:start position:0%
business and and pro worker and um Pro
 
05:29:35.070 --> 05:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
Commerce that's the name of this
 
05:29:37.708 --> 05:29:37.718 align:start position:0%
committee right to uh pass this
 
05:29:40.310 --> 05:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
legislation so um just I think those
 
05:29:41.470 --> 05:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
were the only points that I thought
 
05:29:43.070 --> 05:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
might be helpful to interject into the
 
05:29:45.948 --> 05:29:45.958 align:start position:0%
conversation is that um Vermont has
 
05:29:47.868 --> 05:29:47.878 align:start position:0%
better hours and fewer drunk driving
 
05:29:51.548 --> 05:29:51.558 align:start position:0%
deaths than we do and um something like
 
05:29:55.750 --> 05:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
30% fewer and uh and that when you sell
 
05:29:57.430 --> 05:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
more booze I assume that's on a per
 
05:29:59.868 --> 05:29:59.878 align:start position:0%
capita basis um because they're much
 
05:30:03.310 --> 05:30:03.320 align:start position:0%
smaller State than we are no it's
 
05:30:05.830 --> 05:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh no I think that's um just the bare
 
05:30:08.670 --> 05:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
numbers yeah okay but it's per capit
 
05:30:10.670 --> 05:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
less yeah I I didn't really feel like
 
05:30:11.990 --> 05:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
getting out a calculator and putting all
 
05:30:15.350 --> 05:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
those zeros in um but uh but you can
 
05:30:17.548 --> 05:30:17.558 align:start position:0%
Google it too um but then the other the
 
05:30:19.990 --> 05:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
other point being um that there is a
 
05:30:23.430 --> 05:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
benefit to um the economy in New
 
05:30:24.788 --> 05:30:24.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when people can engage in
 
05:30:27.548 --> 05:30:27.558 align:start position:0%
Commerce for longer periods of time
 
05:30:30.310 --> 05:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't want a question
 
05:30:32.310 --> 05:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
question we have questions
 
05:30:34.510 --> 05:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
representative M I know it's we're at
 
05:30:35.750 --> 05:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
the end of our day here thank you for
 
05:30:37.190 --> 05:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
coming and testifying if your question
 
05:30:39.628 --> 05:30:39.638 align:start position:0%
is am I going to go to a BS no I'd stay
 
05:30:41.708 --> 05:30:41.718 align:start position:0%
at home oh
 
05:30:43.830 --> 05:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
no I could make a joke on what you just
 
05:30:47.910 --> 05:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
said but I won't um so would you believe
 
05:30:50.670 --> 05:30:50.680 align:start position:0%
uh that this uh legislation could be
 
05:30:54.110 --> 05:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
considered anti-discriminatory uh and
 
05:30:56.548 --> 05:30:56.558 align:start position:0%
the reason is because people have
 
05:30:59.590 --> 05:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
different chronotypes so chronotype is
 
05:31:01.230 --> 05:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
when you're most most alert when your
 
05:31:04.628 --> 05:31:04.638 align:start position:0%
circadium rhythm is most alert and there
 
05:31:06.310 --> 05:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
are night owls we've all heard of night
 
05:31:09.190 --> 05:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
owls and there are morning Larks people
 
05:31:11.230 --> 05:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
who get up early in the morning and
 
05:31:13.150 --> 05:31:13.160 align:start position:0%
there are I think finches are people
 
05:31:16.350 --> 05:31:16.360 align:start position:0%
that are midday active and I think that
 
05:31:17.990 --> 05:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
this Society discriminates against the
 
05:31:20.670 --> 05:31:20.680 align:start position:0%
night ow
 
05:31:23.030 --> 05:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
because representative Ammon I would
 
05:31:24.910 --> 05:31:24.920 align:start position:0%
believe that that's a terrible argument
 
05:31:26.990 --> 05:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
but I also want to know what which one
 
05:31:32.310 --> 05:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:34.788 --> 05:31:34.798 align:start position:0%
tracks there might be a real question
 
05:31:36.470 --> 05:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
05:31:40.110 --> 05:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
migu thank you Mr chairman um it's kind
 
05:31:42.430 --> 05:31:42.440 align:start position:0%
of a clarification so this is something
 
05:31:44.708 --> 05:31:44.718 align:start position:0%
I've been keenly aware of since you know
 
05:31:46.190 --> 05:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
working the streets as a medic picking
 
05:31:47.910 --> 05:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
up enough drunk drivers and things would
 
05:31:50.830 --> 05:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
would you believe that Vermont is the
 
05:31:53.868 --> 05:31:53.878 align:start position:0%
fourth worst in the country for drunk
 
05:31:56.548 --> 05:31:56.558 align:start position:0%
driving deaths no and that's the per cap
 
05:31:58.270 --> 05:31:58.280 align:start position:0%
you mean on a per capita basis it's
 
05:32:01.230 --> 05:32:01.240 align:start position:0%
interesting they the fourth worst is the
 
05:32:05.310 --> 05:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
rankings and um by per capita and um on
 
05:32:07.030 --> 05:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
the bare numbers and I didn't see that
 
05:32:10.190 --> 05:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
all of the above they're also 600 and
 
05:32:12.510 --> 05:32:12.520 align:start position:0%
change, imagine the distance from one
 
05:32:14.310 --> 05:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
bar to another in that state you know
 
05:32:17.990 --> 05:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
could be 2hour drive so yeah it's
 
05:32:18.000 --> 05:32:19.350 align:start position:0%
could be 2hour drive so yeah it's
imagine

05:32:19.350 --> 05:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
05:32:21.590 --> 05:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
that imagine that so they're one of the
 
05:32:23.510 --> 05:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
worst in the country I think if the
 
05:32:25.990 --> 05:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
committee wants to put effort into
 
05:32:28.350 --> 05:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
trying to draw delineations between
 
05:32:30.030 --> 05:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
different sets of Statistics it's worth
 
05:32:31.590 --> 05:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
worth your time but it would take a lot
 
05:32:33.230 --> 05:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
of time because I don't think that it's
 
05:32:35.830 --> 05:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
easy to just draw conclusions based on a
 
05:32:38.110 --> 05:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
limited set of information I think it's
 
05:32:39.510 --> 05:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
really complicated if it wasn't
 
05:32:41.350 --> 05:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
complicated we wouldn't be sitting here
 
05:32:43.350 --> 05:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
someone else would do this someone who
 
05:32:45.190 --> 05:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
gets paid a decent
 
05:32:47.670 --> 05:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
amount not 100 bucks a year maybe they'd
 
05:32:49.548 --> 05:32:49.558 align:start position:0%
be getting like 120k and they'd be
 
05:32:51.670 --> 05:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
really smart and they'd figure it out so
 
05:32:53.230 --> 05:32:53.240 align:start position:0%
well you get the perks like I got you
 
05:32:55.350 --> 05:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
know I think I'm getting 20 bucks in
 
05:32:57.430 --> 05:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
mileage today so
 
05:33:02.830 --> 05:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
so repres CL yes thank you um allowing
 
05:33:06.788 --> 05:33:06.798 align:start position:0%
me to ask a question um so
 
05:33:09.948 --> 05:33:09.958 align:start position:0%
uh is this mandatory for every
 
05:33:12.390 --> 05:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
restaurant that they have to be open
 
05:33:14.270 --> 05:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
till 3 o'clock in the morning or can
 
05:33:16.590 --> 05:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
they make those choices for themselves
 
05:33:19.070 --> 05:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
that's not my read of the uh legislation
 
05:33:21.628 --> 05:33:21.638 align:start position:0%
I'm confident that it is uh up to the
 
05:33:24.030 --> 05:33:24.040 align:start position:0%
individual business there's definitely
 
05:33:26.270 --> 05:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
places I I wish I could visit that
 
05:33:28.948 --> 05:33:28.958 align:start position:0%
aren't open as late as I'd like thank
 
05:33:28.958 --> 05:33:41.110 align:start position:0%
aren't open as late as I'd like thank
you

05:33:41.110 --> 05:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:42.948 --> 05:33:42.958 align:start position:0%
it's uh I would say I have a wide
 
05:33:45.948 --> 05:33:45.958 align:start position:0%
selection of liquor at any time you can
 
05:33:48.708 --> 05:33:48.718 align:start position:0%
have but no some towns do just you
 
05:33:51.510 --> 05:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
know they're the the operators in the
 
05:33:53.390 --> 05:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
town and I think it's the employment
 
05:33:54.990 --> 05:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
problem they just don't you know the
