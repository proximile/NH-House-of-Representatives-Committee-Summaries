belnap 7 Barnstead and New
 
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire today I'm introducing and I've
 
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 align:start position:0%
put on everyone's desk a possible
 
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment for this um it adds two
 
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
additional items to the original bill
 
00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 align:start position:0%
but what's we're trying to do is have
 
00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.670 align:start position:0%
but what's we're trying to do is have
more

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
transparency in our government and the
 
00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:23.270 align:start position:0%
transparency in our government and the
vaccine

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 align:start position:0%
Association which was created via RSA
 
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
126q um
 
00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
is tasked with buying
 
00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:40.439 align:start position:0%
meetings are held via
 
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
zoom and you can go online but once
 
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
those meetings are over the only thing
 
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 align:start position:0%
you have left is the
 
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
minutes um in today's world with modern
 
00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
technology I don't think it's a
 
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
hard thing to ask about about having
 
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
them be online so that the public can
 
00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 align:start position:0%
review the other thing with the vaccine
 
00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 align:start position:0%
Association if you've ever attended a
 
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
meeting is that you can ask questions
 
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
but they will not give answers that is
 
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
stipulated right up
 
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
front they will get back to you but they
 
00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
will get back to the person so the
 
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
question that's asked nobody else knows
 
00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
what the answer or the reply was I think
 
00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
it's important for the public
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
to understand what's going
 
00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 align:start position:0%
on this is crucial in this day and age
 
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 align:start position:0%
with so much
 
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.629 align:start position:0%
with so much
controversy

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
controversy
 
00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
surrounding information regarding
 
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
vaccines whether you're for them or
 
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.710 align:start position:0%
vaccines whether you're for them or
against

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
them we need to let it be
 
00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
transparent so that we can gain the
 
00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
public trust I think having public trust
 
00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 align:start position:0%
and transparency and government is
 
00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
essential so the two other items that
 
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
I've added to this bill was one uh to
 
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
establish a physical location for a
 
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
meeting so people can actually go to the
 
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 align:start position:0%
meeting and not be via Zoom
 
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
um I don't know about other meetings I'm
 
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
on some commissions and we actually have
 
00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
physical locations I think it's
 
00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:22.759 align:start position:0%
important for people to meet in person
 
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
and for the public to be able to
 
00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 align:start position:0%
attend um the other thing is is asking
 
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
for a list of a complete list of all
 
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
vaccines and other pharmaceutical
 
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
products that they purchase to be listed
 
00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
we as a legislature and the public who
 
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
fund these
 
00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
programs have the right to know what
 
00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.990 align:start position:0%
programs have the right to know what
we're

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
buying um and it it's pretty
 
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
straightforward so I will be open for
 
00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 align:start position:0%
questions thank you are there any
 
00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:03.639 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you madam chair so I don't
 
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 align:start position:0%
really know how the anything about the
 
00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire vaccine
 
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
Association uh are they a private
 
00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 align:start position:0%
company thank you for asking that no it
 
00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
was established by the
 
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
legislature thank you follow followup
 
00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639 align:start position:0%
sure thank you again my knowledge is
 
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
limited how how many vaccines do we have
 
00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
maybe like
 
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
from kids require from 0 to 18 do you
 
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
know I mean we talk in 20 I think the
 
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
number is staggering is what I will
 
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 align:start position:0%
leave uh you with that um I know that
 
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
when I started in childhood vaccines
 
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 align:start position:0%
there were like five today it's upwards
 
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
but there are people here that are more
 
00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
qualified that I am that could answer
 
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
number peerson thank you madam
 
00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:01.879 align:start position:0%
chair I'm uh I'm not antiva but I have
 
00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:04.759 align:start position:0%
substantial concerns about some of the
 
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:06.280 align:start position:0%
things that have happened in the last 5
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
years the um the location part of this
 
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.160 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not you said this was
 
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
established by the
 
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
legislature so in the establishment of
 
00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:20.759 align:start position:0%
this if you know do that include like
 
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
mileage for the members does it because
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
the physical location might incur a cost
 
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:27.560 align:start position:0%
I mean just I don't know I don't know
 
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
how that was chartered so what is does
 
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
that legislative Charter
 
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
cover um if you go to 126q colon 3 uh
 
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
that's the membership powers and duties
 
00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
of the vaccine Association I know it was
 
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
established to be a not not for-profit
 
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
volunteer and it lists the duties it
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
does not it lists who and what they can
 
00:07:59.550 --> 00:07:59.560 align:start position:0%
do but it doesn't really say
 
00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
where they must meet or really there's
 
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
not much in there okay so I can't answer
 
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.670 align:start position:0%
not much in there okay so I can't answer
that

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
question okay can I have a followup
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
chair it yeah right if it doesn't say
 
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
who how does one get on this I I um
 
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I may have
 
00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:23.879 align:start position:0%
misspoke so it does establish who is to
 
00:08:27.309 --> 00:08:27.319 align:start position:0%
be appointed okay and I guess it doesn't
 
00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
say where or if they must meet in person
 
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing that in this particular
 
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:34.360 align:start position:0%
one but there's someone uh that may be
 
00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:36.919 align:start position:0%
able to speak to that better than I
 
00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome representative
 
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you for taking my question
 
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
so I understand that uh the the
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
association takes some time to get back
 
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
to people how long on average does it
 
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
take to get back to somebody with a
 
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
question um I am not exactly sure but I
 
00:08:59.230 --> 00:08:59.240 align:start position:0%
believe if they've stated and you know
 
00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
there there are people here that are
 
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
going to speak to that so I don't want
 
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
to Mis you know misrepresent them at
 
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
this time but you will get that answer
 
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
is a representative of the vaccine
 
00:09:12.269 --> 00:09:12.279 align:start position:0%
Association okay thank you long uh
 
00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
according to the vaccine association's
 
00:09:17.069 --> 00:09:17.079 align:start position:0%
handout they don't receive any uh public
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
inaccurate um thank you for the question
 
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh they are not for profit they are the
 
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
ones that recommend and purchase
 
00:09:34.829 --> 00:09:34.839 align:start position:0%
vac DHHS is the one with the money for
 
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
the actual purchasing of the vaccines
 
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
but the vaccine Association I believe is
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
the one that's determines what
 
00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:45.389 align:start position:0%
the one that's determines what
vaccines

00:09:45.389 --> 00:09:45.399 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
followup okay what not represent Argie
 
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
um some of the complaints about this
 
00:09:58.269 --> 00:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
organization are kind of generic issues
 
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
relative to very ious committees and uh
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
things in New
 
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um why did you pick uh choose
 
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
to pick on uh the vaccine Association
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
and not make a generic thing uh
 
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
regarding say uh audio and video video
 
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
recording of all meetings and published
 
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
recordings on the website why not just
 
00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:21.959 align:start position:0%
make it a generic thing uh thank you for
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
that question and I would be open to
 
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
that Amendment
 
00:10:28.829 --> 00:10:28.839 align:start position:0%
um because I think that should be
 
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:31.240 align:start position:0%
applicable across the board for
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
everybody okay especially any um you
 
00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
know subdivision of the political you
 
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.629 align:start position:0%
know subdivision of the political you
know

00:10:38.629 --> 00:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
process however um chairing the special
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
committee on covid there was a lot of
 
00:10:45.629 --> 00:10:45.639 align:start position:0%
things that came to light during our
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
conversations and a lot of things we
 
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
didn't know and so for that reason this
 
00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:54.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
members anyone else I oh represent AR
 
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
you've got oh representative schmidth
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam
 
00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:10.279 align:start position:0%
chair first of all question to the chair
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
is this going to
 
00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:15.639 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I don't know okay so uh
 
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
still up in the air uh now but I'm sure
 
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
if it did representative comra would
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
help thank you um so uh as you know
 
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
vaccines are very controversial subject
 
00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:34.639 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of uh misinformation and
 
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
disinformation out there um and there's
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of denial of all virtually all
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
aspects of vaccination and the vaccines
 
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
themselves um so when you when you
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
require an answer uh
 
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
um I think it's
 
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839 align:start position:0%
a questionable a re requirement since uh
 
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
some for some people an answer ain't an
 
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
answer it's a a lie or so forth so uh is
 
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
that something you've given
 
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
consideration to the fact that it's so
 
00:12:14.829 --> 00:12:14.839 align:start position:0%
contentious well well thank you for that
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
question representative Schmidt so I
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
mean I am trusting that when they give
 
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
an answer it's truthful it's not
 
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
misinformation it is actual information
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
and we have to respect the the people
 
00:12:32.069 --> 00:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
that we put in place to give us the
 
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
truth okay um we also so I don't
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
understand why that would be an issue
 
00:12:42.269 --> 00:12:42.279 align:start position:0%
because I am taking people at their word
 
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
in good faith if they're supplying with
 
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
it with information if there's a
 
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
question if the person has a question of
 
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
the information then they can ask that
 
00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:51.959 align:start position:0%
of of the the
 
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
association but that's up to the person
 
00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:57.519 align:start position:0%
that asked the question I
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
mean we're always going to have
 
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
controversial things where people aren't
 
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
going to not going a lot if we don't
 
00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
like the answer it doesn't mean it's the
 
00:13:06.079 --> 00:13:06.990 align:start position:0%
like the answer it doesn't mean it's the
wrong

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%

salers thank you madam chair uh if we
 
00:13:37.949 --> 00:13:37.959 align:start position:0%
decide to go forward and we uh look at
 
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
your Amendment on line 21 it it it just
 
00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:44.519 align:start position:0%
says it says uh showing the brand name
 
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
of the shot so my question is are all
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
vaccines by
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
shot are they administered in other ways
 
00:13:55.749 --> 00:13:55.759 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that for that uh
 
00:13:59.550 --> 00:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
question and from personal experience
 
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that you know the PO for
 
00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:04.959 align:start position:0%
me personally the polio was not a shot
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
so um I'm going to say no but I could be
 
00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
wrong thank you representative law uh
 
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:16.120 align:start position:0%
are there any other private entities
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
that are subject to these requirements
 
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
you're proposing in New
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you for the question and
 
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
I cannot uh answer that I mean I think
 
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
personally that all subdivisions of the
 
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:34.120 align:start position:0%
political process should be required to
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
have all
 
00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
meetings uh live streamed not only live
 
00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
edit okay but this one here was focusing
 
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
on this particular Association at this
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
time but my personal opinion is that
 
00:14:53.069 --> 00:14:53.079 align:start position:0%
they all should
 
00:14:56.189 --> 00:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
be okay other question representative
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
re earlier it was stated I'm I want to
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that I'm understanding this
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
correctly it was asked representative
 
00:15:06.189 --> 00:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
sellers asked about um how many vaccines
 
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
were required and I want um to
 
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
understand from you when you said many
 
00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:14.519 align:start position:0%
many more than five I think that you
 
00:15:16.829 --> 00:15:16.839 align:start position:0%
referenced what when you say the word
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
required who requires
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
vaccines I thank you representative re I
 
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
think I'm going to let the vaccine
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
Association discuss that but if you go
 
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
on to DHHS there is a childhood
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
vaccination schedule that is required
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
for children to enter
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
Association and you should have a copy

and answer any questions that you may
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
have um I'm also joined today by the uh
 
00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:18.279 align:start position:0%
my attorney Mark McHugh who is from
 
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
Hinkley Allen he serves as the
 
00:16:22.509 --> 00:16:22.519 align:start position:0%
association's um longtime Council and if
 
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
there's specific questions about 91a Etc
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
I think he would be the right person to
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
answer those um just listening to the
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
questions a minute ago it sounds like
 
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
there is definitely some unfamiliarity
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
with the association and I'll just start
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
with it is a not for-profit voluntary
 
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
Corporation formed under RSA 292 and
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
then created by State Statute 126q back
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
in 2002 so more than 20 years ago it was
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
the first model in the country for
 
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
Universal vaccine purchase programs and
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
their 13 other states currently with
 
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
similar programs it's a public and
 
00:16:58.309 --> 00:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
private partnership in the sense that we
 
00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
have 80 commercial health insurance
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%

Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
as well and what it is is a structural
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism it does not make
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
policy we save about 36% projected this
 
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
year in fiscal year 2025 and our total
 
00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:24.839 align:start position:0%
admin costs are less than 1% 84 and
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%

tpas we have an extremely limited role
 
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
in the vaccine purchase program that's
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
managed by the Department of Health and

collects assessment payments from its

members those of the 80 plus insurance
 
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:07.240 align:start position:0%
companies um and it's for children that
 
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
are under the age of 19 with those
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
assessments we remit those funds
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
directly back to the state of New
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh the state of New
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh uses them to defay the cost
 
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
of purchases under their program it also
 
00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
ensures that all healthcare providers
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
that require access to childhood
 
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480 align:start position:0%

00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
uninsured the association does not
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
create any vaccine policy we do not
 
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
receive state funds and we do not impose
 
00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:41.799 align:start position:0%
requirements for any
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
immunizations we are strongly opposed to
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
House Bill 233 to attempt to subject the
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
association the proposed requirements
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
and amendments and Associate
 
00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:53.720 align:start position:0%
administrative costs outlined in 233 is
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
unprecedented such a mandate serves no
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
governmental purpose because the
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
association is not a public entity
 
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
receives no funds from the state has no
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
power to enact or affect vaccine policy
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
and is not subject to RSA
 
00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:09.559 align:start position:0%
91a the association also notes that the
 
00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:12.039 align:start position:0%
requirements imposed by House Bill 233
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
would extend far beyond the recoring
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements of 91a which are
 
00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:19.039 align:start position:0%
currently imposed on public bodies to
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
legislate reporting requirements on a
 
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
private entity is an unfounded
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%
interference with the governance and
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
operations of a nonprofit organization
 
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
it would impede the ability of the
 
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:29.720 align:start position:0%
association performance very limited but
 
00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:31.799 align:start position:0%
important charitable
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
purpose the association has voluntarily
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
adopted uh an expansive public access
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
policy I'll leave a copy that promotes
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
transparency WE Post our meeting notices
 
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
and agendas in advance on our website
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
and includes all the meeting minutes any
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
member of the public can attend any
 
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
meeting via webinar which while not
 
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
required creates convenience for all
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
attendees it's also a step above
 
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
91a attendance has increased since this
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
policy was implemented out of courtesy
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
and transparency the association allows
 
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
any member of the public to make
 
00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
comments at the end of each board or
 
00:20:08.029 --> 00:20:08.039 align:start position:0%
committee meeting the vast majority of
 
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
public comments are related to New
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%

of Duties as the executive director I am
 
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
always available be by phone or email to
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
take questions from the public and this
 
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
is also stated at the beginning of each
 
00:20:26.669 --> 00:20:26.679 align:start position:0%
of our meetings and included in all of
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
our online materials there is no
 
00:20:31.149 --> 00:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
precedent in state government that I am
 
00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
aware of for posting questions and
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
answers from the public on a website
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
it's not required for house or Senate
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
committees for example the association
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
should not become a billboard for policy
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
statements when it has no policy-making
 
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
or policy influencing powers and handles
 
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
no public
 
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:49.400 align:start position:0%
monies finally in addition to an annual
 
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:51.320 align:start position:0%
publicly available Financial audit and
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
an annual report the association has
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
multiple public reporting requirements
 
00:20:58.029 --> 00:20:58.039 align:start position:0%
based upon statute that ensure
 
00:20:59.950 --> 00:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
accountability we report to the
 
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
insurance department the health
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
department the Speaker of the House of
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
Representatives the Senate President and
 
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
the governor we have Representatives on
 
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
our board that are appointed by all of
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
these entities as well as pediatricians
 
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
that're appointed by the Department of
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
Health and insurance payers who actually
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
fund all of this work all the reporting
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
requirements can be found on our public
 
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
website in summary we're opposed to this
 
00:21:27.149 --> 00:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
bill it not only needlessly burdensome
 
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
and unnecessary but HB 233 attempts to
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
impose reporting requirements on a
 
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
private entity which interferes with our
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
performance and our our charitable
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
purpose while increasing administrative
 
00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
costs which is born by the payers the
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
insurance companies thank you for the
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%

that you might have I've also included
 
00:21:50.669 --> 00:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
my email my phone and uh my mobile
 
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:55.480 align:start position:0%
office number thank you representative L
 
00:21:57.549 --> 00:21:57.559 align:start position:0%

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
entity that is subject to these
 
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
requirements and also are you aware of
 
00:22:04.909 --> 00:22:04.919 align:start position:0%
any public entity that's subject to the
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
requirement to answer
 
00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
questions I am not no I'm not no of any
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
Ru making entity is required to publish
 
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:19.480 align:start position:0%
comments and questions from from the
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
public and their their responses but
 
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:28.909 --> 00:22:28.919 align:start position:0%
issue yes represent powered thank you
 
00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
for taking my question sure uh so how
 
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
long on average does it take for you to
 
00:22:35.669 --> 00:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
get back to somebody's question sure we
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
keep a complete log um and we could
 
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
calculate that statistic but every uh
 
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:44.039 align:start position:0%
email that comes in to us um gets logged
 
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh at the at the office and then all the
 
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
comments that we reply back to um I
 
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
would say generally we try to turn
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
things around in just a few days
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes it might take us closer to a
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
week um often times the information
 
00:22:59.269 --> 00:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
being requested is coming from the
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and so we refer
 
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
people back to the health department um
 
00:23:05.549 --> 00:23:05.559 align:start position:0%
because again we're just a financing
 
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
mechanism we make no policy you know
 
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
decisions but um but I can we could
 
00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559 align:start position:0%
calculate statistics if you'd like us to
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
I think pretty easily but um but we do
 
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
log everything and respond what I think
 
00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.870 align:start position:0%
log everything and respond what I think
is

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
adequately timely thank you thank you
 
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
sure other uh representative Pearson
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair you've used the
 
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
word transparency in TR in your
 
00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
testimony so my question revolves around
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
that sure if you have a zoom meeting yes
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
which is seems to be the mechanism to
 
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
which you guys are are operating um
 
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty substantial educational
 
00:23:45.549 --> 00:23:45.559 align:start position:0%
platform right for your organization to
 
00:23:45.559 --> 00:23:47.870 align:start position:0%
platform right for your organization to
disseminate

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
disseminate
 
00:23:51.789 --> 00:23:51.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
Universe are with this piece of
 
00:23:58.029 --> 00:23:58.039 align:start position:0%
legislation and the potential Amendment
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
are you you
 
00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.990 align:start position:0%
are you you
opposed

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
specifically to the part that says the
 
00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
zoom meetings will just simply be
 
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
available to be viewed at a later time
 
00:24:09.789 --> 00:24:09.799 align:start position:0%
we're currently opposed to all aspects
 
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
of the bill primarily due to
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
administrative requirements and again as
 
00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:16.919 align:start position:0%
stated priv previously we have an
 
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
existing public access policy which we
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
believe provides adequate um
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
transparency to the public as well as
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
reporting that's required by the statute
 
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you madam chair
 
00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:35.789 --> 00:24:35.799 align:start position:0%
transparency in understanding the
 
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
universe we live in here right this this
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
what we're doing right now is
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
permanently available on
 
00:24:41.159 --> 00:24:43.470 align:start position:0%
permanently available on
YouTube

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
YouTube
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
um I think do you so you're telling me
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
you don't think that this will further
 
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.549 align:start position:0%
you don't think that this will further
your

00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:54.039 align:start position:0%
mission if you just simply make those
 
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
Zoom meetings which are already being
 
00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.470 align:start position:0%
Zoom meetings which are already being
conducted

00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
conducted
 
00:25:00.909 --> 00:25:00.919 align:start position:0%
available later that that does not
 
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
further trust and transparency to which
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
your organization is
 
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
functioning sure I'll turn this over to
 
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
my attorney just just for the record
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Mark McHugh I'm
 
00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
a partner at the law firm of Hanley
 
00:25:16.269 --> 00:25:16.279 align:start position:0%
Allen representing uh New Hampshire
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association for a number of
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
years um I I think the point is more um
 
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
the way the meetings are conducted in
 
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
the last portion the association has
 
00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
voluntarily um opened up the meeting if
 
00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:31.720 align:start position:0%
there's time to the public for comment
 
00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
um as Pat as Mr Miller has described the
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
role of the vaccine Association is
 
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
incredibly limited most of that public
 
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
commentary goes beyond the scope and
 
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
purpose of the vaccine Association um
 
00:25:46.269 --> 00:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily accurate
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
information it's not necessarily
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
information pertaining to the function
 
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:51.640 align:start position:0%
of the association and it's not
 
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
something that necessarily would make
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
sense for the association to respond to
 
00:25:59.549 --> 00:25:59.559 align:start position:0%
because it's outside its purview so um
 
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
it it really doesn't provide
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
transparency to have that kind of a
 
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
record sitting there that it doesn't
 
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
pertain to the organization's business
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
um the the organization is very
 
00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:13.240 align:start position:0%
mechanical in all of its decisions all
 
00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:16.919 align:start position:0%
of its processes all of its um minutes
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
and actually board materials are all
 
00:26:20.909 --> 00:26:20.919 align:start position:0%
displayed they're part of the permanent
 
00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:23.240 align:start position:0%
record they're available on its website
 
00:26:25.149 --> 00:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
and we think that more than uh answers
 
00:26:29.389 --> 00:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative L who makes the rules
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
about uh what vaccines children are
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
required to get in order to attend
 
00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
school uh or in any other situation
 
00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:43.559 align:start position:0%
where the government may be requiring a
 
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
vaccine to participate in some activity
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
um that's a great question so it it
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
actually starts at the federal level
 
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
with FDA approval and then there's a
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
committee out of the Center for Disease
 
00:26:57.149 --> 00:26:57.159 align:start position:0%
and Control uh called asip that then
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
makes recommendations
 
00:27:01.389 --> 00:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
and then at that point uh the state
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
receives those recommendations and the
 
00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Health and Human
 
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
Services has the ability um to
 
00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
essentially say we want to add this to
 
00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:10.919 align:start position:0%
something that the program will
 
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
basically assess funds for um but
 
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
anything uh is really based upon CDC you
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
know recommendations at the end of the
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
day the association has absolutely
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
that representative Howard thank you I
 
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to call uh kind of follow up on
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh some of the points that
 
00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:31.159 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson was making uh
 
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
would you be supportive of any
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
administrative rules uh on your end to
 
00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
uh make sure that your meetings are
 
00:27:39.909 --> 00:27:39.919 align:start position:0%
uploaded to
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
YouTube would can I guess we'd have to
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
consider it but at the moment we don't
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
think that it's necessary okay thank
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
you um representative reeze thank you
 
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair if if this were to go
 
00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
through um you said your administrated
 
00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
costs currently are less than 1%
 
00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
yes would this increase the cost to
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
would your in would your administrative
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
costs rise yes they would followup
 
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
followup thank you um and who ultimately
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
would bear The increased cost for that
 
00:28:16.669 --> 00:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
increased administrative burden it would
 
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
be the insurance companies that
 
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
basically fund the entire Association
 
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
again there's no governmental funding
 
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:25.240 align:start position:0%
involved here the easiest way to think
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
about it is we're a pass through
 
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
organization so
 
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
by allowing this organization to exist
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies and the state
 
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
are purchasing off of a federal contract
 
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
that's where that 36% savings comes and
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
then it allows the vaccines to be given
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
to 220 provider sites across the state
 
00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
at no cost and they don't have to bill
 
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:49.240 align:start position:0%
for it either so there's no
 
00:28:51.789 --> 00:28:51.799 align:start position:0%
administrative costs so it was purely
 
00:28:55.389 --> 00:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
set up for administrative um efficiency
 
00:28:58.269 --> 00:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
as well as cost savings
 
00:29:01.149 --> 00:29:01.159 align:start position:0%
oh thank you that's all it does so
 
00:29:03.669 --> 00:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
ultimately if those costs were then
 
00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
passed on to the insurance companies
 
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
right who do those the insurance
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
companies pass those costs on be passed
 
00:29:11.909 --> 00:29:11.919 align:start position:0%
on to the employers who purchase the
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
products or consumers thank you yeah
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
represent long you had a question no
 
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you represent broa yes I have
 
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
a question to the
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
chair so in our calendar this is HB 233
 
00:29:31.509 --> 00:29:31.519 align:start position:0%
FN but the bill itself is not an FN and
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
has no fiscal note so if this is going
 
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
to have an increase there should be a
 
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal note with this document even
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
though it's not going to be incurred by
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
the state wouldn't you think um no I
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
don't they it if it's called for a
 
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it should have one but in
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
general if there's a cost to the
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
businesses we don't necessarily count it
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
as a fiscal note for example the
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
building code bills have have no fiscal
 
00:30:04.029 --> 00:30:04.039 align:start position:0%
not followup so why is this an early
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.990 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
um he's not here all right thank you
 
00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
well well I'll take take it on to find
 
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
out why early where the fiscal note is
 
00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:31.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
so find out sir if I may ask sure if I
 
00:30:39.149 --> 00:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly your
 
00:30:39.159 --> 00:30:41.430 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly your
organization

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
merely takes the list of vaccines that
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
HHS wants to purchase M tells the
 
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:49.640 align:start position:0%
insurance companies to Pony up a certain
 
00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:51.559 align:start position:0%
amount of money correct and then make
 
00:30:54.029 --> 00:30:54.039 align:start position:0%
sure those vaccines are bought and
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
distributed exactly but you don't decide
 
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:00.200 align:start position:0%
what vaccine are to be purchased just
 
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:01.720 align:start position:0%
how many just
 
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
who how much each insurer pays based on
 
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:08.120 align:start position:0%
their coverage correct ultimately it's a
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
conversation between the provider and
 
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
the patient or in the case of somebody
 
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
under the age of 19 the parent would be
 
00:31:17.549 --> 00:31:17.559 align:start position:0%
involved and the department of uh Health
 
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
and Human Services manages all of that
 
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
we do not manage any of that so that if
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
say the Department of Health and Human
 
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
Services decided for some reason they
 
00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
thought was good to require to require
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
you to purchase flu vaccines y enough to
 
00:31:39.149 --> 00:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
cover every adult over 65 you would make
 
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
arrangements to do so well our
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
organization is only authorized for
 
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
children under the age of 19 we do not
 
00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:47.720 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with adult
 
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
vaccinations at all it's not part of the
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
statute it's a very limited scope and
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
the insurers are only paying
 
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
proportionally for the covered lives at
 
00:32:00.509 --> 00:32:00.519 align:start position:0%
Arch children so that it's Equitable in
 
00:32:02.909 --> 00:32:02.919 align:start position:0%
case one insurer had more adults or
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
another all right but the the same
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
principle applies that if the HHS
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
decided they wanted every child to get a
 
00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
flu shot you would yes accept that
 
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation and negotiate the price
 
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
for for the flu shot so they could be be
 
00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
free correct not really um so what
 
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
happens from a functional perspective is
 
00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:25.480 align:start position:0%
each summer after the fiscal year has
 
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
closed the state provides to us which is
 
00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
also on our website a list of all the
 
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
vaccines that have been purchased and
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
then a list of what they believe will be
 
00:32:36.629 --> 00:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
purchased in the next fiscal year our
 
00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
job is essentially to take that request
 
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
and say we need to raise $17.2 million
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
to you know as a number and our job is
 
00:32:48.629 --> 00:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
to essentially put the assessment PL
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
mechanism in place to make sure that
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
we're charging on a quarterly basis the
 
00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:54.200 align:start position:0%
insurance companies the right amount to
 
00:32:56.909 --> 00:32:56.919 align:start position:0%
cover that ask so think of it as just we
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
get a bill we have to find money to pay
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
for it and then we pay it that's it
 
00:33:04.669 --> 00:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
that's as simple a transaction as it is
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
we have no uh we can't say we don't want
 
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559 align:start position:0%
to pay for something we can't say we
 
00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
would like you to add something that has
 
00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
it's just outside of our scope it's a
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
very very limited scope as to what our
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
role here is all right but the uh some
 
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
of the questions you're getting I'm sure
 
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
deal with the with policy rather than
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
they do and those we typically do refer
 
00:33:26.669 --> 00:33:26.679 align:start position:0%
people back to the Department of Health
 
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
and Human Services because we're not we
 
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
have no authorization to in statute to
 
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
make policy thank you represent Pearson
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
you had a question yeah I'm uh I'm
 
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
trying to we spent half the hearing
 
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
talking about what you don't do right
 
00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:43.960 align:start position:0%
right so I'm trying to understand what
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
what does a meeting look like for you
 
00:33:47.389 --> 00:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
what what do you talk about it's very
 
00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:49.960 align:start position:0%
transactional as attorney McHugh said we
 
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
have a separate plan of operation that
 
00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
the insurance department approves that's
 
00:33:57.789 --> 00:33:57.799 align:start position:0%
also online um and every single month
 
00:33:59.470 --> 00:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
there's a prescribed list of tasks that
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
we carry out it's extremely
 
00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
transactional most of the time we're
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
reporting on the financials so how are
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
we doing in terms are we collecting
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
enough assessment are we over collecting
 
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
um month-to month um and then the bulk
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
of the work is done in the fall in
 
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
September when the board approves the
 
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
rate for the coming calendar year um and
 
00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:20.919 align:start position:0%
there's a package of materials that we
 
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:23.240 align:start position:0%
put together to walk through here's the
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
request that we got here's what we're
 
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
seeing for uh the number of covered
 
00:34:28.109 --> 00:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
lives and then there's a whole
 
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
calculation and really the board's job
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
is to look at that and say it seems
 
00:34:34.109 --> 00:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
reasonable or not and there's a
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
subcommittee called the audit committee
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
that meets twice over the summer to
 
00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
prepare for that meeting that's
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
essentially it we don't meet every month
 
00:34:44.669 --> 00:34:44.679 align:start position:0%
um and uh we choose an auditor every
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
March that's one other function that we
 
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
have and that's about it I can share the
 
00:34:51.149 --> 00:34:51.159 align:start position:0%
plan of operation electronically if
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
you'd like it I didn't bring a copy of
 
00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
that but it lists out by month exactly
 
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
what happens including all of our
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements ments under the
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
statute so in essence follow up thank
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
you madam chair sorry uh in essence then
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
what you're describing to me sounds like
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
you're just a purchasing agent we're not
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
even that we are an agent that raises
 
00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
funds and the Department of Health and
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
Human Services makes the purchase on
 
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
behalf of all children under the age of
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
19 no matter whether they have insurance
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
or whether they have Medicaid or
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
uninsured we have no purchasing
 
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
Authority we write we write a check once
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
a year in
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
June there's no policy
 
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
involved represent BR just out of
 
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
curiosity from my own curiosity could
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
you send us that schedule so that be
 
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
happy would be sure and um it's also on
 
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
our all of our materials all of our
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
access polic all of our policies we have
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
all of our financial audits back to 2002
 
00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
are also on the website so everything's
 
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
there but I'd be more than happy to
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
email it to the
 
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
committee the operation plan I'll send
 
00:35:55.069 --> 00:35:55.079 align:start position:0%
you the operations manual that would be
 
00:35:56.589 --> 00:35:56.599 align:start position:0%
I'll do that after be grateful thank you
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
so muches sellers thank you madam chair
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
I asked the question earlier is how many
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
vaccines are we talking about from till
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
the age 19 um so that's based upon and
 
00:36:10.309 --> 00:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not a clinician but it's based upon
 
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
a clinical schedule that the CDC
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
recommends for States um I don't know
 
00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
the actual number you'd have to ask the
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
department of health or I could I could
 
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
have them send you the schedule but
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
again I don't make any policy decisions
 
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
so I don't know the exact well we're
 
00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
we're just looking for the number that
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
you're buying for for this you're
 
00:36:33.309 --> 00:36:33.319 align:start position:0%
arranging to buy yeah so there are um
 
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
why don't I send you the list of what
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
was purchased last year I think that
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
would give you and it's in our meeting
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
materials I'll pull that out and send it
 
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
to you as well thank you um this year
 
00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
than you that would be uh informative
 
00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:48.079 align:start position:0%
sure and there are different vaccines
 
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
have different options as well brand
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
choice that type of thing so it and I'm
 
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
happy to provide that thank you would be
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
we' be it would be curious sure anything
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
else represent a Bailey and then
 
00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
Schmidt you mentioned it $ 1.17 million
 
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
is the cost of the vaccines or um so
 
00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
each year the number changes um for the
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
coming year the check that we'll write
 
00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
in June um it's basically a purchase of
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
between 22 and $24
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
million followup followup the part
 
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
that's confusing me is it doesn't seem
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
to be claims it's seems to be like a
 
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
proactive thing and the state is not
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
paying and the FEDS are not paying the
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are paying correct
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
so they're doing this out of the
 
00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
goodness of their hearts or they're
 
00:37:38.829 --> 00:37:38.839 align:start position:0%
doing it for two reasons they hope to
 
00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
reduce claims in the future or um so I
 
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
think there's two reasons for it one is
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
by par by this program allows the
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
insurance companies to tap into the CDC
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
discount and that's where the pricing
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
differential comes from if they are
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
purchasing on the public market versus
 
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
the CDC price so there's clearly a
 
00:37:59.550 --> 00:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
financial benefit for the insurance
 
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
companies the other benefit more from
 
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
the health perspective is that the
 
00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
provider offices don't have to pay for
 
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
the vaccine on their own at a list price
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
build the insurance company at a higher
 
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
price and deal with the whole claims
 
00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
Administration so the insurance
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
companies cut out all the claims
 
00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
Administration which is significant both
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
for the providers and for the insurance
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
companies themselves and it just makes
 
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:26.200 align:start position:0%
for better clinical care because at the
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
end of the day no matter what child
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
walks in if the parent decides that with
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
the clinician this is the vaccine they
 
00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
should get they grab it and that's all
 
00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:37.240 align:start position:0%
they need to do so there's no there's no
 
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
administrative overhead if you will to
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
either the provider or to the payer so
 
00:38:44.349 --> 00:38:44.359 align:start position:0%
those are the main reasons why the
 
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
payers are participating thank you
 
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair so uh having
 
00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:55.880 align:start position:0%
attended a number served on and attended
 
00:38:58.309 --> 00:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
a number of meetings of City councils
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
town councils and so forth I know that
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
it's a common practice that the the
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
boards that I've attended anyway uh get
 
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
questions from the public there's no
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
question about that but as a general
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
rule they don't answer uh and very often
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
it's because they don't have an answer
 
00:39:20.829 --> 00:39:20.839 align:start position:0%
it's not like what's the sum of X and Y
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
there's an answer to that that's
 
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
immediately knowable uh in many cases
 
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
the answer to the question is is not
 
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
known and in some cases even not
 
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
knowable it could be this it could be
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
that and and knowledgeable individuals
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
will argue and debate about whether the
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
answer is X or Y um and so the boards
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
generally don't answer uh and and as I
 
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
say in many cases the answers are are
 
00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:51.640 align:start position:0%
not known and so I'm I'm very concerned
 
00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
workability of the requirement that the
 
00:39:59.829 --> 00:39:59.839 align:start position:0%
answers be posted within 48 hours or
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
whatever the particular time frame is um
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
especially since this is such a
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
contentious uh uh uh issue and also
 
00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
we're talking about medicine here and
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
debating about the efficacy of medicine
 
00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
is you
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
know there still many debates about
 
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
things we've been using for hundreds of
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
years so I I I don't see do you do you
 
00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
consider this to be a workable
 
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:31.640 align:start position:0%
Demand on the part of the
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
statute you wantan yeah I we don't see
 
00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
it as workable and again we're providing
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
the ability for the public to comment
 
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
anybody who's ly online can listen to
 
00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
those comments and most of the questions
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
and comments that we get have nothing to
 
00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
do with the association itself and we
 
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
refer most of them back to the
 
00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
Services if I could if I could just
 
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
clarify or add to um we're not a public
 
00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:57.910 align:start position:0%
clarify or add to um we're not a public
agency

00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
agency
 
00:40:59.710 --> 00:40:59.720 align:start position:0%
we're not a public body we're not a
 
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
quasi public body um we're its creation
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
was mandated by the legislature in RSA
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
126q but it's not like a chartered
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
entity like hospital or a college where
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
the statute is the charter um the we
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
were directed to establish a nonprofit
 
00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:23.240 align:start position:0%
voluntary Corporation under RSA 292 to
 
00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
adopt articles and bylaws which give um
 
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
kind of rule procedural rules so it very
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
much is not um any kind of public entity
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
i' I'm familiar with the local
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
government center firefighters case um
 
00:41:40.829 --> 00:41:40.839 align:start position:0%
in that case that entity um its sole
 
00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
members were political subdivisions were
 
00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
towns from municipalities its board was
 
00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:48.839 align:start position:0%
governed entirely by Municipal officers
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
and if um it didn't provide its pulled
 
00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
Management Programs then the towns would
 
00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
have to do that individually in this
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
case in addition to thinking of us as a
 
00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
a pass through the legislative history
 
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
is helpful when the state years ago was
 
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
deciding whether to participate in the
 
00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
federal vaccine children's vaccine
 
00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
purchase program and make those
 
00:42:10.109 --> 00:42:10.119 align:start position:0%
discounts available it was reluctant to
 
00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
commit fully State funds and it wanted
 
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
some contribution some participation by
 
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
Health insurers and so for the reasons
 
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
that Mr Miller explained the health
 
00:42:21.309 --> 00:42:21.319 align:start position:0%
insurers thought that that made sense
 
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
and so this entity is really their
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
entity to manage their contribution to
 
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
the state purchase of vaccines under
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
that Federal program it doesn't have any
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
again doesn't have any policy um control
 
00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
these are funds from these private
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
entities that are then handed to the
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
state um so it's it's not a public
 
00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
entity they're not public monies we're
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
just not um applying 91a just doesn't
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
make sense to this kind of enti you'd
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
have to apply it to every single RSA 292
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
voluntary Corporation in the state which
 
00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
I I don't I think is not serving any
 
00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
governmental purpose thank you for your
 
00:42:59.870 --> 00:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
response because I think this is very
 
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
helpful representative Leon uh thank you
 
00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair I apologize for my
 
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
tardiness we had a flat tire but I was
 
00:43:08.349 --> 00:43:08.359 align:start position:0%
watching this by YouTube and I'm very
 
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
thankful I can ask you a question um it
 
00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:12.599 align:start position:0%
sounds like you said a lot of the cost
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
and reimbursement to make sure that the
 
00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are paying what's
 
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
necessary sorry the the insurance
 
00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
companies are paying what's necessary
 
00:43:21.309 --> 00:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
and the providers are able to have these
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
at no cost do you set the policy around
 
00:43:26.829 --> 00:43:26.839 align:start position:0%
what providers are charged for unused
 
00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
vac Vines um when they have say 10
 
00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
children in their practice and one does
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
not decides to opt out either from a
 
00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
religious or other exemption what is the
 
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
charge assessed upon that provider if
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
they have a covered life that does not
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
use the vaccine so the the charges
 
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
aren't assessed to the provider the the
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
revenue that we receive comes from the
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
insurance companies not from the
 
00:43:54.589 --> 00:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
providers so um there's a true up if you
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
will that the department does during the
 
00:43:59.710 --> 00:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
year so each month um what what actually
 
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
was used what was returned there's a
 
00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
whole process that the Department of
 
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
Health goes through so that by the time
 
00:44:07.589 --> 00:44:07.599 align:start position:0%
we get to June and we're asked to write
 
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
the check back to the department to fund
 
00:44:12.549 --> 00:44:12.559 align:start position:0%
vaccines for the next year um they've
 
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
been able to account for you know if
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
they potentially had more in stock or
 
00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
less in stock they they they trew all
 
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
that up but there's no there's no
 
00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
assessment to the provider from the
 
00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
association I don't I can't speak to the
 
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
department but none that I'm aware of
 
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
well follow uh so I have been told that
 
00:44:32.829 --> 00:44:32.839 align:start position:0%
if a provider doesn't use one of the
 
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
doses they have to pay to replace that
 
00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:37.839 align:start position:0%
dose if it goes unexpired not at the
 
00:44:39.549 --> 00:44:39.559 align:start position:0%
purchased contracted price but at the
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
list price from the manufacturer is that
 
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
part of your um is that anything to do
 
00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:47.720 align:start position:0%
with what you do in your process it does
 
00:44:49.829 --> 00:44:49.839 align:start position:0%
not um I believe what you're referring
 
00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
to is the CDC sets wastage rates for um
 
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
uh states that participate in this
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
program and there if the provider
 
00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
exceeds those or wastage was caused
 
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
either intentionally or something
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
happened their responsible at the
 
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
provider level but that's a CDC that's a
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
federal state piece the association has
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't do
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
anything regarding that at all it
 
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't impact what we do one last
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
followup follow and the my sorry my last
 
00:45:20.589 --> 00:45:20.599 align:start position:0%
followup is basically you are
 
00:45:22.829 --> 00:45:22.839 align:start position:0%
implementing what the CDC has sent to
 
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
the state under the expectation that
 
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
that's the policy set by the Department
 
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services is that a
 
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
correct understanding say that one more
 
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
time that you're implementing the
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
directives from the CDC for
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
participation in this program for
 
00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines um subject to your
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
understanding that the Department of
 
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services has set the
 
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
policy choices is that correct yes so
 
00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
the the Department of Health um as I
 
00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:47.720 align:start position:0%
explained earlier the FDA approves
 
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
vaccines the CDC has an advisory
 
00:45:52.829 --> 00:45:52.839 align:start position:0%
committee that recommends vaccines to a
 
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
schedule the state then can determine
 
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
through the Commissioner's Office of
 
00:45:59.069 --> 00:45:59.079 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services whether or not
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
to add that vaccine to the schedule so
 
00:46:04.589 --> 00:46:04.599 align:start position:0%
ultimately the state determines what
 
00:46:07.069 --> 00:46:07.079 align:start position:0%
will be on the schedule and won't be and
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
then we are asked to remit funding for
 
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
whatever that schedule looks like at the
 
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
end of the day does that help it does
 
00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:18.440 align:start position:0%
thank you sure representative sers thank
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and you're going to
 
00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
provide that list like you said of
 
00:46:26.549 --> 00:46:26.559 align:start position:0%
vaccines so my my question on that is um
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
can you you also identify which ones the
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
HHS purchases because you sell it to
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
other doctors and places do you sell
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
only the HHS yeah we don't sell anything
 
00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
first of all so um just to back up so
 
00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
the state has what they call a universal
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
purchasing program for vaccines where
 
00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
they take Federal monies for uninsured
 
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
and Medicaid and they combine them with
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
private monies that this group The
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
Association provides the state
 
00:46:58.349 --> 00:46:58.359 align:start position:0%
determines Year from an estimate
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
perspective what they think the provider
 
00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
offices are going to use they then ask
 
00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:05.800 align:start position:0%
us to fund a proportion of that it's
 
00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:06.630 align:start position:0%
us to fund a proportion of that it's
about

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
60% and then um they manage signing up
 
00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
providers that participate in the
 
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
program the provider ordering system all
 
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
of that is managed by the state um so at
 
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
the end of the day there's no
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
transaction excuse me between the
 
00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:24.200 align:start position:0%
association and any provider office if
 
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
you will um it's all done with just one
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
check we write at the end of the year to
 
00:47:31.069 --> 00:47:31.079 align:start position:0%
the state itself and then they they use
 
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
those funds to purchase the vaccine so
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
the providers can order what they need
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
help follow up yeah thank you I I was
 
00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:45.640 align:start position:0%
just trying to get an idea of
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
um if there's if there's 20 vaccines
 
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
does HHS
 
00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
require 18 of them and other doctors are
 
00:47:58.750 --> 00:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
you know maybe the other two yeah I'd
 
00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
have to I think you should ask that
 
00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
question of ghhs directly because that's
 
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
a policy question that we're not charged
 
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
with our scope is literally to raise
 
00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
funds and write a check at the end of
 
00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
the year so um but I'm sure we could
 
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
connect you to the office of
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
immunization um to take that question
 
00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.230 align:start position:0%
immunization um to take that question
back

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:19.240 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
Y and the and ultimately I mean there
 
00:48:24.069 --> 00:48:24.079 align:start position:0%
are exemptions and there's other and
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's up to parental choice at the end of
 
00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:27.640 align:start position:0%
the day so
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
as I understand it okay thank you other
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
representative schi thank you madam
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
chair one other aspect has come to mind
 
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:37.640 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
that I think most vaccines have a best
 
00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
used by date and so forth a spoilage
 
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
date and I know covid some of the covid
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
vaccines for example uh had to be used
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
once they were open they had to be used
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
within a certain amount of time or they
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
couldn't be used legally
 
00:49:00.309 --> 00:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
um so does that factor into some degree
 
00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
or is
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
thatly internal to the to the entity
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's going to administer the vaccine
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
um so as part of um the vaccine for
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
children program which is a federal
 
00:49:13.549 --> 00:49:13.559 align:start position:0%
program that New Hampshire participates
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
in there is a c there's a provider
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
contract that the individual clinician
 
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
physician physician assistant Etc who's
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
receiving the vaccines has to sign and
 
00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
part of that um is basically stating how
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
they will manage the inventory so
 
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
there's no loss that things are return
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
before they expire Etc and the
 
00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:35.839 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:49:38.109 --> 00:49:38.119 align:start position:0%
immunization group manages that whole
 
00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
process so they they do on-site visits
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
of the providers every year they sign
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
the providers up and they manage the
 
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
ordering process with them okay thank
 
00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
you yep all
 
00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
DHHS all right other questions thank you
 
00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
very much Mr Miller okay and I will um I
 
00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the public access policy
 
00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
if I could leave that with you now and
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
then I will email the committee the

year that's thank you very much thank
 
00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you chairwoman McGuire
 
00:50:23.109 --> 00:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
pars and colleagues on the house
 
00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
executive departments and administration
 
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the my name is
 
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
representative Jonah oion wheeler I
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
represent the towns of Peter bro and
 
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
Sharon I'm here today generally in
 
00:50:36.789 --> 00:50:36.799 align:start position:0%
support of the idea that we would film
 
00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:39.880 align:start position:0%
the audio and video of this board and I
 
00:50:41.309 --> 00:50:41.319 align:start position:0%
don't have much else to say other than
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
that there are other people who can
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
testify more in support but the idea
 
00:50:48.109 --> 00:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
that people can join the meeting via
 
00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
Zoom read the minutes online access all
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
these different ways that the prior test
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
to fire said that they could access
 
00:50:59.950 --> 00:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
through but in the 21st century we
 
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't film the audio and video is
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
just a little silly to me uh people when
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
it was proposed by uh representative
 
00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
Kirk uh not so long ago some of you may
 
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
remember when we started filming these
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
meetings people said it was unnecessary
 
00:51:23.109 --> 00:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
these meetings um and I think that you
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
know governmental and non-governmental
 
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
boards will say that constantly like no
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
one likes to be filmed but if you're
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
handling even private money that helps
 
00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
DHS purchase these products I think it's
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh important that we film and allow the
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
public to look at these records that's
 
00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:43.559 align:start position:0%
what I'm here in supportive I can't
 
00:51:45.549 --> 00:51:45.559 align:start position:0%
speak to the amendment I can't speak to
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
the question and answer period
 
00:51:48.349 --> 00:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt I think you
 
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
brought up good questions those should
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
be answered I think that might be a
 
00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
little bit too onerous a requirement of
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
the board but I'm here
 
00:51:59.470 --> 00:51:59.480 align:start position:0%
in support of Simply audio and video
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
recording of of the board itself and I
 
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
forget who asked it but I was watching
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative dargy I believe that you
 
00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:08.720 align:start position:0%
did around well why don't we just expand
 
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
this to all boards that piece of
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
legislation is a lot bigger than than
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
this one piece of legislation
 
00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
representative ktoa happened to bring
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
forward the legislation in regards to
 
00:52:20.109 --> 00:52:20.119 align:start position:0%
this one board I would absolutely
 
00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
support legislation to have every board
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
chartered by the state to be filmed
 
00:52:27.069 --> 00:52:27.079 align:start position:0%
audio and video recorded I mean we're in
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
the 21st century and uh it's this stuff
 
00:52:33.309 --> 00:52:33.319 align:start position:0%
is just not that hard to do so that's
 
00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
all I have to say Madam chair and I I
 
00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:38.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate the I'll take some questions
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
I do have to get downstairs ASAP but
 
00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
representative long has a question if
 
00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
you could it's appropriate are you aware
 
00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
of any other private entity that is
 
00:52:51.069 --> 00:52:51.079 align:start position:0%
subject to these requirements you've
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
asked that question a few times
 
00:52:53.549 --> 00:52:53.559 align:start position:0%
representative long and I think you've
 
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
so did I hear you correctly that you
 
00:53:04.349 --> 00:53:04.359 align:start position:0%
would subject all nonprofit boards to
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
these requirements any board or
 
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
organization which was originally
 
00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
state thank you representative Howard
 
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh so I
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
know that you mentioned that you'd be
 
00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
willing to have uh this uh the
 
00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
recordings of all boards uh be handled
 
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
and published online would you be
 
00:53:32.109 --> 00:53:32.119 align:start position:0%
willing to hold off on this so that we
 
00:53:34.789 --> 00:53:34.799 align:start position:0%
could work on legislation for next term
 
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
to handle that so that every single
 
00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:39.559 align:start position:0%
board has a requirement to be
 
00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
recorded this is the committee's bill so
 
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
whe whether I'm willing or not as you
 
00:53:47.789 --> 00:53:47.799 align:start position:0%
know it's not my decision if that's what
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
the committee decides to do on this
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation then then we would
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
move forward with that reality thank you
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you madam
 
00:53:58.349 --> 00:53:58.359 align:start position:0%
chair other questions thank you
 
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler Laura
 
00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:15.880 align:start position:0%
had she would be happy to answer okay we
 
00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
will we will receive her written
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
testimony is there anyone else who
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:29.309 --> 00:54:29.319 align:start position:0%
233 all right representative Bixby are
 
00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
233 that's I thought so all right I have
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
asked our researcher to look into the
 
00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:41.720 align:start position:0%
question of why it's an early Bill and
 
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:45.880 align:start position:0%
where's the fiscal note uh because I
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
think we need to know
 
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
that I will since no one else wishes to
 
00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
testify I'll close the hearing and open
 
00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
the hearing on
 
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:13.870 --> 00:55:13.880 align:start position:0%
vix good morning for the record I'm
 
00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
representative Peter Bixby from uh Dober
 
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:19.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh straford County
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
straford District
 
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
13 and uh this bill is uh essentially um
 
00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:30.200 align:start position:0%
um a uh it is uh something that's coming
 
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
out of the uh New Hampshire food and
 
00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
agriculture strategic plan and uh this
 
00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
is something this is a um something
 
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
that's been work been work uh people
 
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
have been working on for the last couple
 
00:55:46.349 --> 00:55:46.359 align:start position:0%
of years in with the goal of uh
 
00:55:46.359 --> 00:55:47.990 align:start position:0%
of years in with the goal of uh
significantly

00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
increasing uh New Hampshire ability to
 
00:55:55.069 --> 00:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
provide food from local farms and local
 
00:55:58.510 --> 00:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
Fisheries um um and other uh local food
 
00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
producers and uh as a way of reducing uh
 
00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:07.640 align:start position:0%
our dependence on food from far away um
 
00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
and uh so uh I am essentially I am
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
putting this bill in uh on behalf of uh
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
Julie Davidson who is a member of that
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
who has worked on that strateg plan and
 
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
is also um a uh uh uh
 
00:56:29.309 --> 00:56:29.319 align:start position:0%
the board president of the Northeast
 
00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:31.559 align:start position:0%
organic farmers and garden Farmers
 
00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
Association of New Hampshire uh I have
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
my testimony which I uh wrote yesterday
 
00:56:41.029 --> 00:56:41.039 align:start position:0%
to introduce the bill uh I got a message
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
from Miss Davidson this morning saying
 
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
that she was ill and would not be able
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
to come in to testify so uh I had
 
00:56:49.789 --> 00:56:49.799 align:start position:0%
originally expected to testify for about
 
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
3 minutes I will uh testify for you do
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
do my testimony which is about 3 minutes
 
00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
worth and then I will hit some of the
 
00:56:59.950 --> 00:56:59.960 align:start position:0%
high points of her testimony uh and then
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
I would um be happy to answer questions
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
after that
 
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh so uh the um the Strategic plan is
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
something that is uh being done in
 
00:57:16.029 --> 00:57:16.039 align:start position:0%
cooperation with uh a broad range of uh
 
00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:17.640 align:start position:0%
food producers and
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
organizations uh throughout the state
 
00:57:22.589 --> 00:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
including the uh New Hampshire Food
 
00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
Alliance and our department of uh food
 
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
and food
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
agriculture agriculture markets and
 
00:57:33.069 --> 00:57:33.079 align:start position:0%
Foods uh so uh it has broad support
 
00:57:36.029 --> 00:57:36.039 align:start position:0%
throughout the the um agricultural
 
00:57:40.829 --> 00:57:40.839 align:start position:0%
Community um and as I mentioned it's uh
 
00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559 align:start position:0%
the goal of it is to provide a uh have
 
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire provide a greater share of
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
our food so that we can uh encourage
 
00:57:50.349 --> 00:57:50.359 align:start position:0%
food security and
 
00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
resilience uh one of
 
00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
the critical aspects of this plan is
 
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
creating stable markets for New
 
00:57:59.829 --> 00:57:59.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farmers uh the New Hampshire
 
00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
far Farms of school program does this to
 
00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
some degree uh but it's a model that
 
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be um create uh expanded in
 
00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:11.720 align:start position:0%
order to create more impact uh and uh
 
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do is create a
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
study committee that would look into uh
 
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
different uh a broader range of ways
 
00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
that procur procurement uh at the state
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
and local level uh can provide more
 
00:58:27.390 --> 00:58:27.400 align:start position:0%
stable Market market and broader markets
 
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire food Growers and um
 
00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:30.710 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire food Growers and um
and

00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:32.829 --> 00:58:32.839 align:start position:0%
Fishers uh the importance of New
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire agriculture
 
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
uh so uh New Hampshire agriculture uh is
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
important on in several different ways
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh most obviously there's the production
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
of fresh uh fresh and healthy food for
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire res residents but beyond
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
this New Hampshire depends on its
 
00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:54.750 align:start position:0%
this New Hampshire depends on its
natural

00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
natural
 
00:58:59.230 --> 00:58:59.240 align:start position:0%
um natural environment to uh for a
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
substantial portion of our tourist
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
industry and uh one of the things that
 
00:59:08.589 --> 00:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
farmers provide essentially at no cost
 
00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
it to the uh to the state is they
 
00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:13.960 align:start position:0%
provide critical land stewardship that
 
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
supports the natural environment and
 
00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:19.720 align:start position:0%
preserves the natural environment uh in
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
addition uh Farms particularly dairy
 
00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:26.200 align:start position:0%
farms are significant consumers of uh
 
00:59:28.109 --> 00:59:28.119 align:start position:0%
local Ser goods and services such as
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
equipment dealers hardware stores and
 
00:59:32.589 --> 00:59:32.599 align:start position:0%
they contribute significantly
 
00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:35.839 align:start position:0%
significantly to local economies uh also
 
00:59:38.789 --> 00:59:38.799 align:start position:0%
serving as as Employers in in local
 
00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
economies uh so farming is a challenging
 
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
and low margin occupation Farms provide
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
value to the state for which they are
 
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
not remunerated uh one way that the
 
00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
state can help maintain this value that
 
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
they provide is using local uh State and
 
00:59:59.109 --> 00:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
local Pro procurement practices to help
 
01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:01.160 align:start position:0%
provide uh a broader range of markets
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
and a more stable range of markets for
 
01:00:03.359 --> 01:00:04.150 align:start position:0%
and a more stable range of markets for
our

01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.270 align:start position:0%
our
producers

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
producers
 
01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:07.789 align:start position:0%
producers
um

01:00:07.789 --> 01:00:07.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:11.240 align:start position:0%
and uh the details of how these procur
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
procurement plans will would be set up
 
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
is something that uh I frankly don't
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
know how to do yet uh this is why it's a
 
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
study committee as opposed to just a
 
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
straight bill um so
 
01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
uh I think that uh What uh in order to
 
01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
make the in order to make this really
 
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
work we need to study this um this
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
mechanism and uh
 
01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
I uh I am entirely familiar with the
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
reluctance on the part of uh the house
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
to create yet another study committee uh
 
01:00:50.829 --> 01:00:50.839 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's important in
 
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
terms of uh those study study committees
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
is Staffing and I can I
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
can um I am fairly sure that my
 
01:01:02.430 --> 01:01:02.440 align:start position:0%
committee could provide uh two PE two
 
01:01:03.789 --> 01:01:03.799 align:start position:0%
members of the study committee I think
 
01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:06.039 align:start position:0%
it would be critical for this committee
 
01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
to provide one member of that study
 
01:01:10.349 --> 01:01:10.359 align:start position:0%
committee because uh this committee has
 
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
the knowledge of State practices and
 
01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
administrative practices that um our
 
01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
committee doesn't is not as well versed
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
in uh so that is my testimony and I
 
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
excuse me before you go on to the policy
 
01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
of this study committee how many
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
sessions do you think this study
 
01:01:31.549 --> 01:01:31.559 align:start position:0%
committee should exist since it has no
 
01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
expiration date oh one two 10 I I
 
01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
thought that I had put an expiration
 
01:01:41.029 --> 01:01:41.039 align:start position:0%
date in it but um if uh if there one
 
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:45.640 align:start position:0%
term is okay I my in my expectation was
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
to have the expiration date on the on on
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
the committee be uh reporting out
 
01:01:56.829 --> 01:01:56.839 align:start position:0%
November 1st of 2025 I I didn't
 
01:01:59.950 --> 01:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
proofread the that's fine I didn't
 
01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
proofread what came from OS so um that
 
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
is cheing that that is a minor amendment
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
that will need to happen I guess the
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
other thing is that we have an existing
 
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
study committee on state procurement
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
policy which is a
 
01:02:15.309 --> 01:02:15.319 align:start position:0%
inactive would you prefer to have this
 
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
study combined with that or just repeal
 
01:02:19.829 --> 01:02:19.839 align:start position:0%
the other one
 
01:02:24.309 --> 01:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
um I think that uh I don't know what the
 
01:02:25.589 --> 01:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
other one looks like I don't know
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
anything about its charge so I think it
 
01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
probably makes sense to have and and my
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
my my vision for this study committee is
 
01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
that it is a you know just for this year
 
01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
in order to get the me information
 
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
necessary to put forward a specific bill
 
01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to uh sort of the general
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
practices so I think the other study
 
01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
committee you can do what you will like
 
01:02:52.349 --> 01:02:52.359 align:start position:0%
if you want to repeal that as a as an
 
01:02:54.029 --> 01:02:54.039 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill that's fine with
 
01:02:58.990 --> 01:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
me okay thank you very much much I'm I
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
do so proceeding with the the the
 
01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
requesters test a moment yes so uh and
 
01:03:07.789 --> 01:03:07.799 align:start position:0%
this I'm not going to cover she has four
 
01:03:10.269 --> 01:03:10.279 align:start position:0%
pages I'm you are entirely capable of
 
01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:11.799 align:start position:0%
reading it I just want to point out a
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
few of the highlights of it um so uh
 
01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
this bill directly advances key goals
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
from the uh food and agricultural
 
01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:23.720 align:start position:0%
strategic strategic plan then those
 
01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
goals include uh supporting Farm
 
01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
viability through expanded Market access
 
01:03:31.109 --> 01:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
creating Living Way jobs in our local
 
01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:33.319 align:start position:0%
food system uh building climate
 
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
resilience through more sustainable
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
farming practices and providing food
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
accessibility for all Granite
 
01:03:39.839 --> 01:03:42.670 align:start position:0%
accessibility for all Granite
Staters

01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
Staters
 
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh another couple of uh on on the
 
01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
sustainable production end one of the uh
 
01:03:52.990 --> 01:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things that the person who
 
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
brought it to me was envisioning was
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
potentially offering tax credits for
 
01:03:59.710 --> 01:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
retailers who Source from uh sustainable
 
01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
products uh I'm not sure that that
 
01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:05.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh well so that that might
 
01:04:07.789 --> 01:04:07.799 align:start position:0%
be one idea of an approach uh and
 
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
creating supportive regulations for
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
public institutions to Source from
 
01:04:13.789 --> 01:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
sustainable producers which I think is
 
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
more in line with the the central idea
 
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
of what I perceive the bill to be um and
 
01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
uh some of the things that go could go
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
into the study would be evaluating the
 
01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
economic impacts of the farm farm to
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
school procurement um and uh looking at
 
01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
results of that of how that's been U
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
progressed so far and uh maybe expanding
 
01:04:43.309 --> 01:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
that um and looking at how this has
 
01:04:48.029 --> 01:04:48.039 align:start position:0%
worked in some other states uh one one
 
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
um thing that look that uh speaks in
 
01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
favor of it is that uh initial studies
 
01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
in terms of Farm school programs in New
 
01:05:00.670 --> 01:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire suggests that uh the return uh
 
01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
uh on that is that a dollar spent on
 
01:05:06.430 --> 01:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
local food generates about uh a160 in
 
01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:08.200 align:start position:0%
local economic
 
01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
activity um and uh so I think that's
 
01:05:15.549 --> 01:05:15.559 align:start position:0%
let's see sorry
 
01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
um and uh there is some model
 
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
legislation that uh Miss Davidson uh
 
01:05:25.269 --> 01:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
suggested looking at U I think that
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
that's something that uh can give us
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
some ideas I don't think that something
 
01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
we can really depend on because uh
 
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
anything that depends on tax credits
 
01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
directly to Farmers is probably not
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
going to be uh as effective as New
 
01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as it might be in some other
 
01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:46.039 align:start position:0%
states and that concludes um the my
 
01:05:46.039 --> 01:05:47.430 align:start position:0%
states and that concludes um the my
joint

01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
joint
 
01:05:49.549 --> 01:05:49.559 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you will you answer
 
01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
answer some questions sure
 
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson I sit on the
 
01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
state procurement Commission
 
01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
how how fortunate representative Pearson
 
01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:03.640 align:start position:0%
how fortunate that is a commission that
 
01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:07.240 align:start position:0%
takes information it right so the state
 
01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
procurement commission is more of a come
 
01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:12.279 align:start position:0%
to us and tell us your story of how your
 
01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:15.640 align:start position:0%
various group is working is in
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
procurement how they're requiring things
 
01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
um we had uh during the beginning of
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
covid there was a lot of focus on
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
materials and stuff that was necessary
 
01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
to process all that and how the state
 
01:06:33.269 --> 01:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
was was um acquiring things and finding
 
01:06:36.029 --> 01:06:36.039 align:start position:0%
rotten things in storage areas and that
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
sort of thing
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
so if you were to do this if you were to
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
set this up
 
01:06:42.559 --> 01:06:44.630 align:start position:0%
set this up
specifically

01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
um I would think that logically this
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
committee would also report to the state
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
Commission on procurement which handles
 
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
the overall broad encompassing
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
aspect of procurement as as that is what
 
01:07:03.069 --> 01:07:03.079 align:start position:0%
their purview is they don't set policy
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
or um it's more of an absorption thing
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
and then the commission recommends to
 
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
the groups that come before us maybe
 
01:07:12.589 --> 01:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
some ways to help make their life a
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
little bit easier but that that's what
 
01:07:16.269 --> 01:07:16.279 align:start position:0%
that's what we
 
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
do uh so I think that um if I would I
 
01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:23.799 align:start position:0%
would be happy to have an amendment to
 
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
the bill that said that added uh your
 
01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
commission to uh the report to where it
 
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
reports to and I think that your
 
01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839 align:start position:0%
commission also could be uh a very um
 
01:07:39.269 --> 01:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
useful source of information in order to
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
um to to figure out how best to meet the
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
goals of this
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
bill representative leam thank you madam
 
01:07:48.990 --> 01:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
01:07:51.309 --> 01:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill um I'm not sure if
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
you're aware but there seems to be
 
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
almost an exploding demand for good food
 
01:07:58.269 --> 01:07:58.279 align:start position:0%
especially good food raised around us in
 
01:07:59.789 --> 01:07:59.799 align:start position:0%
Dairy we're pretty lucky because we have
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
jnf Farms that brings in Daily Hall and
 
01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
other ones where different um providers
 
01:08:07.269 --> 01:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
um in the state are working together in
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
order to have a good solid Marketplace
 
01:08:10.750 --> 01:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
between the community supported
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
agriculture the Farm Stand and other
 
01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
processes um I'm curious that with the
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
burgeoning demand for this local good
 
01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:21.880 align:start position:0%
food if um if this might actually be
 
01:08:24.070 --> 01:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
something that that the the demands of
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
consumers are almost catching up to the
 
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
need for sustainable production and if
 
01:08:29.709 --> 01:08:29.719 align:start position:0%
the Northeast organic farming
 
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
Association of New Hampshire is looking
 
01:08:34.749 --> 01:08:34.759 align:start position:0%
at how to better seed um these
 
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
interactions between the farmers and the
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
other food producers with the people who
 
01:08:41.229 --> 01:08:41.239 align:start position:0%
are desperately searching for this good
 
01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
food in their neighborhoods right so um
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
this is uh this is a yes and uh so one
 
01:08:51.309 --> 01:08:51.319 align:start position:0%
of the thing so uh the the Strategic
 
01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
plan also cover is um spends a lot of
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
time looking at uh how to better uh
 
01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
connect uh Farmers with uh direct with
 
01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
direct consumers uh and uh that is uh
 
01:09:10.349 --> 01:09:10.359 align:start position:0%
and I'm I can't I'm not there are 27
 
01:09:12.510 --> 01:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
briefs Each of which is about five pages
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
long and then there's an overriding you
 
01:09:16.669 --> 01:09:16.679 align:start position:0%
know plan and that's going to be
 
01:09:21.309 --> 01:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
published in March uh but so that so
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is not um trying to supersede
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
that but one of the things that um so
 
01:09:30.829 --> 01:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
one of the things about uh farmers
 
01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
markets and csas is that there's often a
 
01:09:37.349 --> 01:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
certain amount of fluctuation in demand
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh from that uh makes it difficult for
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh Farmers to necessarily predict uh
 
01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
what they're going to be producing what
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
they need to produce um in any given
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
month and you they certainly have the
 
01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
ability to um to design to to uh use
 
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
their records and use uh exper you
 
01:10:00.669 --> 01:10:00.679 align:start position:0%
broader experience in order to make some
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
guesses but one of the things that a
 
01:10:05.229 --> 01:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
proc procurement program does is it
 
01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
creates a very steady clear demand and
 
01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
that is uh provides an easy base to um
 
01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
to work from and then the farmers
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
markets and uh uh and csas and whatnot
 
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
beyond that would be in addition to what
 
01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
they have is that steady demand follow
 
01:10:31.149 --> 01:10:31.159 align:start position:0%
up uh followup um it's my understanding
 
01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
that CSA is the community supported
 
01:10:35.550 --> 01:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
agriculture everybody pays the amount of
 
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
money ahead of time and agrees that over
 
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
the 10 or 13 week growing session
 
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to show up and get that
 
01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
bush of food no matter if it's full of
 
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
zucchini or it's just corn that week in
 
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
order to have that consistency and
 
01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's specifically the goal of that it
 
01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
yes uh consider so csas are a more are a
 
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
more steady Source than farmers market
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
sales but the but uh in order to uh New
 
01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farmers uh New Hampshire has
 
01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
the highest proportion of direct sales
 
01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
in agriculture of any state and this may
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
seem like a great thing because you know
 
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
here we are at the top but what that one
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
of the things that means is that uh we
 
01:11:21.229 --> 01:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
don't our Farmers depend Less on
 
01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
wholesaling they depend Less on steady
 
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
contracts they depend on uh more on
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
direct sales which tend to fluctuate
 
01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
more csas are one way to moderate that
 
01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
uh a proc a procure procurement program
 
01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
like this is yet is another way to to um
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
to to help with that and our farmers are
 
01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
struggling because the cost of
 
01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:48.280 align:start position:0%
production in the Northeast is higher
 
01:11:49.709 --> 01:11:49.719 align:start position:0%
than the cost of production in some
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
other states so uh anything that we can
 
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
do to help our Farmers so that they can
 
01:11:58.270 --> 01:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
continue to be storage of the land is
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
really important thank you okay other
 
01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
you right does anyone else wish to
 
01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill
 
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
156 well obviously
 
01:12:19.229 --> 01:12:19.239 align:start position:0%
not I guess you're you caught up a
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
little bit yes thank you I appreciate it
 
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
um close the public hearing
 
01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson if you could work
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
you could tell me where the in statute
 
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
that procurement commission you're
 
01:12:37.629 --> 01:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
you're on is located I'm going to work
 
01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
on a technical amendment to oh
 
01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
Lord so this is one of the wonderful
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
aspects of the speaker's office being
 
01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:47.560 align:start position:0%
inundated with the hundreds of
 
01:12:49.390 --> 01:12:49.400 align:start position:0%
commissions and boards that they have to
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
put people on um and that's how I got on
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
it I understand I didn't representative
 
01:12:58.830 --> 01:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
Maguire I'm also on that committee and I
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
can give you the RSA number please do
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
okay it's called the advisory committee
 
01:13:06.270 --> 01:13:06.280 align:start position:0%
on state procurement and it's RSA
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
2-i colon
 
01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
14-d and that at according to a report I
 
01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
got from the speaker's office it hasn't
 
01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
met in a while is that correct that's
 
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
correct corre yeah met um oh Lord it not
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
it didn't even meet last session it
 
01:13:23.629 --> 01:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
didn't meet in the last three years and
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
I recommended just just for full
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
disclosure I recommended that the
 
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
speaker's office um consider either
 
01:13:32.669 --> 01:13:32.679 align:start position:0%
using it or eliminating it because
 
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
there's no sense in having commission if
 
01:13:35.629 --> 01:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
you're not going to use it yeah we we
 
01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
met last right right as Co emerged and
 
01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
then things kind of went haywire okay
 
01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
thank you all right I will work on an
 
01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
amendment to House Bill
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
156 and we'll see and I will report that
 
01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
it is not actually that house bill 233
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
is not actually an early bill and it
 
01:13:58.350 --> 01:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
does not have a fiscal note
 
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
so it may have started as one but it
 
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
didn't come out of the process with it
 
01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
can

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:23.950 align:start position:0%
 
for

01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:53.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:53.920 --> 01:16:23.910 align:start position:0%

01:18:40.229 --> 01:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
uh seeing that it's just after 11:15 I
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
will open the hearing on House Bill 278
 
01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
and call the prime sponsor
 
01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:57.629 --> 01:18:57.639 align:start position:0%
gerana thank you madam chair honorable
 
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
members my name for the record is Nick
 
01:19:05.070 --> 01:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
tra I am representing chesher 15 which
 
01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
is Chesterfield Hinsdale Keen Wards 1
 
01:19:14.629 --> 01:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
and 35 sui Walpole and
 
01:19:18.149 --> 01:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
westerland the purpose of HB 278 is to
 
01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
save New Hampshire taxpayers money by
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
assuring that state purchasing decisions
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
are made with an eye toward long-term
 
01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
costs I want to begin by explaining how
 
01:19:31.229 --> 01:19:31.239 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing works and why we need to
 
01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
prepare for the effects of international
 
01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:35.480 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing models in our state
 
01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:36.550 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing models in our state
purchasing

01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
purchasing
 
01:19:38.590 --> 01:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
decisions carbon pricing is a
 
01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
market-based alternative to State
 
01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
imposed caps by placing a price on
 
01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
carbon emissions carbon carbon pricing
 
01:19:49.390 --> 01:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
provides incentives for producers to
 
01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
develop cleaner low carbon
 
01:19:53.950 --> 01:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
Alternatives the pricing models that are
 
01:19:56.310 --> 01:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
being implemented around the world are
 
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
based on carbon emission goals
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
established by the International Panel
 
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
on climate change to hold Global Climate
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
rise to 1 and a half degrees above
 
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
pre-industrial levels and to reach net
 
01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
zero emissions by
 
01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
2050 the ipcc's goals have been adopted
 
01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
by the international Chamber of Commerce
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
as a basis for its policy initiatives uh
 
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
in the the uh testimony that I emailed
 
01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
everybody I included a couple of
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
hyperlinks to uh the site that contain
 
01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:26.270 align:start position:0%
hyperlinks to uh the site that contain
this

01:20:26.270 --> 01:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
information I want to make uh my
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
testimony as clear as I can HB 278 is
 
01:20:35.629 --> 01:20:35.639 align:start position:0%
not a debate about global warming
 
01:20:38.189 --> 01:20:38.199 align:start position:0%
wherever one stands on the causes of
 
01:20:40.590 --> 01:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
undeniable climate change we are
 
01:20:42.669 --> 01:20:42.679 align:start position:0%
experiencing this bill is about how
 
01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
State purchasing decisions are made in a
 
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
changing energy Market countries around
 
01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:50.920 align:start position:0%
the world including our largest trading
 
01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:53.639 align:start position:0%
partners are adopting carbon pricing
 
01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
programs Canada Mexico China and most
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
European countries have or are in the
 
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
process of adopting and implementing
 
01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:02.709 align:start position:0%
process of adopting and implementing
carbon

01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
carbon
 
01:21:05.669 --> 01:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
pricing these programs will increase the
 
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
cost of carbon intensive production in
 
01:21:10.910 --> 01:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
their domestic markets and globally
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
private companies who conduct business
 
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
internationally are preparing for this
 
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
shift in global markets by implementing
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
internal carbon pricing
 
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
models HB 278 aims to have the State of
 
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire follow the lead of these
 
01:21:28.990 --> 01:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
businesses and take steps to assure the
 
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
most efficient and responsible use of
 
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money by factoring carbon
 
01:21:36.590 --> 01:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
pricing into State purchasing decisions
 
01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
this is where the proxy carbon pricing
 
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
model comes in it's a proxy model
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
because we do not have a carbon pricing
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
model uh in place in the United States
 
01:21:50.110 --> 01:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
however the growth of such models Global
 
01:21:52.590 --> 01:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
globally will inevitably affect our
 
01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
Market this is what private business
 
01:21:56.189 --> 01:21:56.199 align:start position:0%
businesses have already figured out and
 
01:21:59.070 --> 01:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
begun to act upon the price of carbon
 
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
intensive products will continue to rise
 
01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
we can make the best decisions about how
 
01:22:06.270 --> 01:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
to use taxpayer money by anticipating
 
01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
these Rising costs and factoring them
 
01:22:12.030 --> 01:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
into purchasing decisions for example
 
01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
when the state builds new facilities or
 
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
renovates HVAC systems in existing
 
01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
facilities we can use a proit proxy
 
01:22:22.189 --> 01:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing model articulated in the
 
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
bill to compare Heating and Cooling in
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
systems to see which will be most cost
 
01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
effective over the lifetime of the
 
01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
system lower carbon emitting systems May
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
cost more upfront but be considerably
 
01:22:37.390 --> 01:22:37.400 align:start position:0%
more more cost effective in the long
 
01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
term I want to be clear HB 278 does not
 
01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
require the department of administrative
 
01:22:46.830 --> 01:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
services to make purchasing decisions
 
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
based on carbon emissions that is not
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
the standard used in the bill if a lower
 
01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
carbon option is not more cost efficient
 
01:22:57.790 --> 01:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
it would not be
 
01:22:59.950 --> 01:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
chosen I have been in contact with
 
01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner Arling housee and with Gary
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
lunetta from Das and they have confirmed
 
01:23:06.629 --> 01:23:06.639 align:start position:0%
that the department can implement the
 
01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
policy in their evaluation of State
 
01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:09.950 align:start position:0%
policy in their evaluation of State
purchasing

01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
purchasing
 
01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:12.040 align:start position:0%
decisions the fiscal note which is
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
attached to the bill was added prior to
 
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
my discussions with Das I do not know if
 
01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh that information has changed in light
 
01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
of our discussions but I have been
 
01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
assured that the evaluation described in
 
01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
the bill can be performed by the
 
01:23:29.550 --> 01:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
department I understand that there will
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
be a temptation to make a discussion of
 
01:23:34.270 --> 01:23:34.280 align:start position:0%
this bill about global climate change I
 
01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
hope and trust that we can remain
 
01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
focused on the question of how we can
 
01:23:40.629 --> 01:23:40.639 align:start position:0%
best serve our constituents by making
 
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
sound decisions about how to use their
 
01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
tax dollars in a changing Global energy
 
01:23:48.350 --> 01:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
Market I know that my colleagues on this
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
committee on both sides of the aisle
 
01:23:53.550 --> 01:23:53.560 align:start position:0%
share that commitment thank you for your
 
01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
time and consideration and I'm very
 
01:23:57.790 --> 01:23:57.800 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions um thank you
 
01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
for that testimony U my first question
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
would be when you spoke with the
 
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services
 
01:24:04.910 --> 01:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
how many full-time employees did they
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
say this would take because we all know
 
01:24:07.550 --> 01:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
labor is not
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
free thank you for the question when I
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
spoke with Mr lunetta last Friday he
 
01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
didn't uh he didn't give me a number of
 
01:24:16.350 --> 01:24:16.360 align:start position:0%
people who would would work on this what
 
01:24:18.669 --> 01:24:18.679 align:start position:0%
he said was they understand what is
 
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
being asked for and if the bill were to
 
01:24:22.709 --> 01:24:22.719 align:start position:0%
be passed into law they could do
 
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
it so uh as a followup they would not
 
01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
require additional positions in order to
 
01:24:30.189 --> 01:24:30.199 align:start position:0%
do this I can't say that they wouldn't
 
01:24:32.030 --> 01:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
he did not say that they would that's
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
all I can tell you thank you that's
 
01:24:37.950 --> 01:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
helpful there questions representative
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
gr so I'm
 
01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:43.270 align:start position:0%
gr so I'm
having

01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
trouble well it's not trouble but I'd
 
01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
like to have more um an example M okay
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
so it just and I know that the numbers
 
01:24:55.950 --> 01:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
are um
 
01:24:58.510 --> 01:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
would be estimates or even made up right
 
01:25:01.390 --> 01:25:01.400 align:start position:0%
so could you give let's just say you
 
01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:02.830 align:start position:0%
so could you give let's just say you
have

01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:05.870 align:start position:0%
have
um

01:25:05.870 --> 01:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
the you want to replace a furnace in one
 
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
of the buildings right could you walk us
 
01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
through what carbon pricing would look
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
like and how at the end it could be used
 
01:25:18.719 --> 01:25:20.149 align:start position:0%
like and how at the end it could be used
to

01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
make well no never mind because we're
 
01:25:24.669 --> 01:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
not we're just studying it so so let's
 
01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
just say what would the results be what
 
01:25:29.109 --> 01:25:29.119 align:start position:0%
would what would at the end of the day
 
01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
what would you have in this spreadsheet
 
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much for that
 
01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
question uh excellent question right so
 
01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:38.719 align:start position:0%
if you're looking at as any of us would
 
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
do right if we're going to heat our our
 
01:25:42.030 --> 01:25:42.040 align:start position:0%
homes right and and obviously if we're
 
01:25:44.229 --> 01:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
talking about state buildings are much
 
01:25:46.629 --> 01:25:46.639 align:start position:0%
larger than our homes or at least mine
 
01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh but you would do a cost comparison
 
01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
right thinking about what it would cost
 
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
you to operate something over the long
 
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
term and if if you're going with uh an
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
oil furnace for example you would take
 
01:25:59.709 --> 01:25:59.719 align:start position:0%
into account as best you could not only
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
installation costs but if you could
 
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
project the average price of oil out
 
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
over that lifetime of the product right
 
01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
so that gives you a a guess you could
 
01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
have some you could have a heat pump as
 
01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:12.639 align:start position:0%
an alternative for example right and
 
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
again look at installation costs look at
 
01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
the average cost to operate a heat pump
 
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
thermal heat pump over the course of of
 
01:26:20.709 --> 01:26:20.719 align:start position:0%
that time right you would come to a
 
01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
decision one of those is going to be
 
01:26:24.270 --> 01:26:24.280 align:start position:0%
more cost effective one might be more
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
expensive upfront more cost effective in
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
the long run so similarly what what the
 
01:26:31.550 --> 01:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
uh Department of administrative Services
 
01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
would do is to take a look at the
 
01:26:35.109 --> 01:26:35.119 align:start position:0%
different options are that are out there
 
01:26:36.510 --> 01:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
and the way that the proxy carbon
 
01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
pricing Works in is it's not just the
 
01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
cost of installation and it's not just
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
the cost of say oil it also the formula
 
01:26:47.709 --> 01:26:47.719 align:start position:0%
that is uh provided in the bill which is
 
01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
based on the Canadian model would also
 
01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
be factor in factored in and what that
 
01:26:56.229 --> 01:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
does is it factors in a cost an
 
01:26:59.629 --> 01:26:59.639 align:start position:0%
increasing cost of carbon over the years
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
and over decades right so that would be
 
01:27:04.590 --> 01:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
added to the estimate that you would do
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
so I hope that helps you would look at
 
01:27:10.830 --> 01:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
different Alternatives and uh one of the
 
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
the data points you would use to
 
01:27:16.229 --> 01:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
consider is how much carbon does it
 
01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
consume and what does the carbon market
 
01:27:21.550 --> 01:27:21.560 align:start position:0%
look like over 10 or 20 years and that
 
01:27:23.470 --> 01:27:23.480 align:start position:0%
would help you decide what the total
 
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
cost of operation that system is as
 
01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:27.719 align:start position:0%
opposed to a system that uses less
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
carbon or no
 
01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:36.990 --> 01:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
follow so just so that I understand I'm
 
01:27:40.510 --> 01:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
going to do it on a very different I'm
 
01:27:41.950 --> 01:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
going to heat my house with an oil
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
furnace I'm going to consider how much
 
01:27:46.109 --> 01:27:46.119 align:start position:0%
it cost to put that oil furnace in and
 
01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
how much it cost to buy the furnace and
 
01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:50.719 align:start position:0%
then I'm going to calculate for the next
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
let's say the furnace life is 10 years
 
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
just for Simplicity I'm going to
 
01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
calculate how much oil I'm going to need
 
01:27:59.550 --> 01:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
to buy to heat my house for the next 10
 
01:28:01.870 --> 01:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
years based on I'm going to base on what
 
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
I've done before right so at the end I'm
 
01:28:06.189 --> 01:28:06.199 align:start position:0%
going to say
 
01:28:09.790 --> 01:28:09.800 align:start position:0%
that 20 I I'm going to spend $20,000 on
 
01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
the furnace putting it in and buying oil
 
01:28:13.070 --> 01:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
for 10
 
01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:15.800 align:start position:0%
years and then I'm going to look at a
 
01:28:18.629 --> 01:28:18.639 align:start position:0%
different thing I'm going to look at um
 
01:28:20.910 --> 01:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
same system hot floor chock water but
 
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to use solar panels okay I'm
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
going to going to cost out how much it
 
01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
cost to put the solar panels in I'm
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
going to cost how much it run it takes
 
01:28:34.109 --> 01:28:34.119 align:start position:0%
to run those solar panels and I'm going
 
01:28:37.709 --> 01:28:37.719 align:start position:0%
to say that at the end of the year it
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
cost me $20,000 to install the solar
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
panels and everything else so I would
 
01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
think that because we're using a solar
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
panel the carbon cost is higher for the
 
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
coal for the oil because oil is a carbon
 
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
derivative whereas the solar panel is
 
01:29:01.550 --> 01:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
using the sun is that pretty much where
 
01:29:05.550 --> 01:29:05.560 align:start position:0%
we are yes okay so in those two oh so
 
01:29:10.590 --> 01:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:13.709 --> 01:29:13.719 align:start position:0%
cases that's obvious because we can say
 
01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
that oil is carbon derived and sun is
 
01:29:21.109 --> 01:29:21.119 align:start position:0%
not so let's say we're looking at oil
 
01:29:21.119 --> 01:29:22.590 align:start position:0%
not so let's say we're looking at oil
versus

01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
versus
 
01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
propane right we would determine the
 
01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
cost of those two systems and then we
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
would determine they were the same let's
 
01:29:32.350 --> 01:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
say there's $20,000 a
 
01:29:36.430 --> 01:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
piece there would be a carbon proxy fee
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
added to that for analysis
 
01:29:43.870 --> 01:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
purposes because one of these two
 
01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
sources is more carbon dependent than
 
01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:48.149 align:start position:0%
sources is more carbon dependent than
the

01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:50.719 align:start position:0%
other yes exactly you explained it very
 
01:29:53.149 --> 01:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
well and and we do have a a formula here
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
that goes for example for for natural
 
01:29:57.790 --> 01:29:57.800 align:start position:0%
gas which is a little bit different U
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
because of of the chemical kind of
 
01:30:02.669 --> 01:30:02.679 align:start position:0%
makeup of the fuel but uh yes that is
 
01:30:05.470 --> 01:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
correct and and so the department would
 
01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
kind of play both of those scenarios out
 
01:30:09.109 --> 01:30:09.119 align:start position:0%
over the course of the lifetime of that
 
01:30:11.550 --> 01:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
system determine that one of them would
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
be more cost effective and and also I I
 
01:30:17.070 --> 01:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
would add that one of the other features
 
01:30:19.629 --> 01:30:19.639 align:start position:0%
uh obviously that the uh the Das would
 
01:30:21.189 --> 01:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
have to consider again is I referred to
 
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
the size of of the buildings obviously
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with you and I might be
 
01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
able to use solar panels effectively to
 
01:30:30.030 --> 01:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
to provide energy for our homes you're
 
01:30:31.229 --> 01:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
talking about much much larger
 
01:30:33.229 --> 01:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
structures obviously it's much less
 
01:30:34.709 --> 01:30:34.719 align:start position:0%
efficient to use something like solar
 
01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
panels right so even though and that's
 
01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:39.400 align:start position:0%
where I wanted to point out this the the
 
01:30:42.109 --> 01:30:42.119 align:start position:0%
M the measure that Dees would be using
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
is not carbon emissions it's the price
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
right so when they look at it and they
 
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
say there's no way to efficiently heat a
 
01:30:51.070 --> 01:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
government building using solar
 
01:30:53.629 --> 01:30:53.639 align:start position:0%
panels it it is ultimately more cost
 
01:30:55.709 --> 01:30:55.719 align:start position:0%
efficient because of the square footage
 
01:30:59.430 --> 01:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
to to heat with oil or gas or whatever
 
01:31:01.310 --> 01:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
then that is is ultimately what you
 
01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:02.470 align:start position:0%
then that is is ultimately what you
would

01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:31:06.189 --> 01:31:06.199 align:start position:0%
choose thank you person Leon thank you
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh listening to this and
 
01:31:10.270 --> 01:31:10.280 align:start position:0%
hearing this you're talking about
 
01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
market-based carbon pricing but in this
 
01:31:15.590 --> 01:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's not market-based you have an
 
01:31:18.550 --> 01:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
inflation adjusted um adjustment what
 
01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
kind of confidence do you have that $325
 
01:31:25.109 --> 01:31:25.119 align:start position:0%
per ton in 2050 would be an appropriate
 
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
price thank you and that's an excellent
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
question and uh I'm not an economist so
 
01:31:32.189 --> 01:31:32.199 align:start position:0%
I know that I'm not going to be able to
 
01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
give you the best answer to that
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
question the answer that I have is that
 
01:31:42.310 --> 01:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
this is designed to fit into the
 
01:31:45.109 --> 01:31:45.119 align:start position:0%
emerging International Market on pricing
 
01:31:49.310 --> 01:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
so that what that will be uh I I don't
 
01:31:51.149 --> 01:31:51.159 align:start position:0%
think even economists but that's just a
 
01:31:52.910 --> 01:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
guess would be able to tell you that
 
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
with great confidence they'd be able to
 
01:31:55.790 --> 01:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
predict what that price is going to be
 
01:31:59.669 --> 01:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
in 2050 but the uh the method that is
 
01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
described in the bill as I said is meant
 
01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
to have this model be in the ballpark of
 
01:32:08.669 --> 01:32:08.679 align:start position:0%
our major trading partners assuming that
 
01:32:11.870 --> 01:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
whatever price it is will be in that
 
01:32:13.830 --> 01:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
same ballpark with the other
 
01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
industrialized countries that are our
 
01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
major trading
 
01:32:20.750 --> 01:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
partners thank you representative ree
 
01:32:23.470 --> 01:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um I'm not
 
01:32:24.750 --> 01:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
understanding some of the text on the
 
01:32:26.629 --> 01:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
fill and the pricing and I'm hoping that
 
01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
you can explain it to me because you it
 
01:32:31.629 --> 01:32:31.639 align:start position:0%
says here that beginning in January 2026
 
01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
the commissioner she'll use axy carbon
 
01:32:36.109 --> 01:32:36.119 align:start position:0%
price of $85 per ton and then that
 
01:32:40.990 --> 01:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
increases $10 per ton um up until 2050
 
01:32:43.629 --> 01:32:43.639 align:start position:0%
which representative Leon shared and
 
01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
then it says prices shall be inflation
 
01:32:50.350 --> 01:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
adjusted from a 2010 valuation so are
 
01:32:54.109 --> 01:32:54.119 align:start position:0%
are the prices being set by this or or
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
are they being adjusted and why 2010 I'm
 
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm just
 
01:33:01.070 --> 01:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
confused yeah thank you very much for
 
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
that question that marker is one that is
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
established in other carbon pricing
 
01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
systems as a baseline so it's meant to
 
01:33:10.149 --> 01:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
provide again to make this a model which
 
01:33:12.149 --> 01:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
is comparable to the models that exist
 
01:33:14.709 --> 01:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
in other countries European models and
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
and and Canada the Canadian model in
 
01:33:19.149 --> 01:33:19.159 align:start position:0%
particular is the one that was used to
 
01:33:20.990 --> 01:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
create the structure in this bill so
 
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
it's providing the same Baseline as
 
01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
exists in other
 
01:33:26.750 --> 01:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
um other systems I honestly could not
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
tell you why 2010 was chosen um but so
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
it is right it is adjusted as you said
 
01:33:34.910 --> 01:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh on an annual basis and then there is
 
01:33:37.830 --> 01:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
an inflation inflation adjustment as
 
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
well followup thank you so that it's the
 
01:33:45.109 --> 01:33:45.119 align:start position:0%
$10 per year that would be infl
 
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
inflation adjusted is what you're you're
 
01:33:50.270 --> 01:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
saying the $10 increase is what would be
 
01:33:53.310 --> 01:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
a yes my understanding uh is that the
 
01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
the annual adjustment right the increase
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
is what's inflation adjusted thank you
 
01:34:00.109 --> 01:34:00.119 align:start position:0%
that thank you for that clarifying
 
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
question that was very important than
 
01:34:04.109 --> 01:34:04.119 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
long I guess I don't understand the
 
01:34:08.910 --> 01:34:08.920 align:start position:0%
state procurement process very well
 
01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
because it it seems to me like
 
01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
calculating the long-term costs of a
 
01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
purchase that you're making uh would be
 
01:34:18.510 --> 01:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
a standard business practice and I say
 
01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
that as a small business owner uh and so
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's I guess what are they doing now
 
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
that there would be any suggestion that
 
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
they would need more staff to carry this
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
out thank you for that question I think
 
01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
it's a very reasonable question and I
 
01:34:39.149 --> 01:34:39.159 align:start position:0%
also uh you know an ear member earlier
 
01:34:40.990 --> 01:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
had asked the question about staff and
 
01:34:42.350 --> 01:34:42.360 align:start position:0%
the fact is I just don't have an answer
 
01:34:44.430 --> 01:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
for that when I spoke to Mr lunetta he
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
did not say that more staff would be
 
01:34:48.109 --> 01:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
required so I cannot speak to the
 
01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
question whether more staff would be
 
01:34:51.550 --> 01:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
required to do this work they simply
 
01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
said they understood what the bill is is
 
01:35:00.030 --> 01:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
it I believe if I I could it it requires
 
01:35:06.750 --> 01:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
the procurement Department to calculate
 
01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
an adjustment factor for any of these
 
01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
assorted building cost transportation
 
01:35:17.470 --> 01:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
and new new construction which would
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
incorporate instead of the current
 
01:35:24.149 --> 01:35:24.159 align:start position:0%
prices and long-term cost it would put
 
01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
in a fudge factor to account for for
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
carbon so it would complicate the
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
procurement process but it would be at a
 
01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
ju when choosing a a
 
01:35:40.510 --> 01:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
system representative sers thank you
 
01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair um I have a few questions
 
01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
but I'll start with one why don't we
 
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
just have a national model instead of a
 
01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question
 
01:35:57.629 --> 01:35:57.639 align:start position:0%
there has been some momentum in Congress
 
01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
in in recent years uh congresswoman
 
01:36:02.270 --> 01:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
kuster has come out in favor of a
 
01:36:05.470 --> 01:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
national carbon uh pricing model uh
 
01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
there just has not been will within
 
01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
Congress as with many things to to do it
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
so there there are a certain number of
 
01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
representatives in Congress who have
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
been advocating for this but as I said
 
01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
like many other things uh it simply has
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:28.109 --> 01:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:30.390 --> 01:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
represent followup yes please thank you
 
01:36:33.310 --> 01:36:33.320 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:36:37.709 --> 01:36:37.719 align:start position:0%
um I'm just uh we we've never had this
 
01:36:40.510 --> 01:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
before correct so this is
 
01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:45.679 align:start position:0%
new and why do we need it now I mean I'm
 
01:36:48.990 --> 01:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
I'm over 60 years old I'm never heard of
 
01:36:51.390 --> 01:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
cin credits until the last few years of
 
01:36:54.990 --> 01:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
course but why do we need this now
 
01:36:57.070 --> 01:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
thank you that's an excellent question
 
01:36:59.629 --> 01:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
uh while I am a historian so I can say a
 
01:37:01.390 --> 01:37:01.400 align:start position:0%
little bit about the history I'm not a
 
01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
historian of energy policy but actually
 
01:37:07.229 --> 01:37:07.239 align:start position:0%
the idea of a carbon pricing model goes
 
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
back to to the 1980s and and some
 
01:37:11.709 --> 01:37:11.719 align:start position:0%
members of the Reagan Administration
 
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
actually uh who first forwarded the idea
 
01:37:17.629 --> 01:37:17.639 align:start position:0%
as an alternative to some proposals that
 
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
were being put forward in the 80s uh
 
01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
around simply capping carbon emissions
 
01:37:22.990 --> 01:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
right then if you remember in the late '
 
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
90s ear early 2000s there was a
 
01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
discussion about cap and trade um so the
 
01:37:29.790 --> 01:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
discussion actually is not new at a
 
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
national level and and the first people
 
01:37:33.910 --> 01:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
to begin to articulate a model like this
 
01:37:35.790 --> 01:37:35.800 align:start position:0%
as a as a market-based alternative to
 
01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
State imposed uh schemes goes back to
 
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
the 1980s the reason why there's more
 
01:37:43.709 --> 01:37:43.719 align:start position:0%
discussion of it now is because our
 
01:37:45.709 --> 01:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
major trading partners in particular
 
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
Canada Mexico China and most of the
 
01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
European States who are major trading
 
01:37:52.109 --> 01:37:52.119 align:start position:0%
partners are implementing the policies
 
01:37:54.270 --> 01:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
within the past few years and that is
 
01:37:57.070 --> 01:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
what is shaping the global energy Market
 
01:37:59.350 --> 01:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh and companies that are doing business
 
01:38:01.990 --> 01:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
internationally right now are having to
 
01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
figure out how to account in their own
 
01:38:06.430 --> 01:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
business practices for the change in the
 
01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
market so it has become more pressing in
 
01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
recent years because it's been adopted
 
01:38:14.229 --> 01:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
in other countries but the idea goes
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:20.709 --> 01:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
1980s thank followup yeah thank you and
 
01:38:22.030 --> 01:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
just to make sure I'm trying to be clear
 
01:38:24.990 --> 01:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
on this too is so if I'm a builder and
 
01:38:28.990 --> 01:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
I'm building a new 3,000 ft house and
 
01:38:31.109 --> 01:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
I'm sure dep depending on what type of
 
01:38:33.390 --> 01:38:33.400 align:start position:0%
heating Source I put in how much would
 
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
that cost how much more will that cost
 
01:38:38.189 --> 01:38:38.199 align:start position:0%
to that house add to that house U thank
 
01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
you and I think it's important to to
 
01:38:43.510 --> 01:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
clarify any this is strictly for for
 
01:38:46.189 --> 01:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
State purchasing decision so it will not
 
01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
in any way shape or form
 
01:38:50.669 --> 01:38:50.679 align:start position:0%
effect anything beyond that right so
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
work that you do on your home I would
 
01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
say those costs are are going to go up
 
01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:56.440 align:start position:0%
because carbon is going to go up but
 
01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
that's the market independent of this
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
this is strictly uh for State purchasing
 
01:39:03.589 --> 01:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
decisions and does not apply to any
 
01:39:03.599 --> 01:39:04.470 align:start position:0%
decisions and does not apply to any
private

01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
private
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
parties thank you representative JG
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um what do exactly
 
01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
do you mean by um transportation cost is
 
01:39:17.390 --> 01:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
just Transportation cost relative to uh
 
01:39:19.350 --> 01:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
building buildings or Transportation
 
01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
cost in general for moving things around
 
01:39:24.149 --> 01:39:24.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that question it
 
01:39:25.310 --> 01:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
would be the ladder so if you're
 
01:39:27.229 --> 01:39:27.239 align:start position:0%
thinking about the fleet of automobiles
 
01:39:29.790 --> 01:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
for example that the state has right and
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
it's technological developments around
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles or hybrid vehicles Etc
 
01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh as we replace vehicles uh for various
 
01:39:41.229 --> 01:39:41.239 align:start position:0%
purposes uh for the state this kind of
 
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
calculation would be done to determine
 
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
are certain kinds of vehicles more cost
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
effective I mean we do that anyway I
 
01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
assume using various factors right which
 
01:39:53.709 --> 01:39:53.719 align:start position:0%
cars are we going to buy uh in this case
 
01:39:56.510 --> 01:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
it would apply for example to
 
01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:05.790 --> 01:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
state okay other other questions not
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
seeing any thank you representative
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:58.470 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:40:58.470 --> 01:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:00.189 --> 01:41:00.199 align:start position:0%
you should turn your microphone on
 
01:41:02.669 --> 01:41:02.679 align:start position:0%
please no if blue or red was
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
on thank you madam chair and Edna
 
01:41:08.790 --> 01:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
committee members um I'm John Gage from
 
01:41:12.270 --> 01:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
Windam I support this bill
 
01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm the volunteer New Hampshire State
 
01:41:17.589 --> 01:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
coordinator with a group called citizens
 
01:41:20.550 --> 01:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
climate Lobby um I've been the state
 
01:41:24.030 --> 01:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
coordinator for six years and we working
 
01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
to create political will to enable
 
01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
Congress to pass
 
01:41:29.229 --> 01:41:29.239 align:start position:0%
bipartisan carbon fee and dividend
 
01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
legislation um The Economist statement
 
01:41:35.310 --> 01:41:35.320 align:start position:0%
describes the policy that we are uh
 
01:41:37.870 --> 01:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
proposing the the federal government to
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
it is a steadily Rising carbon fee on
 
01:41:43.149 --> 01:41:43.159 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel producers and importers all
 
01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
the money is rebated back to households
 
01:41:47.790 --> 01:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
as an equal per capita dividend each
 
01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
month and a border adjustment so we can
 
01:41:52.430 --> 01:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
charge our price on imports from free
 
01:41:55.270 --> 01:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
polluting countries the reason that that
 
01:41:57.189 --> 01:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
Mr Gage would be a national policy
 
01:41:58.870 --> 01:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
correct that would be a national policy
 
01:42:00.310 --> 01:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
we're not proposing to do that in New
 
01:42:02.910 --> 01:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you um the reason you do
 
01:42:04.470 --> 01:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
it at the national level is because of
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
trade because you can if you have a
 
01:42:09.550 --> 01:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
price on pollution in your own economy
 
01:42:12.229 --> 01:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
you can charge at the border a carbon
 
01:42:14.830 --> 01:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
import tariff and in fact the treasury
 
01:42:19.109 --> 01:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
secretary that was just
 
01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
um um Trump had nominated and it was
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
just uh confirmed by
 
01:42:28.350 --> 01:42:28.360 align:start position:0%
a strong majority in the Senate um has
 
01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
is very interested in using a border
 
01:42:34.830 --> 01:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
import carbon tariff um because we can
 
01:42:36.750 --> 01:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
charge dirtier polluting countries for
 
01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
their pollution um at the border so that
 
01:42:43.830 --> 01:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
that will raise the cost of goods from
 
01:42:48.109 --> 01:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
China and India and Russia um so but
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
we're not here to talk about what I do
 
01:42:52.189 --> 01:42:52.199 align:start position:0%
at the federal level but by my
 
01:42:54.629 --> 01:42:54.639 align:start position:0%
volunteering with this group group I
 
01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
have developed some insights about
 
01:42:58.350 --> 01:42:58.360 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the world that I like
 
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
to share with you I didn't save a copy
 
01:43:01.470 --> 01:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
so I'm not going to be able to tell the
 
01:43:03.390 --> 01:43:03.400 align:start position:0%
page numbers
 
01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
um there's a graph of carbon prices that
 
01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
the ipcc has set to meet the Paris
 
01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
targets um it's the first large graph in
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
yeah it's on the back of the first page
 
01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
minimum carbon price required to hold
 
01:43:31.589 --> 01:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
global warming to 1 and a half degrees
 
01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:34.719 align:start position:0%
versus the actual price of just a small
 
01:43:35.950 --> 01:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
sample of countries that are pricing
 
01:43:40.109 --> 01:43:40.119 align:start position:0%
carbon or not the US EU and Canada the
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
gry line comes from an ipcc report um
 
01:43:45.310 --> 01:43:45.320 align:start position:0%
called the special report on global
 
01:43:48.750 --> 01:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
warming of 1.5 which specifies The
 
01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
Economist estimate for a price range
 
01:43:54.589 --> 01:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
that's necessary to meet the target so
 
01:43:57.070 --> 01:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
the gry line is the bottom of the price
 
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
range the top of the price range is much
 
01:44:02.910 --> 01:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
higher um because it depends on what
 
01:44:04.750 --> 01:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
other complimentary policies are put
 
01:44:07.070 --> 01:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
into place in order to meet the
 
01:44:10.750 --> 01:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
pollution reduction targets so what we
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
did for this bill was we just said
 
01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
okay the every country in the world
 
01:44:18.390 --> 01:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
committed to holding warming to 1 and a
 
01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
half degrees and many of them are
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
listening to economists and following
 
01:44:27.510 --> 01:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
the recommended price path for
 
01:44:30.270 --> 01:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
carbon we're going to somewhere higher
 
01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
Switzerland is actually much higher than
 
01:44:34.669 --> 01:44:34.679 align:start position:0%
the minimum but the EU and Canada are
 
01:44:36.990 --> 01:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
pretty much on track on that minimum
 
01:44:39.790 --> 01:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
price range the reason that the us is
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
going to start carrying is they are
 
01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
going to charge us uh a free polluting
 
01:44:49.229 --> 01:44:49.239 align:start position:0%
country uh for our pollution when we
 
01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
export goods into those markets so that
 
01:44:53.790 --> 01:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
it's called the
 
01:44:56.430 --> 01:44:56.440 align:start position:0%
carbon border adjustment mechanism and
 
01:44:58.510 --> 01:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
there's different ways of doing it but
 
01:45:01.350 --> 01:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
the E the acronym is cbam and it's just
 
01:45:04.669 --> 01:45:04.679 align:start position:0%
a lot easier to say so a cbam is an
 
01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
import tariff on carbon emissions so the
 
01:45:13.109 --> 01:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
EU cbam starts next year we us exporters
 
01:45:15.070 --> 01:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
uh that are exporting Goods into the U
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
Market will have to start paying um the
 
01:45:20.350 --> 01:45:20.360 align:start position:0%
EU carbon price um at the border so that
 
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
our goods sold in that economy reflect
 
01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
the same cost on pollution that Goods
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
produced in the EU automatically
 
01:45:32.910 --> 01:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
reflect um so when China learned that
 
01:45:35.229 --> 01:45:35.239 align:start position:0%
the EU was going to do this China does
 
01:45:37.589 --> 01:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
price carbon in their industrial sector
 
01:45:40.030 --> 01:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
but not in their steel production um
 
01:45:41.629 --> 01:45:41.639 align:start position:0%
they started looking into moving steel
 
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
production into their carbon Market
 
01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
because carbon pricing is the most
 
01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
cost-effective way to reduce carbon
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
pollution um other countries are
 
01:45:54.430 --> 01:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
following the EU the UK starts its cbam
 
01:45:56.669 --> 01:45:56.679 align:start position:0%
in 2020
 
01:46:01.589 --> 01:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
2027 um Japan starts its cbam in
 
01:46:05.709 --> 01:46:05.719 align:start position:0%
2028 okay so let's take a look at this
 
01:46:09.629 --> 01:46:09.639 align:start position:0%
world graph picture this shows about a
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
quarter of the fossil fuels sold in the
 
01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
world are already under some carbon
 
01:46:17.470 --> 01:46:17.480 align:start position:0%
price and the US is actually the only
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
developed country which does not price
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
carbon um there's a graph
 
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
showing uh figure five on the last page
 
01:46:31.390 --> 01:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
at the bottom the expansion of carbon
 
01:46:34.109 --> 01:46:34.119 align:start position:0%
pricing around the world and the percent
 
01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
of uh carbon emissions that are being
 
01:46:40.030 --> 01:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
priced um so it started in 1990 very
 
01:46:44.669 --> 01:46:44.679 align:start position:0%
small percentage but today it's nearly
 
01:46:48.149 --> 01:46:48.159 align:start position:0%
25% and prices are rising as we saw from
 
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
that ipcc Gray Line going up these
 
01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
countries are not just pricing carbon
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
but their prices are rising there's
 
01:46:58.270 --> 01:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
there's graphs showing um select
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
countries prices rising so I think the
 
01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
picture I want to paint in your mind is
 
01:47:05.470 --> 01:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
that carbon pricing is spreading around
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
the world prices are rising and C bams
 
01:47:14.270 --> 01:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
are coming now businesses in the US are
 
01:47:17.109 --> 01:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
anticipating a federal carbon price by
 
01:47:18.990 --> 01:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
using proxy carbon
 
01:47:22.149 --> 01:47:22.159 align:start position:0%
pricing um both to reduce their
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
emissions but also uh as a risk
 
01:47:27.390 --> 01:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
management um
 
01:47:31.950 --> 01:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
tactic um people in you
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
know the at the federal level it's kind
 
01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
of accepted that we have to praise
 
01:47:38.790 --> 01:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
carbon it's also accepted that it's
 
01:47:40.430 --> 01:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
going to be very difficult for the US to
 
01:47:42.669 --> 01:47:42.679 align:start position:0%
price carbon so what I do as a volunteer
 
01:47:44.589 --> 01:47:44.599 align:start position:0%
is I work to educate people about good
 
01:47:46.589 --> 01:47:46.599 align:start position:0%
policies if you return the money back to
 
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
people we all come out ahead we need to
 
01:47:51.310 --> 01:47:51.320 align:start position:0%
do it um but businesses are going to be
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
more and more forc pushing the
 
01:47:54.430 --> 01:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
government to do
 
01:47:57.510 --> 01:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
it so what you know why don't we do this
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
at the federal level not the state level
 
01:48:01.390 --> 01:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
yes exactly we need to price carbon at
 
01:48:04.109 --> 01:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
the federal level so why are we bother
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
bothering talking about it at the state
 
01:48:08.709 --> 01:48:08.719 align:start position:0%
level because by anticipating a future
 
01:48:10.910 --> 01:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
carbon price at the federal level we can
 
01:48:13.390 --> 01:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
save New Hampshire taxpayer
 
01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
dollars if we're going to buy a heating
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
system for a new State Building we have
 
01:48:22.030 --> 01:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
a choice um and if if you look at the
 
01:48:25.870 --> 01:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
cost of a heat pump versus a gas boiler
 
01:48:28.629 --> 01:48:28.639 align:start position:0%
um and then the life cycle cost of
 
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
operating the thing over the 20 or 30
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
years that the equipment will be there
 
01:48:36.430 --> 01:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
so this bill doesn't change your initial
 
01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
cost estimate of how much it costs to do
 
01:48:41.390 --> 01:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
a heat pump versus a gas boiler it's
 
01:48:45.669 --> 01:48:45.679 align:start position:0%
just the price but this carbon price gap
 
01:48:48.830 --> 01:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
which we anticipate coming at us from
 
01:48:51.430 --> 01:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
above in the future is what we want to
 
01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
add into the total life cycle cost of
 
01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
each of the options so for a heat pump
 
01:48:59.109 --> 01:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
there is no additional cost uh from a
 
01:49:02.990 --> 01:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
carbon price um for a gas boiler there's
 
01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
going to be a certain additional price
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
for the fuel each
 
01:49:10.149 --> 01:49:10.159 align:start position:0%
year that I feel the state should
 
01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
anticipate because it's highly likely uh
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
that it will happen at some point in the
 
01:49:18.589 --> 01:49:18.599 align:start position:0%
next 10 years or less and so we're I'm
 
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
just trying to save people New Hampshire
 
01:49:23.390 --> 01:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money
 
01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:25.679 align:start position:0%
by sharing the Insight that I've learned
 
01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
as a volunteer working at the federal
 
01:49:30.270 --> 01:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
level to price carbon um about what's
 
01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
happening around the world uh and even
 
01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
in Congress
 
01:49:37.350 --> 01:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
um Congress came very close to pricing
 
01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
carbon two years ago um it was one vote
 
01:49:43.629 --> 01:49:43.639 align:start position:0%
shy of including a carbon fee and
 
01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
dividend in the inflation reduction act
 
01:49:46.990 --> 01:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
that passed in
 
01:49:50.430 --> 01:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
20122 came very close um and political
 
01:49:52.750 --> 01:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
will is growing we're we're going to
 
01:49:55.790 --> 01:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
keep working on this until it happens so
 
01:49:59.709 --> 01:49:59.719 align:start position:0%
so I had a couple answers for questions
 
01:50:03.109 --> 01:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
uh yeah adjusted FL for inflation so
 
01:50:03.119 --> 01:50:04.750 align:start position:0%
uh yeah adjusted FL for inflation so
$100

01:50:04.750 --> 01:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
$100
 
01:50:10.189 --> 01:50:10.199 align:start position:0%
today um is not equal to $100 in 2010 so
 
01:50:12.189 --> 01:50:12.199 align:start position:0%
all of the prices that are listed here
 
01:50:16.390 --> 01:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
are $210 so even the starting price
 
01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
$85 that would be $85 in 2010 so we'd
 
01:50:21.550 --> 01:50:21.560 align:start position:0%
have to adjust it for inflation to to
 
01:50:24.189 --> 01:50:24.199 align:start position:0%
know what the real start prices and then
 
01:50:26.270 --> 01:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
so the the whole thing is adjusted for
 
01:50:29.470 --> 01:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
inflation um as far as staff
 
01:50:32.070 --> 01:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
considerations I can't imagine anybody
 
01:50:34.149 --> 01:50:34.159 align:start position:0%
this is just adding one more light item
 
01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
in calculations that already been done
 
01:50:38.910 --> 01:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
just adding in a dollar amount which is
 
01:50:41.229 --> 01:50:41.239 align:start position:0%
very easy to calculate for the price of
 
01:50:45.870 --> 01:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
gas diesel or gasoline um over the over
 
01:50:47.470 --> 01:50:47.480 align:start position:0%
you know they know when they buy a
 
01:50:48.990 --> 01:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle about how much gas it's going to
 
01:50:51.430 --> 01:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
burn in its life cycle so you just add
 
01:50:54.790 --> 01:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
extra cost in
 
01:50:59.750 --> 01:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
um why now because the European cbam is
 
01:51:02.109 --> 01:51:02.119 align:start position:0%
starting next year uh so this has been
 
01:51:05.950 --> 01:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
developing for you know 10 years um but
 
01:51:07.669 --> 01:51:07.679 align:start position:0%
we're really seeing things happening in
 
01:51:10.910 --> 01:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
the US was trying to get around the EU
 
01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
cbam um for the last couple years and
 
01:51:14.669 --> 01:51:14.679 align:start position:0%
they have been unable to do it we're
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
going to our exporters are going to
 
01:51:17.950 --> 01:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
start paying this money next year so we
 
01:51:19.589 --> 01:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
have confidence that you know this is
 
01:51:23.069 --> 01:51:23.079 align:start position:0%
really a real thing um just to give you
 
01:51:26.750 --> 01:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
an idea for an example $10 per ton of
 
01:51:30.510 --> 01:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
CO2 adds about 10 cents in a gallon of
 
01:51:34.990 --> 01:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
gas so we're anticipating you know gas
 
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
will will add 85 cents per gallon of gas
 
01:51:40.870 --> 01:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
when it starts and then we'll add 10
 
01:51:43.709 --> 01:51:43.719 align:start position:0%
cents more per gallon of gas um each
 
01:51:46.030 --> 01:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
year after that so they just have to add
 
01:51:48.830 --> 01:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
a little extra cost in the total life
 
01:51:51.510 --> 01:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
cycle cost of a gasoline car
 
01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
Option electric vehicle there's no
 
01:51:57.350 --> 01:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
additional cost um for for carbon
 
01:52:00.149 --> 01:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
pricing so it just tips the balance
 
01:52:05.470 --> 01:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
toward heat pumps and electric vehicles
 
01:52:09.310 --> 01:52:09.320 align:start position:0%
um you know not severely um but there's
 
01:52:11.790 --> 01:52:11.800 align:start position:0%
a reason that we're doing this um to
 
01:52:14.550 --> 01:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
anticipate a future carbon price and
 
01:52:17.629 --> 01:52:17.639 align:start position:0%
hundreds of countries hundreds of us
 
01:52:21.750 --> 01:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
businesses and um states and cities are
 
01:52:25.470 --> 01:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
doing it on the first page followed
 
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
following and going on to the second
 
01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
page um there's a list of
 
01:52:35.910 --> 01:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
um for example the Minnesota pu is using
 
01:52:38.830 --> 01:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
proxy carbon pricing when it is deciding
 
01:52:40.109 --> 01:52:40.119 align:start position:0%
on energy
 
01:52:42.669 --> 01:52:42.679 align:start position:0%
projects and and others are doing the
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
same thing so this is a thing that other
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
states are doing uh to anticipate a
 
01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
future carbon price so that they don't
 
01:52:50.470 --> 01:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
get stuck with stranded assets and waste
 
01:52:54.109 --> 01:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars thank you did you
 
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you madam
 
01:52:58.189 --> 01:52:58.199 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you Mr Gage um I think
 
01:53:00.189 --> 01:53:00.199 align:start position:0%
you might be uniquely suited to answer
 
01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
this question um sorry I'm going to give
 
01:53:05.430 --> 01:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
you sort of a two-part one is this
 
01:53:07.149 --> 01:53:07.159 align:start position:0%
really why my mom's paying a dollar more
 
01:53:09.709 --> 01:53:09.719 align:start position:0%
in gas in California than we are here
 
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
but the one that you're most suited for
 
01:53:14.109 --> 01:53:14.119 align:start position:0%
is um could you tell us what the actual
 
01:53:17.870 --> 01:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
price on January 1st 2026 for this $85 a
 
01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
ton would be based on this 2010
 
01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:23.430 align:start position:0%
ton would be based on this 2010
valuation

01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:26.750 --> 01:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
okay so um I don't I don't pretend to
 
01:53:29.189 --> 01:53:29.199 align:start position:0%
understand California's energy markets
 
01:53:31.470 --> 01:53:31.480 align:start position:0%
um they do have a cap and trade system
 
01:53:33.629 --> 01:53:33.639 align:start position:0%
in California but as the last I heard it
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
was something like $35 per ton of CO2 so
 
01:53:39.750 --> 01:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
that would be adding it's actually n
 
01:53:42.390 --> 01:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
cents per gallon but 10 cents is 10
 
01:53:44.669 --> 01:53:44.679 align:start position:0%
cents per for each $10 is easier to
 
01:53:48.109 --> 01:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
calculate so I'd as I'd guess 35 cents
 
01:53:50.830 --> 01:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
more per gallon because of the carbon
 
01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
price but some reason regions actually
 
01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
exclude gasoline from their carbon
 
01:54:00.310 --> 01:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
Market um which um I'm I'm pretty sure
 
01:54:02.629 --> 01:54:02.639 align:start position:0%
California the cap in trade doesn't
 
01:54:04.750 --> 01:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
cover gasoline I I think that's just for
 
01:54:07.629 --> 01:54:07.639 align:start position:0%
electricity generation but I'm I'm not
 
01:54:08.830 --> 01:54:08.840 align:start position:0%
not totally
 
01:54:11.390 --> 01:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
sure and you didn't have the price for
 
01:54:14.790 --> 01:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
the $85 today based on those $20 because
 
01:54:17.310 --> 01:54:17.320 align:start position:0%
I thought you said it was simple it is
 
01:54:19.550 --> 01:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
simple but you need some information in
 
01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
front of you to make the calculation all
 
01:54:24.750 --> 01:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
you need to know is how much inflation
 
01:54:27.950 --> 01:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
was there between 2010 and today so
 
01:54:31.069 --> 01:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
let's say it was 100% uh inflation I
 
01:54:34.069 --> 01:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
know it wasn't but it's so anyway the
 
01:54:37.149 --> 01:54:37.159 align:start position:0%
answer is you don't know right now yes
 
01:54:38.470 --> 01:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
thank you it would be easy to figure out
 
01:54:40.990 --> 01:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
if I knew the inflation number uh thank
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so looking at
 
01:54:45.470 --> 01:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
the map that you provided it's a little
 
01:54:48.189 --> 01:54:48.199 align:start position:0%
bit difficult to read it I know that it
 
01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
says Massachusetts is one of the states
 
01:54:52.669 --> 01:54:52.679 align:start position:0%
that has uh adopted a similar Poli polic
 
01:54:54.750 --> 01:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
it looks like Maine as well could you
 
01:54:56.950 --> 01:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
just kind of clarify what surrounding
 
01:54:59.109 --> 01:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
states in New England uh have adopted
 
01:54:59.119 --> 01:55:00.350 align:start position:0%
states in New England uh have adopted
similar

01:55:00.350 --> 01:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
similar
 
01:55:03.709 --> 01:55:03.719 align:start position:0%
policies sure um yeah we we have a
 
01:55:07.350 --> 01:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
carbon price here actually um the
 
01:55:11.149 --> 01:55:11.159 align:start position:0%
northeast states um are uh involved in
 
01:55:13.310 --> 01:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
the regional greenhouse gas initiative
 
01:55:17.229 --> 01:55:17.239 align:start position:0%
regie and this is a CPP and trade system
 
01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:18.719 align:start position:0%
that was set up a little more than 10
 
01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
years ago to put a price on carbon
 
01:55:25.229 --> 01:55:25.239 align:start position:0%
emissions from electricity generators
 
01:55:28.510 --> 01:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
so uh I don't know if we have the Reggie
 
01:55:30.790 --> 01:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
price in one of these charts it depends
 
01:55:32.669 --> 01:55:32.679 align:start position:0%
on the year uh yeah it does so the
 
01:55:35.470 --> 01:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
Reggie shows up on
 
01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
um a page that has two graphs on it it's
 
01:55:42.550 --> 01:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
on the bottom um regie has a very small
 
01:55:44.910 --> 01:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
carbon price for for a long time it was
 
01:55:48.990 --> 01:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
about $5 per ton of CO2 uh it crept up
 
01:55:52.350 --> 01:55:52.360 align:start position:0%
close to $15 per ton last time I looked
 
01:55:55.550 --> 01:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
uh last year um so but that's just for
 
01:55:59.470 --> 01:55:59.480 align:start position:0%
power generators and um so each state
 
01:56:00.910 --> 01:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
gets to decide what to do with that
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
money New Hampshire returns most of it
 
01:56:04.430 --> 01:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
in the form of a rebate in the
 
01:56:10.189 --> 01:56:10.199 align:start position:0%
electricity bill um a dollar of per ton
 
01:56:12.589 --> 01:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
uh is actually used to fund some Energy
 
01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:19.870 --> 01:56:19.880 align:start position:0%
offers the questions representative
 
01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
long do you have any data on what our
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
total energy usage as a state government
 
01:56:28.990 --> 01:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
is right now and what it's projected to
 
01:56:30.270 --> 01:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
be in the
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
future um I can take some guesses I
 
01:56:35.229 --> 01:56:35.239 align:start position:0%
haven't been paying a lot of attention
 
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
I've heard $6 billion dollar a year is
 
01:56:39.470 --> 01:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
spent on energy in New Hampshire and
 
01:56:40.709 --> 01:56:40.719 align:start position:0%
something like four and a half billion
 
01:56:44.669 --> 01:56:44.679 align:start position:0%
of that is on fossil fuel energy um you
 
01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639 align:start position:0%
know if you look at our economy that
 
01:56:49.709 --> 01:56:49.719 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars going to um fossil
 
01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
fuel producing but that's the state not
 
01:56:55.790 --> 01:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
the state government oh sorry um you I
 
01:56:58.510 --> 01:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
didn't catch that part no I do not um
 
01:57:02.229 --> 01:57:02.239 align:start position:0%
but you know every vehicle so I just did
 
01:57:04.589 --> 01:57:04.599 align:start position:0%
this in my personal life my furnace died
 
01:57:06.669 --> 01:57:06.679 align:start position:0%
in April I needed to replace the heating
 
01:57:10.350 --> 01:57:10.360 align:start position:0%
machine in my building uh and my car
 
01:57:13.709 --> 01:57:13.719 align:start position:0%
died and I need to to get to replace it
 
01:57:16.870 --> 01:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
I did all the numbers and it was um
 
01:57:19.069 --> 01:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
because I have forced hot water I ended
 
01:57:21.430 --> 01:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
up buying an oil furnace um but also
 
01:57:24.550 --> 01:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
investing energy efficiency um for
 
01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
transportation um I bought an EV um
 
01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
because the the break even um saving
 
01:57:35.229 --> 01:57:35.239 align:start position:0%
money um part is just it was like four
 
01:57:38.910 --> 01:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
or five years out it I I paid more for
 
01:57:41.470 --> 01:57:41.480 align:start position:0%
the vehicle up front but I will save
 
01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
money um per mile um you know over the
 
01:57:46.870 --> 01:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
life cycle of the
 
01:57:50.069 --> 01:57:50.079 align:start position:0%
car so this you know the state will save
 
01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
money I can't tell you how much but if
 
01:57:53.589 --> 01:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
they do this and then carbon pricing
 
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
happens at the federal level we'll save
 
01:57:58.470 --> 01:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
significant money um if it doesn't
 
01:58:01.229 --> 01:58:01.239 align:start position:0%
happen then we will just be a little
 
01:58:03.550 --> 01:58:03.560 align:start position:0%
cleaner um than we would have been but
 
01:58:06.430 --> 01:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
we will generally often save money
 
01:58:08.189 --> 01:58:08.199 align:start position:0%
anyway for some of these
 
01:58:10.510 --> 01:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
things thank you
 
01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
followup yeah so I guess if I'm
 
01:58:15.390 --> 01:58:15.400 align:start position:0%
understanding both this bill and current
 
01:58:18.069 --> 01:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
policy correctly there one way they both
 
01:58:19.830 --> 01:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
differ from what I would consider
 
01:58:22.830 --> 01:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
standard business practice is
 
01:58:24.390 --> 01:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
that you know if I were dealing with
 
01:58:26.709 --> 01:58:26.719 align:start position:0%
conditions of uncertainty uh as there is
 
01:58:28.669 --> 01:58:28.679 align:start position:0%
with the possibility of carbon
 
01:58:31.109 --> 01:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
pricing uh you know I wouldn't really
 
01:58:34.189 --> 01:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
consider the cost straight yes or no I'd
 
01:58:36.589 --> 01:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
try to get a probability estimate and a
 
01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
worst case scenario
 
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
estimate um does it make sense to do
 
01:58:45.430 --> 01:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
something like that uh instead of just a
 
01:58:49.589 --> 01:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
straight up you know this is the cost
 
01:58:53.149 --> 01:58:53.159 align:start position:0%
estimate yeah the bill has two
 
01:58:56.589 --> 01:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
um outcomes one is it determines the
 
01:58:59.229 --> 01:58:59.239 align:start position:0%
decision that's made and the state does
 
01:59:01.470 --> 01:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
the purchase based on this another is
 
01:59:04.189 --> 01:59:04.199 align:start position:0%
that the decision is reported
 
01:59:08.910 --> 01:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
so they report on you know why they made
 
01:59:13.229 --> 01:59:13.239 align:start position:0%
the decision to to go with something if
 
01:59:15.430 --> 01:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
their mind was changed uh because of
 
01:59:17.069 --> 01:59:17.079 align:start position:0%
this carbon price it would be reported
 
01:59:19.990 --> 01:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
so uh you could just do the reporting
 
01:59:22.669 --> 01:59:22.679 align:start position:0%
side um I don't think the paperwork to
 
01:59:24.950 --> 01:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
do this is is very intensive it would be
 
01:59:27.510 --> 01:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
just one more line item in the in the
 
01:59:30.510 --> 01:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
total life cycle cost of these things
 
01:59:32.589 --> 01:59:32.599 align:start position:0%
the downside of just doing this on paper
 
01:59:35.709 --> 01:59:35.719 align:start position:0%
is it's like having a good idea about a
 
01:59:38.270 --> 01:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
stock and not buying it but tracking it
 
01:59:40.510 --> 01:59:40.520 align:start position:0%
for the next two years and then if it's
 
01:59:43.830 --> 01:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
gone up times 10 two years from now um
 
01:59:45.149 --> 01:59:45.159 align:start position:0%
all you know is that you could have
 
01:59:47.430 --> 01:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
saved your you could have made some
 
01:59:50.109 --> 01:59:50.119 align:start position:0%
money you didn't actually make the money
 
01:59:53.350 --> 01:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
so I don't know that it would really
 
01:59:55.550 --> 01:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
help to just do the paperwork if we're
 
01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
not going to make the decisions based on
 
01:59:59.589 --> 01:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
it but you're right risk management is
 
02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
why companies do this they maybe you
 
02:00:05.910 --> 02:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
know so this is a very minimum necessary
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
price to meet our climate goals uh I
 
02:00:12.189 --> 02:00:12.199 align:start position:0%
suspect at some point the price will go
 
02:00:14.950 --> 02:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
have to go well above the Gray Line uh
 
02:00:17.189 --> 02:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
so this is already a pretty conservative
 
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
price to be making your decisions on
 
02:00:24.030 --> 02:00:24.040 align:start position:0%
followup I just want to clarify my
 
02:00:25.750 --> 02:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
question because I wasn't
 
02:00:29.430 --> 02:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
suggesting just doing the paperwork to
 
02:00:32.030 --> 02:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
you have the information available what
 
02:00:34.990 --> 02:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
I was suggesting is something more like
 
02:00:37.390 --> 02:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
you know if I thought there was a 5050
 
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
chance of a carbon pricing being adopted
 
02:00:44.350 --> 02:00:44.360 align:start position:0%
and it would be $150 a ton then instead
 
02:00:46.830 --> 02:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
of saying the cost of this is zero
 
02:00:49.310 --> 02:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't exist yet or it's 150
 
02:00:50.229 --> 02:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
because I think that's what it's going
 
02:00:52.390 --> 02:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
to be then from a business perspective
 
02:00:54.629 --> 02:00:54.639 align:start position:0%
what I would do is I would estimate it
 
02:00:58.950 --> 02:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
at $75 a ton but then also you know
 
02:01:02.109 --> 02:01:02.119 align:start position:0%
consider the 150 as a worst case
 
02:01:05.830 --> 02:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
scenario um but I I would most likely
 
02:01:08.030 --> 02:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
make my purchasing decision using that
 
02:01:10.030 --> 02:01:10.040 align:start position:0%
$75 a ton
 
02:01:15.390 --> 02:01:15.400 align:start position:0%
number uh because that seems like the
 
02:01:18.510 --> 02:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
overall best likely to produce the most
 
02:01:20.750 --> 02:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
value for that purchasing decision so
 
02:01:22.350 --> 02:01:22.360 align:start position:0%
does it make sense to do something like
 
02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
that for State
 
02:01:25.709 --> 02:01:25.719 align:start position:0%
procurement that's a good question I
 
02:01:26.990 --> 02:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
think you'd probably want to talk to a
 
02:01:28.750 --> 02:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
state Economist or something to figure
 
02:01:31.870 --> 02:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
out I'm not a business person I was in
 
02:01:34.510 --> 02:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
computer software engineering for 30
 
02:01:36.750 --> 02:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
years and now I'm learning about energy
 
02:01:39.750 --> 02:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
policy but I know Exxon runs two sets of
 
02:01:41.830 --> 02:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
books and I think a lot of companies do
 
02:01:44.750 --> 02:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
this also one with a proxy carbon price
 
02:01:47.790 --> 02:01:47.800 align:start position:0%
and one was prices as they are I don't
 
02:01:50.189 --> 02:01:50.199 align:start position:0%
know if when they make decisions where
 
02:01:52.990 --> 02:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
in the spectrum they choose to go they
 
02:01:55.270 --> 02:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
could go halfway in between they could
 
02:01:57.310 --> 02:01:57.320 align:start position:0%
think that carbon pricing is less likely
 
02:02:01.350 --> 02:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
now um so maybe they down they they go
 
02:02:04.069 --> 02:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
closer to just actual prices thank you
 
02:02:05.870 --> 02:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
gentlemen but I don't really think we
 
02:02:08.629 --> 02:02:08.639 align:start position:0%
should speculate on what organizations
 
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
we know very little about are actually
 
02:02:13.669 --> 02:02:13.679 align:start position:0%
doing I don't see anybody here from the
 
02:02:16.109 --> 02:02:16.119 align:start position:0%
state procurement office to talk about
 
02:02:19.189 --> 02:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
what they actually do regarding Future
 
02:02:22.669 --> 02:02:22.679 align:start position:0%
Energy prices and we would need to know
 
02:02:26.350 --> 02:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
that to consider offering them
 
02:02:29.109 --> 02:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
advice are there any other
 
02:02:31.550 --> 02:02:31.560 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing none thank
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
you there's nobody else here to testify
 
02:02:35.950 --> 02:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to close the public
 
02:02:50.830 --> 02:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:50.840 --> 02:03:20.750 align:start position:0%

03:04:34.750 --> 03:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
established uh back in the
 
03:04:37.830 --> 03:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
1990s uh there's a state Service
 
03:04:41.429 --> 03:04:41.439 align:start position:0%
Commission in every state um it receives
 
03:04:43.389 --> 03:04:43.399 align:start position:0%
no State
 
03:04:46.990 --> 03:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
funding uh and really supports the
 
03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:48.229 align:start position:0%
funding uh and really supports the
infrastructure

03:04:48.229 --> 03:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
03:04:50.990 --> 03:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
of uh civilian national service programs
 
03:04:54.150 --> 03:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
like americore uh as well as uh just
 
03:04:56.710 --> 03:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
community-based volunteering across the
 
03:05:01.030 --> 03:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
state um we are a state that is uh
 
03:05:04.269 --> 03:05:04.279 align:start position:0%
operated our presence here in this room
 
03:05:05.389 --> 03:05:05.399 align:start position:0%
uh we all know how important
 
03:05:07.309 --> 03:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
volunteerism is in the state of New
 
03:05:09.150 --> 03:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh volunteer New Hampshire
 
03:05:12.510 --> 03:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
provides a catalyst uh and support for
 
03:05:14.950 --> 03:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh volunteer organizations mostly uh
 
03:05:17.030 --> 03:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
nonprofit and public sector
 
03:05:19.469 --> 03:05:19.479 align:start position:0%
organizations that are leveraging uh
 
03:05:20.990 --> 03:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
volunteer power to make a difference in
 
03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:21.910 align:start position:0%
volunteer power to make a difference in
the

03:05:21.910 --> 03:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:05:25.790 --> 03:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
community so back in
 
03:05:30.750 --> 03:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
2020 I guess it was 2019 uh there was a
 
03:05:33.349 --> 03:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
commission to study career Pathways from
 
03:05:36.070 --> 03:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
full-time service year programs to
 
03:05:37.990 --> 03:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
postsecondary education and employment
 
03:05:41.349 --> 03:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh and I can provide
 
03:05:44.030 --> 03:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
the committee with uh a copy of the
 
03:05:45.590 --> 03:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
final report and
 
03:05:49.110 --> 03:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh but really the the
 
03:05:53.030 --> 03:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
focus was how do we attract and retain
 
03:05:54.870 --> 03:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh more young people who are
 
03:05:57.269 --> 03:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
community-minded and service driven who
 
03:05:59.670 --> 03:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
have a track record of that uh how do we
 
03:06:00.950 --> 03:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
keep them here so that they are
 
03:06:04.309 --> 03:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
contributing members uh of our Workforce
 
03:06:07.309 --> 03:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
moving forward um there were several
 
03:06:09.150 --> 03:06:09.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations that were in the final
 
03:06:12.309 --> 03:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
report including uh beefing up americore
 
03:06:15.030 --> 03:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
schools of service which matches uh the
 
03:06:16.990 --> 03:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
education award that americore alumni
 
03:06:18.190 --> 03:06:18.200 align:start position:0%
received when they
 
03:06:20.229 --> 03:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
finish their their full-time year of
 
03:06:22.229 --> 03:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
service uh which is equal to about the
 
03:06:23.790 --> 03:06:23.800 align:start position:0%
pel grants so it's it's it's
 
03:06:27.750 --> 03:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
approximately six or $7,000 a year um
 
03:06:29.830 --> 03:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
institutions of higher ed in the state
 
03:06:34.550 --> 03:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
could match uh that $7,000 so it becomes
 
03:06:37.070 --> 03:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
$144,000 um which makes it much more
 
03:06:38.910 --> 03:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
appealing for a young person to say yes
 
03:06:42.750 --> 03:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
I want to stay in New Hampshire uh to to
 
03:06:46.389 --> 03:06:46.399 align:start position:0%
pursue my future career goals um there's
 
03:06:49.070 --> 03:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
also a program called
 
03:06:51.510 --> 03:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
um uh called employers for national
 
03:06:56.110 --> 03:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
service which is an opt-in program uh no
 
03:06:58.830 --> 03:06:58.840 align:start position:0%
cash involved at all but uh basically
 
03:07:01.670 --> 03:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
public private and nonprofit employers
 
03:07:04.389 --> 03:07:04.399 align:start position:0%
uh opt in and say we really value uh the
 
03:07:06.349 --> 03:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
type of experience that someone who has
 
03:07:07.870 --> 03:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
done one of these service
 
03:07:11.190 --> 03:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
programs um and we want to make sure
 
03:07:13.790 --> 03:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
that we are prioritizing them uh when
 
03:07:16.630 --> 03:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
they are applying for a job and so these
 
03:07:20.269 --> 03:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
are just two examples of the types of
 
03:07:22.750 --> 03:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
national programs that are out there uh
 
03:07:24.550 --> 03:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
that don't have a large presence here in
 
03:07:26.429 --> 03:07:26.439 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and the the
 
03:07:30.910 --> 03:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill uh is to uh create a
 
03:07:33.269 --> 03:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
new position at volunteer New Hampshire
 
03:07:34.990 --> 03:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
uh that can work on these types of
 
03:07:38.950 --> 03:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
initiatives uh to build out uh that post
 
03:07:38.960 --> 03:07:40.469 align:start position:0%
initiatives uh to build out uh that post
service

03:07:40.469 --> 03:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
service
 
03:07:42.870 --> 03:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
um Post Service infrastructure within
 
03:07:46.710 --> 03:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
the state uh so that more institutions
 
03:07:49.670 --> 03:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
of higher ed are taking advantage of the
 
03:07:51.389 --> 03:07:51.399 align:start position:0%
human capital that exists in these
 
03:07:55.469 --> 03:07:55.479 align:start position:0%
alumni uh as well as employers uh and so
 
03:08:00.229 --> 03:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
I think the fiscal note uh says that in
 
03:08:04.150 --> 03:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
FYI 26 uh it' be approximately $75,000
 
03:08:07.830 --> 03:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
all in um which sounds about right to me
 
03:08:11.469 --> 03:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
and uh excited to take your
 
03:08:14.469 --> 03:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
questions thank you I have a question
 
03:08:17.030 --> 03:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
approximately how many americore and
 
03:08:20.110 --> 03:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
peace cor alumni do we have at any given
 
03:08:22.990 --> 03:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
time or come off the program any year
 
03:08:24.910 --> 03:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so on a given year um the most
 
03:08:26.630 --> 03:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
recent stats I have I think go back
 
03:08:29.349 --> 03:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
three years uh and it was
 
03:08:32.469 --> 03:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
365 uh in one year or three years in one
 
03:08:35.269 --> 03:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
year in one year okay so I can get some
 
03:08:37.269 --> 03:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
updated numbers on that um I'll send
 
03:08:38.950 --> 03:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
that over when I I follow up with the
 
03:08:42.510 --> 03:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
committee okay representative Schmidt
 
03:08:45.830 --> 03:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so uh what's the
 
03:08:48.150 --> 03:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
situation n Nationwide
 
03:08:50.550 --> 03:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative uh is this a
 
03:08:54.309 --> 03:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
common uh outcome that the states
 
03:08:56.750 --> 03:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
recognize the value that these people
 
03:09:00.790 --> 03:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
have achieved in assisting the nation's
 
03:09:04.990 --> 03:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
Mission and and so forth in in uh other
 
03:09:08.150 --> 03:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
countries or here in the United States
 
03:09:09.790 --> 03:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
and they recognize that there's a lot of
 
03:09:11.630 --> 03:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
potential in these people for public
 
03:09:14.990 --> 03:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
service and they are supporting it in
 
03:09:17.469 --> 03:09:17.479 align:start position:0%
it's the same way we're attempting to do
 
03:09:20.630 --> 03:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
here or is this a unique I'm sure it's
 
03:09:22.670 --> 03:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
not a unique thing but what is the
 
03:09:25.910 --> 03:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
situation Nationwide in this regard yeah
 
03:09:27.670 --> 03:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question representative
 
03:09:30.510 --> 03:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
the I think each state is looking at
 
03:09:32.750 --> 03:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
this differently and I think some some
 
03:09:35.750 --> 03:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
states are uh recognize the power and
 
03:09:38.229 --> 03:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
potential of connecting their national
 
03:09:41.710 --> 03:09:41.720 align:start position:0%
service alumni with uh Post Service
 
03:09:44.950 --> 03:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
Pathways uh more than others um there
 
03:09:46.510 --> 03:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
are a handful of models that we can
 
03:09:49.429 --> 03:09:49.439 align:start position:0%
point to from other States uh some you
 
03:09:51.830 --> 03:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
know create a a position that will help
 
03:09:55.469 --> 03:09:55.479 align:start position:0%
to uh oversee and support uh this type
 
03:09:58.389 --> 03:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
of work uh and then there are other uh
 
03:09:59.590 --> 03:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
states that have just been doing it
 
03:10:01.790 --> 03:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
organically where institutions of higher
 
03:10:04.070 --> 03:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
ed say this is the exact type of young
 
03:10:05.870 --> 03:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
person that we want on our campus we're
 
03:10:07.349 --> 03:10:07.359 align:start position:0%
raising our hand right now we're saying
 
03:10:10.110 --> 03:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
we want to match that education award um
 
03:10:12.630 --> 03:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
because our campus has a strong stronger
 
03:10:15.590 --> 03:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
Civic life uh as a result of those folks
 
03:10:19.269 --> 03:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
pursuing their their secondary degre so
 
03:10:21.469 --> 03:10:21.479 align:start position:0%
uh could you give us is there anything
 
03:10:23.429 --> 03:10:23.439 align:start position:0%
in writing that we can look at to see
 
03:10:27.030 --> 03:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
whether we're doing the most to exploit
 
03:10:30.469 --> 03:10:30.479 align:start position:0%
the opportunity of these young people's
 
03:10:33.190 --> 03:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh skills and dedication you bet I will
 
03:10:35.750 --> 03:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh follow up with some examples as well
 
03:10:37.510 --> 03:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
as uh some private studies that have
 
03:10:41.670 --> 03:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
been done uh that both interview uh
 
03:10:43.309 --> 03:10:43.319 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities as well as
 
03:10:45.950 --> 03:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
employers who are saying the hard skills
 
03:10:47.950 --> 03:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
and the soft skills that they
 
03:10:49.590 --> 03:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh develop over the course of their
 
03:10:53.190 --> 03:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
service experience uh are really valued
 
03:10:54.790 --> 03:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
03:10:54.800 --> 03:10:56.349 align:start position:0%
thank you very
much

03:10:56.349 --> 03:10:56.359 align:start position:0%
much
 
03:11:00.630 --> 03:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
SL uh representative hel wilham uh to
 
03:11:02.670 --> 03:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
whom does this person report how does he
 
03:11:05.670 --> 03:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
where does he fit into the world so I
 
03:11:07.630 --> 03:11:07.640 align:start position:0%
imagine that the uh position would
 
03:11:09.269 --> 03:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
report to the executive director of
 
03:11:11.750 --> 03:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
volunteer New Hampshire which uh is
 
03:11:15.469 --> 03:11:15.479 align:start position:0%
overseen by a a governor appointed um
 
03:11:15.479 --> 03:11:17.590 align:start position:0%
overseen by a a governor appointed um
Commission

03:11:17.590 --> 03:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
03:11:19.510 --> 03:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative Leon um thank you
 
03:11:20.469 --> 03:11:20.479 align:start position:0%
madam chairman and thank you for
 
03:11:22.630 --> 03:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill to us my question is
 
03:11:23.990 --> 03:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
you said that this was a federally
 
03:11:26.309 --> 03:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
funded program would this be the first
 
03:11:28.229 --> 03:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
um expenditure of State funds on
 
03:11:30.190 --> 03:11:30.200 align:start position:0%
volunteer NH or are there already State
 
03:11:32.229 --> 03:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
funds going to it my understanding is
 
03:11:35.950 --> 03:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
that aside from the ink kind um office
 
03:11:37.950 --> 03:11:37.960 align:start position:0%
space that they get as part of the State
 
03:11:40.510 --> 03:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
Office Park uh there are no State funds
 
03:11:41.870 --> 03:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
that go to volunteer New Hampshire at
 
03:11:41.880 --> 03:11:44.750 align:start position:0%
that go to volunteer New Hampshire at
this

03:11:44.750 --> 03:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:47.510 --> 03:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
time but this person would obviously L
 
03:11:49.910 --> 03:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
be a state
 
03:11:53.349 --> 03:11:53.359 align:start position:0%
employee so technically they would be a
 
03:11:55.229 --> 03:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
employee of volunteer New Hampshire
 
03:11:57.790 --> 03:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
which is a separate 501c3 nonprofit
 
03:11:59.429 --> 03:11:59.439 align:start position:0%
organization so which is why I describ
 
03:12:02.389 --> 03:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
them as a quasi governmental agency so
 
03:12:04.469 --> 03:12:04.479 align:start position:0%
these State service commissions uh are
 
03:12:07.070 --> 03:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
set up differently in different states
 
03:12:09.269 --> 03:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
um at one point this lived in the
 
03:12:10.790 --> 03:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
governor's office the state Service
 
03:12:12.950 --> 03:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
Commission volunteer New Hampshire um
 
03:12:15.190 --> 03:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
it's currently administratively attached
 
03:12:17.750 --> 03:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
Das correct
 
03:12:19.389 --> 03:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
so you actually may have a better answer
 
03:12:22.469 --> 03:12:22.479 align:start position:0%
to that question than I do
 
03:12:25.229 --> 03:12:25.239 align:start position:0%
okay represent L uh thank you Madame
 
03:12:27.670 --> 03:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
chair uh do you know if there are other
 
03:12:29.870 --> 03:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
situations where we directly fund
 
03:12:32.349 --> 03:12:32.359 align:start position:0%
employees at nonprofits as opposed to
 
03:12:34.950 --> 03:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
the sort of bulk um payment that we have
 
03:12:36.790 --> 03:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
to some of the nonprofits that then go
 
03:12:38.469 --> 03:12:38.479 align:start position:0%
ahead and hire those
 
03:12:41.910 --> 03:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
employees uh I am not aware I think that
 
03:12:43.630 --> 03:12:43.640 align:start position:0%
I think the way volunteer New Hampshire
 
03:12:46.190 --> 03:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
is set up is is pretty unique within the
 
03:12:47.790 --> 03:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
03:12:50.269 --> 03:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
um so I actually look forward to
 
03:12:52.110 --> 03:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
learning more about how exactly it would
 
03:12:53.110 --> 03:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
be funded and whether they would
 
03:12:55.389 --> 03:12:55.399 align:start position:0%
technically be a state employee or if
 
03:12:57.830 --> 03:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
they'd be an employee of the 501c3
 
03:13:00.110 --> 03:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
nonprofit well that makes a significant
 
03:13:04.830 --> 03:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:06.870 --> 03:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
benefits all right representative
 
03:13:09.910 --> 03:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you madam chair I'm trying
 
03:13:12.790 --> 03:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
to find out does this organization uh
 
03:13:15.710 --> 03:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
volunteer New Hampshire do they not work
 
03:13:18.389 --> 03:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
with this uh support group Post Service
 
03:13:19.910 --> 03:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
college right
 
03:13:23.990 --> 03:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
now so right now uh it's really up to
 
03:13:26.830 --> 03:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
employers uh you know whether it's a
 
03:13:29.870 --> 03:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
private sector or nonprofit or even the
 
03:13:31.110 --> 03:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
you know the state of New Hampshire
 
03:13:32.269 --> 03:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
could decide that they want to be part
 
03:13:34.550 --> 03:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
of employers for national service they
 
03:13:36.229 --> 03:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
would have to discover the program on
 
03:13:38.750 --> 03:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
their own and then opt in uh and so this
 
03:13:40.309 --> 03:13:40.319 align:start position:0%
is really an effort based on the
 
03:13:42.150 --> 03:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
commission's report back in
 
03:13:47.269 --> 03:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
2020 uh to build build in uh someone who
 
03:13:49.630 --> 03:13:49.640 align:start position:0%
can really coordinate those efforts uh
 
03:13:52.190 --> 03:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
so that we can recruit additional
 
03:13:54.750 --> 03:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
employers of national service as well as
 
03:13:57.510 --> 03:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh additional schools of service so
 
03:13:58.910 --> 03:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
right right now it would just be on the
 
03:14:01.469 --> 03:14:01.479 align:start position:0%
institutions of pyed or the employers to
 
03:14:03.630 --> 03:14:03.640 align:start position:0%
discover it on their own uh and so this
 
03:14:06.110 --> 03:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
is really an opportunity to organize and
 
03:14:08.429 --> 03:14:08.439 align:start position:0%
and and build up that infrastructure in
 
03:14:11.590 --> 03:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:13.830 --> 03:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
way other
 
03:14:22.190 --> 03:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:25.110 --> 03:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
thank you represent we might ask uh is
 
03:14:28.229 --> 03:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
is it the request of the uh umbrella
 
03:14:31.229 --> 03:14:31.239 align:start position:0%
organization or this is uh something
 
03:14:33.750 --> 03:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
that you and the other sponsors have
 
03:14:37.150 --> 03:14:37.160 align:start position:0%
come up with so volunteer New Hampshire
 
03:14:39.710 --> 03:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
uh was part of the commission back in
 
03:14:42.790 --> 03:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
2020 right uh and they are aware of the
 
03:14:45.389 --> 03:14:45.399 align:start position:0%
request uh they wanted to be careful not
 
03:14:47.389 --> 03:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
to say they support it or don't support
 
03:14:49.150 --> 03:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
it um but they're aware of it and
 
03:14:51.070 --> 03:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
certainly see the benefits thank you
 
03:14:54.510 --> 03:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:14:56.990 --> 03:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative I don't
 
03:14:59.229 --> 03:14:59.239 align:start position:0%
think there's anyone else to
 
03:15:01.389 --> 03:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
testify thanks Madam chair I'll follow
 
03:15:38.030 --> 03:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:40.189 --> 03:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
all right I think we should go into
 
03:15:43.309 --> 03:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
executive session since we've got a few
 
03:15:45.349 --> 03:15:45.359 align:start position:0%
minutes representative scitec do you
 
03:15:52.349 --> 03:15:52.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:52.359 --> 03:15:57.870 align:start position:0%
 
16

03:15:57.870 --> 03:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:02.070 --> 03:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
no no you okay you don't have a
 
03:16:06.950 --> 03:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:09.550 --> 03:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
chance um in that case representative
 
03:16:12.229 --> 03:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
scitec does not have a motion I'll move
 
03:16:13.790 --> 03:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to
 
03:16:18.670 --> 03:16:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:21.070 --> 03:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
and I'll just say that this might be a
 
03:16:25.710 --> 03:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
very nice thing to have but if
 
03:16:29.309 --> 03:16:29.319 align:start position:0%
we're but it's very very definitely a
 
03:16:33.750 --> 03:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
nice to have and not a necessary to have
 
03:16:35.830 --> 03:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh I didn't get much of an impression
 
03:16:37.870 --> 03:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
that they knew why it was
 
03:16:42.469 --> 03:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
a full-time position to do things that
 
03:16:44.630 --> 03:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
these other organizations are doing on
 
03:16:47.830 --> 03:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
their own and
 
03:16:50.070 --> 03:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
I don't think we should be at trying to
 
03:16:54.990 --> 03:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
add more state employees in nice to have
 
03:16:57.229 --> 03:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
functions when the governor's just
 
03:16:59.030 --> 03:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
imposed a hiring
 
03:17:01.950 --> 03:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
freeze representative Leon uh thank you
 
03:17:04.710 --> 03:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
madam chair um I definitely appreciate
 
03:17:06.150 --> 03:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
the intention to keep people of Don
 
03:17:09.070 --> 03:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
americ cor and peace Peace Corp here and
 
03:17:10.910 --> 03:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
do this but I don't think that this has
 
03:17:12.830 --> 03:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
been fully fleshed out enough in order
 
03:17:14.950 --> 03:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
to try and make a new position when
 
03:17:16.269 --> 03:17:16.279 align:start position:0%
we're facing the constraints that we
 
03:17:17.429 --> 03:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
have today
 
03:17:18.870 --> 03:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
um there's so many there's so many
 
03:17:20.429 --> 03:17:20.439 align:start position:0%
things that I can see that can be done
 
03:17:24.150 --> 03:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
with that $75,000 of budget um that
 
03:17:25.950 --> 03:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
really would have a direct impact on a
 
03:17:28.150 --> 03:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
lot of different lives and I just don't
 
03:17:31.950 --> 03:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:35.269 --> 03:17:35.279 align:start position:0%
it any other comments questions concerns
 
03:17:35.279 --> 03:17:37.269 align:start position:0%
it any other comments questions concerns
representative

03:17:37.269 --> 03:17:37.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:17:41.389 --> 03:17:41.399 align:start position:0%
scitec this my view this had reasonable
 
03:17:44.229 --> 03:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
chance but this the economic argument
 
03:17:45.790 --> 03:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
even though I know that's the job of
 
03:17:49.710 --> 03:17:49.720 align:start position:0%
Finance we shouldn't ask Finance to be
 
03:17:52.630 --> 03:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
doing uh what we what we recognize has
 
03:17:55.309 --> 03:17:55.319 align:start position:0%
to be done and it's it's sound like a
 
03:17:58.750 --> 03:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
great idea but I'm not sure we can
 
03:18:00.670 --> 03:18:00.680 align:start position:0%
afford it right or should afford it
 
03:18:05.349 --> 03:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:08.950 --> 03:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
reluctantly that's it thank
 
03:18:14.229 --> 03:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:17.150 --> 03:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
de I'm of two minds on this but I really
 
03:18:20.389 --> 03:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
like to see the updated numbers on how
 
03:18:24.510 --> 03:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
many volunteers are here so um I guess
 
03:18:27.070 --> 03:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
we're moving forward with it anyway but
 
03:18:28.830 --> 03:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
um there is a multiplying effect by
 
03:18:32.389 --> 03:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
having a volunteer manager Who Um can
 
03:18:34.830 --> 03:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
help to create a stickiness within the
 
03:18:36.150 --> 03:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so I think that
 
03:18:38.229 --> 03:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
there's a benefit that far exceeds the
 
03:18:42.750 --> 03:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:46.349 --> 03:18:46.359 align:start position:0%
cost in response to that the executive
 
03:18:46.359 --> 03:18:47.429 align:start position:0%
cost in response to that the executive
director

03:18:47.429 --> 03:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
director
 
03:18:49.349 --> 03:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
I don't who I believe is paid with
 
03:18:53.910 --> 03:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
federal funds has the authority to hire
 
03:18:56.349 --> 03:18:56.359 align:start position:0%
people to
 
03:19:02.910 --> 03:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
uh um do these to organize programs to
 
03:19:06.269 --> 03:19:06.279 align:start position:0%
to do that to contact with other
 
03:19:06.279 --> 03:19:08.030 align:start position:0%
to do that to contact with other
nonprofit

03:19:08.030 --> 03:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
nonprofit
 
03:19:08.040 --> 03:19:09.910 align:start position:0%
nonprofit
organizations

03:19:09.910 --> 03:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
03:19:13.229 --> 03:19:13.239 align:start position:0%
um and cooperate with any state federal
 
03:19:15.349 --> 03:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
agency or any private
 
03:19:18.710 --> 03:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
organization and also to accept gifts
 
03:19:22.469 --> 03:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
grants and donations from any funds so
 
03:19:27.510 --> 03:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
my my feeling is that if it's important
 
03:19:30.030 --> 03:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
which I do think it it it very well
 
03:19:30.040 --> 03:19:30.990 align:start position:0%
which I do think it it it very well
should

03:19:30.990 --> 03:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
should
 
03:19:34.030 --> 03:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
be they have the authority to go ahead
 
03:19:37.950 --> 03:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
and raise money to do so or to connect
 
03:19:40.630 --> 03:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
other organizations to these National
 
03:19:43.030 --> 03:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
programs it sounded from what
 
03:19:44.750 --> 03:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
representative wilham said is that
 
03:19:47.750 --> 03:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
they're not actually pushing these
 
03:19:51.110 --> 03:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
National organizations to their partners
 
03:19:53.870 --> 03:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
and that would be in my opinion the
 
03:19:57.750 --> 03:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:00.349 --> 03:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
do representative
 
03:20:02.670 --> 03:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
sers yeah thank you mam chair I'm just
 
03:20:05.189 --> 03:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
thinking that it's they're not on what
 
03:20:07.950 --> 03:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
you were just saying and it's it doesn't
 
03:20:10.110 --> 03:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
sound like they had even attempted to
 
03:20:12.830 --> 03:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
start doing this even part-time on their
 
03:20:16.030 --> 03:20:16.040 align:start position:0%
own yet so I mean if we already had say
 
03:20:17.469 --> 03:20:17.479 align:start position:0%
you know they're already put in 10 hours
 
03:20:19.550 --> 03:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
a week and now they really need someone
 
03:20:21.870 --> 03:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
full-time that's one thing but we they
 
03:20:23.590 --> 03:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
want to start a whole program which I'm
 
03:20:26.389 --> 03:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
not sure if they even know will work or
 
03:20:29.630 --> 03:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:33.309 --> 03:20:33.319 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chairwoman members of
 
03:31:58.189 --> 03:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
the committee uh thank you so much for
 
03:32:00.389 --> 03:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
having me here today for the record I am
 
03:32:02.510 --> 03:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative Jim majori representing
 
03:32:04.030 --> 03:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
the beautiful community and the
 
03:32:06.229 --> 03:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
wonderful residents of Northampton New
 
03:32:08.590 --> 03:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh and I'm here today in full
 
03:32:11.150 --> 03:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill
 
03:32:14.309 --> 03:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
469 uh I'm not going to speak at length
 
03:32:15.990 --> 03:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
about this the people behind me are the
 
03:32:19.990 --> 03:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
real pros um they can answer probably
 
03:32:22.910 --> 03:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
all of your questions uh but I'm really
 
03:32:25.070 --> 03:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
here in support because I'm one of the
 
03:32:27.830 --> 03:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
Selectmen in town and have been for well
 
03:32:31.429 --> 03:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
18 years now uh so I know how important
 
03:32:34.910 --> 03:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
it is for our communities to have access
 
03:32:37.630 --> 03:32:37.640 align:start position:0%
uh for our town managers for our uh Town
 
03:32:40.670 --> 03:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
administrators to have access direct
 
03:32:42.510 --> 03:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
access to the funding that directly
 
03:32:45.150 --> 03:32:45.160 align:start position:0%
affects the residents of our community
 
03:32:48.189 --> 03:32:48.199 align:start position:0%
um so I think think the addition of a
 
03:32:51.030 --> 03:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
municipal manager on this board would be
 
03:32:53.309 --> 03:32:53.319 align:start position:0%
very effective to have that direct input
 
03:32:55.870 --> 03:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
on the advisory Council excuse me uh to
 
03:32:59.189 --> 03:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
have that direct input uh that's coming
 
03:33:01.189 --> 03:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
right from the town to The Advisory
 
03:33:03.830 --> 03:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
Council I think that is a great addition
 
03:33:05.389 --> 03:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're talking about
 
03:33:07.150 --> 03:33:07.160 align:start position:0%
today you probably did some homework
 
03:33:09.510 --> 03:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
about the history of P dip and and
 
03:33:11.870 --> 03:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things that's uh that's
 
03:33:13.389 --> 03:33:13.399 align:start position:0%
not the discussion we're having right
 
03:33:15.790 --> 03:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
now it's adding uh it's adding this one
 
03:33:17.670 --> 03:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
member of the New Hampshire Municipal
 
03:33:19.950 --> 03:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
Association uh excuse me Municipal
 
03:33:22.510 --> 03:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
Managers Association and removing one of
 
03:33:24.590 --> 03:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
the bankers we still have the same
 
03:33:26.710 --> 03:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
representation there I think this is a
 
03:33:28.950 --> 03:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
wonderful idea and again I'm happy to
 
03:33:30.870 --> 03:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
take any question but I'll probably keep
 
03:33:33.070 --> 03:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
saying the folks behind me can answer
 
03:33:34.910 --> 03:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
that the folks behind me can answer that
 
03:33:37.070 --> 03:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
so with that I uh that's about all I
 
03:33:39.389 --> 03:33:39.399 align:start position:0%
have all right thank you very much sure

um we're opposed to uh HB 469 not in its
 
03:34:57.309 --> 03:34:57.319 align:start position:0%
entirety uh we're not opposed to adding
 
03:34:59.790 --> 03:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
a member from the municipal Managers
 
03:35:01.950 --> 03:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
Association but as you can imagine we're
 
03:35:04.110 --> 03:35:04.120 align:start position:0%
opposed to eliminating one of our seats
 
03:35:06.150 --> 03:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
right now we have two seats on The
 
03:35:08.349 --> 03:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board this has been it's been
 
03:35:10.309 --> 03:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
this way for nearly 30 years and so
 
03:35:12.349 --> 03:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
we're curious to why there's a change
 
03:35:14.550 --> 03:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
need for a change uh we feel it's even
 
03:35:17.469 --> 03:35:17.479 align:start position:0%
more important now to have those voices
 
03:35:19.389 --> 03:35:19.399 align:start position:0%
considering the house made a policy
 
03:35:21.670 --> 03:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
decision last year to keep some of the
 
03:35:24.469 --> 03:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
funds held by this pool in banks in New
 
03:35:26.830 --> 03:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we feel having these seats
 
03:35:30.469 --> 03:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
adds and ensures accountability um uh of
 
03:35:32.950 --> 03:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
the board uh
 
03:35:35.630 --> 03:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
furthermore excuse me one of our members
 
03:35:37.750 --> 03:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
that sits on the board is not affiliated
 
03:35:39.309 --> 03:35:39.319 align:start position:0%
with a bank and is actually a retired
 
03:35:41.990 --> 03:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
Banker uh with a lot of knowledge about
 
03:35:45.630 --> 03:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
uh about Banking and uh financing um so
 
03:35:48.229 --> 03:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
so like I mentioned I keep it short um
 
03:35:50.189 --> 03:35:50.199 align:start position:0%
in conclusion while we're not impo
 
03:35:51.910 --> 03:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill in its entirety we
 
03:35:53.790 --> 03:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
are opposed to eliminating one of our
 
03:35:56.389 --> 03:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
seats and I'm happy to take any
 
03:36:01.590 --> 03:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:04.910 --> 03:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
you excellent job no questions thank you
 
03:36:05.750 --> 03:36:05.760 align:start position:0%

03:36:24.670 --> 03:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
Buton turn your

different criteria two that require a

have significant external responsibility
 
03:37:06.670 --> 03:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
members of the MMA are key decision
 
03:37:09.030 --> 03:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
makers for cities and towns across the
 
03:37:11.150 --> 03:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
state we've been following the evolution
 
03:37:12.790 --> 03:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Public deposit
 
03:37:14.910 --> 03:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
investment pool for many years the
 
03:37:16.429 --> 03:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
recent change ders in the oversight of
 
03:37:18.429 --> 03:37:18.439 align:start position:0%
the pool from the New Hampshire banking
 
03:37:20.750 --> 03:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
Department to the state treasure have
 
03:37:22.550 --> 03:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
brought the New Hampshire Public deposit
 
03:37:24.110 --> 03:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
investment pool in line with similar
 
03:37:26.510 --> 03:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
pools from throughout the country adding
 
03:37:30.389 --> 03:37:30.399 align:start position:0%
a member of the MMA to the pool would
 
03:37:32.349 --> 03:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
represent another good step as part of
 
03:37:34.750 --> 03:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
the pool's Evolution and progression I'd
 
03:37:38.150 --> 03:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions you may
 
03:37:42.429 --> 03:37:42.439 align:start position:0%
have um Mr selig um Mr hail made the
 
03:37:44.670 --> 03:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
point that there's a bunch of money held
 
03:37:46.590 --> 03:37:46.600 align:start position:0%
by New Hampshire in New Hampshire bank
 
03:37:48.429 --> 03:37:48.439 align:start position:0%
so that it's appropriate that New
 
03:37:51.590 --> 03:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Bankers sit on this advisor uh
 
03:37:54.189 --> 03:37:54.199 align:start position:0%
board what do you have any objection to
 
03:37:56.590 --> 03:37:56.600 align:start position:0%
Simply adding as he
 
03:37:58.830 --> 03:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
suggested is there a reason to get rid
 
03:38:01.030 --> 03:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
of a banker
 
03:38:05.309 --> 03:38:05.319 align:start position:0%
um I think that there is um in this case
 
03:38:08.309 --> 03:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
we have an instance where in essence
 
03:38:11.110 --> 03:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
competitor institutions who want to do
 
03:38:13.990 --> 03:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
business with the pool have seats on the
 
03:38:16.349 --> 03:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
advisory committee for the pool
 
03:38:20.309 --> 03:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
and so from my perspective um I think it
 
03:38:21.950 --> 03:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
would be more appropriate for there to
 
03:38:24.429 --> 03:38:24.439 align:start position:0%
be an additional member representing
 
03:38:27.150 --> 03:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
cities and towns on the pool managing
 
03:38:28.550 --> 03:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
the pool
 
03:38:31.830 --> 03:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
versus uh a representative of entities
 
03:38:34.469 --> 03:38:34.479 align:start position:0%
who want to do business with the pool so
 
03:38:36.630 --> 03:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
I think it would represent a a step
 
03:38:40.269 --> 03:38:40.279 align:start position:0%
forward to reduce the bankers seats to
 
03:38:43.309 --> 03:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
one and add a an additional Municipal
 
03:38:46.150 --> 03:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
representative follow cause of the
 
03:38:47.990 --> 03:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
competition between the bankers and the
 
03:38:51.110 --> 03:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire deposit yes I see it as a
 
03:38:52.150 --> 03:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
conflict of
 
03:38:57.269 --> 03:38:57.279 align:start position:0%
interest well thank you representative
 
03:39:02.590 --> 03:39:02.600 align:start position:0%
long um so what municipalities have uh
 
03:39:04.990 --> 03:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
funds that are covered by uh this
 
03:39:07.550 --> 03:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
advisory committee and I asked that
 
03:39:10.070 --> 03:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
because I'm just trying to understand
 
03:39:11.870 --> 03:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
you know why it should be uh the
 
03:39:14.070 --> 03:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
municipal management association rather
 
03:39:16.830 --> 03:39:16.840 align:start position:0%
than the municipal associ iation uh and
 
03:39:19.110 --> 03:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
if that makes some significant
 
03:39:21.950 --> 03:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
difference in who gets selected to be
 
03:39:25.229 --> 03:39:25.239 align:start position:0%
this person so the uh current advisory
 
03:39:27.790 --> 03:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
committee of the pool does have one
 
03:39:29.229 --> 03:39:29.239 align:start position:0%
representative from the municipal
 
03:39:31.910 --> 03:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
Association at this time the municipal
 
03:39:34.750 --> 03:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
Association could select a town or a
 
03:39:37.590 --> 03:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
city manager a finance person or a
 
03:39:40.590 --> 03:39:40.600 align:start position:0%
select person or U mayor or city
 
03:39:43.910 --> 03:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
counselor so there's much more latitude
 
03:39:45.670 --> 03:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
on the part of the municipal ass ation
 
03:39:48.150 --> 03:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
and who they might appoint versus the
 
03:39:49.870 --> 03:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
municipal management association where
 
03:39:52.150 --> 03:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
you would get a manager with the kinds
 
03:39:54.229 --> 03:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
of responsibilities I've
 
03:39:58.189 --> 03:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
outlined um cities and towns counties
 
03:40:00.790 --> 03:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
and other entities that qualify are able
 
03:40:04.030 --> 03:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of the pool and uh
 
03:40:07.710 --> 03:40:07.720 align:start position:0%
invest their money Garner High interest
 
03:40:11.750 --> 03:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
rates um and that money stays liquid so
 
03:40:14.670 --> 03:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
it's very important for the cash flow of
 
03:40:16.550 --> 03:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
cities and towns sounds to be able to
 
03:40:18.070 --> 03:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
have an entity like the
 
03:40:23.349 --> 03:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
pool um and from my perspective um in
 
03:40:25.469 --> 03:40:25.479 align:start position:0%
terms of the way the funds of the pool
 
03:40:28.150 --> 03:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
are managed uh the statute that went
 
03:40:31.269 --> 03:40:31.279 align:start position:0%
into effect last year does uh direct the
 
03:40:35.269 --> 03:40:35.279 align:start position:0%
pool to evaluate and seek whether it's
 
03:40:37.269 --> 03:40:37.279 align:start position:0%
possible whether it makes sense uh
 
03:40:40.550 --> 03:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
fiscally to invest those funds in the
 
03:40:43.429 --> 03:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
banks operating in New Hampshire at the
 
03:40:46.630 --> 03:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
same time the pools responsibility is to
 
03:40:48.830 --> 03:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
Garner the highest rate of return in a
 
03:40:52.349 --> 03:40:52.359 align:start position:0%
safe and liquid way for the depositors
 
03:40:56.269 --> 03:40:56.279 align:start position:0%
so the manager would represent the
 
03:40:59.030 --> 03:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
depositors again versus the banks who
 
03:41:02.950 --> 03:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:05.269 --> 03:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
pool some a
 
03:41:09.070 --> 03:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
followup um so I from my understanding
 
03:41:11.510 --> 03:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
of your description of who's eligible to
 
03:41:13.910 --> 03:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
be in the municipal Managers
 
03:41:17.110 --> 03:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
Association uh assume that for example
 
03:41:18.910 --> 03:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
Mayors are not eligible because they're
 
03:41:22.790 --> 03:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
not exactly managers uh so I'm just
 
03:41:25.269 --> 03:41:25.279 align:start position:0%
wondering and then I guess on the other
 
03:41:27.990 --> 03:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
end I don't know if like small towns
 
03:41:31.910 --> 03:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
even have managers so like what is the
 
03:41:35.110 --> 03:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
the range of municipalities who you have
 
03:41:39.590 --> 03:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
members from so um an elected official
 
03:41:41.790 --> 03:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
would not be eligible to be a member of
 
03:41:43.870 --> 03:41:43.880 align:start position:0%
the municipal Management Association of
 
03:41:45.950 --> 03:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um
 
03:41:47.189 --> 03:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
however again the New Hampshire
 
03:41:49.790 --> 03:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association might tap a mayor
 
03:41:53.189 --> 03:41:53.199 align:start position:0%
to be its representative um members of
 
03:41:56.429 --> 03:41:56.439 align:start position:0%
the MMA have to fulfill a set of
 
03:41:59.110 --> 03:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
criteria and in essence we're looking at
 
03:42:01.389 --> 03:42:01.399 align:start position:0%
individuals who are Town managers city
 
03:42:03.349 --> 03:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
managers Town administrators even
 
03:42:05.510 --> 03:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
administrative assistants who have
 
03:42:07.429 --> 03:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
sufficient levels of responsibility in
 
03:42:10.790 --> 03:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
their unique Community to qualify and on
 
03:42:13.070 --> 03:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
a positive note we have an associate
 
03:42:15.670 --> 03:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
membership as well in MMA
 
03:42:18.110 --> 03:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
for those uh really small communities
 
03:42:19.990 --> 03:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
that have a manager that has limited
 
03:42:22.670 --> 03:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility but still wants to Garner
 
03:42:25.950 --> 03:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
the educational benefits and um uh
 
03:42:28.950 --> 03:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
networking that our association
 
03:42:31.030 --> 03:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
provides representative L you had a
 
03:42:34.469 --> 03:42:34.479 align:start position:0%
question no notk you um I had I'm
 
03:42:36.070 --> 03:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill that lists the
 
03:42:38.990 --> 03:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
members of this advisory committee and
 
03:42:41.309 --> 03:42:41.319 align:start position:0%
it says there are two members by the New
 
03:42:43.790 --> 03:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire government Finance Officers
 
03:42:45.910 --> 03:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
Association How would is that different
 
03:42:48.870 --> 03:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
from your organization so um the
 
03:42:51.790 --> 03:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
organization you just mentioned is um
 
03:42:53.910 --> 03:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
another organization it's kind of a
 
03:42:56.149 --> 03:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
parallel organization to the managers
 
03:42:59.030 --> 03:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
but it's comprised of Finance officers
 
03:43:00.469 --> 03:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
business managers business
 
03:43:02.750 --> 03:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
administrators from towns and school
 
03:43:06.149 --> 03:43:06.159 align:start position:0%
districts across the state and so in
 
03:43:07.870 --> 03:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
that case you're getting somebody who
 
03:43:10.630 --> 03:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
has a pure fiscal background versus
 
03:43:13.030 --> 03:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
somebody who's in charge of the overall
 
03:43:14.870 --> 03:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
management function of the town and who
 
03:43:18.149 --> 03:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
also also will have some fiscal
 
03:43:20.830 --> 03:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
background okay I will mention that in
 
03:43:23.189 --> 03:43:23.199 align:start position:0%
many towns such as mine all of the
 
03:43:25.910 --> 03:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
people with fiscal background are
 
03:43:29.750 --> 03:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
elected and responsibility so that's
 
03:43:32.070 --> 03:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh and they would not be eligible for
 
03:43:34.309 --> 03:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
your organization but they would be
 
03:43:36.309 --> 03:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
eligible for the other thank you
 
03:43:38.510 --> 03:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
representative scitech I thought I heard
 
03:43:41.510 --> 03:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
this that El elected officials aren't
 
03:43:45.110 --> 03:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
eligible then representative uh blong
 
03:43:47.389 --> 03:43:47.399 align:start position:0%
said something about asked a question he
 
03:43:50.510 --> 03:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
said but a mayor could be put
 
03:43:54.910 --> 03:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
in so but he's elected have did I miss
 
03:43:57.510 --> 03:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
it would depend on which organization
 
03:44:00.910 --> 03:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
was doing the appointing there
 
03:44:03.910 --> 03:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
are the New Hampshire government Finance
 
03:44:07.389 --> 03:44:07.399 align:start position:0%
officers the association of counties the
 
03:44:10.070 --> 03:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
municipal Association the school boards
 
03:44:13.189 --> 03:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
Association all can appoint a
 
03:44:15.070 --> 03:44:15.080 align:start position:0%
representative and they can appoint an
 
03:44:17.429 --> 03:44:17.439 align:start position:0%
Ed rep they can appoint whoever they
 
03:44:19.429 --> 03:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
think will do the best
 
03:44:22.229 --> 03:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
job so in this way there'd be a mix of
 
03:44:24.670 --> 03:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
people on the board representative
 
03:44:27.309 --> 03:44:27.319 align:start position:0%
dargy thank you madam chair uh do you
 
03:44:30.710 --> 03:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
know how many members there are of the
 
03:44:34.469 --> 03:44:34.479 align:start position:0%
mmnh they're approximately 130 I believe
 
03:44:37.389 --> 03:44:37.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:39.550 --> 03:44:39.560 align:start position:0%
minus okay other
 
03:44:42.590 --> 03:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
questions yeah and we've got 234 cities
 
03:44:44.670 --> 03:44:44.680 align:start position:0%
and towns so not not every Community has
 
03:44:46.630 --> 03:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
somebody to
 
03:44:50.030 --> 03:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
send some have smaller staffs and don't
 
03:44:51.830 --> 03:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
have Professional Management in place
 
03:44:55.550 --> 03:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
they rely on elected uh select people to
 
03:44:57.389 --> 03:44:57.399 align:start position:0%
make those daily
 
03:44:57.399 --> 03:44:59.309 align:start position:0%
make those daily
decisions

03:44:59.309 --> 03:44:59.319 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
03:45:01.790 --> 03:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
okay any other
 
03:45:04.630 --> 03:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
03:45:24.389 --> 03:45:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:25.830 --> 03:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair members of
 
03:45:27.389 --> 03:45:27.399 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Mike mlof I
 
03:45:29.670 --> 03:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
represent pfm Asset Management I've been
 
03:45:31.830 --> 03:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
working with the municipal Managers
 
03:45:33.110 --> 03:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
Association for the last couple moments
 
03:45:35.269 --> 03:45:35.279 align:start position:0%
talking about this bill I think one
 
03:45:36.910 --> 03:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
thing that's important to remember is
 
03:45:39.149 --> 03:45:39.159 align:start position:0%
this bill is not uh something that
 
03:45:41.870 --> 03:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
Standalone it comes into an an
 
03:45:45.389 --> 03:45:45.399 align:start position:0%
organization that is uh static the P dip
 
03:45:47.189 --> 03:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
has been evolving over the last several
 
03:45:49.070 --> 03:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
years beginning with a study committee
 
03:45:52.070 --> 03:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
back in N 2022 that looked at the P dip
 
03:45:55.110 --> 03:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
and said basically why is the banking
 
03:45:58.149 --> 03:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
Department in charge of the P dip when
 
03:46:00.550 --> 03:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
no other state or no other jurisdiction
 
03:46:02.149 --> 03:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
that has a public deposit investment
 
03:46:03.950 --> 03:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
pool has the banking Department we're
 
03:46:06.269 --> 03:46:06.279 align:start position:0%
overseeing it so as they looked at the
 
03:46:07.710 --> 03:46:07.720 align:start position:0%
situation they said it's time to make
 
03:46:12.269 --> 03:46:12.279 align:start position:0%
the change to U create a more uh pool
 
03:46:13.790 --> 03:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
that's consistent with the way all the
 
03:46:15.830 --> 03:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
other pools in the country are running
 
03:46:17.389 --> 03:46:17.399 align:start position:0%
so the study committee recommended
 
03:46:20.510 --> 03:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
legislation which moved the overseeing
 
03:46:23.229 --> 03:46:23.239 align:start position:0%
of the pep from the banking Department
 
03:46:26.389 --> 03:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
to the state treasurer I handed out I
 
03:46:26.399 --> 03:46:27.389 align:start position:0%
to the state treasurer I handed out I
think

03:46:27.389 --> 03:46:27.399 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:46:29.950 --> 03:46:29.960 align:start position:0%
a I sent you over the email some
 
03:46:32.670 --> 03:46:32.680 align:start position:0%
information relative to the timeline and
 
03:46:34.110 --> 03:46:34.120 align:start position:0%
to what would happened to P but it's
 
03:46:37.189 --> 03:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
important to recognize back in 1991 when
 
03:46:39.990 --> 03:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
the PIP was put together the only group
 
03:46:42.070 --> 03:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
in opposition to the pp was the New
 
03:46:43.269 --> 03:46:43.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Banks
 
03:46:46.670 --> 03:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
Association they were anly um or they
 
03:46:48.070 --> 03:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
didn't reluctantly they put in
 
03:46:50.229 --> 03:46:50.239 align:start position:0%
opposition to the original P dip because
 
03:46:53.269 --> 03:46:53.279 align:start position:0%
the p dip uh is a direct competitor with
 
03:46:56.070 --> 03:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
the banks the pp is looking to buy
 
03:46:58.269 --> 03:46:58.279 align:start position:0%
financial instruments and products to
 
03:47:00.670 --> 03:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
produce a return to satisfy their
 
03:47:02.550 --> 03:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
shareholders the banks are looking to
 
03:47:06.229 --> 03:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
sell products uh for their customers and
 
03:47:08.469 --> 03:47:08.479 align:start position:0%
shareholders so when we looked at the
 
03:47:10.710 --> 03:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
study committee and they changed the um
 
03:47:12.189 --> 03:47:12.199 align:start position:0%
orientation to put it to the state
 
03:47:15.469 --> 03:47:15.479 align:start position:0%
Treasures Office um office uh seemed to
 
03:47:17.030 --> 03:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
be that it might be time to keep
 
03:47:20.189 --> 03:47:20.199 align:start position:0%
evolving the pp to have it create more
 
03:47:23.590 --> 03:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
of a uh organization that is in uh
 
03:47:24.870 --> 03:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
synonymous with the rest of the
 
03:47:26.910 --> 03:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
country's ped up so when we looked at
 
03:47:29.710 --> 03:47:29.720 align:start position:0%
what might be a good idea to help is to
 
03:47:31.269 --> 03:47:31.279 align:start position:0%
get a member of the municipal manag
 
03:47:33.349 --> 03:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
Association onto the board to get more
 
03:47:35.550 --> 03:47:35.560 align:start position:0%
influence from decision makers I think
 
03:47:38.269 --> 03:47:38.279 align:start position:0%
the P dip and the bankers relationship
 
03:47:39.830 --> 03:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
can best be ENC capitalized by an
 
03:47:42.030 --> 03:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
analogy which is if all the cities and
 
03:47:45.030 --> 03:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
towns had a a group a pooled group group
 
03:47:47.189 --> 03:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
to buy Automobiles and they had an
 
03:47:49.070 --> 03:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
advisory committee to advise them on
 
03:47:50.950 --> 03:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
which automobiles to buy and they had
 
03:47:52.429 --> 03:47:52.439 align:start position:0%
two four dealers on the advisory
 
03:47:54.110 --> 03:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
committee that would be a conflict of
 
03:47:57.309 --> 03:47:57.319 align:start position:0%
interest and the conflict of interest is
 
03:48:01.309 --> 03:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
the idea or the um the origin of the
 
03:48:03.870 --> 03:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
change in the overseeing of the P dip
 
03:48:05.670 --> 03:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
when the study committee looked at the
 
03:48:07.309 --> 03:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Public deposit investment
 
03:48:09.710 --> 03:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
pool they saw a direct conflict of
 
03:48:12.990 --> 03:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
interest between the banking department
 
03:48:17.269 --> 03:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
and the pp so the two Bankers on the pp
 
03:48:21.229 --> 03:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
are inherently conflicted now we as we
 
03:48:23.630 --> 03:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
talked about what should happen in the
 
03:48:27.110 --> 03:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
um in this session was there's no
 
03:48:28.790 --> 03:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
alternative to throw everybody throw the
 
03:48:30.469 --> 03:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
bank is off but the alternative we're
 
03:48:32.910 --> 03:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
operating today in this bill is to
 
03:48:35.309 --> 03:48:35.319 align:start position:0%
continue the evolution of the pp by
 
03:48:37.950 --> 03:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
adding uh a qualified member and the
 
03:48:40.670 --> 03:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
municipal manag Association uh has a
 
03:48:42.070 --> 03:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
member who's ready willing to serve on
 
03:48:45.590 --> 03:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
the pp and to kind of
 
03:48:47.710 --> 03:48:47.720 align:start position:0%
Wan that conflict of interest because
 
03:48:50.910 --> 03:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
the advisory council is the group that
 
03:48:52.790 --> 03:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
advises the treasurer on where to make
 
03:48:56.790 --> 03:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
the Investments last session the um
 
03:48:59.550 --> 03:48:59.560 align:start position:0%
there was B Senate Bill 553 where the
 
03:49:02.389 --> 03:49:02.399 align:start position:0%
bankers who continue to um have a great
 
03:49:04.550 --> 03:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
desire to do business with the pp and
 
03:49:06.670 --> 03:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
let me stop for a second they can easily
 
03:49:08.750 --> 03:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
do business with the pp by simpling
 
03:49:10.990 --> 03:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
offering a product that is more
 
03:49:12.469 --> 03:49:12.479 align:start position:0%
advantageous to the cities and towns
 
03:49:14.189 --> 03:49:14.199 align:start position:0%
than the product that Pips offers
 
03:49:16.030 --> 03:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
because the main main job of the public
 
03:49:17.630 --> 03:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
deposit investment tool is to provide
 
03:49:19.870 --> 03:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
the best return they can to their
 
03:49:22.870 --> 03:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
investors so there is no prohibition for
 
03:49:25.510 --> 03:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
a bank to do business with the pep but
 
03:49:28.870 --> 03:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
when you put two Bankers on the board uh
 
03:49:31.030 --> 03:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
and the banks are trying to do business
 
03:49:33.950 --> 03:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
with the pp the inherent colc interest
 
03:49:37.550 --> 03:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
is undeniable so the bill today simply
 
03:49:39.429 --> 03:49:39.439 align:start position:0%
says let's make the change this
 
03:49:41.630 --> 03:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
continued evolution of removing the
 
03:49:43.670 --> 03:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest that the study
 
03:49:45.189 --> 03:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
committee saw in the p
 
03:49:47.349 --> 03:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
and replace at least one of the bankers
 
03:49:49.830 --> 03:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
with a non-conflicted person who has the
 
03:49:52.469 --> 03:49:52.479 align:start position:0%
best interest of the depositors uh there
 
03:49:55.469 --> 03:49:55.479 align:start position:0%
is nothing that I would ever say that is
 
03:49:58.429 --> 03:49:58.439 align:start position:0%
U to claim that any Banker is doing
 
03:50:00.309 --> 03:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
something inherently wrong but when you
 
03:50:02.790 --> 03:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
talk about conflict of interest it's the
 
03:50:04.990 --> 03:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
appearance again if you had two four
 
03:50:06.670 --> 03:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
dealers trying to sell trucks to the
 
03:50:09.110 --> 03:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
cities and towns on a group it would be
 
03:50:11.070 --> 03:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
a conflict of interest so as we look at
 
03:50:13.229 --> 03:50:13.239 align:start position:0%
the evolution of the pp I think it makes
 
03:50:16.389 --> 03:50:16.399 align:start position:0%
sense to take the next step step to put
 
03:50:19.389 --> 03:50:19.399 align:start position:0%
RPD in line with every single public
 
03:50:21.670 --> 03:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
deposit and pool in the country there is
 
03:50:24.309 --> 03:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
no deposit pool in the country that has
 
03:50:26.309 --> 03:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
any member of a board of directors or an
 
03:50:28.870 --> 03:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
advisory committee that has a business
 
03:50:33.630 --> 03:50:33.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:36.630 --> 03:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
pool so it can if we continue this
 
03:50:38.269 --> 03:50:38.279 align:start position:0%
Evolution you'll be back next year to
 
03:50:41.309 --> 03:50:41.319 align:start position:0%
get rid of him entirely no the reason
 
03:50:43.349 --> 03:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
I'm here today is the missable Managers
 
03:50:45.149 --> 03:50:45.159 align:start position:0%
Association of Hampshire said we'd like
 
03:50:47.389 --> 03:50:47.399 align:start position:0%
to be on the board unless somebody else
 
03:50:49.349 --> 03:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
comes forward and says we'd like to be
 
03:50:50.830 --> 03:50:50.840 align:start position:0%
on the board they can present their own
 
03:50:54.710 --> 03:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
case but I'm not here to say if if that
 
03:50:56.110 --> 03:50:56.120 align:start position:0%
was the case I would put it I wouldn't
 
03:50:57.469 --> 03:50:57.479 align:start position:0%
put the bill in but a bill could come
 
03:50:59.110 --> 03:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
before you to say take both the banks
 
03:51:01.950 --> 03:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
out but that's not it today it's we have
 
03:51:05.269 --> 03:51:05.279 align:start position:0%
a highly qualified as uh Mr Cel Sor but
 
03:51:06.670 --> 03:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
a highly qualified group that says we're
 
03:51:08.229 --> 03:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
ready willing and able to get on to that
 
03:51:10.910 --> 03:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
board and the benefit is not only to the
 
03:51:12.990 --> 03:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
board itself because the expertise but
 
03:51:15.030 --> 03:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
it also reduces that uh inherent
 
03:51:17.149 --> 03:51:17.159 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest which I don't think
 
03:51:18.830 --> 03:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh it's pretty obvious seeing as we
 
03:51:20.269 --> 03:51:20.279 align:start position:0%
started discussing the conflict of
 
03:51:23.030 --> 03:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
interest back in 1991 finally got in
 
03:51:25.710 --> 03:51:25.720 align:start position:0%
2022 and 2023 to recognize that there
 
03:51:28.469 --> 03:51:28.479 align:start position:0%
exists one and now this has helped to
 
03:51:29.990 --> 03:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
evolve the pep into what it really
 
03:51:33.309 --> 03:51:33.319 align:start position:0%
should be which is a totally neutral uh
 
03:51:33.319 --> 03:51:35.910 align:start position:0%
should be which is a totally neutral uh
Advisory

03:51:35.910 --> 03:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
Advisory
 
03:51:39.429 --> 03:51:39.439 align:start position:0%
board thank you a followup I'll be
 
03:51:43.030 --> 03:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
watching you next year I hope I'm
 
03:51:45.710 --> 03:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
back any other questions comments
 
03:51:48.110 --> 03:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
concerns representative long so I take
 
03:51:50.429 --> 03:51:50.439 align:start position:0%
your point about if you had two four
 
03:51:52.550 --> 03:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
dealers but I would think if you had you
 
03:51:54.550 --> 03:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
know a Ford dealer and a Chevy dealer on
 
03:51:56.590 --> 03:51:56.600 align:start position:0%
the board the headbutting between them
 
03:52:00.790 --> 03:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
would be uh helpful in
 
03:52:04.149 --> 03:52:04.159 align:start position:0%
Illuminating the uh disadvantages of
 
03:52:06.389 --> 03:52:06.399 align:start position:0%
each of their respective products so I
 
03:52:09.110 --> 03:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
guess why does that Dynamic not occur
 
03:52:10.830 --> 03:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
where you have two Bankers instead of
 
03:52:13.590 --> 03:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
one well just then if we're going to
 
03:52:15.590 --> 03:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
have a for in Chev deal we need Chrysler
 
03:52:19.710 --> 03:52:19.720 align:start position:0%
Mercedes VW it just uh the bankers
 
03:52:21.429 --> 03:52:21.439 align:start position:0%
inherently even the banker who he
 
03:52:25.110 --> 03:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned is not working for Bank uh
 
03:52:26.630 --> 03:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
their allegiance particularly a bank
 
03:52:29.070 --> 03:52:29.080 align:start position:0%
who's employed and on the board their
 
03:52:31.030 --> 03:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
first Allegiance under their basic
 
03:52:33.110 --> 03:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
Employment contract is to their employer
 
03:52:36.349 --> 03:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
and their employer's um goal is to sell
 
03:52:38.750 --> 03:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
the products they can and return the
 
03:52:41.269 --> 03:52:41.279 align:start position:0%
most money they can to their investors
 
03:52:43.790 --> 03:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
and their shareholders um when you
 
03:52:46.070 --> 03:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
sitting at the P their job is to find
 
03:52:47.830 --> 03:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
the multiple different investment
 
03:52:51.229 --> 03:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
vehicles that they can uh contract with
 
03:52:53.590 --> 03:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
or buy so that all those shareholders
 
03:52:56.510 --> 03:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
get the maximum return last year the
 
03:52:59.710 --> 03:52:59.720 align:start position:0%
legislature uh wrangled with this whole
 
03:53:01.389 --> 03:53:01.399 align:start position:0%
concept for several months and finally
 
03:53:04.870 --> 03:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
came up with a uh a solution which said
 
03:53:07.990 --> 03:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
yeah the PIP should strive to put money
 
03:53:10.189 --> 03:53:10.199 align:start position:0%
in the banks but that doesn't mean they
 
03:53:12.710 --> 03:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
should go looking for buying a product
 
03:53:15.229 --> 03:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
that is not as good as the product so by
 
03:53:18.550 --> 03:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
XYZ Financial that so the idea for the p
 
03:53:22.510 --> 03:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
is still quite quite quite uh pointed
 
03:53:24.389 --> 03:53:24.399 align:start position:0%
find the best products if the best
 
03:53:26.110 --> 03:53:26.120 align:start position:0%
product is in a New Hampshire bank they
 
03:53:28.870 --> 03:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
will get that product but again this
 
03:53:31.149 --> 03:53:31.159 align:start position:0%
legislation is I look at the PIP as an
 
03:53:34.189 --> 03:53:34.199 align:start position:0%
evolving entity and there's a timeline
 
03:53:36.950 --> 03:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
started in 91 took us 30 took us 30
 
03:53:38.189 --> 03:53:38.199 align:start position:0%
years to catch up with the fact that we
 
03:53:39.510 --> 03:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
were doing it a little different than
 
03:53:41.910 --> 03:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
other people but they changed it they
 
03:53:43.910 --> 03:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
took the banking Department out the
 
03:53:44.870 --> 03:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
banking Department Department in
 
03:53:47.710 --> 03:53:47.720 align:start position:0%
testimony said yeah we have a conflict
 
03:53:49.910 --> 03:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
and the bankers in themselves sitting on
 
03:53:51.110 --> 03:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
the board I mean they didn't do anything
 
03:53:52.910 --> 03:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
wrong to get on the board but as I look
 
03:53:55.590 --> 03:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
in the history where in 1991 the bank is
 
03:53:57.349 --> 03:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
strenuously objected to the
 
03:53:59.870 --> 03:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
establishment of a pip uh just recently
 
03:54:02.309 --> 03:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
the N excuse me the Alabama bank is
 
03:54:04.229 --> 03:54:04.239 align:start position:0%
Association killed the bill in Alabama
 
03:54:05.630 --> 03:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
to create a public deposit investment
 
03:54:08.269 --> 03:54:08.279 align:start position:0%
poort because they compete for the same
 
03:54:10.630 --> 03:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
dollars and when you compete for same
 
03:54:11.790 --> 03:54:11.800 align:start position:0%
dollars against some else it's a
 
03:54:14.110 --> 03:54:14.120 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest so again this is to
 
03:54:16.670 --> 03:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
put a manager on that board who has
 
03:54:20.229 --> 03:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
specialized knowledge and adds to the um
 
03:54:22.389 --> 03:54:22.399 align:start position:0%
to the investment policy in a neutral
 
03:54:27.149 --> 03:54:27.159 align:start position:0%
way um I don't think there's um uh the
 
03:54:28.910 --> 03:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
rationale is do we have somebody to put
 
03:54:31.070 --> 03:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
on the board uh there was a question
 
03:54:33.229 --> 03:54:33.239 align:start position:0%
which do you mind expanding the board
 
03:54:34.429 --> 03:54:34.439 align:start position:0%
and I would say if you look at the
 
03:54:36.750 --> 03:54:36.760 align:start position:0%
history and we do have conflicts the
 
03:54:39.389 --> 03:54:39.399 align:start position:0%
conflicts are there keeping another bank
 
03:54:42.349 --> 03:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
on the board does nothing to reduce the
 
03:54:45.389 --> 03:54:45.399 align:start position:0%
the conflict uh but uh again if if
 
03:54:47.309 --> 03:54:47.319 align:start position:0%
somebody comes in next year who is a
 
03:54:48.790 --> 03:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
highly qualified group or highly
 
03:54:50.590 --> 03:54:50.600 align:start position:0%
qualified entity that says we'd like to
 
03:54:53.030 --> 03:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
be on the board we have no conflicts I
 
03:54:54.510 --> 03:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
would think that the committee would say
 
03:54:55.590 --> 03:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
well that's exactly what the board
 
03:54:57.830 --> 03:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
should be and it should know there is a
 
03:55:00.429 --> 03:55:00.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire way but the the the
 
03:55:02.950 --> 03:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
universal way across the country is
 
03:55:05.309 --> 03:55:05.319 align:start position:0%
boards board of directors and Committees
 
03:55:08.429 --> 03:55:08.439 align:start position:0%
of advisory committees are in absolutely
 
03:55:10.189 --> 03:55:10.199 align:start position:0%
neutral there's nobody on those
 
03:55:12.070 --> 03:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
committees that then goes out and says
 
03:55:13.950 --> 03:55:13.960 align:start position:0%
Hey listen we got to cut 125 basis
 
03:55:15.309 --> 03:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
points off this product we can sell it
 
03:55:17.389 --> 03:55:17.399 align:start position:0%
to the um we can sell it to the public
 
03:55:20.790 --> 03:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
deposit investment pool so it's um again
 
03:55:22.269 --> 03:55:22.279 align:start position:0%
it's not a knock of the bank it's it's
 
03:55:24.229 --> 03:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
the evolution of the of the PIP you can
 
03:55:25.389 --> 03:55:25.399 align:start position:0%
just see it in the history they
 
03:55:27.910 --> 03:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
recognize it's it's different made some
 
03:55:29.110 --> 03:55:29.120 align:start position:0%
changes took it out of the banking
 
03:55:31.229 --> 03:55:31.239 align:start position:0%
Department left the bank is hanging
 
03:55:33.830 --> 03:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
there the bank is are a vestage of the
 
03:55:36.910 --> 03:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
original P dip in 1991 if you was
 
03:55:40.429 --> 03:55:40.439 align:start position:0%
forming a p dip today uh it's I guess
 
03:55:42.070 --> 03:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
the bank would come in and testify
 
03:55:44.550 --> 03:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
against it as they did in 91 uh maybe it
 
03:55:47.229 --> 03:55:47.239 align:start position:0%
was a compromise you don't protest too
 
03:55:48.429 --> 03:55:48.439 align:start position:0%
greatly and we'll put two of you on the
 
03:55:50.309 --> 03:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
board I don't know how they got on the
 
03:55:52.269 --> 03:55:52.279 align:start position:0%
board there's no legislative history on
 
03:55:55.550 --> 03:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
it uh but I would suggest that this bill
 
03:55:57.429 --> 03:55:57.439 align:start position:0%
improves the public deposit investment
 
03:55:59.189 --> 03:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
pool in New
 
03:56:02.670 --> 03:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you are there other
 
03:56:06.710 --> 03:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
questions repres of sers thank you madam
 
03:56:09.429 --> 03:56:09.439 align:start position:0%
chair is there any example that you can
 
03:56:13.189 --> 03:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
give that the the public deposit
 
03:56:15.149 --> 03:56:15.159 align:start position:0%
investment pool
 
03:56:18.389 --> 03:56:18.399 align:start position:0%
did not make the amount of money they
 
03:56:20.870 --> 03:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
should have or made wrong
 
03:56:23.950 --> 03:56:23.960 align:start position:0%
investments in the well I don't have the
 
03:56:25.790 --> 03:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
anal the analytics but I do know that
 
03:56:28.910 --> 03:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
they've returned a solid return on
 
03:56:31.070 --> 03:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
investment for the last 30 years they've
 
03:56:33.990 --> 03:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
never a a a shareholder in the pool has
 
03:56:37.149 --> 03:56:37.159 align:start position:0%
never lost any money so whether or not
 
03:56:38.990 --> 03:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh they could have made more money but I
 
03:56:40.750 --> 03:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
don't know but they are restricted to
 
03:56:43.910 --> 03:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
certain uh highly uh secure Investments
 
03:56:45.550 --> 03:56:45.560 align:start position:0%
and also shortterm I think the longest
 
03:56:48.229 --> 03:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
term investment they have is 270 days so
 
03:56:49.790 --> 03:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
doing commercial paper and all kinds of
 
03:56:52.790 --> 03:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
different things but they can't they're
 
03:56:54.070 --> 03:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
not looking for the maximum return
 
03:56:55.469 --> 03:56:55.479 align:start position:0%
they're looking for the best return with
 
03:56:58.030 --> 03:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
the most security so their performance
 
03:57:00.469 --> 03:57:00.479 align:start position:0%
is judged U every quarter by the
 
03:57:02.550 --> 03:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
advisory committee uh if they had a goal
 
03:57:05.670 --> 03:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
of 4% uh and they came in at 3.5 then
 
03:57:07.710 --> 03:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to say why uh but
 
03:57:10.950 --> 03:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
they do report the returns every quarter
 
03:57:12.670 --> 03:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
and they set their goals and they set
 
03:57:15.309 --> 03:57:15.319 align:start position:0%
the parameters so the um and the P so
 
03:57:17.189 --> 03:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
far has been it's been quite good over
 
03:57:21.309 --> 03:57:21.319 align:start position:0%
the last 30 years and again it's it's
 
03:57:23.590 --> 03:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
the municipal money and the trustees
 
03:57:25.910 --> 03:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
money that is put in the pool is not
 
03:57:27.790 --> 03:57:27.800 align:start position:0%
100% of a city Town's money it's a
 
03:57:29.510 --> 03:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
portion that the the manager the
 
03:57:32.149 --> 03:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
decision maker says we can get some
 
03:57:33.870 --> 03:57:33.880 align:start position:0%
short-term interest on these funds that
 
03:57:36.750 --> 03:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
are right now in in January 2025 not
 
03:57:38.830 --> 03:57:38.840 align:start position:0%
dedicated to something the non-dedicated
 
03:57:40.469 --> 03:57:40.479 align:start position:0%
funds if all the property tax money
 
03:57:42.590 --> 03:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
comes in on Tuesday you've got uh a
 
03:57:44.550 --> 03:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars you need to place to put
 
03:57:45.910 --> 03:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
that to get the best return that's the
 
03:57:47.429 --> 03:57:47.439 align:start position:0%
type of money the PDF handles it moves
 
03:57:48.830 --> 03:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
that money and you can get that money
 
03:57:52.309 --> 03:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
back in 24 hours it's very liquid so uh
 
03:57:53.630 --> 03:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
how are they doing I think they're doing
 
03:57:53.640 --> 03:57:55.349 align:start position:0%
how are they doing I think they're doing
pretty

03:57:55.349 --> 03:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
03:57:55.359 --> 03:57:56.870 align:start position:0%
pretty
good

03:57:56.870 --> 03:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:58:00.510 --> 03:58:00.520 align:start position:0%

Edwards thank
 
04:03:01.590 --> 04:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you madam chair I'm uh
 
04:03:03.710 --> 04:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
representative Jess Edwards I represent
 
04:03:07.830 --> 04:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
the towns of Auburn Candia Chester and
 
04:03:11.590 --> 04:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
Deerfield that's Rockingham District 31
 
04:03:14.990 --> 04:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm uh
 
04:03:17.229 --> 04:03:17.239 align:start position:0%
I also happen to be the chair of
 
04:03:20.830 --> 04:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
division 3 Finance but but today uh more
 
04:03:23.309 --> 04:03:23.319 align:start position:0%
than anything I've come in as a member
 
04:03:25.750 --> 04:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
that's been appointed to the um
 
04:03:28.790 --> 04:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board um
 
04:03:30.750 --> 04:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
as a speaker's appointment I think for
 
04:03:33.269 --> 04:03:33.279 align:start position:0%
five years I've been on it for three and
 
04:03:35.550 --> 04:03:35.560 align:start position:0%
a half years and I've been following the
 
04:03:38.510 --> 04:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
PAB since uh its Inception since before
 
04:03:38.520 --> 04:03:39.269 align:start position:0%
PAB since uh its Inception since before
its

04:03:39.269 --> 04:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
its
 
04:03:42.670 --> 04:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
Inception so what uh what I've learned
 
04:03:45.269 --> 04:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
uh from being a member of the of the
 
04:03:48.149 --> 04:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
commission is that is that the initial
 
04:03:51.389 --> 04:03:51.399 align:start position:0%
legislation needed some some tweaking so
 
04:03:55.309 --> 04:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
I broke it into two parts um the uh
 
04:03:57.429 --> 04:03:57.439 align:start position:0%
first one of the two parts you have here
 
04:04:00.750 --> 04:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
today this is this is some a fine-tuning
 
04:04:02.910 --> 04:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
of some organizational issues just to
 
04:04:05.950 --> 04:04:05.960 align:start position:0%
clean up the statute for the most part
 
04:04:08.349 --> 04:04:08.359 align:start position:0%
uh I'll I'll walk you through it the the
 
04:04:12.950 --> 04:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
reasons for um um on on page what is
 
04:04:15.389 --> 04:04:15.399 align:start position:0%
that number is that to we only have
 
04:04:17.189 --> 04:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
there's only one the one page right of
 
04:04:21.630 --> 04:04:21.640 align:start position:0%
text so so on that page um under Roman
 
04:04:25.110 --> 04:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
numeral uh six uh starting on lines
 
04:04:27.070 --> 04:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
three and running through six there's
 
04:04:29.309 --> 04:04:29.319 align:start position:0%
there's uh or seven there's a couple of
 
04:04:31.670 --> 04:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
tweaks to that and and the reason for
 
04:04:34.389 --> 04:04:34.399 align:start position:0%
those are we realized as we were looking
 
04:04:37.030 --> 04:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
at how much money the state spends on
 
04:04:41.030 --> 04:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs that the initial
 
04:04:45.990 --> 04:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
legislation uh cast slightly narrow net
 
04:04:48.510 --> 04:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
and that our data would be better our
 
04:04:51.030 --> 04:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations would be better honed if
 
04:04:52.870 --> 04:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
we also include the Department of
 
04:04:54.590 --> 04:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
Corrections like the Department of
 
04:04:57.790 --> 04:04:57.800 align:start position:0%
Corrections didn't fit under the initial
 
04:05:00.070 --> 04:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
definition but as we're looking at how
 
04:05:02.030 --> 04:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
much money the state spends on
 
04:05:03.790 --> 04:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs certainly we spend a
 
04:05:05.910 --> 04:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
lot of money through Corrections and we
 
04:05:08.510 --> 04:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
we wanted to bring that into the fold so
 
04:05:10.830 --> 04:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
that's what that addition
 
04:05:14.950 --> 04:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
is uh then down in Roman numeral what is
 
04:05:18.070 --> 04:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
that is that a that's a four anyways
 
04:05:19.349 --> 04:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
it's line
 
04:05:22.189 --> 04:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
17 um through
 
04:05:27.030 --> 04:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
20 uh the original charter basically
 
04:05:30.189 --> 04:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
said that uh once elected chairman the
 
04:05:31.750 --> 04:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
implication was they would remain
 
04:05:35.110 --> 04:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
chairman until um their five years that
 
04:05:38.189 --> 04:05:38.199 align:start position:0%
had expired so this was just to make
 
04:05:40.750 --> 04:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
sure that we every couple years we took
 
04:05:42.830 --> 04:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
a fresh look at the chair position to
 
04:05:45.389 --> 04:05:45.399 align:start position:0%
make sure that the the leadership was uh
 
04:05:48.269 --> 04:05:48.279 align:start position:0%
was appropriate so this is this this is
 
04:05:51.149 --> 04:05:51.159 align:start position:0%
something that the current chair um uh
 
04:05:53.110 --> 04:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
approved of he he he didn't win his
 
04:05:55.910 --> 04:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
reelection but but he worked with the
 
04:05:58.149 --> 04:05:58.159 align:start position:0%
senator Rosenwald and I to to come up
 
04:06:00.349 --> 04:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
with this language and and he was okay
 
04:06:06.030 --> 04:06:06.040 align:start position:0%
with that um then um down here starting
 
04:06:08.710 --> 04:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
on lines 23 and running through
 
04:06:11.910 --> 04:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
29 um for some reason my my colleagues
 
04:06:13.830 --> 04:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
thought it was important to be very very
 
04:06:16.910 --> 04:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
specific about our wanting the executive
 
04:06:20.790 --> 04:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
director to uh feel like um in this case
 
04:06:23.710 --> 04:06:23.720 align:start position:0%
a he he to have him feel like he had
 
04:06:26.910 --> 04:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
some job security uh it had been set up
 
04:06:28.750 --> 04:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
in my mind like every other state
 
04:06:31.750 --> 04:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
employee that as long as you had money
 
04:06:34.030 --> 04:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
and a job you you you had your
 
04:06:36.429 --> 04:06:36.439 align:start position:0%
employment but but this was meant to
 
04:06:38.710 --> 04:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
take a guy who's relatively young 30
 
04:06:41.070 --> 04:06:41.080 align:start position:0%
years old or so and not from New
 
04:06:43.910 --> 04:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh and and it was an
 
04:06:45.710 --> 04:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
attempt to uh give the guy an
 
04:06:48.590 --> 04:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to feel like he had uh some
 
04:06:52.149 --> 04:06:52.159 align:start position:0%
stability um so so that's that's what
 
04:06:55.670 --> 04:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
that does um and I think I've I've
 
04:06:58.469 --> 04:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
walked through the key parts of this um
 
04:07:00.469 --> 04:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
I think it's just sort of some uh
 
04:07:03.030 --> 04:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
administrative moving around of the deck
 
04:07:05.990 --> 04:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
chairs um and I I I don't think it's
 
04:07:08.189 --> 04:07:08.199 align:start position:0%
controversial it was done with key
 
04:07:11.630 --> 04:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
leadership of the PAB uh in um in
 
04:07:14.469 --> 04:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
conjunction with me
 
04:07:17.349 --> 04:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any
 
04:07:20.229 --> 04:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
questions represent Leon uh thank you
 
04:07:22.229 --> 04:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
madam chair this is an area that I know
 
04:07:24.389 --> 04:07:24.399 align:start position:0%
a little bit about but not a lot about
 
04:07:27.990 --> 04:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
yeah um I guess first it sounds like the
 
04:07:29.630 --> 04:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage plan wasn't even
 
04:07:31.469 --> 04:07:31.479 align:start position:0%
included in this
 
04:07:33.750 --> 04:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
information it's uh with the health
 
04:07:35.109 --> 04:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
plans actually sorry that was just more
 
04:07:37.030 --> 04:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
of a curiosity no under the first
 
04:07:39.710 --> 04:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
definition all the Medicaid money that
 
04:07:41.550 --> 04:07:41.560 align:start position:0%
that's actually the core source of the
 
04:07:43.510 --> 04:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
data that we get from the Department of
 
04:07:47.030 --> 04:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
Insurance uh data feeds okay thank you

04:07:55.030 --> 04:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
beyond the scope of this Ed Edwards you
 
04:07:57.790 --> 04:07:57.800 align:start position:0%
said Edgar but that that's all I didn't
 
04:07:59.590 --> 04:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
mean to that's all right I knew who you
 
04:08:01.830 --> 04:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
were talking to
 
04:08:04.750 --> 04:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
04:08:07.910 --> 04:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh the this is beyond the scope of this
 
04:08:10.870 --> 04:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
bill but I'm going to ask you to comment
 
04:08:13.590 --> 04:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
anyway from my perspective when this
 
04:08:16.990 --> 04:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
things started it sounds like that might
 
04:08:19.790 --> 04:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
have been a good idea but is this worth
 
04:08:22.109 --> 04:08:22.119 align:start position:0%
a full-time board a full-time guy that
 
04:08:25.269 --> 04:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
needs a job stability isn't this just F
 
04:08:28.229 --> 04:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
fine-tuning how much drug work do you
 
04:08:30.510 --> 04:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
need to be doing on a continuous basis
 
04:08:32.469 --> 04:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
with the board and all of this seems
 
04:08:34.950 --> 04:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
like a lot of apparatus
 
04:08:38.510 --> 04:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
for uh fine-tuning something that once
 
04:08:45.389 --> 04:08:45.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:47.950 --> 04:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
I'm G to I'm going to be careful here um
 
04:08:51.149 --> 04:08:51.159 align:start position:0%
I I I have U multiple personalities on
 
04:08:55.349 --> 04:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
this one um I I have the division three
 
04:08:57.389 --> 04:08:57.399 align:start position:0%
position of where I'm supposed to come
 
04:08:58.950 --> 04:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
up with the funding for this I'm
 
04:09:01.910 --> 04:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
actually on the commission uh I was one
 
04:09:04.830 --> 04:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
of the early opponents of the bill uh
 
04:09:07.389 --> 04:09:07.399 align:start position:0%
and uh I've I've worked or or with the
 
04:09:12.590 --> 04:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
PAB to be fair and um and so so I'm
 
04:09:14.630 --> 04:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
going to try to answer your question and
 
04:09:17.910 --> 04:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
and and and walk some fine lines there
 
04:09:23.309 --> 04:09:23.319 align:start position:0%
um the pdab is set up as uh as a board
 
04:09:27.070 --> 04:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
that does not expire it goes as as long
 
04:09:30.469 --> 04:09:30.479 align:start position:0%
as the legislation is in place uh it
 
04:09:33.950 --> 04:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
relies on General funds for its two-year
 
04:09:36.750 --> 04:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
budget cycle it's supposed to submit its
 
04:09:38.990 --> 04:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
budget through the Department of Health
 
04:09:41.990 --> 04:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
and Human Services where it's attached
 
04:09:46.630 --> 04:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
um other than some basic uh soft uh
 
04:09:49.389 --> 04:09:49.399 align:start position:0%
admin support the Department of Health
 
04:09:52.349 --> 04:09:52.359 align:start position:0%
and Human Services provides no oversight
 
04:09:53.990 --> 04:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
this is a a very
 
04:09:59.070 --> 04:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
autonomous uh entity U by Statute um
 
04:10:02.750 --> 04:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's uh specifically obligated to
 
04:10:06.149 --> 04:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
develop an annual report to to to report
 
04:10:09.429 --> 04:10:09.439 align:start position:0%
out on uh the statistics that are
 
04:10:11.469 --> 04:10:11.479 align:start position:0%
determined to be relevant to our
 
04:10:14.070 --> 04:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
prescription drug expenditure
 
04:10:16.469 --> 04:10:16.479 align:start position:0%
and also potentially to provide
 
04:10:19.309 --> 04:10:19.319 align:start position:0%
recommendations on how uh the purchasing
 
04:10:22.309 --> 04:10:22.319 align:start position:0%
entities may get lower prices I mean
 
04:10:25.030 --> 04:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
that's really where the the money is
 
04:10:28.030 --> 04:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
supposedly in this board is in the value
 
04:10:29.309 --> 04:10:29.319 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:10:32.630 --> 04:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations that are intended to let
 
04:10:35.109 --> 04:10:35.119 align:start position:0%
payers not the board itself it has no
 
04:10:37.790 --> 04:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
Authority but to make recommendations so
 
04:10:41.309 --> 04:10:41.319 align:start position:0%
that the purchasers get better pricing
 
04:10:42.830 --> 04:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
and that's how we're supposed to save
 
04:10:42.840 --> 04:10:45.149 align:start position:0%
and that's how we're supposed to save
money

04:10:45.149 --> 04:10:45.159 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:10:48.469 --> 04:10:48.479 align:start position:0%
follow I'm really can't let you get away
 
04:10:51.309 --> 04:10:51.319 align:start position:0%
with that um by which I mean
 
04:10:53.750 --> 04:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative scitech I'm sorry uh
 
04:10:56.109 --> 04:10:56.119 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards that's a fine
 
04:10:57.710 --> 04:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
recitation of what the board's supposed
 
04:11:00.990 --> 04:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
to be doing and I that I would support
 
04:11:02.990 --> 04:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
that as a it doesn't matter what I
 
04:11:06.429 --> 04:11:06.439 align:start position:0%
support right um is does that need all
 
04:11:09.030 --> 04:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
this apparatus on a continuous basis
 
04:11:13.469 --> 04:11:13.479 align:start position:0%
that's the Crux of my question
 
04:11:16.670 --> 04:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
um I I think if you were to speak with
 
04:11:19.550 --> 04:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
various people you would get uh various
 
04:11:24.990 --> 04:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
responses to that um we uh had in law U
 
04:11:28.590 --> 04:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
the conduct of a of a redundancy review
 
04:11:31.950 --> 04:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
by the department of uh insurance and it
 
04:11:36.030 --> 04:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
was a pretty thorough review and the
 
04:11:38.750 --> 04:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
number of redundancies between this
 
04:11:41.990 --> 04:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
board and other entities are pretty
 
04:11:44.429 --> 04:11:44.439 align:start position:0%
significant lots of redundancies and the
 
04:11:49.550 --> 04:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
key one is um related to reporting out
 
04:11:52.309 --> 04:11:52.319 align:start position:0%
the 50 most expensive drugs by three
 
04:11:54.590 --> 04:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
different categories that was already
 
04:11:56.030 --> 04:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
being done by the department of
 
04:11:59.309 --> 04:11:59.319 align:start position:0%
insurance and so it's a core piece of uh
 
04:12:02.750 --> 04:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
this most recent annual report and and
 
04:12:05.149 --> 04:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
then there was a lot of material that
 
04:12:09.670 --> 04:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
sort of packaged it but um I think uh if
 
04:12:12.389 --> 04:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
I were to say was this worth you know
 
04:12:12.399 --> 04:12:13.790 align:start position:0%
I were to say was this worth you know
500,000

04:12:13.790 --> 04:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
500,000
 
04:12:18.710 --> 04:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
as a report as a as a budget guy um I it
 
04:12:21.189 --> 04:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
would be difficult for me to ask for
 
04:12:22.790 --> 04:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
that kind of money for that kind of a
 
04:12:22.800 --> 04:12:25.990 align:start position:0%
that kind of money for that kind of a
redundant

04:12:25.990 --> 04:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:29.870 --> 04:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:32.750 --> 04:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
brother thank you um representative
 
04:12:36.429 --> 04:12:36.439 align:start position:0%
Edwards we had I believe approved an
 
04:12:39.790 --> 04:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
executive director for this right for
 
04:12:42.830 --> 04:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
two years right right it's and and and
 
04:12:45.149 --> 04:12:45.159 align:start position:0%
he got hired he didn't get hired
 
04:12:47.389 --> 04:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
immediately but he did get hired and
 
04:12:49.950 --> 04:12:49.960 align:start position:0%
he's we've been working for well over a
 
04:12:52.389 --> 04:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
year now and and he and his
 
04:12:55.950 --> 04:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
current position continues um at least
 
04:12:58.429 --> 04:12:58.439 align:start position:0%
through the fiscal year and as long as
 
04:13:00.790 --> 04:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
we continue to put money into the PAB
 
04:13:04.189 --> 04:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
budget I I think he uh that position is
 
04:13:06.590 --> 04:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
going to continue to be funded yes
 
04:13:06.600 --> 04:13:07.630 align:start position:0%
going to continue to be funded yes
follow

04:13:07.630 --> 04:13:07.640 align:start position:0%
follow
 
04:13:10.710 --> 04:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
up so in other state agencies or other
 
04:13:12.469 --> 04:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
entities like this we don't have bills
 
04:13:16.830 --> 04:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
that say we want to fund a position I
 
04:13:18.870 --> 04:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
mean now that it's set up it should be a
 
04:13:22.109 --> 04:13:22.119 align:start position:0%
a financial decision and shouldn't be a
 
04:13:25.309 --> 04:13:25.319 align:start position:0%
policy decision I mean that's my feeling
 
04:13:27.309 --> 04:13:27.319 align:start position:0%
I can understand how you want to change
 
04:13:30.630 --> 04:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
the definition of payer but then adding
 
04:13:34.070 --> 04:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
you know a guarantee of a job in a
 
04:13:36.269 --> 04:13:36.279 align:start position:0%
bill I I just want to is that what
 
04:13:37.910 --> 04:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
you're is that what you're asking us to
 
04:13:40.630 --> 04:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
do uh that's that's what the bill
 
04:13:44.389 --> 04:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
proposes and the bill was a compr romise
 
04:13:47.670 --> 04:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
with me and and and two other people uh
 
04:13:49.750 --> 04:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
and I thought this was an odd thing to
 
04:13:52.790 --> 04:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
put into a bill but in order to make
 
04:13:55.349 --> 04:13:55.359 align:start position:0%
sure that we could provide the committee
 
04:13:58.070 --> 04:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
with the bill from all three of us it's
 
04:14:00.870 --> 04:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:04.149 --> 04:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
there thank you representam uh thank you
 
04:14:06.189 --> 04:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you representative
 
04:14:09.349 --> 04:14:09.359 align:start position:0%
um it pricing of drugs and the cost of
 
04:14:11.830 --> 04:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
drugs has really changed over the last
 
04:14:13.550 --> 04:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
number of years it used to be really
 
04:14:16.070 --> 04:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
competitive really Dynamic Marketplace
 
04:14:17.950 --> 04:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
but a lot of that is sort of collapsing
 
04:14:19.870 --> 04:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
in upon itself with everything being
 
04:14:22.389 --> 04:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
based around the Medicaid rates and just
 
04:14:24.950 --> 04:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
collapsing into itself um this seems
 
04:14:28.269 --> 04:14:28.279 align:start position:0%
really complex given that uh pricing
 
04:14:30.030 --> 04:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
negotiations have really changed and I'm
 
04:14:31.630 --> 04:14:31.640 align:start position:0%
just curious
 
04:14:35.389 --> 04:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
if if the value we get from having this
 
04:14:37.670 --> 04:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
board is enough to offset some of the
 
04:14:39.030 --> 04:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
other really important things that we do
 
04:14:40.429 --> 04:14:40.439 align:start position:0%
in this state I mean we unfortunately
 
04:14:42.309 --> 04:14:42.319 align:start position:0%
had to shut down a position to help
 
04:14:43.830 --> 04:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
people from America core and peace core
 
04:14:45.870 --> 04:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
because we can't afford to do that right
 
04:14:48.590 --> 04:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
now and it just seems very hard for me
 
04:14:50.670 --> 04:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
to justify putting in that POS the
 
04:14:53.590 --> 04:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
executive director position for longer
 
04:14:55.149 --> 04:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
when we're not sure about the value and
 
04:14:56.790 --> 04:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
it has the redundancies how much do you
 
04:14:58.670 --> 04:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
think it would cost if we were to remove
 
04:15:00.590 --> 04:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
those parts that were found in the the
 
04:15:03.790 --> 04:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
review that had the redundancies well uh
 
04:15:06.790 --> 04:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um I I may
 
04:15:09.870 --> 04:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
not answer that directly but I I'd say
 
04:15:12.590 --> 04:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
that uh the agency budget submission for
 
04:15:15.790 --> 04:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
the next budget is at
 
04:15:18.870 --> 04:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
$257,000 for uh the next year and I
 
04:15:21.830 --> 04:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
think it's like 265 or something like
 
04:15:24.790 --> 04:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
that in the second year and that money
 
04:15:27.349 --> 04:15:27.359 align:start position:0%
includes funding for the executive
 
04:15:30.149 --> 04:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
director and um and although I've not
 
04:15:32.590 --> 04:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
done a formal review on it I suspect
 
04:15:35.630 --> 04:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
that there's also money in there to um
 
04:15:37.990 --> 04:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
to go to vendors to ask for additional
 
04:15:40.389 --> 04:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
supplemental data to help us with our
 
04:15:43.070 --> 04:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
analysis uh there may be some money in
 
04:15:45.349 --> 04:15:45.359 align:start position:0%
there for a contract person's because
 
04:15:47.790 --> 04:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of work for the executive
 
04:15:51.670 --> 04:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
director um and could you just remind me
 
04:15:54.070 --> 04:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
of the key key part of your question
 
04:15:56.750 --> 04:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
because I think I just missed it um the
 
04:15:59.149 --> 04:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
key part was just trying to understand
 
04:16:00.830 --> 04:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
oh is it worth it is it Val it's worth
 
04:16:03.269 --> 04:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
it um what the price is and if if there
 
04:16:04.670 --> 04:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
would be a way to trim it down to
 
04:16:06.550 --> 04:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
something that's more that better
 
04:16:08.670 --> 04:16:08.680 align:start position:0%
recognizes the the pressures that we're
 
04:16:12.910 --> 04:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
facing today I I I would say that there
 
04:16:15.790 --> 04:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
are unlimited wants and limited
 
04:16:18.229 --> 04:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
resources and that this budget cycle is
 
04:16:20.269 --> 04:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
going to make that painfully apparent to
 
04:16:23.670 --> 04:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
every legislator because we know that
 
04:16:26.149 --> 04:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
historically our if we continued with
 
04:16:29.269 --> 04:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
our expenses that that would exceed the
 
04:16:34.109 --> 04:16:34.119 align:start position:0%
available uh um revenues and so we have
 
04:16:36.109 --> 04:16:36.119 align:start position:0%
very difficult decisions to make where
 
04:16:38.269 --> 04:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
we have to make those kinds of tradeoffs
 
04:16:41.309 --> 04:16:41.319 align:start position:0%
and one person's judgment on on utility
 
04:16:44.349 --> 04:16:44.359 align:start position:0%
and value is going to be a little bit
 
04:16:48.950 --> 04:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
subjective uh and so um so I I I I I
 
04:16:50.590 --> 04:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
guess I would leave it to every member
 
04:16:54.510 --> 04:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee to say um is it worth a
 
04:16:58.630 --> 04:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
quarter million dollars a year to get in
 
04:17:03.349 --> 04:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
a report a very Nic looking report uh
 
04:17:06.590 --> 04:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
data that we could get directly from the
 
04:17:11.109 --> 04:17:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:13.469 --> 04:17:13.479 align:start position:0%
anyways good question
 
04:17:16.309 --> 04:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
and as a followup um do you know if
 
04:17:17.790 --> 04:17:17.800 align:start position:0%
there's any specific harm that would
 
04:17:20.109 --> 04:17:20.119 align:start position:0%
come from removing removing the funding
 
04:17:23.070 --> 04:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
from this and removing the the PAB here
 
04:17:27.189 --> 04:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
okay so we we we um the the chair and I
 
04:17:29.229 --> 04:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
came in late after the chair had
 
04:17:31.990 --> 04:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
struggled mightily former representative
 
04:17:35.070 --> 04:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
Gary Merchant who many people know he he
 
04:17:37.950 --> 04:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
did just a great job uh in a volunteer
 
04:17:40.710 --> 04:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
role kind of standing up the pdab and
 
04:17:43.790 --> 04:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
trying to get it going and uh we really
 
04:17:47.229 --> 04:17:47.239 align:start position:0%
were just slogging in the mud until they
 
04:17:49.229 --> 04:17:49.239 align:start position:0%
could hire an executive director and it
 
04:17:52.189 --> 04:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
was after the that full-time person
 
04:17:55.670 --> 04:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
became employed and focused that we
 
04:17:58.550 --> 04:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
started to make some some gains and like
 
04:18:00.309 --> 04:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
I said the annual report's a beautiful
 
04:18:02.070 --> 04:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
thing there's a lot of information in it
 
04:18:04.070 --> 04:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
it you know most of it is not
 
04:18:07.389 --> 04:18:07.399 align:start position:0%
statutorily required but um but if we
 
04:18:09.950 --> 04:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
were to cut the budget much you would
 
04:18:13.349 --> 04:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
cut into uh the ability to
 
04:18:15.990 --> 04:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
continue the employment of the executive
 
04:18:18.269 --> 04:18:18.279 align:start position:0%
director fairly quickly right because
 
04:18:22.149 --> 04:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
you can tell that's about 150 of the
 
04:18:25.389 --> 04:18:25.399 align:start position:0%
$250,000 so I I I think if you if you
 
04:18:27.229 --> 04:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
were to look if you were looking to
 
04:18:31.429 --> 04:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
reduce this it would either be uh that
 
04:18:34.990 --> 04:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
that 100,000 above the pay is is the
 
04:18:38.229 --> 04:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
play area and if you cut below that you
 
04:18:40.550 --> 04:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
may as well shut down the pdb because
 
04:18:42.229 --> 04:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
without the executive director it can
 
04:18:46.389 --> 04:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
produce nothing in my opinion follow and
 
04:18:48.630 --> 04:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
as my one last followup um actually the
 
04:18:50.590 --> 04:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
former representative you mentioned is
 
04:18:53.429 --> 04:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
one of my favorite people um absolutely
 
04:18:56.590 --> 04:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
and my big question here is is this
 
04:18:58.070 --> 04:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
something that was functioning as well
 
04:18:59.830 --> 04:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
as it was just because it was in such
 
04:18:59.840 --> 04:19:00.870 align:start position:0%
as it was just because it was in such
capable

04:19:00.870 --> 04:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
capable
 
04:19:04.429 --> 04:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
hands well you know the the former
 
04:19:07.429 --> 04:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
representative his uh continuity in the
 
04:19:09.309 --> 04:19:09.319 align:start position:0%
board continues he's still the chair of
 
04:19:12.189 --> 04:19:12.199 align:start position:0%
the PAB uh and I'm sure he's watching
 
04:19:14.830 --> 04:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
and listening right now and I'm so sorry
 
04:19:17.149 --> 04:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
uh for for not being a stronger
 
04:19:19.510 --> 04:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
supporter of the pdab I just I've just
 
04:19:21.469 --> 04:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
always worried about the redundancy in
 
04:19:23.229 --> 04:19:23.239 align:start position:0%
them especially now with the new
 
04:19:25.469 --> 04:19:25.479 align:start position:0%
Administration I think the whole
 
04:19:28.149 --> 04:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
prescription drug environment's changing
 
04:19:31.070 --> 04:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
I think uh there are multiple states in
 
04:19:34.269 --> 04:19:34.279 align:start position:0%
the nation that have pabs where I where
 
04:19:36.269 --> 04:19:36.279 align:start position:0%
if we're looking for recommendations on
 
04:19:38.870 --> 04:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
what to do I think it may be better just
 
04:19:41.189 --> 04:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
to hire somebody to collect and
 
04:19:43.429 --> 04:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
aggregate the state report and look for
 
04:19:45.469 --> 04:19:45.479 align:start position:0%
the three or four great ideas that would
 
04:19:48.109 --> 04:19:48.119 align:start position:0%
work here in New Hampshire I I I think I
 
04:19:52.510 --> 04:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
think we could um achieve the important
 
04:19:55.189 --> 04:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
objectives of the board in a different
 
04:19:57.750 --> 04:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
way and I I I feel like I've really
 
04:20:00.070 --> 04:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
strayed because this bill was intended
 
04:20:03.590 --> 04:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
to just be a a cleanup um and a
 
04:20:06.429 --> 04:20:06.439 align:start position:0%
reorientation of U how the PAB is
 
04:20:09.510 --> 04:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
structured and so I I'm happy to answer
 
04:20:12.189 --> 04:20:12.199 align:start position:0%
questions it's just further a field than
 
04:20:14.710 --> 04:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
what I thought thank you okay
 
04:20:16.670 --> 04:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
representative pearon thank you madam
 
04:20:19.229 --> 04:20:19.239 align:start position:0%
chair thank you he representative
 
04:20:22.510 --> 04:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
Edwards um you know as
 
04:20:25.469 --> 04:20:25.479 align:start position:0%
a as in existence right the drug
 
04:20:28.030 --> 04:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
affability board was created with a
 
04:20:30.349 --> 04:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
charge right was created with an i you
 
04:20:32.950 --> 04:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
know like this is what we want you to do
 
04:20:36.030 --> 04:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
has when you refer to the the changes in
 
04:20:38.910 --> 04:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
the invol in the evolvement of of
 
04:20:40.990 --> 04:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs in in the nature of
 
04:20:44.109 --> 04:20:44.119 align:start position:0%
that Universe does does this simply need
 
04:20:46.269 --> 04:20:46.279 align:start position:0%
then the charge to be modified or
 
04:20:48.109 --> 04:20:48.119 align:start position:0%
updated as to what their
 
04:20:51.229 --> 04:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and expectations are
 
04:20:53.830 --> 04:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
that there are components of that in the
 
04:20:56.309 --> 04:20:56.319 align:start position:0%
second bill I I had mentioned that I had
 
04:20:58.349 --> 04:20:58.359 align:start position:0%
split these up and this this bill was
 
04:21:00.349 --> 04:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
really meant to be sort of a cleanup of
 
04:21:02.870 --> 04:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
the organizational structure the second
 
04:21:05.309 --> 04:21:05.319 align:start position:0%
bill is going to a different committee
 
04:21:07.429 --> 04:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
and it's escaping me right now and that
 
04:21:09.710 --> 04:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
sort of detail is in the in the second
 
04:21:12.670 --> 04:21:12.680 align:start position:0%
Bill gotcha okay
 
04:21:15.149 --> 04:21:15.159 align:start position:0%
thank you other
 
04:21:18.950 --> 04:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
questions I I would I would hope like if
 
04:21:21.349 --> 04:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature were to move in and and
 
04:21:23.990 --> 04:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
and um do something dramatic with the
 
04:21:28.070 --> 04:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
pdab th this portion of the bill is fine
 
04:21:30.910 --> 04:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
it's the other bill that I think the a
 
04:21:32.149 --> 04:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
lot of these
 
04:21:36.269 --> 04:21:36.279 align:start position:0%
questions are are maybe fit better but I
 
04:21:38.429 --> 04:21:38.439 align:start position:0%
do appreciate the opportunity to address
 
04:21:40.870 --> 04:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
them in in front of this committee thank
 
04:21:43.469 --> 04:21:43.479 align:start position:0%
you for the information all right
 
04:21:59.429 --> 04:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:01.990 --> 04:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
lean thank you Madame chair uh for the
 
04:22:03.790 --> 04:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
record my name is Peter Lehman I
 
04:22:06.309 --> 04:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
represent the towns of Peterboro and
 
04:22:09.590 --> 04:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
Sharon I appear before you today against
 
04:22:09.600 --> 04:22:10.349 align:start position:0%
Sharon I appear before you today against
this

04:22:10.349 --> 04:22:10.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:22:13.389 --> 04:22:13.399 align:start position:0%
legislation like representative Edwards
 
04:22:16.389 --> 04:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh I have been following pdab for
 
04:22:19.630 --> 04:22:19.640 align:start position:0%
probably now what four years originally
 
04:22:21.750 --> 04:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
um represented Merchant and others came
 
04:22:24.269 --> 04:22:24.279 align:start position:0%
before The Joint legislative fiscal
 
04:22:25.910 --> 04:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
committee that representative Edwards
 
04:22:28.910 --> 04:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
and I serve on looking for us to provide
 
04:22:31.670 --> 04:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
the funding to establish this board that
 
04:22:34.950 --> 04:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
request was rejected and we suggested it
 
04:22:36.469 --> 04:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
should be followed through the normal
 
04:22:38.590 --> 04:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
budget process and go to a policy
 
04:22:40.429 --> 04:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
committee and not have the joint
 
04:22:43.790 --> 04:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
legislative fiscal committee make such
 
04:22:45.870 --> 04:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
decision I certainly think that
 
04:22:48.269 --> 04:22:48.279 align:start position:0%
representative scitec got it right with
 
04:22:50.710 --> 04:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
what he said I'll add to that that
 
04:22:53.030 --> 04:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
there's redundancy here there's no
 
04:22:55.750 --> 04:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
oversight we already know the insurance
 
04:22:58.670 --> 04:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
department does the same thing and in a
 
04:23:01.550 --> 04:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
year that we are strapped for funds to
 
04:23:05.630 --> 04:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
me spending $500,000 on PB when we've
 
04:23:07.790 --> 04:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
got another agency within state
 
04:23:09.229 --> 04:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
government again the insurance
 
04:23:12.149 --> 04:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
department doing the same thing is the
 
04:23:14.750 --> 04:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
reason why I oppose the bill and I'll be
 
04:23:17.269 --> 04:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions Madam chair
 
04:23:19.070 --> 04:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
04:23:20.910 --> 04:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
represent blam uh thank you madam chair
 
04:23:23.550 --> 04:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative lean um do
