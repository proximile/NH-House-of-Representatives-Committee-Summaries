Services uh so today we'll be going over
 
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 align:start position:0%
the division of Public Health Services
 
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
budget um it begins on page
 
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
98 of the governor's operating
 
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.509 align:start position:0%
98 of the governor's operating
budget

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 align:start position:0%
and Public Health Services has about a
 
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
100 accounts uh so it's it's fairly
 
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
lengthy and that that will run all the
 
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
way through Page
 
00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
984 and then as usual you have the
 
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 align:start position:0%
budget briefing book before you it's a
 
00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 align:start position:0%
66-page document again only the
 
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
accounting units in excess of a million
 
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
dollars and I will hand it over to
 
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
Trisha for today's presentation so good
 
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
morning thank you Nathan good morning

thank you chair thank you members of the
 
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
committee um I am sitting in today for
 
00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
director Ian watt he had a family
 
00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
emergency so I am pinch hitting at the
 
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 align:start position:0%
last moment so I hope that you will be
 
00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
uh patient with me as I find some of the
 
00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 align:start position:0%
answers as we go through um I am also
 
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
represented today by a number of folks
 
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
from the division of Public Health
 
00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
Services that are sitting in the gallery
 
00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
so when I Stumble we can be able to call
 
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
on them for some expertise um as well
 
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 align:start position:0%
you have heard a lot about DHHS over the
 
00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 align:start position:0%
past several weeks and I have been
 
00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 align:start position:0%
impressed with your questions and with
 
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
your stamina as you get through all of
 
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
these reports the breadth and depth of
 
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 align:start position:0%
the department is
 
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
extraordinary um of the major divisions
 
00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
Public Health has the smallest budget of
 
00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:44.439 align:start position:0%
the big divisions it has the smallest
 
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
budget and only a modest fraction of
 
00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
General funds within it um it is mainly
 
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
supported by federal funds and by other
 
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
funds that often come through fees or
 
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
licensing or some other capacity um but
 
00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
Public Health also comes with a great
 
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
deal of complexity so what it makes up
 
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
for in you know a relatively small
 
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 align:start position:0%
budget when you're comparing it to
 
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or behavioral health or
 
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
economic Services it is incredibly
 
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
complex and or at least the breath is
 
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
wide as Nathan noted we have almost 100
 
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
accounting units in it there's over 50
 
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
federal grants a lot of the work happens
 
00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 align:start position:0%
through contract so there's a lot of
 
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
detail that you could be interested in
 
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 align:start position:0%
as you make your decisions and and um
 
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
consider your options in front of you
 
00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 align:start position:0%
when you think about this budget there
 
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
were no significant um cuts to Public
 
00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 align:start position:0%
Health in the governor's budget so
 
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 align:start position:0%
that's helpful for you to know straight
 
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
up front um other than the unfund of
 
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
several positions the biggest
 
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 align:start position:0%
uncertainty for public health right now
 
00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
is what's happening at the federal level
 
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
so you know we like all of you are
 
00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
waiting for clarity and direction from
 
00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 align:start position:0%
the federal government as they switch
 
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
their priorities and as they think about
 
00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 align:start position:0%
what it is that they want to um invest
 
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
in and where are there areas that they
 
00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
may be turning away from so we are
 
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.230 align:start position:0%
may be turning away from so we are
waiting

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
waiting
 
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
like everyone else um and especially
 
00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 align:start position:0%
when you think about the fact that we
 
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
have over 50 federal grants um within
 
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
the division of Public Health that
 
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
creates some uncertainty for us that
 
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
said we've presented a budget here and
 
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
the governor has presented a budget that
 
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 align:start position:0%
assumes the work that we are doing will
 
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
continue on um I hope you will see over
 
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
the next couple of hours that both the
 
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
department and public health care about
 
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
the same things that you care about and
 
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
the things that your neighbors care
 
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
about about clean water about safe food
 
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
about preventing our kids and our loved
 
00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
ones and your neighbors from getting
 
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
sick as well as stretching and
 
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
conserving all of our limited resources
 
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
as you flip to our mission on slide two
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
can I I I I want to do a a setup
 
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
question now and and having talked to
 
00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
you for a lot the last few years I'm I'm
 
00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
sure this is going to be easy for you
 
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
but but going going into this section
 
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
there are a significant number of of
 
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.909 align:start position:0%
there are a significant number of of
people

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that say very simply and very
 
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
generally that uh the public health
 
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
budget that's being presented has grown
 
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
significantly since uh before covid and
 
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
that there really ought to be an effort
 
00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 align:start position:0%
to return it back to preco like era in
 
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 align:start position:0%
size and you and I have talked about it
 
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
I think you have uh an answer but can
 
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
you give us your sort of one paragraph
 
00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
or two paragraph summary of of how you
 
00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
respond to that sort of simple belief
 
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
sure thanks that's a great question so
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
again we all experienced we had the
 
00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759 align:start position:0%
pre-co days the pre-pandemic days there
 
00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:51.639 align:start position:0%
was work there was Federal resources
 
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 align:start position:0%
like crazy we had arpa dollars
 
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
everything stretched not only Public
 
00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
Health but every all of our work across
 
00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
Services been benefited by um uh in an
 
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
influx of funds from the federal
 
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
government we stretched it up and those
 
00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:08.759 align:start position:0%
funds have now receded so it's I at
 
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280 align:start position:0%
early on I was calling it the title
 
00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
waver the tsunami we knew the tsunami
 
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
was coming and then eventually that
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
tsunami was going to flow backwards and
 
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:19.240 align:start position:0%
that's where we are right now so what we
 
00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
I can tell you you know full-time
 
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
authorized staff we're about exactly
 
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 align:start position:0%
where we were 2018 so we had about 250
 
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
staff then we have about 250 staff now
 
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
there are some federal funds that have
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
continued to flow into the department
 
00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
that have added some increase but the
 
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
other place that you'll see where we've
 
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
increased is just by shifting things
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
around in the department as well as with
 
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
other agencies so you'll recall When I
 
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
Was Here a number of weeks ago we talked
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
about how um for example our Bureau uh
 
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
for emergency preparedness response and
 
00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:53.479 align:start position:0%
Recovery that was in a whole other
 
00:07:55.629 --> 00:07:55.639 align:start position:0%
section of the department we moved it
 
00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
into the division of Public Health and
 
00:07:58.830 --> 00:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
therefore it looks like we had a budget
 
00:08:00.749 --> 00:08:00.759 align:start position:0%
increase but when you look across the
 
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
the department it is the same similarly
 
00:08:05.309 --> 00:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
and I was had the ability to tune in a
 
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
little bit to your conversations with
 
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
the division for Economic Security
 
00:08:11.309 --> 00:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
yesterday and with director Hebert we
 
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
have some uh programs that used to be
 
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
supported or uh budgeted and funded and
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
and supported within Economic Security
 
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
that have now or dcyf that have now
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
moved over into public health so there
 
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
has been a shifting of where some of the
 
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
things are that gives the impression
 
00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
that the budget has increased but you
 
00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
have to look at it across the entire
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
department so so to that end I I was
 
00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
anticipating that as part of your answer
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
the the the consolidation of other
 
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
programs into the public health as we go
 
00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:46.519 align:start position:0%
through the budget over the next couple
 
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
hours would you try to make a point so
 
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
we don't have to keep asking you sure if
 
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
there's a program that has moved where
 
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
did it move from and and you know what
 
00:08:56.829 --> 00:08:56.839 align:start position:0%
the underlying rationale for the move
 
00:08:58.750 --> 00:08:58.760 align:start position:0%
was absolutely happy to do that thank
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
you and I'll also highlight to the best
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
that I can just eyeball it where there
 
00:09:04.829 --> 00:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
might be new federal Investments where
 
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:07.160 align:start position:0%
they weren't before 2018 I may not be
 
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
able to get all of them or have a
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
completely comprehensive list but I bet
 
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
I can eyeball some of them for you all
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
right uh thank you I'm looking forward
 
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
to this super thanks so if you flipped
 
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
to uh slide two this is our mission and
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
you'll see that one of the things that
 
00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
sets Public Health apart from other
 
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
places within the department is that its
 
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
mission is to serve every single person
 
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
in the state so we have great programs
 
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
like medic or long-term services that
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
serve vulnerable populations incredibly
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
important Public Health on the other end
 
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
by its nature serves the entire
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
population and we do that by making sure
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
your food is safe we make we do that by
 
00:09:44.069 --> 00:09:44.079 align:start position:0%
making sure the dental x-ray that you
 
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
use that the dentist is safe and we do
 
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:49.480 align:start position:0%
that by other population Health measures
 
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
we also have some targeted programs we
 
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
have some targeted programs like the
 
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
wick program the women infant and
 
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
children feeding program or we have
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
other programs that serve other vulner
 
00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
able or lowincome populations but as a
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
whole the the mission of the department
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
really is to protect and promote the
 
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
health of everyone in the state of New
 
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so um as you go to slide three
 
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
you'll begin to see that breath from
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
emergency response as um representative
 
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
Edwards noted to surveillance of
 
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
infectious disease to targeting
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
strategies that we know are going to
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
improve health we support directly folks
 
00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:30.279 align:start position:0%
like the federal equal qualified Health
 
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
Centers our community health centers we
 
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
support small hospitals with um
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
activities around quality improvement we
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
focus on chronic disease prevention and
 
00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:43.160 align:start position:0%
maternal and child health things that I
 
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959 align:start position:0%
you know that many of us are starting to
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
think are going to be continued to be
 
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
supported in a new federal
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
Administration we've heard a lot about
 
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
that from the feds right now around the
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
emphasis on chronic disease we
 
00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
anticipate a continued focus on maternal
 
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
Health we also collect and analyze data
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
about the health status of community
 
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
needs and the strengths within those
 
00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
communities and we use that dat data to
 
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
determine where we should focus our
 
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
resources and finally you know the way
 
00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
that I think about it is that public
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
health really is an invisible glue it's
 
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
helping us stay healthy we are often at
 
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
our best when we're not in the newspaper
 
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
when you don't have to think about us
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
when your medical providers are close by
 
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
and you have access to care when your
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
food and water doesn't make you sick you
 
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
know when your child's school is not
 
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
interrupted by an outbreak of measles
 
00:11:38.629 --> 00:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
that's when we're doing our job you can
 
00:11:40.629 --> 00:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
go out and eat in the community with
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
little concern about or go out and be in
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
the community with little concern of
 
00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
getting tuberculosis or breathing
 
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
Legionella in from some sort of water
 
00:11:51.389 --> 00:11:51.399 align:start position:0%
holding tank you know your milk and your
 
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
coffee is safe that's the mission of um
 
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
the division of Public Health Services
 
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
so let's get started and we'll do a
 
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
little work into the organizational
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
overview on Slide Five you'll see
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
roughly where those bureaus are um we
 
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
have a director's office and again um
 
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
director watt send his regrets about not
 
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
being here today um and there are some
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
programs within that director's office
 
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
and then we have a bureau of family
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
health and nutrition a bureau of
 
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
Infectious Disease Control a bureau of
 
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
Public Health protection our Bureau of
 
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
emergency preparedness response recovery
 
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
our Bureau of prevention and wellness
 
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:29.240 align:start position:0%
Bureau of public health statistics and
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
informatics and finally our Public
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
Health Laboratories we currently have
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
about a 15% vacancy rate across all of
 
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
those programs within in the division um
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
slide six you'll recognize from when I
 
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
was here a couple of weeks ago these are
 
00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:46.839 align:start position:0%
the bureaus that have generally stayed
 
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
the same in size and focus our lab our
 
00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:51.959 align:start position:0%
Bureau of infectious disease our Bureau
 
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:53.720 align:start position:0%
of public health statistics and
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
informatics and our Bureau of Public
 
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
Health protection those have generally
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
stayed within the same scope um and look
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
the same and organizationally are the
 
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
same um since pre pandemic did you take
 
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:14.519 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman and welcome
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
Mrs til and um thank you for everything
 
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
that you do um for the agency and for
 
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
all the public health um we've been
 
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
hearing a lot about the bird flu virus
 
00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
and I know this is just an open question
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
but where would something like this fall
 
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%
within the organizational chart that's a
 
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
super question and it speaks to the way
 
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
that our work is integrated you know
 
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
while we have all these different
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
bureaus our work crosses over every day
 
00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:45.519 align:start position:0%
so for bird flu and not only within the
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
division of Public Health Services but
 
00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:48.519 align:start position:0%
also with our other state agency
 
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
partners so when we think about bird
 
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
through there's two things there's the
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
human health aspect which is impact
 
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
which we focus on within um the division
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
of Public Health Services and the
 
00:13:59.150 --> 00:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
and then there's the animal health part
 
00:14:02.829 --> 00:14:02.839 align:start position:0%
of it which actually we partner with the
 
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture for so
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
together working with the Department of
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
a we focus within the division of Public
 
00:14:12.829 --> 00:14:12.839 align:start position:0%
Health is thinking about um safety of
 
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
food so safety of the milk Pro milk um
 
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
that we have right now so we do some
 
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
testing the FDA has requested us and
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
USDA has requested us to do some work
 
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
around testing of milk supply to make
 
00:14:26.189 --> 00:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
sure that the bird flu is not in the
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
milk as you know as many of you have
 
00:14:30.189 --> 00:14:30.199 align:start position:0%
followed this the birds can impact the
 
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
other animals that dairy cows within the
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
community um and then ultimately if
 
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
there were to be human infections that's
 
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
where both our laboratory and our Bureau
 
00:14:43.069 --> 00:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
of infectious disease and our Bureau of
 
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
emergency preparedness would all kick in
 
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
you'll see as we get to some of those um
 
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
for example when we get to the Bureau of
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
emergency preparedness we actually have
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
a slot of budgeted amount of money that
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
is unfunded from the feds but we leave
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
it there for emergency so so that if the
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
feds were to send us emergent money so
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
that we could have a response if there
 
00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
was a reason for a response we could
 
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
accept that money quickly and then
 
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
deploy it thank you very much thank you
 
00:15:15.629 --> 00:15:15.639 align:start position:0%
so slides um okay I'll move on um slides
 
00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
seven through nine again are a repeat
 
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:19.160 align:start position:0%
from when I was here a couple of weeks
 
00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
ago and they show how we reorganized
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
existing work and Incorporated it from
 
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:26.519 align:start position:0%
the other parts of the department um I
 
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
will ask representative Edwards would
 
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
you like me to go through this detail
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
again now or should we skip through or
 
00:15:33.069 --> 00:15:33.079 align:start position:0%
there questions I just don't want to
 
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
take up your time repeating so my Hope
 
00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
was that the prior uh educational form
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
that you provided us is is enough
 
00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
background for us to get more into the
 
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
metrics and of the of the of what your
 
00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:48.519 align:start position:0%
programs are doing sure and if there are
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
questions because we forget uh about
 
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
what the program is really intended to
 
00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:55.720 align:start position:0%
do you know maybe you could just give us
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
a sentence introduction and and then hit
 
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
hit how we do it and how much resource
 
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
consumption there is sure and so I think
 
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
we can probably get to that as we dig
 
00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
into the budget so this so I think 7
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
through n just as that background of how
 
00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
the deck chairs got moved around so if
 
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
we SL go to slide 10 you know this is
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
where we start getting to those key
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
budget takeaways um you'll see again the
 
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
relatively modest um budget when you're
 
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
comparing it to other parts of the
 
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
department um like Medicaid or long-term
 
00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
services and of that budget um less than
 
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
20% % is General funds so not a lot of
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
money there to move around as you all
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
are doing the hard work of making some
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
really hard decisions around um making
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
your overall state budget work so
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
probably a question for Mr White for
 
00:16:44.749 --> 00:16:44.759 align:start position:0%
context uh the general funds that go to
 
00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
Public Health what percentage of the
 
00:16:50.189 --> 00:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
total Department of Health and Human
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
Services are these General funds do
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
these General funds represent 5% of the
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
total general fund demand hand of the
 
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
department or or whatever the numberers
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
do you know and if you don't know right
 
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
away you could just tell us later
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
but sure so if if you look at the uh the
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
governor's operating budget page 984
 
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
you'll see there's a proximately $24
 
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
million of General funds budgeted in all
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
of Public Health you and and and you'll
 
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that the federal funds are
 
00:17:26.189 --> 00:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
around $135 million so pretty
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
significant when you compare that to the
 
00:17:29.039 --> 00:17:29.950 align:start position:0%
significant when you compare that to the
total

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
total
 
00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:33.039 align:start position:0%
DHHS general fund operating budget in
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget it's
 
00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:36.390 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget it's
$1.1

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
$1.1
 
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
billion so so today we're talking about
 
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
24 million of 1.1 billion so we're
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
around 2.2% of the total DHHS relatively
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
ininal amount yes yeah okay good good
 
00:17:51.789 --> 00:17:51.799 align:start position:0%
context it's maybe a rounding error is
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
the way that I would describe it
 
00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth thank you Mr
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
chairman I'd like to jump ahead a little
 
00:18:01.149 --> 00:18:01.159 align:start position:0%
bit too since we're we're doing that of
 
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
this um 18% General funds is it mostly
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
again either matching funds and
 
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:13.720 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort or is there a mix
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
between what it's used for so there's um
 
00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
a number of Standalone grants that do
 
00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
not have a matching or maintenance of
 
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
effort um there are allocated costs for
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
certain positions where individuals work
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
on certain grants and those funds um are
 
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
are allocated but but that may be from a
 
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
fixed Grant in certain cases it may be
 
00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
from um from for and other cases and it
 
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:43.240 align:start position:0%
all depends on the nature of the work um
 
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:45.640 align:start position:0%
but this works a little Public Health
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
overall generally speaking is a little
 
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
different there are matching
 
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
requirements for certain grants but it
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
depends on the grants so it's uh it's
 
00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
it's very Grant specific where we have
 
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
dozens and dozens of them within Public
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
Health and they're they're much smaller
 
00:19:02.909 --> 00:19:02.919 align:start position:0%
and that's part of the reason that you
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
know we don't have 12 accounting units
 
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
we have 100 because we have to track
 
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:10.360 align:start position:0%
each one of those separately and you'll
 
00:19:12.149 --> 00:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
see those as we go through the budget
 
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
just just for broad
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
context and again as I can eyeball as we
 
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
go through I'll sort of highlight when
 
00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:20.039 align:start position:0%
there's an accounting unit that has
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
General funds and federal funds in it I
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
think we can eyeball and number those
 
00:19:25.149 --> 00:19:25.159 align:start position:0%
and go that's a match that's a
 
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort those are
 
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
resources that were invested
 
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
is it also true that in um the 66 page
 
00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:35.480 align:start position:0%
DHHS budget briefing book for public
 
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
health that those kinds of answers can
 
00:19:41.549 --> 00:19:41.559 align:start position:0%
all be found in in this detail or is
 
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
that overlooked occasionally you know
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
what I would expect that most of those
 
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
details are in there I would never say
 
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
that anything is completely ACC
 
00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
completely complete so you you do have a
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
resource uh representative NV thank you
 
00:19:56.669 --> 00:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Mr Telly uh I'm
 
00:19:59.710 --> 00:19:59.720 align:start position:0%
looking at uh 9008 the St starting page
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
here I'm looking at the uh number of
 
00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
positions which looks like it's you know
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
close to doubled and I'm I'm assuming
 
00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:10.919 align:start position:0%
that that's part of the reorganiza where
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
some of those positions in other places
 
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
move from other places and that would
 
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
see a corresponding offset yes is that
 
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank Youk and and for General
 
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
context if you did look at if you turn
 
00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:25.240 align:start position:0%
to page
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
984 that summarizes the total count of
 
00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:29.720 align:start position:0%
positions for the division and you'll
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
actually see a net reduction of one
 
00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
unclassified position to the total count
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
so there will be movement within the
 
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
accounting units but broadly speaking
 
00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
the the numbers are remaining
 
00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
neutral and a quick
 
00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
followup so of the positions how many of
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
those are are
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
unfilled we have about a 15% vacancy
 
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039 align:start position:0%
rate right now and that's a broad number
 
00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
across um but it's in that ballpark okay
 
00:21:00.909 --> 00:21:00.919 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so so so I'd like to
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
follow up on that I uh because uh
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
Manpower costs are are significant part
 
00:21:11.549 --> 00:21:11.559 align:start position:0%
of every budget um uh is the following
 
00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
accurate that uh in the last two budget
 
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
years uh the entire department has had
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
three a ceiling of 3,000 full-time
 
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
permanent employees imposed on it and
 
00:21:26.669 --> 00:21:26.679 align:start position:0%
that in the governor's budget the
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
governor asked how many vac encies are
 
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
were Department wide the number was
 
00:21:36.029 --> 00:21:36.039 align:start position:0%
450 and so uh she's asked in her budget
 
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
to reduce by 400 so effectively you have
 
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.510 align:start position:0%
to reduce by 400 so effectively you have
a

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
2600 Manpower ceiling for the coming
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
budget is is is that is that accurate no
 
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
part of it is part this is what I'm why
 
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
I'm asking sure so um and I I can
 
00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
provide a little bit of History so in
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
the prior Bia we in in chapter law um
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
3,000 cap and that's full-time
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
authorized position cap that was
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
established in the current Bia chapter
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
79 or chapter 106 laws of 2023 there's a
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
current 3,000 full-time authorized
 
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
position cap and both and both those
 
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:22.919 align:start position:0%
Provisions were chapter law that chapter
 
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
law expires on June 30th of
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
2025 in the governor's operating bu
 
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
budget there was uh 394 positions that
 
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.149 align:start position:0%
budget there was uh 394 positions that
were

00:22:33.149 --> 00:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
unfunded so if you look at our total
 
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
count where we are right now or where we
 
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
were a couple weeks ago we were around
 
00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:44.799 align:start position:0%
2800 filled positions and so that
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
remaining Delta of the 450 or so of that
 
00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:51.919 align:start position:0%
the 394 were
 
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
unfunded okay and and the reason I bring
 
00:22:56.669 --> 00:22:56.679 align:start position:0%
that department level question into this
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
conversation is I think we're going to
 
00:23:02.269 --> 00:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
have this ongoing interest in in how the
 
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
the the Manpower in each of these
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
programs are affected and I assume that
 
00:23:12.269 --> 00:23:12.279 align:start position:0%
um they've all been um prioritized by
 
00:23:12.279 --> 00:23:12.990 align:start position:0%
um they've all been um prioritized by
the

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
commissioner of what her available
 
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
Manpower might be and the and and and in
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
this budget book we we're seeing the um
 
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:25.400 align:start position:0%
and a a transitory position of the
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
department or is this your sort of your
 
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
your go forward position that you want
 
00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
the division to division three to assess
 
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:38.200 align:start position:0%
reassess sure so um I I I guess two two
 
00:23:39.789 --> 00:23:39.799 align:start position:0%
points on that one is I think it's
 
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
important to just to recognize that our
 
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
budget our our Personnel costs are about
 
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
11% so we're very different from most
 
00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:49.559 align:start position:0%
agencies where Personnel Drive their
 
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
costs often times like at Department
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
Corrections Department of Safety um very
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
different in that sense um and yesterday
 
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
we haded talked about that one piece of
 
00:24:02.669 --> 00:24:02.679 align:start position:0%
Statute that this committee had made
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
permanent uh the authority to fill
 
00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions in hb2 of last year
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
and we're very grateful for that and
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
then the other key provision there
 
00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:13.799 align:start position:0%
that's in the current draft is the
 
00:24:16.029 --> 00:24:16.039 align:start position:0%
provision to move money from person
 
00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
within Personnel lines and so the
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
positions are unfunded But ultimately
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
we're a very Dynamic operation and needs
 
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
arise and they Decline and it's those
 
00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
two key Provisions that will allow us to
 
00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
manage through the next bium with those
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions those are very
 
00:24:35.389 --> 00:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
important provisions and if we didn't
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
have those then we would be locked into
 
00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
the current state and it would be very
 
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
difficult to respond to emerging needs
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh as they come about so so I think I
 
00:24:48.269 --> 00:24:48.279 align:start position:0%
think the division wanted you to have
 
00:24:50.669 --> 00:24:50.679 align:start position:0%
that flexibility because we we
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
anticipated the challenge that we were
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
imposing on you but uh but one thing uh
 
00:24:59.149 --> 00:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
that maybe you could clarify and again
 
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to distract this is the
 
00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
department wide and it affects you as
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
well is let let's say you have um three
 
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
positions that you consider a priority
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
but as you look at the available money
 
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
you think you can only really fund two
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
of them are you allowed under the
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
current rules to go and advertise for
 
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
all three
 
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
simultaneously and just fill the first
 
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:29.240 align:start position:0%
two that can be filled and shut down
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
recruitment on the third or or do you
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
have to have a fully funded position
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
each and every one before you can go
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
recruit so traditionally you need to
 
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
have the position funded in order to
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
post it um I know that DCF has worked
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
out um certain solutions that Marie
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
Nunan had made reference to the other
 
00:25:56.389 --> 00:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
day as far as finding other Alternatives
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
so that you you didn't if you had a 100
 
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
vacancies you could post 100 positions
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
um we would have to work uh with the
 
00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
with the division of personnel to see if
 
00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
we could do that in other areas because
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
that kind of it it breaks the logic of
 
00:26:14.029 --> 00:26:14.039 align:start position:0%
the system like 1 plus one must equal
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
two um but but we've been able to do
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
that successfully in certain areas and
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
we would we'll probably need to see if
 
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
we can expand that to other areas so
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
that we we have the ability to hire
 
00:26:28.029 --> 00:26:28.039 align:start position:0%
because if you can't post you're never
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
going to higher and you're going to see
 
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
that that rate go that vacancy rate go
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
up right so so this this is kind what
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to offer is is that uh I
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
assume having the flexibility to recruit
 
00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
simultaneously for more positions than
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
you have available funding for and then
 
00:26:47.389 --> 00:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
to control the recruitment process to
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
shut down when you obligated the money
 
00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
against new hires that that would that
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
additional flexibility would would help
 
00:26:58.750 --> 00:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
in some cases
 
00:27:00.669 --> 00:27:00.679 align:start position:0%
it it it helps greatly it's just a
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
question if you need that in an hb2 if
 
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
you don't have quite that flexibility I
 
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
you know help us uh draft that because I
 
00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:12.200 align:start position:0%
I think that would be fair um to say
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
okay you you got four important
 
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
positions but only money for two go open
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
it up and and see see what we can get
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
and then stop the other two if you run
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
out of money sure I I'd like to have a
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
conversation with our peers at the
 
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
just understand what would potentially
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
be needed there and and make sure that
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
we we partner with them to make it
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
successful sure and I'm willing to
 
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:40.120 align:start position:0%
partner with all of you on that um so uh
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
so I'm sorry that was a huge segue that
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
got triggered by a question on Personnel
 
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
but I I I I wanted to have us sort of
 
00:27:50.909 --> 00:27:50.919 align:start position:0%
see a a bigger picture as we look at all
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
those we appreciate that uh
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
representative go ahead yeah thank you
 
00:27:58.590 --> 00:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman a really quick uh
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
definitional question so you talk in
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
terms of full-time positions is that the
 
00:28:05.789 --> 00:28:05.799 align:start position:0%
same as uh full-time equivalents I mean
 
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of used to and um that would in
 
00:28:11.509 --> 00:28:11.519 align:start position:0%
include the number you gave if it was
 
00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
full-time equivalence would include
 
00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
part-time or
 
00:28:17.509 --> 00:28:17.519 align:start position:0%
temporary so there's different types of
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
positions in the state system one is
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
your your standard classified positions
 
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
and you'll see the salaries budgeted
 
00:28:29.149 --> 00:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
within uh class 10 for that
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
then you'll see unclassified positions
 
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
um unclassified positions are at will
 
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
positions they're established in RSA
 
00:28:40.029 --> 00:28:40.039 align:start position:0%
941a and those are budgeted at DHHS
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
within Class 12 um they're other
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
agencies budget them in class 11 I
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
believe there's also non-classified
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
positions which we currently have none
 
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
of which don't exist in statute and then
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
there's also full-time temporary
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
positions which are typically budgeted
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
Within class 59 and then there's
 
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:02.440 align:start position:0%
part-time temporary positions which are
 
00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:04.519 align:start position:0%
budgeted within class
 
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
50 and just to note for public health we
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
have a number of those um temporary
 
00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
positions we sometimes refer to them as
 
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
n9s or 8s um which are not part of that
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
full-time authorized we have those
 
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
temporary positions because they're
 
00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
often tied to a Time limited Grant and
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
so the money is just good for when we
 
00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
have those federal funds the there's no
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
expectation necessar that that position
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
is going to be a permanent position
 
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
within the department so just so when
 
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the numbers in the
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
governor's budget book and I you know um
 
00:29:42.269 --> 00:29:42.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing the whole picture of how
 
00:29:44.269 --> 00:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
many people were employing because it it
 
00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't include those those different
 
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
categories of yeah so the the numbers
 
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
that you see in there those are the
 
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
full-time authorized positions that
 
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
include the classified and unclassified
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
typically the full-time temporary
 
00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
positions or the part-time temporary
 
00:30:03.389 --> 00:30:03.399 align:start position:0%
positions um those have much higher
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates those are either
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
established via a dop and GNC process
 
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
for extension or they're approved bya
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee when we receive funding
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:19.029 --> 00:30:19.039 align:start position:0%
purpose okay thank you I I think the
 
00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:21.640 align:start position:0%
other thing you're not seeing in that is
 
00:30:23.549 --> 00:30:23.559 align:start position:0%
is that some of these programs are
 
00:30:26.509 --> 00:30:26.519 align:start position:0%
supported through uh contracts and the
 
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
contracts provide Manpower with many of
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
them so so you're not seeing a a a
 
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
complete Manpower
 
00:30:37.389 --> 00:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
picture so I'm also not seeing a
 
00:30:39.509 --> 00:30:39.519 align:start position:0%
Complete Personnel cost picture because
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's a portion of that is buried in the
 
00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
contracts yeah you say Personnel I say
 
00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
Manpower it's so just it's probably the
 
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
same thing yep thank
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
you thank you so um if we want to move
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
along we can go into slide 11 which
 
00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
starts getting to some of those you know
 
00:30:58.990 --> 00:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
at least ke achievements and some of
 
00:31:00.269 --> 00:31:00.279 align:start position:0%
those numbers that are not budget
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
numbers that I know that you're
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
interested in thinking about um you know
 
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
at the top of the list we have our
 
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized laboratory a
 
00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
phenomenal facility it's up on 29 Hazen
 
00:31:13.389 --> 00:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
drive we have tested over 16,000 water
 
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
samples in 2024 including 2500 from
 
00:31:18.669 --> 00:31:18.679 align:start position:0%
public Wells to ensure that we have
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
clean water for both to drink and to
 
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
play in we have launched our Wastewater
 
00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
surveillance program with support from
 
00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
the federal government to monitor for
 
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
respiratory diseases is in local
 
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
communities it's one of my f you know um
 
00:31:32.669 --> 00:31:32.679 align:start position:0%
those of you who know me I love pulling
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
up data slides it's great to go in and
 
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
sort of see where the um the spikes are
 
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
of respiratory illness that shows up in
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
your Wastewater this is also an
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
important technology because it is
 
00:31:45.909 --> 00:31:45.919 align:start position:0%
anticipated that there could be uses for
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
other infectious diseases that can be um
 
00:31:50.629 --> 00:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
that can be noticed or figured out
 
00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
through through Wastewater so it's a
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
great um system to have in place now
 
00:31:56.509 --> 00:31:56.519 align:start position:0%
that we may need for something else in
 
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
the future that we don't even know
 
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
about we um conduct food testing to
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
maintain that safe food supply including
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
Dairy and shellfish shellfish that is
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
grown right off the shores of New
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one of the things that was
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
interesting and again incredible value
 
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:14.120 align:start position:0%
of our laboratory this year in the past
 
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
year in 2024 we identified some arsenic
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
in a apple juice box so any of you who
 
00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
have kids or grandkids you know about
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
little juice boxes we identified arsenic
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
in that that led to a recall of more
 
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
than 14,000 cases of juice across 26
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
States really protecting the health
 
00:32:32.509 --> 00:32:32.519 align:start position:0%
especially of the small children that
 
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
drink that product so then we look at so
 
00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:37.799 align:start position:0%
that's our sort of laboratory fun you
 
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
know get in there there's no more bunts
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
and burners but in my mind I I always
 
00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
still want to see like bunts and burners
 
00:32:45.389 --> 00:32:45.399 align:start position:0%
as I walk through that laboratory we
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
also have delivered oversight and
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
resources um around for our communities
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
and our environment and some of that is
 
00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
through our regulatory work and
 
00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:55.480 align:start position:0%
Licensing work so we've licensed over 60
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
6,000 businesses including restaurants
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
and others food providers we've
 
00:33:02.509 --> 00:33:02.519 align:start position:0%
conducted more than 3500 routine and
 
00:33:04.669 --> 00:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
licensing inspections every year to
 
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
ensure that safe food supply we've
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
processed over 28,000 um blood lead
 
00:33:12.029 --> 00:33:12.039 align:start position:0%
level results for adults and kids and
 
00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
provided case management when kids or
 
00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:17.240 align:start position:0%
youth or and adults have high levels of
 
00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
um Le blood lead in their blood we've
 
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
inspected more than 46 radiation
 
00:33:25.629 --> 00:33:25.639 align:start position:0%
machines and conducted some Associated
 
00:33:27.789 --> 00:33:27.799 align:start position:0%
registra of activities and distributed
 
00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
did more than 3500 radon tests free at
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
free cost I have I have a question about
 
00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
416 the I I assume that nearly all of
 
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
those are Diagnostic Imaging machines
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
often referred to as x-ray machines so
 
00:33:44.909 --> 00:33:44.919 align:start position:0%
um yes and actually you can take a look
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
later on when we get there we actually
 
00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
have a pie chart further later in the
 
00:33:50.909 --> 00:33:50.919 align:start position:0%
presentation of the span some of them
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
are industry as well those radiation
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
machines that are are that could be in
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
Industry so it's not only in healthcare
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
environments but in industrial settings
 
00:34:01.389 --> 00:34:01.399 align:start position:0%
okay and and so even if um an
 
00:34:03.789 --> 00:34:03.799 align:start position:0%
organization has a
 
00:34:07.149 --> 00:34:07.159 align:start position:0%
physicist um on staff uh we still have
 
00:34:09.869 --> 00:34:09.879 align:start position:0%
an obligation to go do an independent
 
00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
yes test it does that does that make
 
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
sense in a resource constraint
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
environment are there situations where
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
we could ask the organizational
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
physicist to to conduct and
 
00:34:26.109 --> 00:34:26.119 align:start position:0%
self-certify safety of of Diagnostic
 
00:34:28.069 --> 00:34:28.079 align:start position:0%
Imaging systems I I think think all
 
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
things are on the table to have that
 
00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:31.399 align:start position:0%
discussion we've actually had some other
 
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
thoughts around our rad health program
 
00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:36.440 align:start position:0%
to to ease some of that is a the way in
 
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
which we license in particular dental
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
equipment that we think that there's an
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity and we've actually shared it
 
00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
with um Cod that to streamline that
 
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
because many of the um pieces of
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
equipment that we go to are in dental
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
providers and so I think there's some
 
00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
opportunities there I think for health
 
00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
Rel especially for health related
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
environments you always will want an
 
00:34:59.630 --> 00:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
dependent body to come in and make sure
 
00:35:01.069 --> 00:35:01.079 align:start position:0%
that those machines are working as they
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
should be okay I'm I'm glad you're
 
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
working with coach and you've got ideas
 
00:35:08.589 --> 00:35:08.599 align:start position:0%
already TR keep coming thank you thank
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
you so much and then again we get to
 
00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:11.720 align:start position:0%
some of the other places in public
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
health that you might was there I'm
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
sorry was there a question a question
 
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
representative Daniels yes thank you of
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
the 3500 uh free test how many how many
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
of those test uh we were results were
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
reported back to the division um I I
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
don't know and I can find out and the
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
team that's sitting here can figure can
 
00:35:32.589 --> 00:35:32.599 align:start position:0%
help me with this they don't require
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
that we find out the results of what
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
happened with those tests we send the
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
tests out to the family to the
 
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
individuals and the homeowners and they
 
00:35:42.069 --> 00:35:42.079 align:start position:0%
use it we don't there's no reporting re
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
back to us what those tests found am I
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
understanding your question correctly
 
00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:48.839 align:start position:0%
yes but I guess it leads to the question
 
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
so you really have no idea if they're
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
being used or not you know what I'll
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
I'll get back to you on the way in which
 
00:35:56.589 --> 00:35:56.599 align:start position:0%
we evaluate that okay thank you you're
 
00:35:56.599 --> 00:35:58.390 align:start position:0%
we evaluate that okay thank you you're
welcome

00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and then finally um the other
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
area that we're really proud of is some
 
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
of the work that we've done around
 
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
family support and yesterday I had the
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to tune into um director
 
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
Hebert's presentation and we were
 
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
talking a little bit about tanif and the
 
00:36:14.109 --> 00:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
ways in which it can be used to support
 
00:36:16.109 --> 00:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
young families I know representative
 
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
Edwards you're interested in the two
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
family you know what we're doing to
 
00:36:20.589 --> 00:36:20.599 align:start position:0%
support two families we're going to talk
 
00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
about that a little bit later in the
 
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
presentation but we are using tanif
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
funds um in part as well with federal
 
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
funds and General funds to really
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
provide the sort of preventative
 
00:36:32.829 --> 00:36:32.839 align:start position:0%
Services that I talked a lot about the
 
00:36:35.069 --> 00:36:35.079 align:start position:0%
last time that I was here around what we
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
can be doing to make sure that we keep
 
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
kids and families safe healthy happy and
 
00:36:42.309 --> 00:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
preferably nowhere near the child
 
00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
welfare system so those are the areas in
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
which we're particularly proud this year
 
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
as you go into slide 13 you'll see that
 
00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to start digging into the
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
budget now and what those numbers are so
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
we have as noted um our Administration
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
our office of the director leads and
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
supports seven bureaus this is where we
 
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
dump all the rent all of the um other
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
you know overall costs for there it's
 
00:37:08.349 --> 00:37:08.359 align:start position:0%
largely driven by um cost allocated
 
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
funds however we also include and in
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
addition we include folks like our
 
00:37:15.309 --> 00:37:15.319 align:start position:0%
legislative liais on many of you know
 
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
Abby Rogers she sits within our office
 
00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:20.200 align:start position:0%
of director we have our state
 
00:37:22.829 --> 00:37:22.839 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist Dr Ben Chan again many of
 
00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:25.640 align:start position:0%
you know him from TV and our therapeutic
 
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
cannabis program our therapeutic
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis program is one of those
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
programs that's moved around a little
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
bit um it came to the department well
 
00:37:36.309 --> 00:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic it used to be split
 
00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
all the functions of it were split
 
00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
across the department um 2016 is we
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
brought it to um public health and
 
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
combined it into one program so as you
 
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
flip into so C idea is is do you
 
00:37:52.829 --> 00:37:52.839 align:start position:0%
anticipate a time where the therapeutic
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis program can just be spun out of
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
state government and privatized
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
to run on a as sort of an independent
 
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
organization or or do you see the state
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
always having to play the a role similar
 
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
uh to what we're playing now that's a
 
00:38:12.309 --> 00:38:12.319 align:start position:0%
great question I haven't I have not
 
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:14.200 align:start position:0%
thought about it in that way well you're
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
not using therapeutic
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
cannabis a
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
little that's
 
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
private we keep that data very private
 
00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:25.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I I i' I've been watching this
 
00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
program for for now the fifth term and
 
00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
it just seems to me at some point we can
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
exit this business um all right there's
 
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
a and I think there are ways in which to
 
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
think about therapeutic cannabis we do
 
00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
provide you know the structure of
 
00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
ensuring that um New Hampshire's program
 
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
is not like other states there are other
 
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
states where it is very easy to get a
 
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
card and it's just it's very permissive
 
00:38:53.309 --> 00:38:53.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's program is a little bit
 
00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
more restrictive and conservative in its
 
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
approach that might not lend it itself
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
to an outside entity do you have a
 
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
question represent I just have a comment
 
00:39:05.309 --> 00:39:05.319 align:start position:0%
I uh participated in a tour of um one of
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
these therapeutic cannabis um uh
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
locations it was extremely eye openening
 
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
um the amount of um control and um you
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
know eyes on making sure everything is
 
00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
is safe and um appropriately documented
 
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
and everything I encourage everyone to
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
reach out and tour one of these
 
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
facilities it really was impressive it's
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
really extraordinary the work and you
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
know I'll just underscore what you noted
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
around safety one of the roles of Public
 
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
Health is to make sure that people are
 
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
getting what they think that they're
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
getting and that there are not additives
 
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
or adulterations to the product that's
 
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
the difference of why it's worth um
 
00:39:45.309 --> 00:39:45.319 align:start position:0%
paying the $50 for every three years
 
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's not a heavy amount of money for
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
someone to register if they have a their
 
00:39:50.829 --> 00:39:50.839 align:start position:0%
if they have a condition that qualifies
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
them and they know they're getting safe
 
00:39:55.309 --> 00:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
um a safe product which you're certainly
 
00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
not going to get on the black market and
 
00:39:59.870 --> 00:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
you may or may not get as much with a
 
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
retail Market that doesn't have
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
oversight over
 
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
it so um as you flip you'll see on uh
 
00:40:10.589 --> 00:40:10.599 align:start position:0%
slide 15 um a little few little graphs
 
00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
about the therapeutic um cannabis um
 
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
program we're close to 15,000 folks
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
right now registered that's huge when
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
you did you intend to skip page 14 or
 
00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
did we do 14 and I just out you know
 
00:40:26.349 --> 00:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
what I did not intend to skip page 14 I
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
just got excited about the therapeutic
 
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis program all right I could spend
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
six hours talking to you about the
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program so uh page
 
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
14 you'll see the office of director
 
00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:39.800 align:start position:0%
those funds are are largely cost
 
00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
allocated across the program and then
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
you'll see about the 1.2 million that's
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program those
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
are not General funds those are not
 
00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
State funds those are funds um that are
 
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh come through both registration fees
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
as well as um there's in statute the
 
00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
ability for those alternative treatment
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
um at atcs alternative treatment centers
 
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
to make whole the program so there are
 
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:07.480 align:start position:0%
no General there are no federal funds in
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
self-funded we can now get to page 15
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
and I can show off our slides our our
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
data you'll see the steady increase over
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
time of enrollment in that program and
 
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
that really has come with the increase
 
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
of um understanding about it and sort of
 
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
um people learn about it but the other
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
thing that has increased the growth is
 
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
the number of conditions that have been
 
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
certified that folks can have to be
 
00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:35.720 align:start position:0%
certified in the program you'll recall
 
00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
in many of the conversations this is not
 
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:39.640 align:start position:0%
a prescription Physicians do not
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
prescribe Med the therapeutic cannabis
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
they simply certify that you have one of
 
00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
a list of conditions and that's what
 
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
makes you eligible of note at the bottom
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
I I I always think this is interesting
 
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
some of us have a vision of who uses
 
00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis um you'll see the per capita
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
rate around the the U total Patti
 
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
patients by County you'll see the county
 
00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:03.640 align:start position:0%
with the highest per capita rate of use
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
is Coos County and we attribute that
 
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
mostly to the age of coas County most of
 
00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
the the um age cohort of the people in
 
00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:13.720 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic can cannabis program
 
00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
tends to be older older middle class uh
 
00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
not middle class older middle age um
 
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
those folks you know starting at about
 
00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:24.200 align:start position:0%
age 50 those are the that's the area and
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
because coas has a higher median age
 
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
rate it's not surprising in to see that
 
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
higher rate up North so that bottom one
 
00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
confuses me a little bit three atcs and
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
seven locations and while you're
 
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
addressing that uh would you also
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
address whether or not uh the state
 
00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
would benefit from having a mobile ATC
 
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
capability it hasn't been allowed by law
 
00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
yep I so um it has not been allowed by
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
law I think access is always important
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
um and I think there are probably ways
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
you could control for that for security
 
00:42:59.710 --> 00:42:59.720 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that you know part
 
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
of what the program and why it isn't a
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
separate program privatized is that we
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
want to ensure there's no diversion of
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
the product so we would have to ensure
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
that there was security for that so that
 
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
certainly is something that we could
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
think about in a more um in a stronger
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
way so to the three ic's in four in
 
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
seven locations the state was divided
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
into four quadrants when the program was
 
00:43:24.549 --> 00:43:24.559 align:start position:0%
um developed there are three vendors for
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
those four quadrants one has two areas
 
00:43:29.309 --> 00:43:29.319 align:start position:0%
in the others each have their own area
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
um and over time it when it was
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
originally developed there was only one
 
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
retail location in each of those
 
00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
quadrants um over time we have expanded
 
00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
that to try and make um access a little
 
00:43:43.309 --> 00:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
bit easier so there are three entities
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
who have contracts with the state to
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
provide to be the ATC they are in seven
 
00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.270 align:start position:0%
provide to be the ATC they are in seven
retail

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
retail
 
00:43:56.109 --> 00:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
locations so um do we have any evidence
 
00:43:59.630 --> 00:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
that suggests that the availability of
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis has an impact on
 
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
reducing the number of medical
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals that are being consumed
 
00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:10.280 align:start position:0%
because we spend a lot of money on
 
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
medical Pharmaceuticals and there's a
 
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
lot of anecdotal discussion around how
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
people can use therapeutic cannabis and
 
00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:21.640 align:start position:0%
get off of pharmaceuticals it's it it's
 
00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
a super question what we don't you know
 
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
we haven't been able to for legal
 
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
reasons we have not been able to match
 
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:31.720 align:start position:0%
you know the people in this registry
 
00:44:34.109 --> 00:44:34.119 align:start position:0%
with you know prescribing habits and and
 
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that would always be
 
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
perfect anyway because of the folks in
 
00:44:41.109 --> 00:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
this program by definition are sick they
 
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
have a condition of some sort they may
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
have cancer and there may be lots of
 
00:44:46.549 --> 00:44:46.559 align:start position:0%
things that they are prescribed at any
 
00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
given time however what we do have is we
 
00:44:52.589 --> 00:44:52.599 align:start position:0%
do an annual survey of our of um our
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
participants and that is the theme that
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
comes out of every survey that we have
 
00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
is I've been able to reduce the amount
 
00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
of Med other medications I needed to
 
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
take but there's no National study
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
there's no clinical research there's
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
nothing to demonstrate this is the big
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
problem with cannabis is there because
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
it is still federally scheduled we don't
 
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
have the sort of gold standard studies
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
that we would like all right was was
 
00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
there a question over here I saw a
 
00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:20.750 align:start position:0%
there a question over here I saw a
movement

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
movement
 
00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere I had one but it's not on this
 
00:45:27.069 --> 00:45:27.079 align:start position:0%
topic so if people still want to pursue
 
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
go ahead come back to your question if
 
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
you can is it go do you want to answer
 
00:45:35.309 --> 00:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
now go I'll go all right um so I'm still
 
00:45:37.549 --> 00:45:37.559 align:start position:0%
stuck on the previous side slide I had a
 
00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
question the middle row um about the
 
00:45:43.549 --> 00:45:43.559 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation is that amount
 
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
a management function or is that
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
reimbursement to the unemployment
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
fund the that that amount is dictated by
 
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
services so you'll see unemployment
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
compensation within all of our our
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
respective division areas so it's a
 
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
standard amount there's there's other
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
class lines um that are similar
 
00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:05.839 align:start position:0%
different but similar like transfers to
 
00:46:07.549 --> 00:46:07.559 align:start position:0%
plant and property like that's another
 
00:46:10.349 --> 00:46:10.359 align:start position:0%
class line on page 9008 where we're
 
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:12.280 align:start position:0%
we're we're given a number and we put
 
00:46:16.109 --> 00:46:16.119 align:start position:0%
that number in there um there's there's
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
also uh class uh 41 audit fund set aside
 
00:46:25.069 --> 00:46:25.079 align:start position:0%
there's a prescribed rate of 01 1% that
 
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
we have to set aside for federal aits
 
00:46:30.829 --> 00:46:30.839 align:start position:0%
that we um as a state pay for additional
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
fringe benefits that's that that's a
 
00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
similar scenario where there's a
 
00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
methodology that's prescribed in the
 
00:46:38.549 --> 00:46:38.559 align:start position:0%
budget briefing book when we prepare
 
00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
that so so that's kind of one of those
 
00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:42.440 align:start position:0%
things that's sort of outside of our
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
control when we put this together but
 
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
but it feeds towards a larger system
 
00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
administered by the department of
 
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
administrative Services thank you I kind
 
00:46:52.349 --> 00:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
of thought it was something like that
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
and it I hadn't focused on it in
 
00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
previous times so I just thought I'd get
 
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
it cleared up and thank you thank you so
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
we will move in out of the office of the
 
00:47:05.549 --> 00:47:05.559 align:start position:0%
director and we will move to slide 16
 
00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
which is an overview of our Bureau of
 
00:47:10.549 --> 00:47:10.559 align:start position:0%
public health statistics and informatics
 
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
we call it bipy it's a cute name for an
 
00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
incredibly important um Bureau this work
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
is all pursuant to RSA 126 it Ser this
 
00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
group this Bureau serves as our data
 
00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
Steward and our public health statistics
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
and informatics Center for all for
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
health related data it is very connected
 
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
to the other work throughout the
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
department um on our Enterprise
 
00:47:39.069 --> 00:47:39.079 align:start position:0%
functions but in particular within
 
00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
Public Health their role is really
 
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
around the population Health measures
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
and then many many many of the systems
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
that we have that are often tied to
 
00:47:51.549 --> 00:47:51.559 align:start position:0%
Federal programs for managing individual
 
00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
types of um conditions or systems that
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
need to function within Public Health we
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
provide um data stewardship and
 
00:48:03.069 --> 00:48:03.079 align:start position:0%
governance for all of those data sets
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
ensuring alignment with our department
 
00:48:07.549 --> 00:48:07.559 align:start position:0%
government governance and management
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
strategies we strongly focus on privacy
 
00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:12.599 align:start position:0%
as representative Edwards knows he sits
 
00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
on our our Vital Records privacy board
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
or at least has sat on that which we
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
work with co- facilitate with the um
 
00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
Department of uh Secretary of State
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
Division of Vital Records it also um
 
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
focuses so there's the data component as
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
well as the informatics component it
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
maintains our integration and our
 
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
reporting system so again how we get
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
reports into our laboratory from
 
00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Providers or reports around
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
infectious diseases syndromic
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
surveillance um and supports our in
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
promotes our
 
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
interoperability this is an area where
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
we received an a number of additional
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
federal funds over the pandemic as you
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
can imagine and it was they were really
 
00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:57.400 align:start position:0%
focused on data modernization not only
 
00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
to address the tens thousand hundreds of
 
00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
thousands pieces of data that came to us
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
over the pandemic but it allowed us to
 
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:07.640 align:start position:0%
strengthen A system that was beginning
 
00:49:09.789 --> 00:49:09.799 align:start position:0%
to be Antiquated at that time so there
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
were funds over time being used in this
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
area and um as representative ards
 
00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:17.240 align:start position:0%
pointed out oftentimes those were
 
00:49:20.589 --> 00:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
contracts with entities um to help us do
 
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
that technical work because we cannot
 
00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:25.160 align:start position:0%
hire for those within the in the state
 
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
often because we just can't find the
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
tech technical expertise to do that work
 
00:49:31.789 --> 00:49:31.799 align:start position:0%
we have over 30 different Data Systems
 
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
we have reduced this number so pointing
 
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
towards efficiency over time and with
 
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
those Federal Investments we have
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
started to reduce the number of systems
 
00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
and consolidate where possible and
 
00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
really move to a sales a consistent
 
00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
Salesforce platform we work very closely
 
00:49:49.109 --> 00:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
with the Department of um information
 
00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
technology to do all of that work so if
 
00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
you slide into ex uh to slide 17 you can
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
start seeing some of the budget overview
 
00:50:01.589 --> 00:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
um bipy has about five accounting units
 
00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
um because some of these are less than a
 
00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:05.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars they're not in your
 
00:50:07.309 --> 00:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
budget book so when you look at this
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
seat and you see the na that highlights
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
for you that it's a smaller often grant
 
00:50:13.789 --> 00:50:13.799 align:start position:0%
that doesn't um so it doesn't raise to
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
the level to be in your budget briefing
 
00:50:18.789 --> 00:50:18.799 align:start position:0%
book so I'll go through start on slide
 
00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
17 a few of those items so we start with
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
our informatics and health statistics
 
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
this is a mixed bag of funds um we have
 
00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
about 1.3 million in federal about
 
00:50:35.309 --> 00:50:35.319 align:start position:0%
622 in um in general funds here and this
 
00:50:38.109 --> 00:50:38.119 align:start position:0%
is the uh provide some of the backbone
 
00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
work to um to bipy again establishing
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
and maintaining that integration
 
00:50:46.829 --> 00:50:46.839 align:start position:0%
Electronic Reporting we can move down
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
into the payral risk factor survey
 
00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
that's a Federal grant relatively small
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
um and that funds A CDC survey that asks
 
00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
people about their Health uh their
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
health their and their experience
 
00:51:01.789 --> 00:51:01.799 align:start position:0%
getting healthc care um it's a great
 
00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
survey it's how we learn things like
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
prevalence of smoking prevalence of
 
00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
overweight it comes through the
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
behavioral risk factor survey we have
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
our cancer reg yep uh Finance question
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
on uh the informatics and health stati
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
statistics you're mentioning
 
00:51:20.589 --> 00:51:20.599 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical rebates yes that that
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
shows up somewhere as an other Revenue
 
00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:27.400 align:start position:0%
line I believe and that his historically
 
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
this line is often undercounted or
 
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
underestimated on the order of like 10
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
million or more and because of our
 
00:51:39.069 --> 00:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
budget situation if that's the case I
 
00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
think we need to we need to identify the
 
00:51:46.349 --> 00:51:46.359 align:start position:0%
full a full true estimate on what we're
 
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
going to get from rebates I I I believe
 
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
you're referring to the Medicaid
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical rebates oh okay which are
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
which are higher and and we did have we
 
00:51:59.950 --> 00:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
did have a
 
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
one-time um fiscal item that came
 
00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
through to accept additional uh Federal
 
00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:07.640 align:start position:0%
rebate that went back I I I think almost
 
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
a decade because of a a a programming uh
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
detail that had to be corrected where we
 
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
were able to claim those funds but that
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
was a onetime situation that the fiscal
 
00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
committee saw I think this past November
 
00:52:22.349 --> 00:52:22.359 align:start position:0%
maybe okay so you just corrected me that
 
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
this Ryan White pharmaceutical rebates
 
00:52:26.829 --> 00:52:26.839 align:start position:0%
program it is very specific to Public
 
00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
Health that is around HIV and AIDS
 
00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
medication okay and so the amount so
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
these rebates are probably relatively
 
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
small compared to the certainly compared
 
00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
to Medicaid yes all right thank you
 
00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
thank you so we have our informatics and
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
health statistics our our burus our
 
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
behavioral risk factor survey we have
 
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
our cancer registry budgeted within our
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
Bureau of population of um health
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
statistics and informatics um that has
 
00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:55.240 align:start position:0%
this is one of those where there is a
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
the those General funds are a
 
00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort um that match to
 
00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
the federal funds that is our our
 
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
Statewide um cancer surveillance system
 
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
that tells us about Cancer Care and
 
00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
cancer experiences in the state um here
 
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
on 1628 the strengthening Public Health
 
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
infrastructure sometimes you hear us
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
refer to this as fig
 
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
phig um the public health infrastructure
 
00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
Grant fig um this is one of those places
 
00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
that this is a newer um Federal grant
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
Federal resource that came to us as a
 
00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
result of CO as a result of covid quite
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
frankly ending it came towards the end
 
00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic it's designed um we we
 
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
have a it's designed to support the
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
workforce in general there's a
 
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
technology and an informatics component
 
00:53:44.789 --> 00:53:44.799 align:start position:0%
which is why it's here in our informatic
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
section but it also supports individuals
 
00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
in other other areas throughout the
 
00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
division of Public Health Services
 
00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:55.480 align:start position:0%
um you will notice in this one just in
 
00:53:57.549 --> 00:53:57.559 align:start position:0%
case you want to ask a question there's
 
00:53:59.670 --> 00:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
a little bit extra money budgeted if you
 
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
go to the budget briefing book or in the
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
budget but the budget briefing book
 
00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:05.480 align:start position:0%
shows that um the governor's budget
 
00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:07.400 align:start position:0%
shows a higher amount in state fiscal
 
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
year 26 it's not because we've received
 
00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
additional funding it's really that we
 
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
haven't spent the previous year's
 
00:54:14.829 --> 00:54:14.839 align:start position:0%
funding and the funding is moving
 
00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
forward just because of when the funding
 
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
came to us and when we were able to get
 
00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
contracts and and staff um support staff
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
hired into those roles so it's not that
 
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
there's really necessarily an increase
 
00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
we're just budgeting it in that year
 
00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
appropriately and and none of that's
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
General funds no nope nope and then we
 
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
have ybs and I know that that's um
 
00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
that's the youth risk behavioral survey
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
we've had lots of conversations and
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
policies around that that is the uh
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
completely voluntary and Anonymous
 
00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:47.720 align:start position:0%
survey that is done within high schools
 
00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
families can opt out of that um schools
 
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
can opt out of this but this is the data
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
where we learn things like how many kids
 
00:54:58.109 --> 00:54:58.119 align:start position:0%
are using tobacco products or vaping or
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
what their experience is in in receiving
 
00:55:02.109 --> 00:55:02.119 align:start position:0%
health care that comes from the youth
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
risk behavior so if we change that to an
 
00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
optin instead of an opt out and we
 
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
reduced participation by about
 
00:55:15.549 --> 00:55:15.559 align:start position:0%
50% uh wouldn't that be a a sufficient
 
00:55:18.589 --> 00:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
proxy for the county information we need
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
and if we coupled that with what we're
 
00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
seeing in Vermont and Maine that in the
 
00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:25.720 align:start position:0%
aggregate we would be we would make no
 
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
different policy decisions based on
 
00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:32.200 align:start position:0%
having 100% of the data versus 50% I I'm
 
00:55:34.589 --> 00:55:34.599 align:start position:0%
not sure that that's true so this is one
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
of these highly designed methodological
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
studies where we try and make sure that
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
it is representative of the entire not
 
00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
only the entire State of New Hampshire
 
00:55:45.309 --> 00:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
but each region so the schools that
 
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
participate in this program participate
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
so that they can understand what's
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
happening in their schools and in their
 
00:55:52.589 --> 00:55:52.599 align:start position:0%
communities and without having the
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate weights and the appropriate
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
distribution around the state we can't
 
00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
say that anymore we might be able to say
 
00:56:02.029 --> 00:56:02.039 align:start position:0%
x% of New Hampshire kids do this we
 
00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't be able to say x% of
 
00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
kids in kowas County are experiencing
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
something different than the kids in
 
00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:09.400 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County and so that's a
 
00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:10.950 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County and so that's a
methodological

00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
methodological
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
questional examples differential
 
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
examples between different schools that
 
00:56:18.309 --> 00:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
have implemented different policies that
 
00:56:21.309 --> 00:56:21.319 align:start position:0%
are meant to respond to their school
 
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:24.200 align:start position:0%
results 100% so the schools and the
 
00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:26.359 align:start position:0%
regions use this to whether or focus on
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
bullying whether to focus on sexual
 
00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:30.440 align:start position:0%
assault whether the experience of sexual
 
00:56:32.109 --> 00:56:32.119 align:start position:0%
assault whether to focus on Tobacco
 
00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
whether to work focus on substance use
 
00:56:36.069 --> 00:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
that's what those communities do with
 
00:56:38.349 --> 00:56:38.359 align:start position:0%
this data it's incredibly important to
 
00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
them oftentimes you'll see them come out
 
00:56:42.549 --> 00:56:42.559 align:start position:0%
this is often as you know a a policy
 
00:56:44.190 --> 00:56:44.200 align:start position:0%
question that we talk about in the
 
00:56:47.309 --> 00:56:47.319 align:start position:0%
education committee and um because this
 
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
is anonymous it is different than other
 
00:56:53.069 --> 00:56:53.079 align:start position:0%
places where we gather permission we we
 
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
have an opt out on this because it is
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
anonymous no child's name is attached to
 
00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:00.200 align:start position:0%
this it is not an individual's um it is
 
00:57:02.069 --> 00:57:02.079 align:start position:0%
reflective of their experience but it is
 
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
different than say our immunization
 
00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
system where it's really about an
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
individual's Health Care is is it is it
 
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
truly fully Anonymous I I I've had
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
people tell me that if somebody some
 
00:57:15.150 --> 00:57:15.160 align:start position:0%
kids survey comes in saying that they
 
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
are thinking about suicide that there is
 
00:57:20.029 --> 00:57:20.039 align:start position:0%
a way to dig into the data to find out
 
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
who that individual student I do not
 
00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
believe you can do that you may know
 
00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
that that child is considering aside
 
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
because of other behaviors that that
 
00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
child expresses but the data doesn't
 
00:57:32.789 --> 00:57:32.799 align:start position:0%
there is no place where there is a name
 
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
on this survey I I know that but because
 
00:57:39.390 --> 00:57:39.400 align:start position:0%
uh if you put enough personal data
 
00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
together you can retroactively figure
 
00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
out who the individual I am not aware
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
that we have ever been able to do that
 
00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:50.680 align:start position:0%
okay that's that's important and and
 
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
you've got people who are pretty smart
 
00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:55.000 align:start position:0%
saying that it's not fully Anonymous
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
correct and we're happy to have those
 
00:57:57.789 --> 00:57:57.799 align:start position:0%
conversations with them all right
 
00:57:57.799 --> 00:57:59.150 align:start position:0%
conversations with them all right
representative

00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman and uh back
 
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
on page 17 on each of these activity
 
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
accounting units do you have numbers of
 
00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:12.200 align:start position:0%
clients that you
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
serviced uh for the last in fiscal year
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
24 sure so in some of those places I
 
00:58:20.309 --> 00:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
mean some of these um so if I think
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
about informatics and health statistics
 
00:58:24.109 --> 00:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
that's really infrastructure work you
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
know so that's not a direct service yeah
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
that's an exception yes but our cancer
 
00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
registry we certainly can tell you the
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
number of individuals that are within
 
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
our cancer registry and how we use that
 
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
similarly Public Health infrastructure
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
again that's a more of a Workforce
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
situation y RBS we can tell you the
 
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
number of Youth that participated and
 
00:58:47.309 --> 00:58:47.319 align:start position:0%
and both of these uh surveillance
 
00:58:47.319 --> 00:58:49.270 align:start position:0%
and both of these uh surveillance
surveys

00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
surveys
 
00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:52.280 align:start position:0%
um once they're collected what do you do
 
00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
with them and do you pass them on to
 
00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
other agencies for sure so are you
 
00:58:58.750 --> 00:58:58.760 align:start position:0%
talking about collect the actual
 
00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:01.400 align:start position:0%
information or the okay so these are
 
00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:03.640 align:start position:0%
done electronically so we don't have a
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
stack of you know individual papers with
 
00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:07.960 align:start position:0%
anybody's name on them or anything so
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's they're built into webbased
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
systems um in both of the cases of um
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
burus the behavioral risk factor survey
 
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
which is adults and the youth um risk
 
00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:19.799 align:start position:0%
behavior survey which is youth um the
 
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
data um anonymized completely anonymized
 
00:59:26.589 --> 00:59:26.599 align:start position:0%
is um cleaned and looked at by CDC they
 
00:59:28.829 --> 00:59:28.839 align:start position:0%
have a role in analyzing that data and
 
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
then we analyze that data here we put
 
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
that data very publicly and
 
00:59:36.029 --> 00:59:36.039 align:start position:0%
transparently on our wisdom dashboard so
 
00:59:37.870 --> 00:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
our data portal New Hampshire if you
 
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
want to the best way to find that is to
 
00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
Google New Hampshire data portal or DHHS
 
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
data portal so all of that information
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
is available to everyone in in the state
 
00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
and then a many um different advocacy
 
00:59:52.109 --> 00:59:52.119 align:start position:0%
organizations and public health and
 
00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:55.240 align:start position:0%
schools use the data to really figure
 
00:59:56.670 --> 00:59:56.680 align:start position:0%
out what they're going to focus on
 
00:59:58.510 --> 00:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
especially when you're talking about ybs
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's really focused the schools get
 
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
their own data and how often do you do
 
01:00:04.829 --> 01:00:04.839 align:start position:0%
this once the ybs is done every other
 
01:00:06.589 --> 01:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
year so we are currently doing it right
 
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
now we're in 2025 we do it on odd years
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
um burus I believe is done every year
 
01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
okay represented Daniels thank
 
01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:17.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you on this voluntary program
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
what what is your participation rate so
 
01:00:23.789 --> 01:00:23.799 align:start position:0%
I can get um you know I we can come back
 
01:00:25.029 --> 01:00:25.039 align:start position:0%
to you with the exact number I don't
 
01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
have that off the top of my mind head
 
01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
but the way it sort of functions is that
 
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
the school decide first of all the
 
01:00:31.589 --> 01:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
school decides that whether or not it's
 
01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
GNA they're going to participate that's
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
a local decision made by school boards
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
and and School administration so that
 
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
that sort of starts that and then
 
01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
there's a very um specific way in which
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
the schools if they choose to
 
01:00:46.829 --> 01:00:46.839 align:start position:0%
participate make the the survey
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
available to parents and then there is
 
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
an opt out process and I would have to
 
01:00:56.109 --> 01:00:56.119 align:start position:0%
um ask the com ask our folks here and we
 
01:00:58.029 --> 01:00:58.039 align:start position:0%
can probably get that to you by lunch
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
how what the number is for opting out of
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
that okay so you're you're you're you're
 
01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:05.839 align:start position:0%
saying that before the opt out decision
 
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
is made yes that they see every question
 
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
that's in the survey it is available you
 
01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
know to the degree which all of us as
 
01:01:15.549 --> 01:01:15.559 align:start position:0%
busy parents read those things I don't
 
01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:17.240 align:start position:0%
know but it is made available
 
01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
electronically for everyone and and so
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
and because this is such a
 
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
valuable source of information and the
 
01:01:29.069 --> 01:01:29.079 align:start position:0%
purposes of it are so good why wouldn't
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
a simple little marketing effort to
 
01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
parents convince them that they ought to
 
01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
go ahead and opt in instead of doing an
 
01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
opt out which you know I believe is
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
truly unethical after Decades of
 
01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
experience in corporate privacy opt out
 
01:01:47.029 --> 01:01:47.039 align:start position:0%
is an unethical way to gather personal
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
data so I I appreciate this and this is
 
01:01:51.029 --> 01:01:51.039 align:start position:0%
a place that I know that we often have
 
01:01:52.589 --> 01:01:52.599 align:start position:0%
had a disagreement especially around
 
01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
this because it's a completely Anonymous
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
survey so that there is no way to tie
 
01:02:00.789 --> 01:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
that back to an individual um I think
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
you know I will frame it this way I I
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
don't know how many of you had high
 
01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
school kids but and how many of you got
 
01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:07.640 align:start position:0%
a piece of paper that was stuck in the
 
01:02:10.349 --> 01:02:10.359 align:start position:0%
bottom of a backpack to try and get and
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
the logistics for the school district to
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
manage that certainly would suggest that
 
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
we would have far less participation
 
01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
because simply managing that is is
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
complicated and it would be on the back
 
01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
of the school district to manage so we
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
don't really know that that an effective
 
01:02:28.029 --> 01:02:28.039 align:start position:0%
marketing program aimed at parents to
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
get them to opt in we have we have the
 
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
experience of other states that have
 
01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
tried that and they've seen rapid
 
01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
declines in participation but we're
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
better all right I'll that that's enough
 
01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
enough of the public meeting thank
 
01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:47.720 align:start position:0%
you representative Daniels uh understand
 
01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
that schools can opt out parents can opt
 
01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:53.079 align:start position:0%
out uh can student opt out 100% they can
 
01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
stop they they can just choose not to
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
take it they could answer three
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
questions and sit back and not do it
 
01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:01.240 align:start position:0%
anymore no one is making anyone do this
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
survey do we actively Market that they
 
01:03:05.549 --> 01:03:05.559 align:start position:0%
can opt out or is it sort of just
 
01:03:07.390 --> 01:03:07.400 align:start position:0%
embedded in the process that they go
 
01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
with the flow and they don't even
 
01:03:10.990 --> 01:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
realize what they're doing that is
 
01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:12.799 align:start position:0%
managed at the school district level but
 
01:03:14.349 --> 01:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
that is part of the directions that
 
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
we've given them and you know again I
 
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:18.559 align:start position:0%
think for those of you who've had
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
teenagers they know when they can
 
01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
stop all
 
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
right I've I've had two
 
01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:31.640 align:start position:0%
yes okay so slide
 
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
18 um this just gives you again some
 
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
highlights a lot a lot of these you'll
 
01:03:37.269 --> 01:03:37.279 align:start position:0%
see this theme throughout the
 
01:03:38.829 --> 01:03:38.839 align:start position:0%
presentation these are just numbers
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
they're you know really for um just to
 
01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
give you a sense of the volume of some
 
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
of the work you know one of the roles of
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of population Health Services
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
is to receive data requests you you know
 
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
whether it is a right to no request or
 
01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
um some other you know media Outlet or
 
01:03:59.230 --> 01:03:59.240 align:start position:0%
uh some other entity we do data requests
 
01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
all the time we do that very carefully
 
01:04:03.069 --> 01:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
that's where our stewardship of the data
 
01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
comes in and making sure that we're not
 
01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
giving away um identifiable information
 
01:04:11.789 --> 01:04:11.799 align:start position:0%
inappropriately um we have onboarding
 
01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
we've done this thing called electronic
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
case reporting which is really helpful
 
01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
to healthc care providers so that we've
 
01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
gone from uh when you know at the
 
01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
beginning of covid we were literally
 
01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
getting fax machine responses to like
 
01:04:27.069 --> 01:04:27.079 align:start position:0%
incidences of covid we've gone to an
 
01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
electronic case reporting that's what
 
01:04:30.109 --> 01:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
the re the federal resources have
 
01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
enabled us to do and then we manage
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
about 587 data visualizations on that
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire data portal it's a if you
 
01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:40.119 align:start position:0%
love looking at charts and tables you
 
01:04:42.269 --> 01:04:42.279 align:start position:0%
can get lost in it for you know a day
 
01:04:43.870 --> 01:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
looking at all of the health outcomes in
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
the state of New
 
01:04:49.069 --> 01:04:49.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so um as you go into slide 19
 
01:04:50.829 --> 01:04:50.839 align:start position:0%
this is what that those data portal
 
01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
looks like um just are screenshots of
 
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
what you can do it's very informative
 
01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
you know we are able to cut that data in
 
01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
many different ways by areas of the
 
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
state you know by male by female by age
 
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
there's lots of fascinating ways that
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
you can manipulate that data that
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't identify individuals but really
 
01:05:13.150 --> 01:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
helps us understand the health um status
 
01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire residents um and then
 
01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
again we can only do that through the
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
data integration and the data
 
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
modernization that we work so lots of
 
01:05:23.789 --> 01:05:23.799 align:start position:0%
people much smarter than me make all
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
these things happen um I just been
 
01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
benefit by able being able to look at
 
01:05:29.269 --> 01:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
all of the incredible reports that
 
01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
happen from everything from heart
 
01:05:33.549 --> 01:05:33.559 align:start position:0%
disease to opioid use to maternal
 
01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
mortality and on and
 
01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
on so we can now move into our Bureau of
 
01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
Public Health protection
 
01:05:47.069 --> 01:05:47.079 align:start position:0%
bphp um that is on slide 20 um here this
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
is where we do that important work that
 
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
protects you know from foodborn illness
 
01:05:54.589 --> 01:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
radiological Health lead poisoning all
 
01:05:56.349 --> 01:05:56.359 align:start position:0%
of that is within our our Bureau of
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
Public Health protection um you know my
 
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
fun my you know I not only do I love
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
data I also love history you'll remember
 
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
from my presentation a couple of weeks
 
01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
ago this is the original work in the
 
01:06:10.269 --> 01:06:10.279 align:start position:0%
1880s that the Department of Health was
 
01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
assigned to do which was to ensure that
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
our food and our milk was safe that was
 
01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:17.720 align:start position:0%
the original authorization of the
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Health so we have been
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
doing this work for well over a century
 
01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
um keeping New Hampshire individuals um
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
free from adulterations and some of
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
those those things as we move into slide
 
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
21 we jump into this budget they have
 
01:06:35.789 --> 01:06:35.799 align:start position:0%
seven accounting units in here um we
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
start with food protection um there's
 
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
about 1.8 million 75% of that is General
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
funds and 25% of that is other funds
 
01:06:46.349 --> 01:06:46.359 align:start position:0%
there is no this is not a self-funded
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
program the um General those licensing
 
01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
fees and others come into the program
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
they can keep a portion of it but the
 
01:06:55.349 --> 01:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
rest of it goes into the general fund
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
and then the general fund um supports
 
01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
the program so it's not a self-funded
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
program it works with food
 
01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
establishments grocery stores
 
01:07:06.309 --> 01:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
restaurants as well as dairies other
 
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
entities including schools um and food
 
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
protection we've done about 4,000 food
 
01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:13.799 align:start position:0%
inspections a
 
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
year we um have our radiological Health
 
01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
fees this is where this is a program
 
01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
that is self-funded through those
 
01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
licensing and registration fees um there
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
are over 5,000 machines as we noted
 
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
x-rays MRIs and some industrial machines
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
um that can impact human health we make
 
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
sure that they're running appropriately
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
and we've got the physicists to do that
 
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
work um we then also these other are
 
01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
smaller um accounts in bring your
 
01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:43.480 align:start position:0%
attention to the lead poisoning
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
prevention fund this is an account that
 
01:07:47.789 --> 01:07:47.799 align:start position:0%
has other phones again other funds some
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
licensing some fees it's very small um
 
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
but we've used it most recently for
 
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
supporting a data system
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
we go into slide 22 um as I look around
 
01:08:02.029 --> 01:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
great um we have more lead funding in
 
01:08:05.069 --> 01:08:05.079 align:start position:0%
here we have um the lead remediation
 
01:08:08.029 --> 01:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
program so we have some funds from the
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:11.839 align:start position:0%
that we take some groundwater trust
 
01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
money from Dees get sent over to um
 
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
public health and we are working in
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
Partnership to support um Child Care
 
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
Facilities to make sure that they don't
 
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
have uh that they can reduce the lead in
 
01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
their drinking water
 
01:08:28.829 --> 01:08:28.839 align:start position:0%
water primarily from the hardware from
 
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
the pipes and the faucets so we have
 
01:08:32.349 --> 01:08:32.359 align:start position:0%
some resources that we're able to
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
provide child care providers to make
 
01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
safe go ahead yeah just a quick question
 
01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
so and all this stuff I don't see any
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
anything related to asbest is that no
 
01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
longer we do not um that is done within
 
01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
the divis the Department of
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services
 
01:08:56.279 --> 01:08:58.070 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services
not

01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:09:00.669 --> 01:09:00.679 align:start position:0%
DHHS and what's the reason for I mean
 
01:09:02.749 --> 01:09:02.759 align:start position:0%
lead is handled here but as best this is
 
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
handled someplace El yes it just the way
 
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
the pie is broken up I mean it asbestos
 
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
is in Dees that's all you know there was
 
01:09:13.829 --> 01:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
a time again if I go on my history uh
 
01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
Soap Box there were times between
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
there's some you know you cut the pie
 
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
differently between public health and
 
01:09:22.510 --> 01:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
environmental services we have lead they
 
01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
have asbest okay thank you yep thank you
 
01:09:28.189 --> 01:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
we do work closely with them you know
 
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
just importantly they're the
 
01:09:31.630 --> 01:09:31.640 align:start position:0%
environmental services and public health
 
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
are actually in the same building up on
 
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
Hazen drive so there's a lot of
 
01:09:36.669 --> 01:09:36.679 align:start position:0%
crossover and a lot of partnership as we
 
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
do some investigations but the
 
01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:39.759 align:start position:0%
authorities just sit within two
 
01:09:39.759 --> 01:09:40.590 align:start position:0%
authorities just sit within two
different

01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
departments thank
 
01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
you super so the lead prevention fund um
 
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.030 align:start position:0%
you super so the lead prevention fund um
the

01:09:48.030 --> 01:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:50.709 --> 01:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
7964 this is federal funds and general
 
01:09:53.070 --> 01:09:53.080 align:start position:0%
funds this is a um an accounting unit
 
01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
where we actually have lots of different
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
sources of revenue in there we have some
 
01:09:59.070 --> 01:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
CDC funds we have funds from the
 
01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:01.480 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection Association we
 
01:10:03.149 --> 01:10:03.159 align:start position:0%
use some of those funds that we talked
 
01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
about earlier those fig those um Public
 
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
Health infrastructure Grant funds and
 
01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
then we use something called the
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
preventative Services block grant which
 
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
is a uh a flexible fund that we'll get
 
01:10:16.149 --> 01:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
to at the end of the presentation it's
 
01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:19.400 align:start position:0%
budgeted in another part of the um of
 
01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
the division but this this work in lead
 
01:10:23.709 --> 01:10:23.719 align:start position:0%
prevention under
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
7964 the CDC C funds pay for
 
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
surveillance um ensuring that we reduce
 
01:10:32.510 --> 01:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
the rates of of kids with high blood
 
01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
blood levels um our general funds
 
01:10:37.149 --> 01:10:37.159 align:start position:0%
generally are used for nurses and nurse
 
01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
case management so we have when we have
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
a child that has an elevated blood level
 
01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
we have a nurse on we have a couple
 
01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
nurses on board that work with them to
 
01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that those kids get the care
 
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
that they need and the followup they
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
need the Fig that infrastructure um
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
Grant pays for some licensing folks and
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
our gramp pays for legal support to the
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
program so should I have a a a practical
 
01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
question about the lead testing we the
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
state has been making a lot of over
 
01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
efforts to reduce environmental lead
 
01:11:10.669 --> 01:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
okay I understand that fundamentally
 
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
though we still have an issue if a child
 
01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
comes in with elevated lead we we don't
 
01:11:21.229 --> 01:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
really understand how they became um I I
 
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
want to say infected but that's not the
 
01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
right word how they became
 
01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh how the lead got there poisoned that
 
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
would work is poisoned so we don't know
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
the source of their being poisoned but
 
01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
while we're trying to reduce the
 
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
environmental lead is there is there
 
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
something that am I just wrong can can
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
we actually identify the sources of
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
poisoning per child and and remediate
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
those more directly so we have enough
 
01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
evidence so I I understand that there
 
01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
are is always some question about that
 
01:11:56.030 --> 01:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
but we have enough evence evidence and
 
01:11:58.510 --> 01:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
experience over time that when a child
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
lives in a house that has um unstable
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
lead so that there's lead chipping
 
01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
peeling lead dust in that home from lead
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
paint you know as we all know lead paint
 
01:12:09.870 --> 01:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
was banned in 1970 but New Hampshire has
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
some of the oldest housing stock in the
 
01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
country so we got a lot of old houses
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
mine being one of them you know uh this
 
01:12:17.790 --> 01:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
is an area I feel personally very strong
 
01:12:19.870 --> 01:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
about my own child had elevated lead as
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
a child as as a 2-year-old because we
 
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
were doing repairs to my 1920s house
 
01:12:27.070 --> 01:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
were repairing it there was dust
 
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
everywhere it was before that there the
 
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
um the uh the uh the construction
 
01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
workers need to be licensed they were
 
01:12:36.669 --> 01:12:36.679 align:start position:0%
acting in an unsafe way there was dust
 
01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
everywhere and my 2-year-old was
 
01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
poisoned she was a thumb sucker there
 
01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
was dust in the house she put her hand
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
down she put her thumb in her mouth she
 
01:12:45.669 --> 01:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
put her hand down she put her thumb in
 
01:12:47.950 --> 01:12:47.960 align:start position:0%
her mouth my older child who was just
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
two years older had zero in her system
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
because she was not putting her hand
 
01:12:54.910 --> 01:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
down putting her thumb in her mouth so
 
01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
what we know is that when we can tie it
 
01:13:00.149 --> 01:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
back to something like that and then we
 
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
remediate that lead in the home the
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
incidence of lead in that child's blood
 
01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
goes down and if it doesn't go down we
 
01:13:10.149 --> 01:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
need to know to look somewhere else but
 
01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:12.440 align:start position:0%
by far the housing stock in the lead
 
01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
paint is the primary driver there are
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
other issues there's lead toys from
 
01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
China you know there are other things
 
01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
that could possibly be the case but in
 
01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we've seen over and over
 
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
again if you remediate the lead paint in
 
01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
the house the the lead in the child that
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
has been poisoned they're um the percent
 
01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
of blood lead in their uh percent of
 
01:13:37.629 --> 01:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
lead in their blood goes down so can I
 
01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
do an exact you know isotope to isotope
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
and prove that maybe not but that
 
01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
experience tells us something helped and
 
01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
and fixing the house
 
01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
helped so I guess that's the difference
 
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
between public health and individual
 
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
health you're you're taking care of an
 
01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
aggregate public problem and and it
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
still leaves open the fact that if we
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
have an individual patient it's hard to
 
01:14:03.550 --> 01:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
identify exactly how they got poison
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely but I know as a parent
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
of a child that had elevated blood when
 
01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
we fixed it the BL blood Le level went
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
down and that was enough for me again my
 
01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
as a homeowner um I did that on my own
 
01:14:18.830 --> 01:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
the um licensing that we do and the
 
01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
inspecting and when we put orders on
 
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
homes that's for landlords who are
 
01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
renting and making money off that
 
01:14:26.189 --> 01:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
property they have a different
 
01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility than as an individual
 
01:14:30.270 --> 01:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
it's actually something where we've
 
01:14:32.189 --> 01:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
really grown over the past couple years
 
01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
we've used additional resources to be
 
01:14:36.189 --> 01:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
able to reach out to those homeowners
 
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
because it used to be that the
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
homeowners were sort of out on their own
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
to deal with it um and so we the this
 
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
general court has been very supportive
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
of making sure that we have support not
 
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
only for the landlord we you know the
 
01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:49.400 align:start position:0%
landlords have to do it it's their
 
01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
business but also for the homeowners
 
01:14:52.990 --> 01:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
that they have the support they need to
 
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
fix to do the remediation
 
01:14:57.870 --> 01:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
I hope your child's okay she she's great
 
01:14:59.790 --> 01:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
now she's she's an adult right she's an
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
adult now but it was very scary sure so
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
lead represent Daniels thank you in the
 
01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:13.480 align:start position:0%
budget book book on page
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
921 uh in uh
 
01:15:21.629 --> 01:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
6712 of 548 re what are
 
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
reagents reagents that's a great
 
01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
question that's for the laboratory that
 
01:15:28.270 --> 01:15:28.280 align:start position:0%
is the what we use to be able to make
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
the test run so sometimes it's you know
 
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
the supplies that help so that to do the
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
testing okay thank you that's a great
 
01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
question representative sewart do you
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
have a question your mic's on oh no
 
01:15:44.910 --> 01:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
super so we'll continue to go through um
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
we have the environmental Public Health
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
tracking program that's 100% Federal
 
01:15:51.669 --> 01:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
phones funds um in addition to this work
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
in environmental Public Health tracking
 
01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
that does some data um and analysis we
 
01:15:58.189 --> 01:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
also have our radon program where we
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
gave give out those free radon tests um
 
01:16:04.030 --> 01:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
as we slide into slide 23 again high
 
01:16:08.910 --> 01:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
level 28,000 lead tests 3500 radon tests
 
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
almost 4,000 inspections in the food
 
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
protection folks are very busy um our
 
01:16:15.149 --> 01:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
provider you know when you think about
 
01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
lead testing we've had a lot of
 
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
conversation about increasing the rates
 
01:16:20.430 --> 01:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
of blood lead testing especially of of
 
01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
um youth that are or kiddos that are in
 
01:16:24.030 --> 01:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid we want to make sure that we're
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
getting as many kids tested as possible
 
01:16:29.390 --> 01:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
it's the law at age one and two so
 
01:16:30.910 --> 01:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
there's some additional information on
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
lead on slide 24 again um about 1100
 
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
kids in New Hampshire had elevated blood
 
01:16:39.790 --> 01:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
lead levels enough to impair their think
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
learn and concentrate um in 2023 that is
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
an extraordinary number to think about
 
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
that we've had there's been a lot of
 
01:16:48.189 --> 01:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
media around the fact that those numbers
 
01:16:51.629 --> 01:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
went up from 21 to 23 we believe part of
 
01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
that is being um the reason we're seeing
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
more kids with elevated is because we're
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
doing better at screening so you know we
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
all knew in the story we had early on
 
01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
around 21 when kids were not going to
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
the doctor or going for a few things we
 
01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
just simply didn't screen it so those
 
01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
numbers went way down but as we're
 
01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
getting that screening back to where it
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
needs to be um we're seeing the numbers
 
01:17:13.390 --> 01:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
go up that's not necessarily a great
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
thing we don't want more kids with BL
 
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
blood blood levels but we think it's an
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
artifact of the
 
01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
screening so represent priest did you
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
have a question I'm going to go to n
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
vano first and then you okay thank you
 
01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:17:27.790 --> 01:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
very very I know uh representative
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
Daniels raised a question on the radon
 
01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
radon testing so you're not you're not
 
01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
keeping track so if somebody sends back
 
01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
the radon test you don't actually see or
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
track or keep a registry or anything I
 
01:17:41.669 --> 01:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
we don't keep we certainly don't keep a
 
01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
registry and I'm going to have my team
 
01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
let us know what they use to evaluate
 
01:17:49.390 --> 01:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
that and and the so the test comes back
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
positive so what's the follow-up action
 
01:17:53.709 --> 01:17:53.719 align:start position:0%
on so what we've done with that is
 
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
provide some instruction to a homeowner
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
where you know that these are things
 
01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
that should be assessed by a
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
professional to understand how they can
 
01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:03.400 align:start position:0%
mitigate the radon in their house so
 
01:18:05.790 --> 01:18:05.800 align:start position:0%
really the idea about giving the tests
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
out is simply to give people the tools
 
01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
they need so they can manage their own
 
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
home and make sure it's safe and and
 
01:18:14.830 --> 01:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
just a brief followup do you do you know
 
01:18:18.270 --> 01:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
I mean I lived in other areas where Ron
 
01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
tests were basically conducted when a
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
homeowner went to sell the house and
 
01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
part of the inspection process whether I
 
01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
don't I recall whether Connecticut
 
01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
required that as part of the inspection
 
01:18:33.870 --> 01:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
process but um why that isn't uh what
 
01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
happens in New Hampshire so I'm going to
 
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
say something a little out of turn here
 
01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
and I I'm I can be easily corrected by
 
01:18:41.310 --> 01:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
the team my team we have not in my
 
01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
memory um enacted legislation that
 
01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
requires those testing it often happens
 
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
when you buy your house it sort of you
 
01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
know is negotiated on but I can't I my
 
01:18:53.310 --> 01:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
recollection is that we do not require
 
01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
it again the team can fill me in if I'm
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
wrong yeah I'm just wondering about the
 
01:19:00.189 --> 01:19:00.199 align:start position:0%
efficacy of the the program because I've
 
01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
been you know certainly in the situation
 
01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
where so house the efficacy of the
 
01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
program really you know we'll get more
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
details for you but we're really looking
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
at lung cancer rates you know we know
 
01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
that areas of New Hampshire just by the
 
01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
granite that we're built on that are
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
have higher rates of lung cancer and it
 
01:19:17.790 --> 01:19:17.800 align:start position:0%
comes from radon and so again a
 
01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
population Health a public health
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
approach is to give people the tools
 
01:19:23.629 --> 01:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
they need to mitigate their risks and
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
one of it is just knowing whether or not
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
they got raidon in their house and then
 
01:19:29.189 --> 01:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
they they have the responsibility to
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
mitigate okay thank you your
 
01:19:30.719 --> 01:19:31.750 align:start position:0%
mitigate okay thank you your
representative

01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman and and
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Miss Tilly um for taking my
 
01:19:43.470 --> 01:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
question um back on page uh 20 uh 4 do
 
01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
you have uh figures for
 
01:19:49.229 --> 01:19:49.239 align:start position:0%
24 as to the number of children that uh
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
has been tested with high blood levels
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
of lead and in their system so we have
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
we collect that data that data has not
 
01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
yet been analyzed for 24 but we we have
 
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
it it's not been analyzed and what
 
01:20:06.270 --> 01:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
measures do you have to help remediate
 
01:20:10.030 --> 01:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
it so in in ter we we follow so this is
 
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
the role of the nurse case manager so we
 
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
um ensure we do two things one um we
 
01:20:17.070 --> 01:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
ensure we address the environmental
 
01:20:20.629 --> 01:20:20.639 align:start position:0%
causes so um we could if the the child
 
01:20:23.709 --> 01:20:23.719 align:start position:0%
lives in a rented home or in we will go
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
out and do the inspection and we can
 
01:20:26.590 --> 01:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that we can talk about what
 
01:20:28.270 --> 01:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
needs to be remediated in the home and
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
that's part of how we address that if
 
01:20:33.629 --> 01:20:33.639 align:start position:0%
the child lives um in a home owned by it
 
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
their parents we just simply Provide
 
01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
support but over time we can track the
 
01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
blood blood levels as they come down as
 
01:20:43.950 --> 01:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
that remediation happens okay thank
 
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
you okay great um slide 25 gets to the O
 
01:20:50.350 --> 01:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry we still have representative
 
01:20:54.910 --> 01:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
Daniel oh I'm sorry thank you on page 24
 
01:20:57.629 --> 01:20:57.639 align:start position:0%
the chart there that shows the
 
01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
4570 people has the threshold to
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
determine lead poisoning changed between
 
01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:10.709 --> 01:21:10.719 align:start position:0%
2023 I'm going to have to get back to
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
you on that it changed I don't remember
 
01:21:15.669 --> 01:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
the date okay thank you thank you I
 
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
apologize I'm not the director of Public
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
Health anymore I should have had that on
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
the top of my
 
01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
head represent torki very quickly I'm
 
01:21:24.910 --> 01:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
looking at this I'm very conc ered to
 
01:21:26.790 --> 01:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
see that children who are on Medicaid um
 
01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:28.360 align:start position:0%
are twice as likely to have lead
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
poisoning 100% tied to I'm assuming
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
older homes lower income rents that kind
 
01:21:38.189 --> 01:21:38.199 align:start position:0%
of thing um can you if we forward look
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
to uh the proposal for um
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
changing chip um that we're looking at
 
01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
in the budget concerns about being able
 
01:21:49.390 --> 01:21:49.400 align:start position:0%
to identify these children provide
 
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
proper treatment and get them in a safe
 
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
home do you have any is so you know I
 
01:21:57.669 --> 01:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
mean we have worked very closely Public
 
01:21:59.070 --> 01:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
Health has worked very closely with
 
01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid this has been a a huge um
 
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
emphasis both in the MCO contracts and
 
01:22:06.430 --> 01:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
others is to increase the screening
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
rates for Medicaid because we know that
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
they dispropor those infant those kids
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
disproportionately live in older homes
 
01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
or in rental facilities compared to the
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
broader population and so the insurance
 
01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
is the vehicle that gets them into their
 
01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
well child visits and that's where the
 
01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
screening occurs right so there's no
 
01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
there's 's no other possible screening
 
01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:28.719 align:start position:0%
for these These are really infants SL
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
one and twoy olds one and two year olds
 
01:22:32.669 --> 01:22:32.679 align:start position:0%
one screening at one and two is what we
 
01:22:34.990 --> 01:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
do is the is the little pneumonic that
 
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
we have um so we want to make sure that
 
01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
they're getting it you know historically
 
01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
days before chip you would find Wick
 
01:22:44.830 --> 01:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
clinics trying to you know jump in and
 
01:22:46.709 --> 01:22:46.719 align:start position:0%
try and do some of the screening but the
 
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
best place to do this screening and to
 
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
manage it is within a Primary Care
 
01:22:52.270 --> 01:22:52.280 align:start position:0%
Physician's office thank you for
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
that so so I I think Mr Litman with the
 
01:23:00.189 --> 01:23:00.199 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program routinely puts
 
01:23:02.830 --> 01:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
incentives to yes get particular
 
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
behavior and it sounds like you're
 
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
implying that uh the lead testing in the
 
01:23:09.870 --> 01:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
youth is a definite
 
01:23:12.189 --> 01:23:12.199 align:start position:0%
incentive I I couldn't speak to what the
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
exact incentive is but it is prioritized
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
in their contract right so that's how
 
01:23:18.510 --> 01:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
they get their incentive uh money I I
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
believe um and then um I had another
 
01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
thing I wanted to say about that
 
01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
oh is it possible looking at this data
 
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
that because Medicaid put such an
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
emphasis on this that regular
 
01:23:36.149 --> 01:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
Insurance isn't keeping up and so it
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
isn't that necessarily that the kids
 
01:23:41.629 --> 01:23:41.639 align:start position:0%
with regular Insurance have a lower
 
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
incidence of lead it just they may have
 
01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
a lower incidence of being tested and
 
01:23:48.350 --> 01:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
evaluated for it so we look at that I
 
01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
could probably we could probably get
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
that data for you because we get lead
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
tests on every child not just Medicaid
 
01:23:56.110 --> 01:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
child children or children on Medicaid
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
um so we can look at that differential I
 
01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
do think a good driver of it is um the
 
01:24:03.870 --> 01:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
substandard conditions in the housing
 
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
all right I mean that makes sense I just
 
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we're interpreting the
 
01:24:11.070 --> 01:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
data properly because this jumps out at
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
you you know and we have made so you
 
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
know this is a place where we've also
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
made public health improvements around
 
01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
things like fixing the you know uh
 
01:24:21.950 --> 01:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
certifying the um the folks that do the
 
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
construction work that they now have to
 
01:24:26.110 --> 01:24:26.120 align:start position:0%
work in a safe way where they didn't
 
01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
when my child was poisoned we just had
 
01:24:29.629 --> 01:24:29.639 align:start position:0%
you know like our contractor doing this
 
01:24:31.390 --> 01:24:31.400 align:start position:0%
work and he was just out there sanding
 
01:24:33.790 --> 01:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
like crazy that doesn't happen anymore
 
01:24:35.229 --> 01:24:35.239 align:start position:0%
and that's in part due to the work of
 
01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
this lead program all right sry thank
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
you um so slide 25 is radiological
 
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
Health one of again my favorite things
 
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
to talk about you'll see this is that
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
pie chart I was referencing early 58% of
 
01:24:49.629 --> 01:24:49.639 align:start position:0%
the machines are in the dental
 
01:24:51.310 --> 01:24:51.320 align:start position:0%
facilities um so you can think about
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
that next time you go to the dentist um
 
01:24:55.550 --> 01:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
that's that's where a lot of them are
 
01:24:57.990 --> 01:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
you know some even surprised around 11%
 
01:25:00.149 --> 01:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
in chiropractic offices so there are
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
places that we I think it is important
 
01:25:04.709 --> 01:25:04.719 align:start position:0%
for us to have a regulatory function to
 
01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
go out there and ensure that those um
 
01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
machines are safe for human health at
 
01:25:11.229 --> 01:25:11.239 align:start position:0%
the end of the day one of the things
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
also just an interesting way that we use
 
01:25:16.030 --> 01:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
this work uh the physicists who work
 
01:25:18.270 --> 01:25:18.280 align:start position:0%
here is not only to do those inspections
 
01:25:19.870 --> 01:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
but they're also responding to
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
radiological incidents in the state in
 
01:25:25.470 --> 01:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
October we had a case where there was a
 
01:25:28.030 --> 01:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
car accident a vehicle accident of a
 
01:25:30.950 --> 01:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle that had radiological Health um
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
equipment in it and the car went on fire
 
01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
on the road and so we deployed our team
 
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
right away First Responders came
 
01:25:42.350 --> 01:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
notified us and our radiological Health
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
team went out right away to assure that
 
01:25:46.390 --> 01:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
there was no danger to the First
 
01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
Responders who were um working on that
 
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle accident so they serve not only
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
this function so to your point around
 
01:25:54.910 --> 01:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
can you do this privately
 
01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
you know you could do anything privately
 
01:25:58.990 --> 01:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
but one of the things by having it built
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
in within public health is we can have
 
01:26:02.709 --> 01:26:02.719 align:start position:0%
this emergency response function in
 
01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
addition to having an objective um
 
01:26:08.270 --> 01:26:08.280 align:start position:0%
standard to making sure that um all the
 
01:26:11.390 --> 01:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
equipment is safe thank you all right so
 
01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
we can go into the Bureau of family
 
01:26:14.910 --> 01:26:14.920 align:start position:0%
health and nutrition just just to do a
 
01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
quick time check um we got a lot we got
 
01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
a lot right uh so are we anticipating U
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
we can go back after lunch or
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
yes I think we will have to come back
 
01:26:30.669 --> 01:26:30.679 align:start position:0%
after lunch okay so yesterday we took a
 
01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
a a noon recess and came back at
 
01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
12:45 looks like we're going to do that
 
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
again this time great representative PR
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for uh my allowing
 
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
me to uh give a question um Miss Tilly
 
01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
what about the radioactive waste that
 
01:26:52.669 --> 01:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
comes from the various machines how do
 
01:26:56.350 --> 01:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
you handle that so we our team helps uh
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
is uh there are regulations around all
 
01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
of that and we ensure that they follow
 
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
those regulations to get rid of that
 
01:27:04.189 --> 01:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
waste okay thank
 
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
you great so we're going to slide into
 
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
um slide 26 which is our Bureau of
 
01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:11.480 align:start position:0%
family health and nutrition um this
 
01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
you'll recall was one of those bureaus
 
01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
that were split that is the result of a
 
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
bureau being split in half so this is
 
01:27:19.870 --> 01:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
the half that is maternal and child
 
01:27:22.189 --> 01:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
health and our women infant and children
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
nutrition program on slide 27 through 31
 
01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
there are over 20 accounting units
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
within the Bureau of family um health
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
and nutrition it's part of the reason
 
01:27:34.629 --> 01:27:34.639 align:start position:0%
that Bureau was split apart because
 
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
there were probably almost 40 accounting
 
01:27:39.310 --> 01:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
units in the combined Bureau before and
 
01:27:41.229 --> 01:27:41.239 align:start position:0%
we in order to have span of oversight of
 
01:27:44.189 --> 01:27:44.199 align:start position:0%
the budget it made sense to split it up
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
um we we can go quickly happy to answer
 
01:27:49.149 --> 01:27:49.159 align:start position:0%
any questions through here pre pregnancy
 
01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
risk monitoring s um system that is uh
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
another one of those surveys called
 
01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:55.149 align:start position:0%
another one of those surveys called
prank

01:27:55.149 --> 01:27:55.159 align:start position:0%
prank
 
01:27:57.070 --> 01:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
um and it is a survey that is funded by
 
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
the CDC um and sent to pregnant women uh
 
01:28:04.270 --> 01:28:04.280 align:start position:0%
or women who have given birth and um
 
01:28:06.189 --> 01:28:06.199 align:start position:0%
voluntary they can fill out that survey
 
01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
and send back an anonymous survey to
 
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
help us understand their experience um
 
01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
while they were pregnant and after
 
01:28:16.189 --> 01:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
giving birth um our Wick food rebates so
 
01:28:18.510 --> 01:28:18.520 align:start position:0%
much like pharmaceutical rebates this is
 
01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
another place where we use sort of an
 
01:28:22.590 --> 01:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
Innovative partnership with with uh
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
Corporate America we sign into a
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
contract to use a particular brand of
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
infant formula we re the the it is free
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
to the women and the pregnant women and
 
01:28:35.709 --> 01:28:35.719 align:start position:0%
I'm not pregnant women but the women who
 
01:28:37.550 --> 01:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
have an infant um it's free to the
 
01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
infants um we reimburse the stores at
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
that rate and we get a rebate back that
 
01:28:44.830 --> 01:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
we put into the food program so it's a
 
01:28:46.109 --> 01:28:46.119 align:start position:0%
way that we can get more money to make
 
01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
sure that we have more food for um for
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
pregnant women and young children up to
 
01:28:53.430 --> 01:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
age five there's about $4 million
 
01:28:57.310 --> 01:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
budgeted in here our MCH data linkage um
 
01:28:59.070 --> 01:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
again very tiny Grant doesn't even show
 
01:29:01.229 --> 01:29:01.239 align:start position:0%
up in our budget briefing book and this
 
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
just works on some of our data uh work
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
within maternal and child health the
 
01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
maternal and child health block grant
 
01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
5190 is a bigger um uh uh budgeted area
 
01:29:14.590 --> 01:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
it's about 5.6 million in federal funds
 
01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
3.6 million in general funds this is a
 
01:29:19.390 --> 01:29:19.400 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort the block grant
 
01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
was developed back in the 80s I believe
 
01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
um and so there's a maintenance of
 
01:29:26.109 --> 01:29:26.119 align:start position:0%
effort of how much funds that we use to
 
01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
support this work this is a lot of our
 
01:29:30.669 --> 01:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
infrastructure uh for supporting all of
 
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
our efforts around um pregnant
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
individuals and infant
 
01:29:37.629 --> 01:29:37.639 align:start position:0%
Health we go on to the next slide slide
 
01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
28 we have our newborn screening we have
 
01:29:43.109 --> 01:29:43.119 align:start position:0%
a question represent quick question on
 
01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
the maternal and child health section
 
01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
what uh constitutes qualitative
 
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
preventive you know it says increas
 
01:29:54.109 --> 01:29:54.119 align:start position:0%
access to qualitative preventive what uh
 
01:29:56.030 --> 01:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
quality preventative and primary care
 
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
services for children and women of
 
01:29:59.550 --> 01:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
reproductive Age We fund our federally
 
01:30:01.629 --> 01:30:01.639 align:start position:0%
qualified Health Centers to ensure that
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
they have high quality prenatal care and
 
01:30:06.750 --> 01:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
um pediatric care for kids so that's
 
01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
what the preventative is it has nothing
 
01:30:12.109 --> 01:30:12.119 align:start position:0%
to do with preventing pregnancy or so
 
01:30:15.109 --> 01:30:15.119 align:start position:0%
you'll well it may um so uh
 
01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
contraception is part of is a routine
 
01:30:18.990 --> 01:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
part of preventative Healthcare so
 
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
that's that could be included in here
 
01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
you'll also see a little bit further
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about family
 
01:30:25.149 --> 01:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
planning which may be the place that you
 
01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
ever question more about um the sexual
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
and reproductive Health Services right
 
01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um great we have a
 
01:30:35.790 --> 01:30:35.800 align:start position:0%
newborn screening revolving fund this is
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
another you know classically New
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire way that not use General funds
 
01:30:42.189 --> 01:30:42.199 align:start position:0%
we charge the hospitals um for the
 
01:30:44.270 --> 01:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
filter paper when every baby is born
 
01:30:46.270 --> 01:30:46.280 align:start position:0%
they get a little blood spot on their
 
01:30:48.189 --> 01:30:48.199 align:start position:0%
heel they also have ear their hearing
 
01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
tested they also have their heart um
 
01:30:53.109 --> 01:30:53.119 align:start position:0%
monitored um and we charge the hospitals
 
01:30:54.790 --> 01:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
for the filter p paper we essentially
 
01:30:56.830 --> 01:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
sell it back to them that pays for the
 
01:30:59.390 --> 01:30:59.400 align:start position:0%
program so it pays for the monitoring of
 
01:31:01.109 --> 01:31:01.119 align:start position:0%
that program it also pays for the actual
 
01:31:03.470 --> 01:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
testing we have a contract with UMass in
 
01:31:05.790 --> 01:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
Boston that does um the screening you
 
01:31:07.070 --> 01:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
have to do the screening in an
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
incredibly time-sensitive way the whole
 
01:31:11.149 --> 01:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
point of newborn screening is that a
 
01:31:13.709 --> 01:31:13.719 align:start position:0%
baby may be born looks perfectly healthy
 
01:31:16.629 --> 01:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
to all of us has no clinical signs but
 
01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:18.280 align:start position:0%
actually could have some heritable
 
01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
conditions that even things like
 
01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
drinking formula could um cause
 
01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
significant um developmental concerns or
 
01:31:27.870 --> 01:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
even death so you need to do more
 
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
screening within 24
 
01:31:33.109 --> 01:31:33.119 align:start position:0%
hours reprentative go ahead what would
 
01:31:35.109 --> 01:31:35.119 align:start position:0%
heritable conditions that would cover
 
01:31:36.109 --> 01:31:36.119 align:start position:0%
something like
 
01:31:39.390 --> 01:31:39.400 align:start position:0%
TX tax is not one of the conditions that
 
01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
we have we have a list of about 40ish
 
01:31:45.270 --> 01:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
conditions um specific to hear what we
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
screen for are the things that you would
 
01:31:50.430 --> 01:31:50.440 align:start position:0%
have a in a child that would look
 
01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
clinically normal from just sort of eyes
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
and ears and a doctor looking at them
 
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
but they might have a genetic disorder
 
01:31:58.709 --> 01:31:58.719 align:start position:0%
or some other develop some other
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
disorder that would or chromosomal
 
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
disorder that would make it that we need
 
01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
to do something quickly there needs to
 
01:32:06.510 --> 01:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
be an intervention why why would take
 
01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:09.400 align:start position:0%
Tacs not make that uh you know what I
 
01:32:11.070 --> 01:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
I'll I've got my newborn screening
 
01:32:12.910 --> 01:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
specialist sitting in the audience she
 
01:32:14.270 --> 01:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
can I can tell you that when I get back
 
01:32:16.390 --> 01:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
after lunch and I only yeah I only asked
 
01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
because we had experience with that
 
01:32:19.870 --> 01:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
where we you know had a where the
 
01:32:22.149 --> 01:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
developmental process and a grandchild
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
stopped at about two
 
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
yes and so what I can tell you about
 
01:32:28.830 --> 01:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
that so these conditions are things
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
where something bad is going to happen
 
01:32:33.030 --> 01:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
right away like immediately and that
 
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
there's actually an intervention that
 
01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
can help so that sort of speaks to T why
 
01:32:39.709 --> 01:32:39.719 align:start position:0%
it might be different than Tacs so these
 
01:32:42.109 --> 01:32:42.119 align:start position:0%
are places where um it started with
 
01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
something called PKU testing because we
 
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
knew that an an infant couldn't um metab
 
01:32:49.950 --> 01:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
metabolize fat and it would impact their
 
01:32:52.590 --> 01:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
brain development you know right away so
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
we needed to know before that baby
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
actually started eating in Formula or
 
01:32:59.070 --> 01:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
breast milk that we needed to pursue a
 
01:33:01.629 --> 01:33:01.639 align:start position:0%
different path and that so the we have a
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
process with a newborn screening
 
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
committee that determines which uh
 
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
conditions are in or out so we can talk
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
more about
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
it all right wick supplemental nutrition
 
01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
program um we have more pardon us again
 
01:33:16.350 --> 01:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
representative Daniel I'm sorry just one
 
01:33:18.669 --> 01:33:18.679 align:start position:0%
one quick question on that uh do I
 
01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
understand you to say that uh parents
 
01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
don't have a choice is that no parents
 
01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
always have a choice so they can they
 
01:33:28.149 --> 01:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
can opt out of that program at any time
 
01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
they're given information um early on
 
01:33:33.550 --> 01:33:33.560 align:start position:0%
and they can opt out of newborn
 
01:33:35.669 --> 01:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
screening okay thank you and the opt out
 
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
rate is less than 2% and and that um
 
01:33:40.830 --> 01:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
that looks to the parent to be free a
 
01:33:43.870 --> 01:33:43.880 align:start position:0%
free service yes right
 
01:33:47.870 --> 01:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so Wick supplemental um
 
01:33:50.270 --> 01:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
nutrition so that's the big Grant around
 
01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
Wick you know we take some of those
 
01:33:54.109 --> 01:33:54.119 align:start position:0%
rebate monies and sort of support what's
 
01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
in the wick program um we have more
 
01:33:58.709 --> 01:33:58.719 align:start position:0%
information about that on slide 32 we
 
01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
serve about 12 12,000 low-income
 
01:34:02.709 --> 01:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
pregnant postpartum breastfeeding women
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
infants and children to age five
 
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
tremendous program we're very supportive
 
01:34:09.629 --> 01:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
of it um and that those funds come from
 
01:34:10.910 --> 01:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
you um
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
Planning all right so very quick
 
01:34:24.669 --> 01:34:24.679 align:start position:0%
question on on the um uh
 
01:34:26.189 --> 01:34:26.199 align:start position:0%
do does do you have a program that
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
encourages breastfeeding or yes so
 
01:34:31.149 --> 01:34:31.159 align:start position:0%
within our Wick program we strongly
 
01:34:32.790 --> 01:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
encourage breastfeeding we know that
 
01:34:34.510 --> 01:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
that's the choice of every individual
 
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement to do that but we
 
01:34:38.709 --> 01:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
certainly provide the education that
 
01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding is um a very healthy way
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
to support the your infants growth and
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
development thank
 
01:34:47.709 --> 01:34:47.719 align:start position:0%
you thank you we also do that in our
 
01:34:49.229 --> 01:34:49.239 align:start position:0%
maternal and child health programs like
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
the federally qualified Health Centers
 
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
but Wick really is the strong promoter
 
01:34:55.709 --> 01:34:55.719 align:start position:0%
of um breastfeeding so in Family
 
01:34:57.470 --> 01:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
Planning will you anticipate our
 
01:34:59.350 --> 01:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
questions and try to just make it part
 
01:35:01.229 --> 01:35:01.239 align:start position:0%
of what you're about to say sure so
 
01:35:04.189 --> 01:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
Family Planning is a program funded by
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
title 10 we have some general funds
 
01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
attached to it that are generally
 
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
matched to it um Family Planning
 
01:35:13.470 --> 01:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
services are about contraception care
 
01:35:15.669 --> 01:35:15.679 align:start position:0%
about screening for cancer about
 
01:35:17.430 --> 01:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
screening for other chronic diseases it
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
does not include abortion um abortion is
 
01:35:22.709 --> 01:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
not allowed under Federal funding it is
 
01:35:24.669 --> 01:35:24.679 align:start position:0%
not allowed with within our state
 
01:35:26.910 --> 01:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
contracts we have four providers in the
 
01:35:28.750 --> 01:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that provide
 
01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
family planning Services three of them
 
01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
are federally qualified Health Centers
 
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
the other one is beln not maram Capa
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
Community Action Program those are the
 
01:35:39.390 --> 01:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
providers that we have today no abortion
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
is funded we have had several audits of
 
01:35:43.629 --> 01:35:43.639 align:start position:0%
that work that show that we have
 
01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
separation of funds um but currently we
 
01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
do not have any vendors that also
 
01:35:51.510 --> 01:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
provide abortion Services um that you
 
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
would know of happy to answer question
 
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
is it still the casee that the executive
 
01:35:59.669 --> 01:35:59.679 align:start position:0%
Council has been exercising its contract
 
01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
discretion to not provide contracts to
 
01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
particular vendors that is correct the
 
01:36:06.629 --> 01:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
last time that we brought this to um the
 
01:36:09.229 --> 01:36:09.239 align:start position:0%
executive Council we had put out had a
 
01:36:12.189 --> 01:36:12.199 align:start position:0%
um an open procurement um three
 
01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
organizations that also provide abortion
 
01:36:16.990 --> 01:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
Services went through the procurement
 
01:36:19.629 --> 01:36:19.639 align:start position:0%
met all the met all of our contract
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
standards showed separation of funds the
 
01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
executive Council chose not to fun chose
 
01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
not to move those contracts forward do
 
01:36:27.550 --> 01:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
question all right uh representative tki
 
01:36:32.229 --> 01:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
thank you this might not be a question
 
01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
for you but um do you have any feedback
 
01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
on what that lack of executive Council
 
01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
funding um not putting those contracts
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
through what that could mean for the
 
01:36:43.950 --> 01:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
financial stability of those
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
organizations that provide necessary
 
01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
Health Care to so many people in state
 
01:36:49.870 --> 01:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
yeah unfortunately because we no longer
 
01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
have a contract with them we don't get
 
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
to see their um you know audit document
 
01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
or their financials anymore they've
 
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
certainly expressed in the news that it
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
it has an impact on them but we don't
 
01:37:01.709 --> 01:37:01.719 align:start position:0%
have any uh contractual relationship
 
01:37:06.590 --> 01:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
with them so we can't no thanks great um
 
01:37:09.189 --> 01:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
I I would think that uh given the salary
 
01:37:12.189 --> 01:37:12.199 align:start position:0%
of the CEO of the New England region and
 
01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
the advertising I've seen done uh they
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
seem to have resources there's more than
 
01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
one organization I know but I'm talking
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
about a pretty specific one and talking
 
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
about some other specific ones too all
 
01:37:30.189 --> 01:37:30.199 align:start position:0%
right thank you all right um then we
 
01:37:31.629 --> 01:37:31.639 align:start position:0%
move into an area where we do have
 
01:37:34.590 --> 01:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
General funds um this is our community
 
01:37:38.350 --> 01:37:38.360 align:start position:0%
collaboration line um this serves uh our
 
01:37:41.070 --> 01:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
children by um promoting positive
 
01:37:44.830 --> 01:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
parenting programs we H in here is our
 
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Family Support Services
 
01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
our home visiting some newborn navig
 
01:37:51.550 --> 01:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
newborn navigation kinship navigation
 
01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
which is a partnership with DCF that's
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
for um when children are placed with a
 
01:37:59.470 --> 01:37:59.480 align:start position:0%
member of their family we help support
 
01:38:01.109 --> 01:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
them so that they know how to get access
 
01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
to the services they need and and
 
01:38:04.589 --> 01:38:04.599 align:start position:0%
support them in their parenting Journey
 
01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
especially for if it's a grandparent the
 
01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
second time around um and our Family
 
01:38:10.270 --> 01:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
Resource Centers and our family
 
01:38:14.229 --> 01:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
connection center at the um at the uh
 
01:38:16.189 --> 01:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
state prisons um there's a lot more
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
information on slides 36 and 37 when we
 
01:38:21.149 --> 01:38:21.159 align:start position:0%
get and as we get there we can dive in
 
01:38:22.629 --> 01:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
if you'd like or I'm happy to answer
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
questions now
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
okay so you mentioned prisons and when I
 
01:38:28.589 --> 01:38:28.599 align:start position:0%
think of Prisons I think of a program
 
01:38:31.669 --> 01:38:31.679 align:start position:0%
called Choose Love Is that in here where
 
01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
where is Choose Love Choose Love is in
 
01:38:35.070 --> 01:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
our division of Behavioral Health all
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
right thank you y um similar for family
 
01:38:41.550 --> 01:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
support on on slide 29 we have our home
 
01:38:43.550 --> 01:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
visiting we call this the formula grant
 
01:38:45.629 --> 01:38:45.639 align:start position:0%
these are funds that come from um the
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
federal government we have a small
 
01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
amount of General funds in here um
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
because we had an opportunity if we
 
01:38:54.030 --> 01:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
added some addition additional General
 
01:38:55.950 --> 01:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
funds we would get additional federal
 
01:38:58.229 --> 01:38:58.239 align:start position:0%
funds so we had a base Grant from the
 
01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
federal government uh by Anum of go we
 
01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
added some general funds so that we
 
01:39:04.149 --> 01:39:04.159 align:start position:0%
could expand this program these are
 
01:39:06.629 --> 01:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
voluntary home visiting programs this is
 
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
not DCF but it really is preventative to
 
01:39:16.830 --> 01:39:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:20.629 --> 01:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
families thank you if I could just jump
 
01:39:22.709 --> 01:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
back to the community collaboration
 
01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
again you mentioned that it's 100%
 
01:39:29.589 --> 01:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
General funds um what I'm looking at is
 
01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
back to the difference between the
 
01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
current budget and the proposed budget
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
where it shifted and changed and I
 
01:39:39.629 --> 01:39:39.639 align:start position:0%
wonder if you could clarify that sure so
 
01:39:41.310 --> 01:39:41.320 align:start position:0%
I'm going to pull that up as as I'm
 
01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
doing that I can let you know that we
 
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
used to have some federal funds to
 
01:39:46.149 --> 01:39:46.159 align:start position:0%
support this work and that was a
 
01:39:49.310 --> 01:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
time-bound grant and so we have shifted
 
01:39:51.870 --> 01:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
over time and there was an investment of
 
01:39:54.589 --> 01:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
um of dollars so if you
 
01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
see actually I don't see that in there
 
01:40:00.629 --> 01:40:00.639 align:start position:0%
you want to take it sure so so money was
 
01:40:02.589 --> 01:40:02.599 align:start position:0%
moved from the division for children
 
01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:05.639 align:start position:0%
youth and families from accounting units
 
01:40:07.709 --> 01:40:07.719 align:start position:0%
7215 and
 
01:40:10.870 --> 01:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
7216 and the and the federal award ended
 
01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
which is why you see the federal funds
 
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
zero out and the general funds increase
 
01:40:16.750 --> 01:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
and I I'll let Trisha speak to the some
 
01:40:18.629 --> 01:40:18.639 align:start position:0%
of the rationale for for moving the
 
01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
operations from DCF to dphs sure so
 
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for looking that up
 
01:40:25.629 --> 01:40:25.639 align:start position:0%
faster than I did um so again we had a
 
01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
Federal grant that did some work that
 
01:40:29.109 --> 01:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
Grant ended that's no longer funded at
 
01:40:31.390 --> 01:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
the federal level but what we did is had
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
this resource within um public health of
 
01:40:35.830 --> 01:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
folks that really did this preventative
 
01:40:38.830 --> 01:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
work and it was aligned with our overall
 
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
um programs supporting pregnant women
 
01:40:44.830 --> 01:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
and again outside of the dcyf system so
 
01:40:46.589 --> 01:40:46.599 align:start position:0%
there were programs like comprehensive
 
01:40:48.510 --> 01:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
family support that has sort of floated
 
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
around it had been in DCF it had been in
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
the division of Economic Security um and
 
01:40:57.229 --> 01:40:57.239 align:start position:0%
the notion was to move those programs
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
within public health because it really
 
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
was um sometimes we call it front door
 
01:41:03.550 --> 01:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
activities this is like out in the yard
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
this is before you enter into Services
 
01:41:07.149 --> 01:41:07.159 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that there's
 
01:41:08.750 --> 01:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
prevention and that prevention Focus
 
01:41:11.109 --> 01:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
really is the best fit for public
 
01:41:15.109 --> 01:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
health yeah great so if we go to I'm I'm
 
01:41:17.790 --> 01:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
trying real hard to speak fast you're
 
01:41:20.830 --> 01:41:20.840 align:start position:0%
you're you're doing great thank you um
 
01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
so uh home visiting again just want to
 
01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
say I really appreciate your testimony
 
01:41:28.510 --> 01:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
because you have an attorney that comes
 
01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
in and talks to us occasionally and I'm
 
01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
I swear he gets paid by the word so I
 
01:41:36.270 --> 01:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
really I really appreciate your brevity
 
01:41:38.910 --> 01:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um so we have that
 
01:41:40.510 --> 01:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
home visiting formula grant again
 
01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
federal funds we we got extra General
 
01:41:44.430 --> 01:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
funds to be able to expand that which is
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
a great investment um for a relatively
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
short amount of money um our sued case
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
registry so sued sudden unexpected
 
01:41:54.510 --> 01:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
infant death some of you might remember
 
01:41:56.910 --> 01:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
that is SIDS from when you had kids um
 
01:41:58.669 --> 01:41:58.679 align:start position:0%
which was sudden infant death syndrome
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
these are tragic deaths that happen
 
01:42:03.390 --> 01:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
often before an infant is four months
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
old we have a registry where we manage
 
01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
where we look at that data and try to
 
01:42:12.310 --> 01:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
provide preventative um services and
 
01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
embed that everywhere so that we can
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:23.229 --> 01:42:23.239 align:start position:0%
state may quick question on that is that
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I uh used to be in the news a lot
 
01:42:27.790 --> 01:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
with CRI you know crib deaths or however
 
01:42:30.830 --> 01:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
you were describing it has that uh
 
01:42:33.790 --> 01:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
contined to be I mean at about the same
 
01:42:36.070 --> 01:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
historic level so the the rates have
 
01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
come down and and this is a place where
 
01:42:39.870 --> 01:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
it's hard you know sometimes when you
 
01:42:41.830 --> 01:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
Trend that over time it's hard to C
 
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
figure out what was counted 20 years ago
 
01:42:46.790 --> 01:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
to what's counted today um we spend a
 
01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
lot of time working with our office of
 
01:42:50.669 --> 01:42:50.679 align:start position:0%
chief medical examiner who examines all
 
01:42:52.350 --> 01:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
of these deaths to understand things
 
01:42:54.589 --> 01:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
like how that baby was sleeping and the
 
01:42:56.430 --> 01:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
conditions so as we all probably know
 
01:42:58.350 --> 01:42:58.360 align:start position:0%
we've moved to this back to sleep you
 
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
know where you put babies in cribs
 
01:43:01.950 --> 01:43:01.960 align:start position:0%
nothing else in it no bed you know
 
01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
blankets or fluffy toys those are that's
 
01:43:06.629 --> 01:43:06.639 align:start position:0%
really come from the data from not only
 
01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's seid case registry but
 
01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
around the country of understanding what
 
01:43:12.350 --> 01:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
are the contributing factors to seid and
 
01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
so it's a a population Health um
 
01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
promotion as well as doing the
 
01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
individual education to you know all our
 
01:43:20.950 --> 01:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
moms dads and grandparents about why
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%

visiting is that contracted out so that
 
01:44:17.790 --> 01:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
you contract with agencies yes in the
 
01:44:20.109 --> 01:44:20.119 align:start position:0%
community who do the visiting yes so we
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
contract with names that you would
 
01:44:23.709 --> 01:44:23.719 align:start position:0%
recall places like Waypoint places like
 
01:44:25.229 --> 01:44:25.239 align:start position:0%
Family Resource Centers there's a couple

01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
visiting those sorts of agencies yep um
 
01:44:33.270 --> 01:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
Wick infrastructure money this is really
 
01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
the money that's given to us for USDA to
 
01:44:37.709 --> 01:44:37.719 align:start position:0%
manage our Data Systems we have our
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
poison control again a tiny amount of
 
01:44:41.790 --> 01:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
money doesn't even show up in the um
 
01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
budget briefing book but the Poison
 
01:44:46.189 --> 01:44:46.199 align:start position:0%
Control Center we contract with Maine
 
01:44:48.430 --> 01:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
Medical Center um they handle about
 
01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
10,000 calls a year about poisonings um
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
and we get a little bit of money from
 
01:44:55.350 --> 01:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety for that as
 
01:44:57.790 --> 01:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
well um we'll go to slide 30 we have
 
01:45:00.149 --> 01:45:00.159 align:start position:0%
early hearing detection and intervention
 
01:45:02.109 --> 01:45:02.119 align:start position:0%
like newborn screening we've learned you
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
know 20 plus years ago that it's really
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
important to screen infants um when
 
01:45:08.229 --> 01:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
they're born for hearing because that's
 
01:45:10.030 --> 01:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
when you can start doing interventions
 
01:45:11.229 --> 01:45:11.239 align:start position:0%
right away to ensure that there's
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
language development and so parents we
 
01:45:15.629 --> 01:45:15.639 align:start position:0%
do the the hospitals do the hearing
 
01:45:18.109 --> 01:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
screening parents determine what the
 
01:45:21.149 --> 01:45:21.159 align:start position:0%
best path for that would be in terms of
 
01:45:23.629 --> 01:45:23.639 align:start position:0%
um having that hearing further identif
 
01:45:25.149 --> 01:45:25.159 align:start position:0%
we the screening happens in the
 
01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
hospitals then there's further followup
 
01:45:29.070 --> 01:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
and then they can determine whether or
 
01:45:31.390 --> 01:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
not that infant might need a c CER or if
 
01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
they want to pursue sign language only
 
01:45:36.750 --> 01:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
for a child that's profoundly deaf um I
 
01:45:38.669 --> 01:45:38.679 align:start position:0%
just want to note that the next several
 
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
of these are 100% funded and so small
 
01:45:45.070 --> 01:45:45.080 align:start position:0%
that they're not uh they're not even in
 
01:45:48.189 --> 01:45:48.199 align:start position:0%
the budget vook right so so I see all
 
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
100% funding I'll the rest are all
 
01:45:54.030 --> 01:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
little I'll let the members skim
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:01.470 --> 01:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:46:04.950 --> 01:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
priest yes I just have a question on the
 
01:46:09.390 --> 01:46:09.400 align:start position:0%
last accounting unit on page 31 yes
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
could you just spell what that is it is
 
01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
the alliance allance for innovation in
 
01:46:16.629 --> 01:46:16.639 align:start position:0%
Alliance for Innovation maternal Health
 
01:46:17.910 --> 01:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
it's write down there Innovation on
 
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
maternal health safety bundles for
 
01:46:21.870 --> 01:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
substance use and peretto mental health
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
so we work with Dartmouth
 
01:46:25.310 --> 01:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
um to work with all the hospitals to
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
figure out how we can best support um
 
01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
both mom and baby when there has been
 
01:46:33.270 --> 01:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
substance use thank
 
01:46:39.910 --> 01:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
you great um slides 32 um 33 and 34 give
 
01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
you some further detail around both our
 
01:46:44.430 --> 01:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
Wick nutrition program in particular
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
Wick Farmers Market um our newborn
 
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
screening program again um you can take
 
01:46:52.990 --> 01:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
a look at some of that data that we
 
01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
captured over 90% of our infants have
 
01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
received newborn hearing screen we're
 
01:46:59.310 --> 01:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
very proud of that um and then as you
 
01:47:01.470 --> 01:47:01.480 align:start position:0%
look at some of the numbers we have over
 
01:47:04.270 --> 01:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
7,000 families um our Family Resource
 
01:47:05.950 --> 01:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
Centers have supported over 7,000
 
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
families and there have been over 5,000
 
01:47:10.990 --> 01:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
home visits um we've got additional
 
01:47:12.910 --> 01:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
information there on Healthy Families
 
01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
America on slide 35 that's a great quote
 
01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
if you're just Bor of listening to me
 
01:47:19.030 --> 01:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
talk and you want to read something else
 
01:47:20.510 --> 01:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
that's a great quote from one of our
 
01:47:22.109 --> 01:47:22.119 align:start position:0%
families about the importance of that
 
01:47:26.430 --> 01:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
program to her um as we get into slide
 
01:47:29.589 --> 01:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
36 um this may come a little bit closer
 
01:47:31.310 --> 01:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
to the question that you were asking
 
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards yesterday around
 
01:47:36.910 --> 01:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
um how we use tanif and other funds to
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
support two parent programs this child
 
01:47:41.390 --> 01:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
and Family Services um you can see on
 
01:47:43.589 --> 01:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
the map where we have those Services
 
01:47:45.390 --> 01:47:45.400 align:start position:0%
located and where they serve families
 
01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
all around the the country I me all
 
01:47:50.750 --> 01:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
around the state um and we began to look
 
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
at your two parent program from n
 
01:47:54.270 --> 01:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
Nebraska and we noticed some
 
01:47:56.270 --> 01:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
similarities to what we do now and then
 
01:47:57.709 --> 01:47:57.719 align:start position:0%
some differences that we could think
 
01:47:59.950 --> 01:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
about incorporating as as we move
 
01:48:02.910 --> 01:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
forward so a lot of the S similarities
 
01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
that um we saw to that program were
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
promotion Improvement of healthy
 
01:48:09.229 --> 01:48:09.239 align:start position:0%
relationships and co-parenting our
 
01:48:11.189 --> 01:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
Family Resource Centers Provide support
 
01:48:13.149 --> 01:48:13.159 align:start position:0%
groups and opportunities for parents to
 
01:48:15.430 --> 01:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
engage in those social connections our
 
01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:17.639 align:start position:0%
child and Family Services support home
 
01:48:20.430 --> 01:48:20.440 align:start position:0%
visitors partner to identify goals for
 
01:48:22.470 --> 01:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
themselves which could be things from
 
01:48:24.550 --> 01:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
plan future pregnancies how they
 
01:48:26.950 --> 01:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
continue their own education finding and
 
01:48:29.189 --> 01:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
maintaining their employment and
 
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
household management and co-parenting
 
01:48:33.790 --> 01:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
support which I think is part of those
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
really important there's a lot of
 
01:48:37.229 --> 01:48:37.239 align:start position:0%
promotion of economic stability again
 
01:48:38.709 --> 01:48:38.719 align:start position:0%
because we use tanif money we put
 
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
together a couple of different sources
 
01:48:42.510 --> 01:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
of funds but tanif is in here and so the
 
01:48:45.189 --> 01:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
Family Resource Centers offer budgeting
 
01:48:47.669 --> 01:48:47.679 align:start position:0%
classes tax prep questiones connection
 
01:48:50.550 --> 01:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
to benefits like like uh Medicaid and
 
01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
the Child and Family Services child and
 
01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
Family Support um cfss um also do the
 
01:48:59.950 --> 01:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
similar work around you know household
 
01:49:01.990 --> 01:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
management and co-parenting some of the
 
01:49:03.790 --> 01:49:03.800 align:start position:0%
differences that we've had is that there
 
01:49:05.790 --> 01:49:05.800 align:start position:0%
are Family Resource Centers that have
 
01:49:07.470 --> 01:49:07.480 align:start position:0%
developed support support groups and
 
01:49:10.750 --> 01:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
father- Le engagement what we've seen um
 
01:49:12.910 --> 01:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
most of our father level engagement has
 
01:49:15.390 --> 01:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
come out of DCF there's a great fathers
 
01:49:17.310 --> 01:49:17.320 align:start position:0%
group that comes there there's probably
 
01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for us to learn about
 
01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
that a little bit more in public health
 
01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
and maybe apply some of that to um a
 
01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
more population based as opposed to the
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
father engagement Group which is really
 
01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
around families that have entered into
 
01:49:31.470 --> 01:49:31.480 align:start position:0%
the child welfare
 
01:49:33.669 --> 01:49:33.679 align:start position:0%
system thank thank you for mentioning
 
01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
that you guys are digging into the
 
01:49:37.430 --> 01:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
Nebraska program I just I just want to
 
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
contextualize that for you a little bit
 
01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
and so that nobody misinterprets what
 
01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
I'm what I'm trying to do here in in the
 
01:49:47.950 --> 01:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
past couple budget Cycles uh there's not
 
01:49:50.629 --> 01:49:50.639 align:start position:0%
been a program that's been specifically
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
aimed at assisting two parent families
 
01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
at least none that have been presented
 
01:49:59.950 --> 01:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
to to us and in order to stimulate some
 
01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
conversation within the department I
 
01:50:04.030 --> 01:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
knew that Nebraska had one that they
 
01:50:07.149 --> 01:50:07.159 align:start position:0%
specifically intended for that purpose
 
01:50:09.750 --> 01:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
and so I wanted to use it to to prime
 
01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
the pump sort of speak to get you all
 
01:50:14.990 --> 01:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
talking and thinking in no way am I
 
01:50:18.189 --> 01:50:18.199 align:start position:0%
saying we should emulate that or do that
 
01:50:20.270 --> 01:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying here's a suggestion by
 
01:50:22.510 --> 01:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
another state yeah absolutely and I I
 
01:50:24.750 --> 01:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
think it's fair and I think that because
 
01:50:26.589 --> 01:50:26.599 align:start position:0%
we have flexibility in some of these
 
01:50:28.510 --> 01:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
programs they really can be dynamic and
 
01:50:31.669 --> 01:50:31.679 align:start position:0%
address needs as um as we as the state
 
01:50:34.109 --> 01:50:34.119 align:start position:0%
want to work across all of our divisions
 
01:50:36.270 --> 01:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
to meet the multiple needs you know
 
01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
around economic support around public
 
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
health promotion and prevention and I I
 
01:50:42.709 --> 01:50:42.719 align:start position:0%
think there's some value in digging in a
 
01:50:44.910 --> 01:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
little more all right thank you uh
 
01:50:47.390 --> 01:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
representative tki thank you um thank
 
01:50:48.910 --> 01:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
you I probably should have thought of
 
01:50:51.229 --> 01:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
this yesterday but I didn't um when we
 
01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
talk about the two parent family I think
 
01:50:55.069 --> 01:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
it was number four on the tanif list
 
01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
yesterday um are we necessarily talking
 
01:51:00.310 --> 01:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
about a marriage certificate between two
 
01:51:01.990 --> 01:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
people are we talking about could we be
 
01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
two divorced parents who have a healthy
 
01:51:05.750 --> 01:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
relationship and are parenting qu
 
01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
jointly maybe same-sex family uh
 
01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:10.639 align:start position:0%
parenting couple do we have those
 
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
non-traditional parents that are
 
01:51:14.390 --> 01:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
included in this so I I'm going to go
 
01:51:15.709 --> 01:51:15.719 align:start position:0%
out on a limb here because I am not a
 
01:51:18.350 --> 01:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
tan of expert there is some Antiquated
 
01:51:21.709 --> 01:51:21.719 align:start position:0%
language in TANF around marriage and
 
01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
unwit so so an unwed so I can't speak
 
01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
much more than that I know that that's
 
01:51:29.149 --> 01:51:29.159 align:start position:0%
old Antiquated language that's built
 
01:51:31.229 --> 01:51:31.239 align:start position:0%
into the system I can tell you when
 
01:51:32.709 --> 01:51:32.719 align:start position:0%
we're talking about public health
 
01:51:35.069 --> 01:51:35.079 align:start position:0%
families Define who they are and so
 
01:51:36.589 --> 01:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
that's that's what we're trying to
 
01:51:39.069 --> 01:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
support and we all know that two healthy
 
01:51:42.750 --> 01:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
caring um caretakers is it makes life a
 
01:51:45.069 --> 01:51:45.079 align:start position:0%
little bit easier than one we again
 
01:51:47.709 --> 01:51:47.719 align:start position:0%
families Define who's who's their family
 
01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
I think the statistics are overwhelming
 
01:51:51.510 --> 01:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
right that two parent families
 
01:51:54.750 --> 01:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
regardless of who making up the parents
 
01:51:56.990 --> 01:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
provide for a much more stable better
 
01:51:59.470 --> 01:51:59.480 align:start position:0%
economic environment for the kids yeah
 
01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
and I'm agnostic on you know I think
 
01:52:02.750 --> 01:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
we're agnostic of whether or not there's
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
a wedding certificate at the end of the
 
01:52:06.910 --> 01:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
day from a public health perspective I I
 
01:52:09.069 --> 01:52:09.079 align:start position:0%
I I couldn't agree more you're bound by
 
01:52:12.629 --> 01:52:12.639 align:start position:0%
the rags but um but I I I think going
 
01:52:15.069 --> 01:52:15.079 align:start position:0%
from no programs aimed at it to some
 
01:52:17.109 --> 01:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
programs even if the programs are
 
01:52:19.950 --> 01:52:19.960 align:start position:0%
focused on traditional marriage and not
 
01:52:23.189 --> 01:52:23.199 align:start position:0%
a a more current version of it I think
 
01:52:25.229 --> 01:52:25.239 align:start position:0%
that is still a step
 
01:52:27.510 --> 01:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
forward I guess I also just had the
 
01:52:30.189 --> 01:52:30.199 align:start position:0%
clarification of there's a number of
 
01:52:32.669 --> 01:52:32.679 align:start position:0%
parents who are divorced who are in
 
01:52:35.189 --> 01:52:35.199 align:start position:0%
healthy families and I'm just hoping
 
01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
that they also could receive some of
 
01:52:38.830 --> 01:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
that support but thank you for that
 
01:52:42.750 --> 01:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:46.510 --> 01:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
family um have representative Daniels
 
01:52:48.910 --> 01:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
great thank you thank you on that page
 
01:52:51.149 --> 01:52:51.159 align:start position:0%
what does it mean when it says engage 2
 
01:52:53.350 --> 01:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
225 uh
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
or 228
 
01:52:59.229 --> 01:52:59.239 align:start position:0%
fathers um what page are we on
 
01:53:03.950 --> 01:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh 37 37 so
 
01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
engaged 228
 
01:53:09.589 --> 01:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
fathers okay I'm oh I think that that's
 
01:53:11.790 --> 01:53:11.800 align:start position:0%
specifically that there was a father
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
fatherhood engagement activity so at the
 
01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
you know so each of these programs may
 
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
have done like a father's group or
 
01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
something so I I interpret that as it
 
01:53:22.990 --> 01:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
was a very specific
 
01:53:25.990 --> 01:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
father focused activity we can get more
 
01:53:30.229 --> 01:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
information for you okay I ju I didn't
 
01:53:32.669 --> 01:53:32.679 align:start position:0%
know what it mean meant first of all but
 
01:53:35.709 --> 01:53:35.719 align:start position:0%
then do you have one for mothers too
 
01:53:37.629 --> 01:53:37.639 align:start position:0%
well I so I think this is one of the
 
01:53:39.750 --> 01:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
places where you're sort of the default
 
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
historically and societally then when we
 
01:53:44.990 --> 01:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
look at you know serving 1500 families
 
01:53:47.310 --> 01:53:47.320 align:start position:0%
many of us think that's a mother and a
 
01:53:49.550 --> 01:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
child and perhaps someone else in the
 
01:53:51.910 --> 01:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
household as well again whoever they def
 
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
they um Define as their family to me as
 
01:53:56.910 --> 01:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
I understand that number this was
 
01:53:59.350 --> 01:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
something very specific for people who
 
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
identify as Fathers as opposed to a
 
01:54:05.229 --> 01:54:05.239 align:start position:0%
caretaker but we can get more
 
01:54:05.239 --> 01:54:06.750 align:start position:0%
caretaker but we can get more
information

01:54:06.750 --> 01:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:54:10.709 --> 01:54:10.719 align:start position:0%
great so we will move in um it's 10
 
01:54:12.229 --> 01:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
minutes to
 
01:54:14.870 --> 01:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
12 um I could start with the Bureau of
 
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
infectious disease or we
 
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
could I I think we're g to let
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative priest ask his question
 
01:54:24.589 --> 01:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
and then I I want to summarize and let
 
01:54:27.669 --> 01:54:27.679 align:start position:0%
us get off to lunch uh representative
 
01:54:29.870 --> 01:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
PRI you have a question I do and thank
 
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
you for acknowledging me and thank you
 
01:54:35.109 --> 01:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
Miss Tilly uh back on page
 
01:54:39.510 --> 01:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
37 do you have any past numbers that
 
01:54:43.750 --> 01:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
have shown your progress in these areas
 
01:54:45.910 --> 01:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
so we Trend some of this data over time
 
01:54:47.629 --> 01:54:47.639 align:start position:0%
and we can probably make that available
 
01:54:49.629 --> 01:54:49.639 align:start position:0%
to you that would be great thank you the
 
01:54:51.510 --> 01:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
I will caveat that is these programs
 
01:54:54.270 --> 01:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
have been very Flex so there may be some
 
01:54:55.790 --> 01:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
things that are not comparable from one
 
01:54:57.470 --> 01:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
year to another but you can ask direct
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
that so we can okay that would be very
 
01:55:02.990 --> 01:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you great thank you so so
 
01:55:05.470 --> 01:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
I think I think we're going to land at
 
01:55:07.390 --> 01:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
the beginning of Bureau of Infectious
 
01:55:10.189 --> 01:55:10.199 align:start position:0%
Disease Control as we go into recess and
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
I I just want to uh uh thank you for
 
01:55:16.990 --> 01:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
stepping in for uh Ian Ian watts is that
 
01:55:21.189 --> 01:55:21.199 align:start position:0%
his name um and uh do doing just a a
 
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
fantastic job I I think you're one of
 
01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
the most impressive people in state
 
01:55:27.870 --> 01:55:27.880 align:start position:0%
government and we disagree periodically
 
01:55:29.709 --> 01:55:29.719 align:start position:0%
but I just want you to know I respect
 
01:55:32.270 --> 01:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
what you do thank you very much you bet
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
so we're at recess until
 
01:55:49.229 --> 01:55:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:57.109 --> 01:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:57.119 --> 01:55:59.870 align:start position:0%

01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%

02:47:30.590 --> 02:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
okay it's uh it's 12:46 we're coming uh
 
02:47:34.830 --> 02:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
back in division three um from a recess
 
02:47:38.269 --> 02:47:38.279 align:start position:0%
uh in the break I uh got a question from
 
02:47:44.030 --> 02:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
the public um uh commissioner uh Tilly
 
02:47:47.269 --> 02:47:47.279 align:start position:0%
uh would would you tell us about the
 
02:47:49.230 --> 02:47:49.240 align:start position:0%
interner relationship
 
02:47:53.469 --> 02:47:53.479 align:start position:0%
uh and coordination between um the lead
 
02:47:55.670 --> 02:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
testing that public health is doing and
 
02:47:58.870 --> 02:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
the lead testing that Dees is doing and
 
02:48:01.830 --> 02:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
how we make sure that there are not
 
02:48:03.990 --> 02:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
redundancies and there's not wasted
 
02:48:06.190 --> 02:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities to share
 
02:48:07.830 --> 02:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
information thank you for the
 
02:48:11.389 --> 02:48:11.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity thanks um so I think
 
02:48:13.110 --> 02:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
specifically you are asking not about
 
02:48:15.030 --> 02:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
the lead program in general but specific
 
02:48:16.630 --> 02:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
to the funds that have come from the
 
02:48:18.750 --> 02:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services to
 
02:48:20.990 --> 02:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
to do some of that lead abatement and Le
 
02:48:23.269 --> 02:48:23.279 align:start position:0%
lead work in the in the community so as
 
02:48:25.349 --> 02:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
I noted we work closely with the
 
02:48:27.110 --> 02:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
division the Department of Environmental
 
02:48:29.150 --> 02:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
Services they have transferred some of
 
02:48:31.230 --> 02:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
their groundwater trust money to us to
 
02:48:33.790 --> 02:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
work with child care they on the other
 
02:48:35.550 --> 02:48:35.560 align:start position:0%
hand are working with schools doing a
 
02:48:37.230 --> 02:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
similar effort to get the lead out of
 
02:48:39.550 --> 02:48:39.560 align:start position:0%
the faucets and the hardware in school
 
02:48:41.309 --> 02:48:41.319 align:start position:0%
systems to make sure that water in the
 
02:48:43.630 --> 02:48:43.640 align:start position:0%
schools are safe so they have schools we
 
02:48:45.269 --> 02:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
have child care and the reason for that
 
02:48:47.429 --> 02:48:47.439 align:start position:0%
division of labor is in part because the
 
02:48:49.309 --> 02:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
department has a licensing
 
02:48:51.790 --> 02:48:51.800 align:start position:0%
um relationship with the child care as
 
02:48:53.469 --> 02:48:53.479 align:start position:0%
opposed to we we don't necessarily have
 
02:48:55.349 --> 02:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
a a relationship with the individual
 
02:48:56.950 --> 02:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
schools so they maintain the school
 
02:48:59.510 --> 02:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
piece and then they partnered with us to
 
02:49:02.269 --> 02:49:02.279 align:start position:0%
take on the child care and if you think
 
02:49:04.309 --> 02:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
about this larger you know I can expand
 
02:49:06.030 --> 02:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit to the question earlier
 
02:49:08.670 --> 02:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
around like why asbest in Dees and why
 
02:49:12.349 --> 02:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
Leed in in um public health and in part
 
02:49:14.429 --> 02:49:14.439 align:start position:0%
it's about the health impact so with
 
02:49:17.750 --> 02:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
lead it's really an urgent need to
 
02:49:20.070 --> 02:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
address um children's development so
 
02:49:21.469 --> 02:49:21.479 align:start position:0%
that's really where the impact of lead
 
02:49:23.229 --> 02:49:23.239 align:start position:0%
is most great is on childhood brain
 
02:49:25.190 --> 02:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
development and so we do the nurse case
 
02:49:27.110 --> 02:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
management and followup so it's sort of
 
02:49:29.070 --> 02:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
the onew punch of the environmental side
 
02:49:31.110 --> 02:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
of getting rid of the exposure and then
 
02:49:32.870 --> 02:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
doing the follow-up as opposed to
 
02:49:34.830 --> 02:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
something like asbest which really is
 
02:49:36.150 --> 02:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
you know the health impacts you don't
 
02:49:38.790 --> 02:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
see right away it's hard to tie it back
 
02:49:40.870 --> 02:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
and we don't do the sort of nurse case
 
02:49:42.870 --> 02:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
management for adults in the same way
 
02:49:44.710 --> 02:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
that we would for kids when we're really
 
02:49:46.469 --> 02:49:46.479 align:start position:0%
trying to ensure that they've got the
 
02:49:48.429 --> 02:49:48.439 align:start position:0%
optimal development um so that they can
 
02:49:51.110 --> 02:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:53.870 --> 02:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
school thank you you're welcome and then
 
02:49:58.389 --> 02:49:58.399 align:start position:0%
with that I think uh represent Daniels
 
02:50:00.309 --> 02:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
just a quick question on the program get
 
02:50:03.950 --> 02:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:06.389 --> 02:50:06.399 align:start position:0%
that I don't know the answer to that
 
02:50:07.870 --> 02:50:07.880 align:start position:0%
that may be something that we partner on
 
02:50:09.630 --> 02:50:09.640 align:start position:0%
but I you know what I've been a little
 
02:50:11.429 --> 02:50:11.439 align:start position:0%
separated from it we'll find out for you
 
02:50:13.550 --> 02:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I do have before I
 
02:50:17.269 --> 02:50:17.279 align:start position:0%
dive in I've got a couple of um answers
 
02:50:19.389 --> 02:50:19.399 align:start position:0%
to questions that have come in from the
 
02:50:21.349 --> 02:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
phenomenal team that is behind me again
 
02:50:23.070 --> 02:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
I apologize cuz I'm pinch hitting and I
 
02:50:24.630 --> 02:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
don't have everything off the top of my
 
02:50:26.269 --> 02:50:26.279 align:start position:0%
head um but there were a couple
 
02:50:30.030 --> 02:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
questions one was around um yrbs and
 
02:50:31.710 --> 02:50:31.720 align:start position:0%
there was a question around school
 
02:50:34.389 --> 02:50:34.399 align:start position:0%
participation and so in 20 there are
 
02:50:37.750 --> 02:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
about um 75 schools out of 82 schools
 
02:50:40.070 --> 02:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
have committed to participate this year
 
02:50:43.190 --> 02:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
so 2025 there's 91% and those are high
 
02:50:45.670 --> 02:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
schools we only do the yrbs in high
 
02:50:47.710 --> 02:50:47.720 align:start position:0%
schools um I thought some of it's eth
 
02:50:51.030 --> 02:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
grade it's eth grade high schools no
 
02:50:54.309 --> 02:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
other some schools opt and do it outside
 
02:50:56.990 --> 02:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
of the state you know but for the state
 
02:50:59.190 --> 02:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
run program we only do the high school
 
02:51:01.389 --> 02:51:01.399 align:start position:0%
thank you grade N9 to 9 through 12 so
 
02:51:03.389 --> 02:51:03.399 align:start position:0%
that's one answer for you right there
 
02:51:07.269 --> 02:51:07.279 align:start position:0%
and then on the father question um so of
 
02:51:10.630 --> 02:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
the 228 fathers that you had asked about
 
02:51:13.030 --> 02:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
they either enrolled as the primary
 
02:51:15.229 --> 02:51:15.239 align:start position:0%
parent or as a co-parent with the home
 
02:51:17.070 --> 02:51:17.080 align:start position:0%
visitor but it's likely that they were
 
02:51:19.590 --> 02:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
it was a father headed household and
 
02:51:21.750 --> 02:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
that they were participating in that way
 
02:51:25.309 --> 02:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
so um there you go and I just hot off
 
02:51:27.830 --> 02:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
the presses um uh New Hampshire
 
02:51:29.469 --> 02:51:29.479 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services has
 
02:51:31.110 --> 02:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
to get the let out program and we
 
02:51:33.110 --> 02:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
partner for the child care facilities so
 
02:51:34.750 --> 02:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
those are all my quick answers for you
 
02:51:37.389 --> 02:51:37.399 align:start position:0%
before we dive into what's coming next
 
02:51:41.710 --> 02:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
okay thanks um so we are on slide 30 oh
 
02:51:43.750 --> 02:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
okay um we are on slide 38 we're going
 
02:51:45.269 --> 02:51:45.279 align:start position:0%
to be talking about our Bureau of
 
02:51:48.870 --> 02:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
Infectious Disease Control so bck we
 
02:51:50.469 --> 02:51:50.479 align:start position:0%
call it um brings together
 
02:51:52.590 --> 02:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
epidemiologists Public Health nurses
 
02:51:55.469 --> 02:51:55.479 align:start position:0%
data analysts and others to identify
 
02:51:58.150 --> 02:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
investigate and prevent infectious
 
02:52:00.389 --> 02:52:00.399 align:start position:0%
disease and that crosses the board from
 
02:52:03.190 --> 02:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
foodborn disease arboviral which
 
02:52:04.670 --> 02:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
typically in this environment we think
 
02:52:07.790 --> 02:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
about as mosquito born disease tick born
 
02:52:10.910 --> 02:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
disease healthc care acquired infections
 
02:52:12.990 --> 02:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
and vaccine preventable disease so
 
02:52:15.630 --> 02:52:15.640 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty broad span a lot of
 
02:52:17.309 --> 02:52:17.319 align:start position:0%
times certainly in the days of covid
 
02:52:18.830 --> 02:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
used to think you know I think many of
 
02:52:20.750 --> 02:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
us thought really covid only those
 
02:52:23.110 --> 02:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
respiratory diseases but bick's work
 
02:52:25.030 --> 02:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
really is much more crosscutting than
 
02:52:28.469 --> 02:52:28.479 align:start position:0%
that it plays up Pol additionally um
 
02:52:30.269 --> 02:52:30.279 align:start position:0%
bidic plays a pretty important role in
 
02:52:33.590 --> 02:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
our emergency response from outbreaks
 
02:52:35.670 --> 02:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
again we all hurt lived through that
 
02:52:37.830 --> 02:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
with covid but right now where we're
 
02:52:39.550 --> 02:52:39.560 align:start position:0%
focused on many of those outbreaks are
 
02:52:40.950 --> 02:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
things that you hear about in the news
 
02:52:42.110 --> 02:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
things like measles things like
 
02:52:44.590 --> 02:52:44.600 align:start position:0%
tuberculosis things like Legionella and
 
02:52:46.630 --> 02:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
then ultimately we provide we partner
 
02:52:48.710 --> 02:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
with our Healthcare Providers and
 
02:52:51.030 --> 02:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
private sectors to ensure that everybody
 
02:52:53.429 --> 02:52:53.439 align:start position:0%
gets the appropriate immunizations for
 
02:52:56.309 --> 02:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
them and that that is both the school
 
02:52:58.269 --> 02:52:58.279 align:start position:0%
requ the immunizations required for
 
02:53:00.389 --> 02:53:00.399 align:start position:0%
school entry and then the immunizations
 
02:53:02.389 --> 02:53:02.399 align:start position:0%
that are not required for anything but
 
02:53:04.950 --> 02:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
are just good ideas for people that have
 
02:53:06.309 --> 02:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
particular conditions so whether you're
 
02:53:08.429 --> 02:53:08.439 align:start position:0%
talking about a flu vaccine that is not
 
02:53:10.550 --> 02:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
required for kids or adults that's
 
02:53:11.990 --> 02:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
really important especially as we've
 
02:53:14.150 --> 02:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
seen this year as those Hospital rates
 
02:53:16.630 --> 02:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
have gone up really high um for people
 
02:53:18.990 --> 02:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
entering the hospital from flu Rel
 
02:53:22.150 --> 02:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
illnesses or complications so let's dig
 
02:53:25.269 --> 02:53:25.279 align:start position:0%
into slide 39 here we get into some of
 
02:53:28.590 --> 02:53:28.600 align:start position:0%
the um accounting units um we start off
 
02:53:31.190 --> 02:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
with Ryan White which is the part B
 
02:53:33.590 --> 02:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
which is the um our program that
 
02:53:37.750 --> 02:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
provides accessible um uh medication and
 
02:53:42.150 --> 02:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
care for people with HIV and um AIDS um
 
02:53:44.910 --> 02:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
we work with people that are up to 500%
 
02:53:47.950 --> 02:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
of the federal poverty uh level or lower
 
02:53:51.030 --> 02:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
to ensure sure that they have um HIV and
 
02:53:53.389 --> 02:53:53.399 align:start position:0%
AIDS drug assistant those drugs are
 
02:53:55.429 --> 02:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
famously expensive and this is where we
 
02:53:57.389 --> 02:53:57.399 align:start position:0%
work with the pharmaceutical companies
 
02:54:00.150 --> 02:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
to also get rebates and we are able to
 
02:54:01.550 --> 02:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
incorporate those rebates into the
 
02:54:04.750 --> 02:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
program as well so I haven't seen this
 
02:54:08.190 --> 02:54:08.200 align:start position:0%
this data in a while that I can recall
 
02:54:11.670 --> 02:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
but uh do you happen to know uh how many
 
02:54:14.750 --> 02:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
HIV positive patients we have identified
 
02:54:16.830 --> 02:54:16.840 align:start position:0%
in the state and and since you just
 
02:54:18.790 --> 02:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned the expense of the
 
02:54:21.070 --> 02:54:21.080 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical what what what what's the
 
02:54:23.790 --> 02:54:23.800 align:start position:0%
average uh cost of a Year's treatment
 
02:54:25.750 --> 02:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
these days I certainly can't answer the
 
02:54:27.309 --> 02:54:27.319 align:start position:0%
second question and I'm I'm pretty far
 
02:54:28.830 --> 02:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
removed from that and our numbers are
 
02:54:30.910 --> 02:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
fairly small we're among the smallest
 
02:54:33.870 --> 02:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
proportion of um people living with AIDS
 
02:54:36.429 --> 02:54:36.439 align:start position:0%
or people living with HIV in the country
 
02:54:38.229 --> 02:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
um I've got folks behind me right now
 
02:54:40.190 --> 02:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
who will be pulling that data up off the
 
02:54:41.590 --> 02:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
top of their head but it's a relatively
 
02:54:44.110 --> 02:54:44.120 align:start position:0%
small number but it's it's expensive for
 
02:54:46.710 --> 02:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
those people who are there right um the
 
02:54:48.429 --> 02:54:48.439 align:start position:0%
the second funding source that doesn't
 
02:54:50.710 --> 02:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
know again it's other funds not General
 
02:54:52.429 --> 02:54:52.439 align:start position:0%
funds um but just in case you're
 
02:54:55.229 --> 02:54:55.239 align:start position:0%
wondering this Boston EMA part A the
 
02:54:57.830 --> 02:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
city of Boston receives federal funds
 
02:55:02.349 --> 02:55:02.359 align:start position:0%
for their um uh their uh metropolitan
 
02:55:03.950 --> 02:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
area I don't I think it's extended
 
02:55:05.790 --> 02:55:05.800 align:start position:0%
metropolitan area but I could be wrong
 
02:55:07.870 --> 02:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
on what the E stands for and part of
 
02:55:10.110 --> 02:55:10.120 align:start position:0%
their metropolitan area includes County
 
02:55:11.750 --> 02:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro Rockingham and straford
 
02:55:14.630 --> 02:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
counties so Boston gives us the funds
 
02:55:16.670 --> 02:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
that they have for their metropolitan
 
02:55:18.349 --> 02:55:18.359 align:start position:0%
area to serve the people of new
 
02:55:20.790 --> 02:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and again finally you have
 
02:55:23.670 --> 02:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
here the the rebate numbers as are the
 
02:55:26.429 --> 02:55:26.439 align:start position:0%
the funding source for the rebates so
 
02:55:30.389 --> 02:55:30.399 align:start position:0%
that leads us into um I know to 5170
 
02:55:32.469 --> 02:55:32.479 align:start position:0%
which is the large one of the large
 
02:55:35.870 --> 02:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
Disease Control um Aus and in that we
 
02:55:38.469 --> 02:55:38.479 align:start position:0%
are tracking more than 8,000 reports of
 
02:55:41.190 --> 02:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
infectious disease and more than 300
 
02:55:44.070 --> 02:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
outbreaks a year um and those outbreaks
 
02:55:46.469 --> 02:55:46.479 align:start position:0%
can include anything from flu in a
 
02:55:49.389 --> 02:55:49.399 align:start position:0%
nursing home to measels in the Upper
 
02:55:52.030 --> 02:55:52.040 align:start position:0%
Valley so these are busy folks getting
 
02:55:54.309 --> 02:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
lots of data in lots of reports that
 
02:55:56.309 --> 02:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
they're managing and managing those
 
02:55:59.670 --> 02:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
outbreaks in congregate settings um that
 
02:56:02.070 --> 02:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
also includes in some of those um
 
02:56:04.510 --> 02:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
outbreaks um representative Mooney has a
 
02:56:06.150 --> 02:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
question but I also want to ask you in
 
02:56:10.309 --> 02:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
here are we seeing any upticks in um
 
02:56:15.389 --> 02:56:15.399 align:start position:0%
diseases like um Hepatitis B um that are
 
02:56:18.910 --> 02:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
often associated with um immigr
 
02:56:21.070 --> 02:56:21.080 align:start position:0%
ation I don't think that we have seen an
 
02:56:24.750 --> 02:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
uptick necessarily in Hepatitis B um
 
02:56:26.630 --> 02:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
again I can be corrected on that what I
 
02:56:29.590 --> 02:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
can say is that with hepatitis A B and C
 
02:56:31.790 --> 02:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
are have all been historically on have
 
02:56:33.550 --> 02:56:33.560 align:start position:0%
been on the rise right now for lots of
 
02:56:35.389 --> 02:56:35.399 align:start position:0%
different reasons and there are some you
 
02:56:37.630 --> 02:56:37.640 align:start position:0%
know but we haven't seen anything
 
02:56:40.269 --> 02:56:40.279 align:start position:0%
specifically tied that I'm aware of to
 
02:56:41.950 --> 02:56:41.960 align:start position:0%
um a new American or an immigrant
 
02:56:44.269 --> 02:56:44.279 align:start position:0%
population all right um and there was a
 
02:56:45.630 --> 02:56:45.640 align:start position:0%
second one I don't remember which
 
02:56:48.750 --> 02:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
disease is associated with um
 
02:56:50.590 --> 02:56:50.600 align:start position:0%
potentially with the immigration
 
02:56:53.830 --> 02:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
population but but just generally we're
 
02:56:57.030 --> 02:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
not seeing an uptick in any not not in
 
02:56:58.870 --> 02:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
any significant way that I'm aware of
 
02:57:00.550 --> 02:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Mooney thank
 
02:57:02.910 --> 02:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for being here
 
02:57:05.870 --> 02:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
a constituent once contacted me and was
 
02:57:09.790 --> 02:57:09.800 align:start position:0%
concerned about a headlice breakout at a
 
02:57:12.510 --> 02:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
school they wanted to know who to talk
 
02:57:16.790 --> 02:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
to naturally on their behalf I contacted
 
02:57:21.790 --> 02:57:21.800 align:start position:0%
DHHS and to surprise was told no not us
 
02:57:24.750 --> 02:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
you contact the Department of Education
 
02:57:27.830 --> 02:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
so my question to you is why and are
 
02:57:31.150 --> 02:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
there any other such uh contagious type
 
02:57:32.910 --> 02:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
conditions that are also handled by
 
02:57:35.389 --> 02:57:35.399 align:start position:0%
other departments thank you so thank you
 
02:57:38.030 --> 02:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
that's a lice is you know I think I you
 
02:57:39.630 --> 02:57:39.640 align:start position:0%
start itching just thinking about it
 
02:57:42.950 --> 02:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
right there um so it is correct we do
 
02:57:46.269 --> 02:57:46.279 align:start position:0%
not handle um headlights uh outbreaks or
 
02:57:48.389 --> 02:57:48.399 align:start position:0%
anything mainly because there isn't a
 
02:57:50.870 --> 02:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
significant risk to human health it is
 
02:57:53.030 --> 02:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
annoying it is not something we want in
 
02:57:55.389 --> 02:57:55.399 align:start position:0%
our you know among in our children or
 
02:57:57.229 --> 02:57:57.239 align:start position:0%
ourselves but there's not a real
 
02:57:59.309 --> 02:57:59.319 align:start position:0%
infectious disease risk associated with
 
02:58:01.229 --> 02:58:01.239 align:start position:0%
headli and so typically the Department
 
02:58:03.269 --> 02:58:03.279 align:start position:0%
of Education School nurses handle that
 
02:58:05.710 --> 02:58:05.720 align:start position:0%
on their own thank
 
02:58:08.429 --> 02:58:08.439 align:start position:0%
you represent Tori that just brings me
 
02:58:09.790 --> 02:58:09.800 align:start position:0%
to something else but what about bed
 
02:58:11.710 --> 02:58:11.720 align:start position:0%
bugs do you guys deal with that or is
 
02:58:16.550 --> 02:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
that where does that fall so um in in um
 
02:58:18.830 --> 02:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
we do address bed bugs to a smaller
 
02:58:21.269 --> 02:58:21.279 align:start position:0%
degree in our health officer liaison
 
02:58:24.150 --> 02:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
roles so often that is HP that is dealt
 
02:58:26.229 --> 02:58:26.239 align:start position:0%
with at the local level with our local
 
02:58:28.110 --> 02:58:28.120 align:start position:0%
Health officers and so we work with our
 
02:58:29.990 --> 02:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
health officers to provide them the
 
02:58:31.710 --> 02:58:31.720 align:start position:0%
training that they need but it's
 
02:58:33.429 --> 02:58:33.439 align:start position:0%
addressed at at the local level not at
 
02:58:36.150 --> 02:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
the state level thank you are is is
 
02:58:37.750 --> 02:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
there anything in the health officer
 
02:58:40.429 --> 02:58:40.439 align:start position:0%
budget that is in your public health
 
02:58:42.469 --> 02:58:42.479 align:start position:0%
section so we have a little bit that was
 
02:58:44.269 --> 02:58:44.279 align:start position:0%
actually back in our Bureau of Public
 
02:58:46.309 --> 02:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
Health protection for the most part it's
 
02:58:48.590 --> 02:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
embedded there we have one fulltime
 
02:58:51.469 --> 02:58:51.479 align:start position:0%
position that is a liaison to the health
 
02:58:53.750 --> 02:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
officers and so we just provide them
 
02:58:56.070 --> 02:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
with support and then we utilize the
 
02:58:58.510 --> 02:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
entire team at Public Health to provide
 
02:59:00.830 --> 02:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
the specific information that they might
 
02:59:03.030 --> 02:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
need in their role the health officers
 
02:59:05.349 --> 02:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
do a lot of environmental work around Su
 
02:59:08.510 --> 02:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
septic and sewer and um have different
 
02:59:10.870 --> 02:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
roles in each Community again a health
 
02:59:14.070 --> 02:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
officer and a teeny tiny um rural town
 
02:59:15.830 --> 02:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
is going to look very different than the
 
02:59:17.630 --> 02:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
health officer at Manchester so we
 
02:59:19.309 --> 02:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
provide some support and we provide
 
02:59:21.229 --> 02:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
training for the most part all right
 
02:59:23.510 --> 02:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you great thank you so we can go
 
02:59:29.269 --> 02:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
into slide um 40 um we have um we can
 
02:59:31.229 --> 02:59:31.239 align:start position:0%
dive into the mosquito control fund just
 
02:59:33.670 --> 02:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
so you know that this is a very small
 
02:59:35.790 --> 02:59:35.800 align:start position:0%
amount of money that we set aside in
 
02:59:38.590 --> 02:59:38.600 align:start position:0%
case there is a declared emergency
 
02:59:41.349 --> 02:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
around a mosquito born illness we don't
 
02:59:43.030 --> 02:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
typically use this is a sort of money
 
02:59:45.990 --> 02:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's just um put in in reserve in case
 
02:59:49.990 --> 02:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
of emergency it's fairly small um 5177
 
02:59:51.389 --> 02:59:51.399 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk a little bit more on
 
02:59:54.830 --> 02:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
slide 43 about that um but this is the
 
02:59:57.349 --> 02:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
funding for um that we received from the
 
02:59:59.750 --> 02:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire vaccine Association to
 
03:00:01.630 --> 03:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
help ensure universal access to
 
03:00:04.870 --> 03:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
Childhood vaccines that's we're going to
 
03:00:08.950 --> 03:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
um so so you know there's a bill that's
 
03:00:11.830 --> 03:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
talking about um eliminating the New
 
03:00:16.269 --> 03:00:16.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire vaccine association yes um and
 
03:00:18.550 --> 03:00:18.560 align:start position:0%
as I understand the the two key
 
03:00:21.550 --> 03:00:21.560 align:start position:0%
arguments one is that this is a great
 
03:00:24.150 --> 03:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
value ad in terms of being able to uh
 
03:00:27.030 --> 03:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
collect money from the vaccine
 
03:00:29.750 --> 03:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and to effectively reduce
 
03:00:33.389 --> 03:00:33.399 align:start position:0%
prices for our consumers um the the
 
03:00:36.510 --> 03:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
there are some concern that by having
 
03:00:39.309 --> 03:00:39.319 align:start position:0%
the state in a position to um I'm just
 
03:00:43.190 --> 03:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
going to air quote profit off of of
 
03:00:45.870 --> 03:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
these rebates that there's a built-in
 
03:00:49.830 --> 03:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
incentive to put more vaccines on the
 
03:00:52.269 --> 03:00:52.279 align:start position:0%
registry so that there's more control
 
03:00:54.830 --> 03:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
and more money so those are kind of the
 
03:00:57.269 --> 03:00:57.279 align:start position:0%
two positions I've heard what what are
 
03:00:59.309 --> 03:00:59.319 align:start position:0%
your thoughts so thank you so if I could
 
03:01:00.670 --> 03:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
just sort of correct the record a little
 
03:01:02.190 --> 03:01:02.200 align:start position:0%
bit on that the way that the New
 
03:01:04.710 --> 03:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire vaccine Association works is
 
03:01:06.910 --> 03:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
that it is an independent organization
 
03:01:10.750 --> 03:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
it is set up in statute and it um sets
 
03:01:12.830 --> 03:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
assessment rates from the commercial
 
03:01:15.710 --> 03:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
payers and so it sets an assessment and
 
03:01:18.990 --> 03:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
ensures that we have um essentially bulk
 
03:01:21.990 --> 03:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
purchasing for insurance we they collect
 
03:01:23.389 --> 03:01:23.399 align:start position:0%
the funds the New Hampshire vaccine
 
03:01:25.870 --> 03:01:25.880 align:start position:0%
Association collects the funds from the
 
03:01:28.510 --> 03:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
commercial prayers they then transfer
 
03:01:31.309 --> 03:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
the funds to the state and that allows
 
03:01:34.950 --> 03:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
DHHS to buy immunizations at a cheaper
 
03:01:37.750 --> 03:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
rate through the CDC so it is a
 
03:01:40.229 --> 03:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
financing mechanism that allow that does
 
03:01:43.750 --> 03:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
two things it um allows larger bulk P
 
03:01:45.550 --> 03:01:45.560 align:start position:0%
purchasing which is actually a costs
 
03:01:48.750 --> 03:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
saver to the carriers which is important
 
03:01:51.550 --> 03:01:51.560 align:start position:0%
and then secondly it also ensures that
 
03:01:54.990 --> 03:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
the providers by us managing buying the
 
03:01:57.550 --> 03:01:57.560 align:start position:0%
those vaccines in bulk again childhood
 
03:02:00.469 --> 03:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
vaccines buying those in bulk it makes
 
03:02:02.190 --> 03:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
it is a savings to the health care
 
03:02:04.389 --> 03:02:04.399 align:start position:0%
providers that don't have to negotiate
 
03:02:06.670 --> 03:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
with each of their carriers to figure
 
03:02:08.790 --> 03:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
out which and which vaccines they have
 
03:02:10.670 --> 03:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
when they're going to have it and so it
 
03:02:12.670 --> 03:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
really is a financial mechanism the New
 
03:02:14.790 --> 03:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire vaccine Association does not
 
03:02:17.269 --> 03:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
set immunization policy it does not
 
03:02:19.510 --> 03:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
receive any State funds and it doesn't
 
03:02:24.349 --> 03:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
determine which immunization the state
 
03:02:29.150 --> 03:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:31.990 --> 03:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
you represent torki I just want to
 
03:02:34.469 --> 03:02:34.479 align:start position:0%
better understand the impact of this
 
03:02:35.790 --> 03:02:35.800 align:start position:0%
bill that's coming to the floor on
 
03:02:37.790 --> 03:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
Thursday in the financial impact
 
03:02:40.830 --> 03:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
particularly for uh pediatricians or
 
03:02:42.830 --> 03:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
Physicians up in the north country where
 
03:02:45.910 --> 03:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
there's maybe one practitioner um maybe
 
03:02:48.429 --> 03:02:48.439 align:start position:0%
not a large number of patients
 
03:02:50.349 --> 03:02:50.359 align:start position:0%
and we know these vaccines can sometimes
 
03:02:52.870 --> 03:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
be expensive but they also expire so
 
03:02:54.750 --> 03:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
they need to have the dose at the right
 
03:02:56.670 --> 03:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
time when the parent shows up with the
 
03:02:59.030 --> 03:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
child that kind of thing could we
 
03:03:00.710 --> 03:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
potentially find ourselves in a
 
03:03:02.110 --> 03:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
situation where the doctors the
 
03:03:04.150 --> 03:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
providers would not have vaccines ready
 
03:03:05.990 --> 03:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
and available when a family shows up and
 
03:03:07.910 --> 03:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
wants to give their child a vaccination
 
03:03:10.030 --> 03:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
the short answer to that is yes we would
 
03:03:13.790 --> 03:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
not um especially we saw this with RSV a
 
03:03:15.030 --> 03:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago there was a new
 
03:03:19.389 --> 03:03:19.399 align:start position:0%
vaccine for RSV for infants um and uh
 
03:03:20.990 --> 03:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
the state could not purchase it
 
03:03:22.309 --> 03:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
originally it could not be part of the
 
03:03:23.710 --> 03:03:23.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire vaccine Association
 
03:03:26.150 --> 03:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
because of the the um technical language
 
03:03:27.790 --> 03:03:27.800 align:start position:0%
of the way our statue was written we
 
03:03:29.190 --> 03:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
actually we've solved that we've
 
03:03:32.070 --> 03:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
remedied that right now but early on in
 
03:03:34.710 --> 03:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
that process this new the state of New
 
03:03:36.710 --> 03:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could not participate so we
 
03:03:40.910 --> 03:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
were able to get some um funds through
 
03:03:43.590 --> 03:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid so that Medicaid kids could
 
03:03:45.990 --> 03:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
have access to the RSV vaccine but there
 
03:03:48.750 --> 03:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
was a physician in Norther in Coos
 
03:03:51.309 --> 03:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
County that wasn't able to access it in
 
03:03:53.469 --> 03:03:53.479 align:start position:0%
a timely way for his commercial paid
 
03:03:55.309 --> 03:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
kids at that at that time and so it was
 
03:03:57.389 --> 03:03:57.399 align:start position:0%
set up this process where some kids
 
03:03:59.110 --> 03:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
could get access to vaccine and some
 
03:04:01.190 --> 03:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
kids couldn't one of the things that our
 
03:04:03.990 --> 03:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine program does once you sort of
 
03:04:05.870 --> 03:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
Peel away some of the you know
 
03:04:08.229 --> 03:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
ideological thoughts around vaccine is
 
03:04:10.750 --> 03:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
we actually manage the control of them
 
03:04:11.990 --> 03:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine these are really
 
03:04:13.710 --> 03:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
sensitive pharmaceutical products
 
03:04:14.790 --> 03:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
they've got to have you have to have
 
03:04:17.950 --> 03:04:17.960 align:start position:0%
cold chain management and um both both
 
03:04:20.229 --> 03:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
the the bulk purchasing allows us to
 
03:04:22.590 --> 03:04:22.600 align:start position:0%
take that responsibility on and we can
 
03:04:24.830 --> 03:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
manage that and be able to get the the
 
03:04:27.790 --> 03:04:27.800 align:start position:0%
right number of vacines to the providers
 
03:04:30.790 --> 03:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
as they need them so somewhat connected
 
03:04:33.389 --> 03:04:33.399 align:start position:0%
to that with the most recent outbreak of
 
03:04:35.830 --> 03:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
measles in Texas and the unfortunate
 
03:04:39.830 --> 03:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
death um I believe it was last week
 
03:04:42.510 --> 03:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
um this would the way I'm interpreting
 
03:04:44.510 --> 03:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
it could potentially prevent people who
 
03:04:46.110 --> 03:04:46.120 align:start position:0%
want a vaccine from getting a vaccine in
 
03:04:48.349 --> 03:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
a timely manner uh could this open the
 
03:04:51.269 --> 03:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
door to a possible outbreak of um any
 
03:04:52.630 --> 03:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
one of these diseases here in New
 
03:04:54.670 --> 03:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire certainly I mean that's always
 
03:04:56.469 --> 03:04:56.479 align:start position:0%
Our concern is that as we've seen
 
03:04:58.870 --> 03:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
immunization rates drop over time and
 
03:05:01.030 --> 03:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
families can choose what they want to do
 
03:05:02.990 --> 03:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
for their own Children's Health but
 
03:05:05.349 --> 03:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
there are a set of highly contagious
 
03:05:07.670 --> 03:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
diseases for which we have school and
 
03:05:09.790 --> 03:05:09.800 align:start position:0%
child care entry requirements for
 
03:05:12.110 --> 03:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine those and it is for a very
 
03:05:14.349 --> 03:05:14.359 align:start position:0%
limited number it's not covid we've had
 
03:05:15.790 --> 03:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
this conversation many times the
 
03:05:18.429 --> 03:05:18.439 align:start position:0%
department has never anticipated ated or
 
03:05:20.870 --> 03:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
suggested that Co be a required vaccine
 
03:05:22.630 --> 03:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
for school entry we're talking about
 
03:05:24.550 --> 03:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
things like measles mumps and rubella
 
03:05:26.870 --> 03:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
things that are highly contagious um and
 
03:05:29.309 --> 03:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
have been managed for many years and as
 
03:05:32.469 --> 03:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
we see um reduced vaccination rates
 
03:05:34.190 --> 03:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
we're seeing this we're seeing measles
 
03:05:36.349 --> 03:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
pop up more and more it's incredibly
 
03:05:38.990 --> 03:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
virulent um we had our own measles
 
03:05:41.750 --> 03:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
outbreak in the um Upper Valley last
 
03:05:44.429 --> 03:05:44.439 align:start position:0%
summer small number five people but
 
03:05:46.309 --> 03:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
still and it was a visitor to New
 
03:05:49.070 --> 03:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who had meas and you know the
 
03:05:51.110 --> 03:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
transmission happened in places like in
 
03:05:54.110 --> 03:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
a store together you know and and so we
 
03:05:55.630 --> 03:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
want to control that and we know that
 
03:05:58.030 --> 03:05:58.040 align:start position:0%
measles is incredibly dangerous as well
 
03:06:00.630 --> 03:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
to to kids health thank you
 
03:06:02.429 --> 03:06:02.439 align:start position:0%
representative nvum yes thank you
 
03:06:05.309 --> 03:06:05.319 align:start position:0%
chairman so if I my understanding is
 
03:06:08.030 --> 03:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
correct the and you know it's this is uh
 
03:06:10.630 --> 03:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
new to me the New Hampshire vaccine
 
03:06:12.469 --> 03:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
Association they actually holding
 
03:06:13.910 --> 03:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
inventories because you said they're
 
03:06:16.910 --> 03:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
managing so their their their primary
 
03:06:21.309 --> 03:06:21.319 align:start position:0%
role is negotiating a a bulk rate and U
 
03:06:23.190 --> 03:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
so their primary role really is in
 
03:06:25.830 --> 03:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
assessing the um anticipating with us
 
03:06:27.349 --> 03:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
the number of vaccines that the
 
03:06:28.750 --> 03:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:06:30.590 --> 03:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
is going to need we work with them we
 
03:06:32.030 --> 03:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
share that information that we
 
03:06:33.990 --> 03:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
anticipate to we are going to need
 
03:06:37.269 --> 03:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
200,000 vaccines their role is to work
 
03:06:39.469 --> 03:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
and negotiate with the commercial payers
 
03:06:41.349 --> 03:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
the state does not have a role in that
 
03:06:43.110 --> 03:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
they work with the commercial payers and
 
03:06:44.990 --> 03:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
say how is they going to assess that
 
03:06:46.950 --> 03:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
among their covered lives they use a
 
03:06:49.550 --> 03:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
covered live methodology they gather the
 
03:06:51.349 --> 03:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
money they give the money to us the
 
03:06:52.870 --> 03:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:06:54.750 --> 03:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
purchases the vaccines so they're not
 
03:06:56.990 --> 03:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
hold that Association really isn't
 
03:06:57.000 --> 03:06:58.030 align:start position:0%
hold that Association really isn't
physically

03:06:58.030 --> 03:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
physically
 
03:07:01.269 --> 03:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
holding um and but they are a financial
 
03:07:02.750 --> 03:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
transaction and when you say they're
 
03:07:06.590 --> 03:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
managing the the uh supply chain uh that
 
03:07:09.269 --> 03:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
that's a quality assurance uh role
 
03:07:12.070 --> 03:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
rather than physically handling the
 
03:07:14.030 --> 03:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
supply chain is managed by the
 
03:07:15.469 --> 03:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:07:18.830 --> 03:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
by public health
 
03:07:20.670 --> 03:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
the role of the New Hampshire vaccine
 
03:07:23.229 --> 03:07:23.239 align:start position:0%
Association is primarily
 
03:07:26.590 --> 03:07:26.600 align:start position:0%
Financial okay so yeah and primarily
 
03:07:30.030 --> 03:07:30.040 align:start position:0%
rate negotiation on on a bulk uh
 
03:07:32.830 --> 03:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
basis thank you and the rate negotiation
 
03:07:35.910 --> 03:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
depends upon a good estimate of
 
03:07:39.389 --> 03:07:39.399 align:start position:0%
volume yeah all right representative
 
03:07:41.510 --> 03:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
seaworth thank you Mr chairman my
 
03:07:44.790 --> 03:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
questions actually for you should this
 
03:07:47.550 --> 03:07:47.560 align:start position:0%
um bill that we're referencing pass I
 
03:07:49.750 --> 03:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
saw it has a fiscal note do you expect
 
03:07:52.469 --> 03:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
it if it makes it through Thursday
 
03:07:54.950 --> 03:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
session to come before
 
03:07:57.349 --> 03:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
us that's an excellent question I don't
 
03:08:01.630 --> 03:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:05.389 --> 03:08:05.399 align:start position:0%
answer great so thank you um we'll move
 
03:08:07.710 --> 03:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
on then to hospital acquired
 
03:08:07.720 --> 03:08:09.269 align:start position:0%
on then to hospital acquired
affections

03:08:09.269 --> 03:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
affections
 
03:08:12.469 --> 03:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
sorry I to response to your question it
 
03:08:14.550 --> 03:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
should come before us the chair of
 
03:08:17.070 --> 03:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
Finance has out the perview to wave it
 
03:08:18.910 --> 03:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
coming to a second committee which would
 
03:08:20.630 --> 03:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
prevent us from having the discussion on
 
03:08:22.830 --> 03:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
the bill um I just wanted to clarify
 
03:08:24.790 --> 03:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
that and then I believe representative
 
03:08:27.830 --> 03:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
has a question yeah it's a thank you
 
03:08:29.990 --> 03:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's a previous question on communicable
 
03:08:31.910 --> 03:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
disease one it comes up every once in a
 
03:08:33.990 --> 03:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
while it's in the in the news is what is
 
03:08:36.990 --> 03:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
it Triple E the in uh yes does that is
 
03:08:39.070 --> 03:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
that something that uh you're you're
 
03:08:41.469 --> 03:08:41.479 align:start position:0%
dealing with that's an e uh sorry horse
 
03:08:42.990 --> 03:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
has to do with in fact we're going to
 
03:08:45.030 --> 03:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about SL on slide 43
 
03:08:46.550 --> 03:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
if you give me 30 seconds we'll get
 
03:08:49.590 --> 03:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
there we'll talk about it um so super so
 
03:08:51.590 --> 03:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
um additionally Small Program around
 
03:08:53.750 --> 03:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
Hospital acquired infections for those
 
03:08:55.790 --> 03:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
of you who are on HHS oversight we do a
 
03:08:57.510 --> 03:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
report about Hospital inquired
 
03:09:00.870 --> 03:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
affections every year we we um do both
 
03:09:03.190 --> 03:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
training for hospitals as well as the
 
03:09:05.269 --> 03:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
surveillance around watching whether
 
03:09:07.469 --> 03:09:07.479 align:start position:0%
those infections go up or down and then
 
03:09:11.389 --> 03:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
finally the large um uh account the last
 
03:09:13.229 --> 03:09:13.239 align:start position:0%
large account in our bidic in our Bureau
 
03:09:14.990 --> 03:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
of Infectious Disease Control is around
 
03:09:17.910 --> 03:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
STD and HIV prevention again you'll see
 
03:09:20.469 --> 03:09:20.479 align:start position:0%
some of the rebate money in there mostly
 
03:09:23.070 --> 03:09:23.080 align:start position:0%
federally funded um and it provides
 
03:09:27.269 --> 03:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
funding for no cost um and H STI and HIV
 
03:09:29.469 --> 03:09:29.479 align:start position:0%
testing at the two City Health
 
03:09:31.469 --> 03:09:31.479 align:start position:0%
departments as well as all the
 
03:09:34.070 --> 03:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
investigation and monitoring of STI and
 
03:09:36.950 --> 03:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
HIV in the state things like cyia which
 
03:09:38.309 --> 03:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
is probably the thing that we have the
 
03:09:40.510 --> 03:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
most reports on in that we don't
 
03:09:41.910 --> 03:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
investigate every single case of
 
03:09:43.790 --> 03:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
chlamydia but they are reported to us
 
03:09:46.190 --> 03:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
and then other things like syphilis
 
03:09:48.349 --> 03:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
gonorrhea um especially when we think
 
03:09:50.349 --> 03:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
about syphilis among pregnant um
 
03:09:52.030 --> 03:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
individuals that requires deeper
 
03:09:55.309 --> 03:09:55.319 align:start position:0%
investigation and support along the way
 
03:09:57.590 --> 03:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
um we have among the lowest rates in the
 
03:09:59.269 --> 03:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
country of sexually transmitted
 
03:10:01.469 --> 03:10:01.479 align:start position:0%
infections which is really uh something
 
03:10:03.030 --> 03:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
that we want to maintain as we go
 
03:10:06.950 --> 03:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
forward so so a question there um this
 
03:10:10.590 --> 03:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
may be for Mr White it's unusual to see
 
03:10:12.950 --> 03:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
this distribution of funds I I get the
 
03:10:16.830 --> 03:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
10% I I I I don't understand how we got
 
03:10:22.349 --> 03:10:22.359 align:start position:0%
to two % on General funds for um STD
 
03:10:25.870 --> 03:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
prevention why are we doing 2% is that a
 
03:10:29.110 --> 03:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
c a minimum effort thing or is that a
 
03:10:30.670 --> 03:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
it's not a match it's likely cost
 
03:10:33.590 --> 03:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
allocation but I will let Nathan correct
 
03:10:35.710 --> 03:10:35.720 align:start position:0%
me if I'm
 
03:10:39.110 --> 03:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
wrong I'm not I'm not questioning the
 
03:10:42.150 --> 03:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
program I just want to understand why
 
03:10:50.429 --> 03:10:50.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:52.550 --> 03:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
I I would have to look into it I suspect
 
03:10:55.950 --> 03:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
there is a specific class line that may
 
03:10:58.030 --> 03:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
not be eligible for federal or other
 
03:11:00.750 --> 03:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
funds all right it's not it's not urgent
 
03:11:04.269 --> 03:11:04.279 align:start position:0%
it just jumped out as a curiosity sure
 
03:11:07.870 --> 03:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm I'm 99% certain it's it's
 
03:11:09.349 --> 03:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
because the positions are allocated but
 
03:11:11.269 --> 03:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
we can verify that for you all right
 
03:11:13.429 --> 03:11:13.439 align:start position:0%
representative priest thank you Mr
 
03:11:15.469 --> 03:11:15.479 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
03:11:20.910 --> 03:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
question um back on on uh page uh 40 on
 
03:11:23.229 --> 03:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
03:11:25.309 --> 03:11:25.319 align:start position:0%
5177 and
 
03:11:31.349 --> 03:11:31.359 align:start position:0%
5178 M have there been any studies done
 
03:11:34.990 --> 03:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
as to what would happen if these two
 
03:11:36.990 --> 03:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
accounting these two programs or
 
03:11:40.790 --> 03:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
accounting units went away how many
 
03:11:42.750 --> 03:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
children would be
 
03:11:46.590 --> 03:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
affected and I can tell so I we haven't
 
03:11:48.429 --> 03:11:48.439 align:start position:0%
had a particular study there but I would
 
03:11:50.070 --> 03:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
suggest that almost every child in New
 
03:11:52.429 --> 03:11:52.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would be affected so this is
 
03:11:54.510 --> 03:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
the way that we ensure that vaccines are
 
03:11:57.750 --> 03:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
available again those common routine
 
03:12:00.229 --> 03:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccinations measles mums
 
03:12:03.349 --> 03:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
rebella verella common routine that
 
03:12:05.790 --> 03:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
children are required to have for entry
 
03:12:08.269 --> 03:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
into school and to child care there are
 
03:12:09.870 --> 03:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
exceptions to that there's religious
 
03:12:11.630 --> 03:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
exemptions to that there are exemptions
 
03:12:13.630 --> 03:12:13.640 align:start position:0%
for health you know a child that cannot
 
03:12:15.190 --> 03:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
take a particular vaccine because their
 
03:12:18.150 --> 03:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
own medical need but every child would
 
03:12:20.950 --> 03:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
be impacted by that um and what's the
 
03:12:23.510 --> 03:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
fertility rate on that I each of those
 
03:12:25.510 --> 03:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
each of those um conditions have their
 
03:12:30.750 --> 03:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:34.550 --> 03:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
you great super so I think that we um as
 
03:12:36.790 --> 03:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
we go through the the next slides s
 
03:12:39.670 --> 03:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
slides 42 and 43 just provide a little
 
03:12:42.790 --> 03:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
bit more color again 42 talks a little
 
03:12:44.550 --> 03:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
bit about the measles outbreak that I
 
03:12:47.229 --> 03:12:47.239 align:start position:0%
was just referencing in um the upper
 
03:12:49.469 --> 03:12:49.479 align:start position:0%
Valley Legionnaire's Disease again
 
03:12:50.870 --> 03:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
something you might hear on the news you
 
03:12:52.910 --> 03:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
might recall there was a particular case
 
03:12:55.670 --> 03:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
last summer um L um linked to an
 
03:12:57.630 --> 03:12:57.640 align:start position:0%
outbreak associated with a contaminated
 
03:13:00.389 --> 03:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
cooling tower on the top of a hotel
 
03:13:02.429 --> 03:13:02.439 align:start position:0%
again this is where the epies and the
 
03:13:05.110 --> 03:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
data the disease investigators get their
 
03:13:08.229 --> 03:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
you know um really do their hard work is
 
03:13:09.349 --> 03:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
understanding we've got a bunch of
 
03:13:10.870 --> 03:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
people who are all showing up with L
 
03:13:13.269 --> 03:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
janela how what was the common exposure
 
03:13:15.229 --> 03:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
and we were able to link it to a cooling
 
03:13:17.950 --> 03:13:17.960 align:start position:0%
tower um in the North country and then
 
03:13:20.429 --> 03:13:20.439 align:start position:0%
ultimately we had another very large
 
03:13:23.550 --> 03:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
tuberculosis um exposure where an
 
03:13:26.150 --> 03:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
individual exposed a large number of
 
03:13:28.950 --> 03:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
children to their tuberculosis luckily
 
03:13:31.030 --> 03:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
we were able to M mitigate any of the
 
03:13:32.550 --> 03:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
impacts to
 
03:13:35.229 --> 03:13:35.239 align:start position:0%
that um slide 43 has a little bit more
 
03:13:37.309 --> 03:13:37.319 align:start position:0%
information if you need it around uh the
 
03:13:39.710 --> 03:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire vaccine Association and
 
03:13:41.750 --> 03:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
then slide 43 gets to the question
 
03:13:44.349 --> 03:13:44.359 align:start position:0%
around arboviral disease um Triple E the
 
03:13:47.070 --> 03:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
mosquito born illness we saw some incre
 
03:13:50.910 --> 03:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
ined arboviral activity in 2024 we had
 
03:13:52.990 --> 03:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
five human cases of Triple E which was a
 
03:13:55.070 --> 03:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
large number and the first human case
 
03:13:57.750 --> 03:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
since 2014 you may recall there were
 
03:14:00.429 --> 03:14:00.439 align:start position:0%
some um AR the Triple E was around in
 
03:14:02.469 --> 03:14:02.479 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire um you know you
 
03:14:03.870 --> 03:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
can play M that's one of those you can
 
03:14:05.229 --> 03:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
blame Massachusetts for it because
 
03:14:06.950 --> 03:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts also had an increase so
 
03:14:08.590 --> 03:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
maybe with the mosquitoes were coming
 
03:14:11.630 --> 03:14:11.640 align:start position:0%
over the Border um you I really I'm
 
03:14:12.790 --> 03:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
going to point out because I really
 
03:14:13.910 --> 03:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate if you get out your
 
03:14:15.630 --> 03:14:15.640 align:start position:0%
magnifying glass there are very cute
 
03:14:17.750 --> 03:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
little icons on here on the bottom
 
03:14:20.309 --> 03:14:20.319 align:start position:0%
referring to cases in white tail deer
 
03:14:21.910 --> 03:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
and horses that's what those little
 
03:14:23.790 --> 03:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
animals are are pictured of and this is
 
03:14:25.750 --> 03:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
a great example of where human health
 
03:14:28.389 --> 03:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
and Animal Health really cross over um
 
03:14:30.510 --> 03:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day so this was for
 
03:14:33.710 --> 03:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
Triple E um we ensure human health but
 
03:14:36.229 --> 03:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
of course we have to work closely um
 
03:14:37.790 --> 03:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
around Animal Health to make sure that
 
03:14:41.790 --> 03:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
humans are healthy so great we're doing
 
03:14:44.870 --> 03:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
great for time moving on to the lab I
 
03:14:46.349 --> 03:14:46.359 align:start position:0%
think representative Daniels has a
 
03:14:49.190 --> 03:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
question yes before we leave the vaccine
 
03:14:50.830 --> 03:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
uh I sense
 
03:14:54.389 --> 03:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
that the whole episode with Co yes has
 
03:14:56.349 --> 03:14:56.359 align:start position:0%
caused a lot of people to back away from
 
03:14:58.750 --> 03:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines what is the division doing to
 
03:15:02.030 --> 03:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
try to reinstall the confidence the V
 
03:15:05.070 --> 03:15:05.080 align:start position:0%
the vaccines are are good man you know
 
03:15:07.150 --> 03:15:07.160 align:start position:0%
that is a a wonderful question and
 
03:15:08.309 --> 03:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
something that we have been thinking
 
03:15:09.469 --> 03:15:09.479 align:start position:0%
about a lot and I think it's
 
03:15:12.190 --> 03:15:12.200 align:start position:0%
fundamentally about trust um I think we
 
03:15:14.870 --> 03:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
were bombarded with lots of information
 
03:15:17.070 --> 03:15:17.080 align:start position:0%
during covid and people rightfully had
 
03:15:19.910 --> 03:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
questions um and so I think what we can
 
03:15:21.950 --> 03:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
do every time we show up here in the
 
03:15:23.950 --> 03:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
legislature every time that we work
 
03:15:26.150 --> 03:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
closely with Hospital providers and
 
03:15:28.110 --> 03:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
medical providers we want to make sure
 
03:15:30.229 --> 03:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
that families and individuals know that
 
03:15:32.070 --> 03:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
they should be talking to their doctors
 
03:15:34.070 --> 03:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
and their medical providers have really
 
03:15:35.670 --> 03:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
good information about what's right for
 
03:15:39.229 --> 03:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
them for vaccines that we can't um it's
 
03:15:41.030 --> 03:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's not always instructive to Simply
 
03:15:43.830 --> 03:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
say all vaccines are bad each of us have
 
03:15:46.150 --> 03:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
different needs Childhood school
 
03:15:47.870 --> 03:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines have been around a very long
 
03:15:50.070 --> 03:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
time and they come from the age of where
 
03:15:52.309 --> 03:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
we know what the impact of polio was we
 
03:15:54.710 --> 03:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
knew what the impact of measles were and
 
03:15:56.830 --> 03:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
those are diseases that are highly
 
03:15:58.910 --> 03:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
contagious and have devastating
 
03:16:01.269 --> 03:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
consequences within congregate settings
 
03:16:03.030 --> 03:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
you have to remember kids come and spend
 
03:16:05.590 --> 03:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of time at child care or in school
 
03:16:07.950 --> 03:16:07.960 align:start position:0%
and they're like grimy we all you know
 
03:16:09.349 --> 03:16:09.359 align:start position:0%
if you had a child they're grimy they
 
03:16:10.870 --> 03:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
put their little hands they cough they
 
03:16:13.150 --> 03:16:13.160 align:start position:0%
don't cover themselves it's a a place
 
03:16:15.630 --> 03:16:15.640 align:start position:0%
that's primed for um some of those types
 
03:16:17.469 --> 03:16:17.479 align:start position:0%
of infections to occur so I think coming
 
03:16:19.870 --> 03:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
back and talking about why we've had
 
03:16:21.630 --> 03:16:21.640 align:start position:0%
those vaccines for a long time and
 
03:16:23.590 --> 03:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
ensuring that we are as transparent as
 
03:16:26.510 --> 03:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
possible uh with um the efficacy and the
 
03:16:30.389 --> 03:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
safety of those vaccines thank you so we
 
03:16:32.349 --> 03:16:32.359 align:start position:0%
we had a discussion I think about a year
 
03:16:36.269 --> 03:16:36.279 align:start position:0%
ago or so about um going on the DHHS
 
03:16:38.990 --> 03:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
website and if you're a parent and
 
03:16:41.150 --> 03:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
you're looking for advice on whether not
 
03:16:45.910 --> 03:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
your child should have covid um uh that
 
03:16:48.110 --> 03:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
website I think still clicks through to
 
03:16:51.070 --> 03:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
the CDC without being apparent that
 
03:16:53.870 --> 03:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
you've moved to the CDC and the CDC is
 
03:16:57.309 --> 03:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
taking the position of pushing covid
 
03:16:59.150 --> 03:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
where I think the New Hampshire position
 
03:17:01.910 --> 03:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
as you've articulated before is if
 
03:17:04.070 --> 03:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
you're curious about covid you should go
 
03:17:06.429 --> 03:17:06.439 align:start position:0%
talk to your primary care
 
03:17:09.269 --> 03:17:09.279 align:start position:0%
provider but we don't say that on the
 
03:17:12.750 --> 03:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
website it it it clicks through to the
 
03:17:16.630 --> 03:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
CDC uh Hawking their Co so I think what
 
03:17:18.510 --> 03:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
we we have tried to fix many of those
 
03:17:21.389 --> 03:17:21.399 align:start position:0%
links the the language we use on our
 
03:17:23.150 --> 03:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
website as you know which is the talk to
 
03:17:25.550 --> 03:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
your doctor for more information I can't
 
03:17:27.510 --> 03:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
I didn't see that though I I I went in
 
03:17:29.429 --> 03:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
there naively just thinking okay I'm a
 
03:17:31.510 --> 03:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
new guy so I'll find I I'll find you
 
03:17:34.189 --> 03:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
that link we did find one you you shared
 
03:17:36.110 --> 03:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
with us one link it wasn't even Actually
 
03:17:37.229 --> 03:17:37.239 align:start position:0%
I don't even think it was on the
 
03:17:39.309 --> 03:17:39.319 align:start position:0%
immunization side but it went to an
 
03:17:42.110 --> 03:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
agency that wasn't even CDC it was um
 
03:17:45.510 --> 03:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
our uh the agency around preparedness
 
03:17:47.189 --> 03:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
which had some stronger language around
 
03:17:49.070 --> 03:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
covid vaccines we've taken that link off
 
03:17:51.150 --> 03:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
the website okay and I wouldn't have
 
03:17:52.630 --> 03:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned it except for the
 
03:17:54.630 --> 03:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
representative Daniel's questions about
 
03:17:56.870 --> 03:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
how do we build trust you know and one
 
03:17:58.990 --> 03:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
of the ways we build trust is we admit
 
03:18:00.710 --> 03:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
mistakes and there were some mistakes
 
03:18:03.870 --> 03:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
that I think everyone from the CDC to to
 
03:18:07.990 --> 03:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire could could uh make I
 
03:18:09.870 --> 03:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
think I think what you will find from
 
03:18:11.550 --> 03:18:11.560 align:start position:0%
this department is that we are very open
 
03:18:14.670 --> 03:18:14.680 align:start position:0%
to having open conversations yeah all
 
03:18:17.429 --> 03:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
right uh representative uh
 
03:18:19.950 --> 03:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
no yeah thank you chairman and this is
 
03:18:21.750 --> 03:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
just to build on that comment of how you
 
03:18:24.910 --> 03:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
build trust one of the I think uh things
 
03:18:27.670 --> 03:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
in my lifetime when I look at
 
03:18:30.870 --> 03:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines uh that typically you think of
 
03:18:33.950 --> 03:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
a vaccine with a possible exception of
 
03:18:36.189 --> 03:18:36.199 align:start position:0%
in influenza vaccine but the vaccines
 
03:18:36.199 --> 03:18:37.110 align:start position:0%
in influenza vaccine but the vaccines
for

03:18:37.110 --> 03:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:18:40.030 --> 03:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
polio uh measles the the ones that
 
03:18:42.110 --> 03:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
you're Comming saying pretty much
 
03:18:46.110 --> 03:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
conform to the one one and done kind of
 
03:18:47.309 --> 03:18:47.319 align:start position:0%
a message
 
03:18:48.670 --> 03:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
so just so you know you're you're
 
03:18:51.950 --> 03:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
talking about the CDC naming issue it
 
03:18:54.870 --> 03:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
was the CDC that came out and helped
 
03:18:59.110 --> 03:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
brand covid-19 injections as vaccines
 
03:19:00.870 --> 03:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
and i' I've told those folks that that
 
03:19:03.349 --> 03:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
was a mistake there's a big bigger
 
03:19:06.990 --> 03:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
question because there's a change in in
 
03:19:09.030 --> 03:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh the definition around vaccine you're
 
03:19:11.389 --> 03:19:11.399 align:start position:0%
now dealing with the the covid was I
 
03:19:12.790 --> 03:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
guess the Leading Edge of this but
 
03:19:14.590 --> 03:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to see more of it and
 
03:19:17.950 --> 03:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
that's where it's an MR you know Mna
 
03:19:22.070 --> 03:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's um um um affecting yeah I'm just
 
03:19:23.429 --> 03:19:23.439 align:start position:0%
saying I don't I don't think we can
 
03:19:26.110 --> 03:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
resolve that here that's a federal issue
 
03:19:27.670 --> 03:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
the question was how do you build trust
 
03:19:29.150 --> 03:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
and that you know I think somebody's got
 
03:19:31.550 --> 03:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
to tackle the question of traditional
 
03:19:33.630 --> 03:19:33.640 align:start position:0%
definition of vaccines and and maybe a
 
03:19:36.269 --> 03:19:36.279 align:start position:0%
new class of vaccines yeah I that that
 
03:19:37.830 --> 03:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
point is well appreciated I will just
 
03:19:40.990 --> 03:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
note that the reason like flu um and
 
03:19:42.910 --> 03:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
covid changes every year and there's
 
03:19:44.870 --> 03:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
like a recommendation for an annual
 
03:19:46.229 --> 03:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
vaccine around that is because the
 
03:19:48.070 --> 03:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
strain are different every year and so
 
03:19:50.550 --> 03:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
you more effectively focus on the strain
 
03:19:52.590 --> 03:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
that is prevalent and so that gets it
 
03:19:54.670 --> 03:19:54.680 align:start position:0%
gets updated routinely and it's more
 
03:19:57.110 --> 03:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
broadly distributed we haven't had a new
 
03:20:00.630 --> 03:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
strain of measles thank goodness and one
 
03:20:03.790 --> 03:20:03.800 align:start position:0%
final comment if you if you will is that
 
03:20:05.910 --> 03:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
traditionally a lot of the vaccines were
 
03:20:09.349 --> 03:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
egg based you know grown um from chicken
 
03:20:13.550 --> 03:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
eggs or eggs you now have a whole new um
 
03:20:15.790 --> 03:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
methodology of producing vaccines which
 
03:20:18.389 --> 03:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
builds them up molecularly so there's a
 
03:20:20.790 --> 03:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
whole issue around the definitional
 
03:20:24.790 --> 03:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:26.710 --> 03:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
categories thank you did you want to
 
03:20:28.070 --> 03:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
comment on that no all right I think
 
03:20:30.070 --> 03:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
that's it so go ahead thank you so now
 
03:20:31.550 --> 03:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
we are getting to our
 
03:20:33.590 --> 03:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
laboratory that conducts Laboratory
 
03:20:35.469 --> 03:20:35.479 align:start position:0%
Testing for disease prevention control
 
03:20:37.790 --> 03:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
and did we hit the section that has your
 
03:20:41.070 --> 03:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
epidemiology contract in it the
 
03:20:44.269 --> 03:20:44.279 align:start position:0%
ELC did we covered that right that in
 
03:20:46.750 --> 03:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
one of these slides there was I think so
 
03:20:49.510 --> 03:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
so I I think we have a contract with UNH
 
03:20:53.229 --> 03:20:53.239 align:start position:0%
for like $2.4 million p 40 cents and and
 
03:20:56.630 --> 03:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
we and we basically buy time of uh an
 
03:20:58.910 --> 03:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
epidemiology set of subject matter
 
03:21:01.870 --> 03:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
experts is is it also may be connected
 
03:21:04.389 --> 03:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
you know at one point that contract also
 
03:21:06.429 --> 03:21:06.439 align:start position:0%
had other funds in it to do things are
 
03:21:08.150 --> 03:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
like our state health Improvement plan
 
03:21:09.469 --> 03:21:09.479 align:start position:0%
so that that could be part of the
 
03:21:11.030 --> 03:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
confusion there we could take that
 
03:21:14.710 --> 03:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
offline yeah great so ELC are um
 
03:21:17.670 --> 03:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
provides that 100% Federal fund
 
03:21:20.550 --> 03:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
um and it's allowing us to respond both
 
03:21:22.830 --> 03:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
in the laboratory as well as disease
 
03:21:25.070 --> 03:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
investigation to whatever is coming down
 
03:21:28.269 --> 03:21:28.279 align:start position:0%
the pike we used ELC ELC was expanded
 
03:21:30.550 --> 03:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
during covid it contracted at the end of
 
03:21:33.870 --> 03:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
covid this is a real core funding um
 
03:21:35.229 --> 03:21:35.239 align:start position:0%
that we get from
 
03:21:39.550 --> 03:21:39.560 align:start position:0%
CDC um we can go down to 1878 not in
 
03:21:41.590 --> 03:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
your budget book but we have a a small
 
03:21:43.389 --> 03:21:43.399 align:start position:0%
amount of money of other funds that are
 
03:21:45.950 --> 03:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
the water testing fees for laboratory
 
03:21:49.070 --> 03:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
equipment specific for water testing um
 
03:21:51.229 --> 03:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
this is a place where water testing used
 
03:21:52.510 --> 03:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
to sit in the Department of
 
03:21:53.910 --> 03:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services it was
 
03:21:56.189 --> 03:21:56.199 align:start position:0%
transferred over to the division of
 
03:21:57.990 --> 03:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services because uh
 
03:21:59.790 --> 03:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
essentially Public Health Services owns
 
03:22:02.030 --> 03:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
the lab and so it just made didn't make
 
03:22:04.670 --> 03:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
a sense to have a a different agency
 
03:22:07.030 --> 03:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
also having space in there and so we've
 
03:22:09.309 --> 03:22:09.319 align:start position:0%
shared that and worked collaboratively
 
03:22:11.429 --> 03:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
with Dees as as we do on so many
 
03:22:14.750 --> 03:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
programs um this also tests so public
 
03:22:17.429 --> 03:22:17.439 align:start position:0%
water sources private water sour ources
 
03:22:19.590 --> 03:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
um shellfish and volunteer lake and
 
03:22:22.790 --> 03:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
river stuff um we can skip down to the
 
03:22:25.429 --> 03:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
public health laboratory fund again this
 
03:22:27.630 --> 03:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
is our big chunk of change of General
 
03:22:30.630 --> 03:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
funds to support laboratory functions um
 
03:22:33.910 --> 03:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
for emergency resport uh response this
 
03:22:35.469 --> 03:22:35.479 align:start position:0%
supports a lot of the actual
 
03:22:37.830 --> 03:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
laboratorian laboratorians that's a word
 
03:22:39.189 --> 03:22:39.199 align:start position:0%
I can never say but the folks who work
 
03:22:42.070 --> 03:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
in the lab um are radiological support
 
03:22:44.229 --> 03:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
and a lot of equipment this is the place
 
03:22:45.550 --> 03:22:45.560 align:start position:0%
where if you were really digging into
 
03:22:46.830 --> 03:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
the budget you'd see these huge
 
03:22:48.750 --> 03:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
equipment numbers and it's really about
 
03:22:50.670 --> 03:22:50.680 align:start position:0%
the fancy very expensive equipment that
 
03:22:52.950 --> 03:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
we need to run those tests sir
 
03:22:54.910 --> 03:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
representative Daniels has a question
 
03:22:57.269 --> 03:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman on testing of
 
03:22:59.950 --> 03:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
private Wells is there any any situation
 
03:23:01.510 --> 03:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
where the testing is
 
03:23:05.269 --> 03:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
mandatory no not that I know of uh and
 
03:23:08.389 --> 03:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
if someone were to test their well uh
 
03:23:11.229 --> 03:23:11.239 align:start position:0%
and turn it into an independent lab do
 
03:23:15.030 --> 03:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
those results get reported to the state
 
03:23:19.790 --> 03:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
no and if if they use the state lab uh
 
03:23:22.990 --> 03:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
did the results get maintained and are
 
03:23:26.189 --> 03:23:26.199 align:start position:0%
there any bureaucratic nightmare that a
 
03:23:29.349 --> 03:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
an individual must enter into that would
 
03:23:31.510 --> 03:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
would cause them maybe not to want a
 
03:23:34.429 --> 03:23:34.439 align:start position:0%
test there well no not not that I that
 
03:23:37.070 --> 03:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
we have experienced in any way we're our
 
03:23:39.790 --> 03:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
our fees are actually really inexpensive
 
03:23:41.269 --> 03:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
um there's some there's a piece of
 
03:23:42.670 --> 03:23:42.680 align:start position:0%
legislation right now to actually
 
03:23:44.670 --> 03:23:44.680 align:start position:0%
increase our fees for that because in
 
03:23:46.510 --> 03:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
some ways we are much less expensive
 
03:23:48.550 --> 03:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
than those private testing companies and
 
03:23:50.950 --> 03:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
we uh the costs have gone up so we would
 
03:23:52.269 --> 03:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
like to get more in line to what the
 
03:23:56.469 --> 03:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
commercials uh are are charging thank
 
03:24:00.510 --> 03:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
you okay great um so we have some funds
 
03:24:02.870 --> 03:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
in here um some more funds from the
 
03:24:04.429 --> 03:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
03:24:06.229 --> 03:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
this is a theme that you're hearing we
 
03:24:08.269 --> 03:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
work really closely with Dees this is
 
03:24:12.469 --> 03:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
for our P um imple and this does testing
 
03:24:15.110 --> 03:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
for Pas testing in drinking water for
 
03:24:18.269 --> 03:24:18.279 align:start position:0%
homeowners um and for private Wells um
 
03:24:20.389 --> 03:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
and we've used some funds from um Dees
 
03:24:22.710 --> 03:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
in order to to do that to implement that
 
03:24:26.150 --> 03:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
work um we have our food emergency
 
03:24:28.070 --> 03:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
response Network sometimes you'll see
 
03:24:30.670 --> 03:24:30.680 align:start position:0%
that uh as an acronym of fern this is
 
03:24:33.070 --> 03:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
where we c um conduct those food sample
 
03:24:36.670 --> 03:24:36.680 align:start position:0%
testing and we're also there as well as
 
03:24:38.830 --> 03:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
in a defense posture in case there were
 
03:24:41.150 --> 03:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
ever contaminants purposely put into the
 
03:24:43.630 --> 03:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
food system um through some sort of biot
 
03:24:45.510 --> 03:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
terrorism and we look at both
 
03:24:48.990 --> 03:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
microbiology chemistry radiochemistry so
 
03:24:51.630 --> 03:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
you know all of those pieces both for
 
03:24:54.030 --> 03:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
you know um organisms as well as
 
03:24:57.189 --> 03:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
chemical things like lead or or arsenic
 
03:24:59.590 --> 03:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
um we have a biom monetary biom
 
03:25:02.710 --> 03:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
monitoring Grant this grant um is um
 
03:25:06.830 --> 03:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
unfunded right now by the CDC but we are
 
03:25:09.309 --> 03:25:09.319 align:start position:0%
it is unfunded but awarded so this
 
03:25:11.070 --> 03:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes happens with a CDC Grant as
 
03:25:13.389 --> 03:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
they get a smaller amount of money they
 
03:25:14.870 --> 03:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
don't have enough money to give out to
 
03:25:16.750 --> 03:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
everyone so they will unfund fund EST
 
03:25:19.070 --> 03:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
state but they will have awarded it to
 
03:25:21.710 --> 03:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
us so that if money does appear we would
 
03:25:23.189 --> 03:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
be able to take it in and so by
 
03:25:25.349 --> 03:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
budgeting it allows us to continue to do
 
03:25:26.990 --> 03:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
the work of biom monitoring which we
 
03:25:29.870 --> 03:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
have done for five years and those are
 
03:25:35.150 --> 03:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
the major um uh accounting units of our
 
03:25:37.950 --> 03:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
Laboratory um slide 47 you'll just see
 
03:25:39.870 --> 03:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
some numbers I know you all love to look
 
03:25:43.750 --> 03:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
at numbers over 16,000 water samples 25
 
03:25:45.990 --> 03:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
200 samples from private Wells we've
 
03:25:48.910 --> 03:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
tested Ed shellfish um we've tested
 
03:25:50.990 --> 03:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
water samples for lead in the schools
 
03:25:54.070 --> 03:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
our food testing again over 1500 samples
 
03:25:56.990 --> 03:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
for bacteria alone a th over a thousand
 
03:26:00.990 --> 03:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
samples for chemicals um and that uh
 
03:26:02.990 --> 03:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
notice on the bottom is that arsenic um
 
03:26:04.269 --> 03:26:04.279 align:start position:0%
where we found arsenic in the juice
 
03:26:06.510 --> 03:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
boxes earlier on which of course no one
 
03:26:10.750 --> 03:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
wants arsenic in juice boxes so um we
 
03:26:12.229 --> 03:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
can move on unless there's any other
 
03:26:13.790 --> 03:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
questions I'm just I'm just curious
 
03:26:16.910 --> 03:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
about um external benchmarking are is
 
03:26:19.710 --> 03:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
there anything that you're you know of
 
03:26:22.309 --> 03:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
um where the states share with each
 
03:26:25.030 --> 03:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
other the kind of workload they perform
 
03:26:27.030 --> 03:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
and the kind of Manpower that they apply
 
03:26:29.429 --> 03:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
to it to to develop some sort of a
 
03:26:29.439 --> 03:26:30.830 align:start position:0%
to it to to develop some sort of a
workload

03:26:30.830 --> 03:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
workload
 
03:26:33.269 --> 03:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
Benchmark so I know that we work closely
 
03:26:34.910 --> 03:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
with our association which is the
 
03:26:36.030 --> 03:26:36.040 align:start position:0%
association of Public Health
 
03:26:38.950 --> 03:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
Laboratories to understand ntion have
 
03:26:41.229 --> 03:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
some sort of larger vision of what other
 
03:26:43.790 --> 03:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
um Public Health Laboratories experience
 
03:26:45.910 --> 03:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
we go through some quality a lot of
 
03:26:47.710 --> 03:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
quality improvement work we have our
 
03:26:49.590 --> 03:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
Clea which makes sure that we are you
 
03:26:51.429 --> 03:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
know we are outside regulated to make
 
03:26:53.309 --> 03:26:53.319 align:start position:0%
sure that our testing is accurate so
 
03:26:55.030 --> 03:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
some you know we pay for someone like
 
03:26:56.710 --> 03:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
like ja in the hospital but we pay for
 
03:26:58.309 --> 03:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
Clea to come and make sure that our
 
03:27:01.349 --> 03:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
methods are correct and so we get some
 
03:27:04.110 --> 03:27:04.120 align:start position:0%
sense of what um you know the number of
 
03:27:06.750 --> 03:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
people to testing you know we have
 
03:27:09.030 --> 03:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
General ideas I don't know that we have
 
03:27:11.349 --> 03:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
a particular study that's done like a an
 
03:27:12.750 --> 03:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
actual like this is how many people
 
03:27:15.750 --> 03:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
should be on your bench to do X number
 
03:27:18.710 --> 03:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
of why Services you know we certainly
 
03:27:22.070 --> 03:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
lived that through covid as we e you
 
03:27:25.030 --> 03:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
know grew by an extraordinary amount the
 
03:27:27.269 --> 03:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
number of tests that we the covid tests
 
03:27:30.189 --> 03:27:30.199 align:start position:0%
that we um tested over time and we were
 
03:27:32.990 --> 03:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
able to flex up mostly using a a
 
03:27:34.870 --> 03:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
temporary staffing contract and so we
 
03:27:36.750 --> 03:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
were able to flex up and flex down in a
 
03:27:38.790 --> 03:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
much easier way that we didn't add uh
 
03:27:41.950 --> 03:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
positions to the state budget okay
 
03:27:46.269 --> 03:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
um so just to close that idea out I
 
03:27:48.229 --> 03:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
wonder if you've ever looked at what the
 
03:27:50.630 --> 03:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
Army Medical department has for workload
 
03:27:53.429 --> 03:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
metrics and you probably haven't be you
 
03:27:54.910 --> 03:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
know because it's such an obscure
 
03:27:57.510 --> 03:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
thought but um the Army Medical
 
03:28:00.309 --> 03:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
department has workload standards on
 
03:28:03.229 --> 03:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
almost everything you know and I I just
 
03:28:04.189 --> 03:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:28:07.870 --> 03:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
curious um maybe as a side project and
 
03:28:11.229 --> 03:28:11.239 align:start position:0%
some dull month to try to try to see how
 
03:28:13.750 --> 03:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
we compare relative to what say the Army
 
03:28:15.590 --> 03:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
Medical Department would allocate that's
 
03:28:17.389 --> 03:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
a great idea there's never a dull moment
 
03:28:19.670 --> 03:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
but um we can we can yeah there's not
 
03:28:21.389 --> 03:28:21.399 align:start position:0%
going to be any outbreaks or anything
 
03:28:24.349 --> 03:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
this year it's all going to be great uh
 
03:28:26.710 --> 03:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
representative priest that's very
 
03:28:29.469 --> 03:28:29.479 align:start position:0%
comforting to know um it's a point of
 
03:28:35.269 --> 03:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
clarification back on uh 48 on the um
 
03:28:38.670 --> 03:28:38.680 align:start position:0%
various Water Analysis yep laboratory
 
03:28:41.710 --> 03:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
testings do you share this information
 
03:28:45.550 --> 03:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
with a federal organization like CDC and
 
03:28:48.590 --> 03:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
and they compare that to our neighboring
 
03:28:51.510 --> 03:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
states to see if something bigger is
 
03:28:54.309 --> 03:28:54.319 align:start position:0%
happening that we should be alerted of
 
03:28:56.429 --> 03:28:56.439 align:start position:0%
yeah you know um I don't think we
 
03:28:59.110 --> 03:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
specifically send this to CDC um because
 
03:29:01.349 --> 03:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
much of this is funded by just um state
 
03:29:03.269 --> 03:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
general funds but we certainly have
 
03:29:04.910 --> 03:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
awareness and work with our regional
 
03:29:06.910 --> 03:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
Partners all the time in looking at
 
03:29:09.469 --> 03:29:09.479 align:start position:0%
those different um contaminants and this
 
03:29:11.550 --> 03:29:11.560 align:start position:0%
is where we've started to understand
 
03:29:14.269 --> 03:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
something like Pas so you know Pas is a
 
03:29:15.670 --> 03:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
great example that there were some
 
03:29:18.469 --> 03:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
health impacts and environmental impacts
 
03:29:20.670 --> 03:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
at the same time and we were seeing them
 
03:29:22.790 --> 03:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
simultaneously we you know we have't
 
03:29:25.469 --> 03:29:25.479 align:start position:0%
elevated a more than expected number of
 
03:29:28.990 --> 03:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
kidney cancer cases in marac um I can't
 
03:29:31.110 --> 03:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
tie that to past but we know that there
 
03:29:33.070 --> 03:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
is an increased amount of pasas in the
 
03:29:35.790 --> 03:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
marac area you know we can't dot those
 
03:29:37.910 --> 03:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
put a straight line between there but it
 
03:29:39.389 --> 03:29:39.399 align:start position:0%
is interesting to look at those two
 
03:29:40.950 --> 03:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
things and so we certainly work with our
 
03:29:44.710 --> 03:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
national uh Partners at CDC at the um
 
03:29:46.950 --> 03:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
Association for public health labor to
 
03:29:48.510 --> 03:29:48.520 align:start position:0%
have a better understanding that New
 
03:29:50.550 --> 03:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not you know solely
 
03:29:52.870 --> 03:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
focusing on um what's Happening Here
 
03:29:54.309 --> 03:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
Without awareness of what's happening
 
03:29:57.830 --> 03:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
outside the door okay thank you yeah um
 
03:30:00.110 --> 03:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
Nathan pulled up that contract and if
 
03:30:02.070 --> 03:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
you want to uh for the UNH
 
03:30:05.510 --> 03:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist sure representative sewor
 
03:30:07.030 --> 03:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
you want to have oh are you still
 
03:30:09.550 --> 03:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
talking representative priest are you
 
03:30:11.790 --> 03:30:11.800 align:start position:0%
done if you're if you're still got
 
03:30:14.510 --> 03:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
questions okay representative seaworth
 
03:30:17.110 --> 03:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
you had your yes
 
03:30:19.830 --> 03:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
all right I'll jump in ahead of this but
 
03:30:21.950 --> 03:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
mostly a question for you again I want
 
03:30:24.070 --> 03:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
to jump back to that biom monitoring
 
03:30:26.870 --> 03:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
Grant the one we said was awarded but
 
03:30:30.990 --> 03:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
unfunded and I'm kind of thinking of
 
03:30:33.389 --> 03:30:33.399 align:start position:0%
philosophically so if I look at the
 
03:30:35.429 --> 03:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
expense items they all look like things
 
03:30:37.229 --> 03:30:37.239 align:start position:0%
that if the money's there we can fund
 
03:30:40.469 --> 03:30:40.479 align:start position:0%
them if it's not we don't correct
 
03:30:46.150 --> 03:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:48.790 --> 03:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
confident or at least somewhat confident
 
03:30:51.189 --> 03:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
that money might not show up what are
 
03:30:53.630 --> 03:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
the advantages and disadvantages of
 
03:30:56.910 --> 03:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
having it in the budget versus not
 
03:30:58.590 --> 03:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
having it in the budget and having to go
 
03:31:00.910 --> 03:31:00.920 align:start position:0%
to fiscal maybe if unexpected money
 
03:31:05.910 --> 03:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
arrives sure so from a from a technical
 
03:31:08.670 --> 03:31:08.680 align:start position:0%
perspective um this essentially provides
 
03:31:10.590 --> 03:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
us the authority to spend those dollars
 
03:31:14.830 --> 03:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
where were they to arrive if um if you
 
03:31:17.349 --> 03:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
take it out of the budget
 
03:31:21.070 --> 03:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
then what we would have to do is uh
 
03:31:24.469 --> 03:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
prepare a fiscal item and we would send
 
03:31:26.790 --> 03:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
that down typically the deadline for
 
03:31:29.670 --> 03:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal is about a month in advance so
 
03:31:32.710 --> 03:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
there would probably be a um a delay in
 
03:31:35.550 --> 03:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
that and then after fiscal the item also
 
03:31:37.510 --> 03:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
has to go through the executive counsel
 
03:31:39.349 --> 03:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
process so they would have to
 
03:31:40.990 --> 03:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
subsequently approve that so there may
 
03:31:43.790 --> 03:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
be a a week or depending on the timing
 
03:31:46.189 --> 03:31:46.199 align:start position:0%
of things or more delay on top of that
 
03:31:49.710 --> 03:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
so it it would delay our ability to get
 
03:31:52.630 --> 03:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
those funds by four to 6 weeks depending
 
03:31:56.469 --> 03:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
on the specific schedule and then um
 
03:31:58.189 --> 03:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
depending on the nature of what was
 
03:32:01.070 --> 03:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
needed if if procurement was required or
 
03:32:03.189 --> 03:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
or whatever it might be that may just
 
03:32:05.550 --> 03:32:05.560 align:start position:0%
lead to some delays in initiating that
 
03:32:08.790 --> 03:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
procurement until we have um pretty good
 
03:32:11.469 --> 03:32:11.479 align:start position:0%
confidence level that it's going to be
 
03:32:14.750 --> 03:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
approved thank you thank you to much
 
03:32:16.469 --> 03:32:16.479 align:start position:0%
thank thank you Mr chairman
 
03:32:19.309 --> 03:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
quick question on the uh
 
03:32:23.550 --> 03:32:23.560 align:start position:0%
on slide 48 on the 203 water samples
 
03:32:26.110 --> 03:32:26.120 align:start position:0%
tested for lead in schools is that
 
03:32:29.150 --> 03:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
that's not 203 schools that's the the
 
03:32:31.309 --> 03:32:31.319 align:start position:0%
samples at multiple samples at how how
 
03:32:33.550 --> 03:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
many schools did that cover and do you
 
03:32:35.389 --> 03:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
know I I wouldn't know the the number
 
03:32:36.790 --> 03:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
right off the top of my head and I guess
 
03:32:39.349 --> 03:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
the question is if you test a school is
 
03:32:42.229 --> 03:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
that is that a you find not you know you
 
03:32:44.429 --> 03:32:44.439 align:start position:0%
you I'm not sure what the process is you
 
03:32:45.830 --> 03:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
have suspicion that there's lead Co
 
03:32:48.469 --> 03:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
because it's an older school or this is
 
03:32:49.790 --> 03:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
a partnership that we've had with the
 
03:32:51.790 --> 03:32:51.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services and
 
03:32:53.590 --> 03:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
what I was speaking of when we just when
 
03:32:56.469 --> 03:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
we started this afternoon which is um we
 
03:32:59.150 --> 03:32:59.160 align:start position:0%
do some of the testing in partnership
 
03:33:01.790 --> 03:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
with Dees Dees has funds to pay for the
 
03:33:03.990 --> 03:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
fixing of the hardware but we are doing
 
03:33:06.269 --> 03:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
the testing to see is there presence of
 
03:33:08.590 --> 03:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
lead so first you test the water then
 
03:33:10.469 --> 03:33:10.479 align:start position:0%
you find out what the source of it is
 
03:33:12.510 --> 03:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
with um the hardware so I'm just
 
03:33:16.349 --> 03:33:16.359 align:start position:0%
thinking that o over time um uh that
 
03:33:18.750 --> 03:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
this should be a diminishing area of
 
03:33:20.870 --> 03:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
lead Source because you got new schools
 
03:33:23.070 --> 03:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
the old schools are either been tested
 
03:33:25.269 --> 03:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
and remediated or eventually you would
 
03:33:27.510 --> 03:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
hope that disappears in the schools 100%
 
03:33:28.950 --> 03:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
this should this should be a very small
 
03:33:31.750 --> 03:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
number moving forward okay thank
 
03:33:34.550 --> 03:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
you I just wanted to acknowledge that my
 
03:33:37.229 --> 03:33:37.239 align:start position:0%
neighborhood school um had a very large
 
03:33:39.830 --> 03:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
number of water fountains and sinks that
 
03:33:42.750 --> 03:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
tested high for lead um and I received a
 
03:33:44.550 --> 03:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
lot of Outreach from very concerned
 
03:33:47.030 --> 03:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
parents that were very thankful for the
 
03:33:48.429 --> 03:33:48.439 align:start position:0%
program and that that testing was
 
03:33:51.429 --> 03:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
happening and they were shut down and um
 
03:33:53.469 --> 03:33:53.479 align:start position:0%
taken care of so I just want to say it's
 
03:33:56.950 --> 03:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
a very good program and um like you said
 
03:33:59.349 --> 03:33:59.359 align:start position:0%
hopefully we will deal with it and move
 
03:34:02.070 --> 03:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
on and have safer product um in the
 
03:34:07.150 --> 03:34:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:10.269 --> 03:34:10.279 align:start position:0%
you uh relative to the question earlier
 
03:34:12.750 --> 03:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
on the um the the contract with UNH for
 
03:34:15.429 --> 03:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
the epidemiological support so the most
 
03:34:17.429 --> 03:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
recent contract that was approved in May
 
03:34:20.990 --> 03:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
of 2024 it was an extension for 3 years
 
03:34:23.670 --> 03:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
and the um the extension included a
 
03:34:25.830 --> 03:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
price limitation increase of
 
03:34:29.030 --> 03:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
$635,000 total funds so that equates to
 
03:34:33.110 --> 03:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
a little over $200,000 a year um and
 
03:34:33.120 --> 03:34:34.269 align:start position:0%
a little over $200,000 a year um and
about

03:34:34.269 --> 03:34:34.279 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:34:36.830 --> 03:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
46,000 of that each year is General
 
03:34:39.389 --> 03:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
funds so on an annual basis it's a
 
03:34:42.830 --> 03:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
little over $200,000 a year and and and
 
03:34:44.990 --> 03:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes the confusion comes from the
 
03:34:48.150 --> 03:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
fact that when we submit an item for GNC
 
03:34:51.389 --> 03:34:51.399 align:start position:0%
approval we're we're modifying the total
 
03:34:53.030 --> 03:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
price limitation and that total price
 
03:34:55.750 --> 03:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
limitation can be over 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
 
03:34:57.830 --> 03:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
years and the scope isn't necessarily
 
03:35:00.030 --> 03:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
always consistent we do modify that over
 
03:35:02.070 --> 03:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
that period of time so you do commonly
 
03:35:04.429 --> 03:35:04.439 align:start position:0%
see individuals looking at that and not
 
03:35:06.590 --> 03:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
realizing that the most recent action is
 
03:35:08.429 --> 03:35:08.439 align:start position:0%
fairly isolated and different from the
 
03:35:09.750 --> 03:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
total price limitation that you're
 
03:35:11.710 --> 03:35:11.720 align:start position:0%
looking at and with the available amount
 
03:35:13.550 --> 03:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
of funds we've flexed up and down the
 
03:35:15.910 --> 03:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
number of of days and hours that we have
 
03:35:17.750 --> 03:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
of for that epidemiologist so I just
 
03:35:19.429 --> 03:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
want to be on the record of saying that
 
03:35:20.710 --> 03:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you the exact number
 
03:35:22.309 --> 03:35:22.319 align:start position:0%
without digging in there of how many
 
03:35:25.429 --> 03:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
hours or or what FTE equivalency that
 
03:35:27.030 --> 03:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
we're paying for so so if I'm looking
 
03:35:28.910 --> 03:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
for a nugget to keep in my head it
 
03:35:31.510 --> 03:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's about 64,000 in general
 
03:35:35.189 --> 03:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
funds each year U um I apologize I may
 
03:35:38.110 --> 03:35:38.120 align:start position:0%
misspoke about $46,000 of General funds
 
03:35:41.150 --> 03:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
each year okay I may have transposed it
 
03:35:43.550 --> 03:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
when I heard it
 
03:35:47.269 --> 03:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
great thank you um so slide 49 again
 
03:35:48.670 --> 03:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
just a highlight of some of the other
 
03:35:50.750 --> 03:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
testing that we do Wastewater testing
 
03:35:53.070 --> 03:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
for Respiratory viruses that we talked a
 
03:35:54.630 --> 03:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
little bit about before really
 
03:35:56.269 --> 03:35:56.279 align:start position:0%
interesting work that we're doing we
 
03:35:59.070 --> 03:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
work with um I think 13 communities
 
03:36:01.790 --> 03:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
around um testing their Wastewater and
 
03:36:03.910 --> 03:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
then we also added in because it's you
 
03:36:05.790 --> 03:36:05.800 align:start position:0%
know back to the fundamental nature of
 
03:36:07.950 --> 03:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
the work that we do is rabies testing
 
03:36:09.510 --> 03:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
this is something that you know doesn't
 
03:36:12.030 --> 03:36:12.040 align:start position:0%
get out on TV very often um and we've
 
03:36:13.910 --> 03:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
been doing for a very long time and we
 
03:36:15.790 --> 03:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
have the responsibility of working
 
03:36:18.510 --> 03:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
closely with fish and game um and as
 
03:36:20.269 --> 03:36:20.279 align:start position:0%
well as the department of safety to
 
03:36:23.150 --> 03:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
address rabies um this is actually
 
03:36:24.630 --> 03:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
probably one of the most sensitive
 
03:36:27.150 --> 03:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
things that we test the risk uh it has
 
03:36:29.349 --> 03:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
incredible risks to human health because
 
03:36:31.870 --> 03:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
once symptoms develop from raises from a
 
03:36:33.550 --> 03:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
person there's nothing you can do about
 
03:36:36.349 --> 03:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
it it will lead to death rabies is bad
 
03:36:39.469 --> 03:36:39.479 align:start position:0%
news that's all I have to say about that
 
03:36:41.510 --> 03:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
um we can go
 
03:36:45.070 --> 03:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
into very quick question if if you will
 
03:36:49.070 --> 03:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
may I yes may I very quick question on
 
03:36:52.510 --> 03:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
the testing for for influenza so you're
 
03:36:56.070 --> 03:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
testing for the you know the influenza
 
03:36:57.990 --> 03:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
is constantly evolving in fact the
 
03:37:00.510 --> 03:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
Pharma companies are making an educated
 
03:37:03.189 --> 03:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
guess on what by the time they do the
 
03:37:05.389 --> 03:37:05.399 align:start position:0%
vaccines what they think the strain is
 
03:37:08.950 --> 03:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
going to be so this test this tests for
 
03:37:12.349 --> 03:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
identifiable strains or I yeah it's part
 
03:37:14.630 --> 03:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
it's part of a a multi-prong effort
 
03:37:17.670 --> 03:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
around influ fluza um that we have we
 
03:37:19.910 --> 03:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
can test for it in the Wastewater often
 
03:37:21.550 --> 03:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
the idea around Wastewater testing is
 
03:37:22.870 --> 03:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit of a canary in the
 
03:37:25.870 --> 03:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
coal mine you can sometimes see disease
 
03:37:27.950 --> 03:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
before it actually presents clinically
 
03:37:29.710 --> 03:37:29.720 align:start position:0%
it'll show up in the Wastewater so it
 
03:37:31.710 --> 03:37:31.720 align:start position:0%
gives you an idea where you might have a
 
03:37:34.790 --> 03:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
hot spot in a in an in the state um or a
 
03:37:36.469 --> 03:37:36.479 align:start position:0%
region of the state for respiratory
 
03:37:38.510 --> 03:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
disease we also do other testing for
 
03:37:41.269 --> 03:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
influenza again for confirmatory testing
 
03:37:43.830 --> 03:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
for hospitals Sentinel um sources so
 
03:37:45.590 --> 03:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
that we have an understanding of where
 
03:37:48.269 --> 03:37:48.279 align:start position:0%
influenza is spreading in the community
 
03:37:51.030 --> 03:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you great and and we know that
 
03:37:53.110 --> 03:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
influenza is Incredible cost driver and
 
03:37:55.070 --> 03:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
real cost to human health especially
 
03:37:58.910 --> 03:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
among older adults um and um the you
 
03:38:00.309 --> 03:38:00.319 align:start position:0%
know we have seen and we've been working
 
03:38:02.229 --> 03:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
with the hospital Association this year
 
03:38:04.229 --> 03:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
they have not shuttered the doors but
 
03:38:06.110 --> 03:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
they've they have been very full this
 
03:38:08.630 --> 03:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
year with all respiratory diseases from
 
03:38:11.030 --> 03:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
covid to RSV to influence it has been a
 
03:38:12.990 --> 03:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
bad year in New
 
03:38:16.189 --> 03:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all right um slide 50 we begin
 
03:38:18.389 --> 03:38:18.399 align:start position:0%
to dig into our emergency preparedness
 
03:38:21.269 --> 03:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
response and recovery program um again
 
03:38:23.750 --> 03:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
you'll recall that this was a a program
 
03:38:25.710 --> 03:38:25.720 align:start position:0%
that used to be housed within our office
 
03:38:28.469 --> 03:38:28.479 align:start position:0%
of commissioner um back during pre
 
03:38:30.150 --> 03:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic and in the beginning days of
 
03:38:32.630 --> 03:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
the pandemic during the pandemic we
 
03:38:34.510 --> 03:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
moved it within the division of Public
 
03:38:36.469 --> 03:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
Health Services simply because of the
 
03:38:38.269 --> 03:38:38.279 align:start position:0%
degree to which that we were working
 
03:38:40.750 --> 03:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
hand inand every single day um it was
 
03:38:42.510 --> 03:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
also a bit of a span of control it made
 
03:38:44.710 --> 03:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
more sense given the funding sources for
 
03:38:46.510 --> 03:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
that to sit with within the division of
 
03:38:49.550 --> 03:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services and so this um
 
03:38:52.150 --> 03:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
our uh Bureau of emergency preparedness
 
03:38:54.510 --> 03:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
and response really crosses lots of
 
03:38:56.710 --> 03:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
areas it works closely with the
 
03:38:59.150 --> 03:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety Homeland Security
 
03:39:01.670 --> 03:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
it mans some of the ESF functions the
 
03:39:03.349 --> 03:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
emergency service functions around
 
03:39:06.309 --> 03:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
medical and housing for the entire State
 
03:39:08.910 --> 03:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
um in addition to helping us within
 
03:39:11.309 --> 03:39:11.319 align:start position:0%
Public Health in particular to the sort
 
03:39:13.429 --> 03:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
of incidents that we have around
 
03:39:16.189 --> 03:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
tuberculosis measles or other infectious
 
03:39:17.630 --> 03:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
disease events those tend to be the
 
03:39:19.790 --> 03:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
largest number of things but this group
 
03:39:22.309 --> 03:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
also um uses some of its fund or
 
03:39:24.030 --> 03:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
resources and you know based on its
 
03:39:26.670 --> 03:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
General funds can do things like um when
 
03:39:29.070 --> 03:39:29.080 align:start position:0%
the eclipse was happening up north they
 
03:39:31.429 --> 03:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
were sent up north to help with that to
 
03:39:33.229 --> 03:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
make sure that we had adequate first aid
 
03:39:35.309 --> 03:39:35.319 align:start position:0%
for all of the tens of thousands people
 
03:39:37.870 --> 03:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
who came to visit up North so if we go
 
03:39:41.990 --> 03:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
into um slide 50 um or 51 uh this is
 
03:39:44.030 --> 03:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
where my slides are out of order so I
 
03:39:46.990 --> 03:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
apologize um we have some federal funds
 
03:39:50.070 --> 03:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
here for um a little bit of funds uh and
 
03:39:52.429 --> 03:39:52.439 align:start position:0%
more General funds to help prepare and
 
03:39:55.950 --> 03:39:55.960 align:start position:0%
respond to radiological incidents um we
 
03:39:58.389 --> 03:39:58.399 align:start position:0%
then dive into Hospital preparedness we
 
03:40:00.950 --> 03:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
work very closely with the hospitals um
 
03:40:02.429 --> 03:40:02.439 align:start position:0%
there's actually match that the
 
03:40:04.590 --> 03:40:04.600 align:start position:0%
hospitals requ that is required to the
 
03:40:06.189 --> 03:40:06.199 align:start position:0%
federal funds that comes from the
 
03:40:08.030 --> 03:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
hospitals and the amount of money that
 
03:40:10.150 --> 03:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
they invest in this work and this is
 
03:40:11.910 --> 03:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
really helping them be able to be
 
03:40:14.830 --> 03:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
prepared to handle any um emergency
 
03:40:16.550 --> 03:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
within the the hospital or Health Care
 
03:40:20.070 --> 03:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
setting we have um another large funding
 
03:40:21.710 --> 03:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
area this the most significant amount of
 
03:40:24.070 --> 03:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
funds is in something we call fet public
 
03:40:26.070 --> 03:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
health emergency preparedness I have a
 
03:40:28.750 --> 03:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
question there yes on the emergency
 
03:40:31.990 --> 03:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
preparedness I it looks like it's 9%
 
03:40:34.790 --> 03:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
General funds it's uh the the you you
 
03:40:38.950 --> 03:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
all requested a increase from 536 to 736
 
03:40:40.910 --> 03:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
in general funds and the governor
 
03:40:43.870 --> 03:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
knocked it back to your your 536 and
 
03:40:46.510 --> 03:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
might I'm looking at the uh the budget
 
03:40:48.229 --> 03:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
briefing book page
 
03:40:51.710 --> 03:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
50 okay and I I think that's associated
 
03:40:55.510 --> 03:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
with uh the pH emergency
 
03:40:55.520 --> 03:41:02.550 align:start position:0%
with uh the pH emergency
preparedness

03:41:02.550 --> 03:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:05.630 --> 03:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
114 is this is this a is this a required
 
03:41:09.630 --> 03:41:09.640 align:start position:0%
match the 9% what how did how did we
 
03:41:11.950 --> 03:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
come up with that number 9 sure so
 
03:41:14.950 --> 03:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a 10% match and
 
03:41:17.269 --> 03:41:17.279 align:start position:0%
there's spend one unfunded position in
 
03:41:19.189 --> 03:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
this area which I believe accounts for
 
03:41:20.590 --> 03:41:20.600 align:start position:0%
the difference between the agency and
 
03:41:23.750 --> 03:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget um and and that
 
03:41:25.349 --> 03:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
that that's that's where that reduction
 
03:41:27.189 --> 03:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
is coming from
 
03:41:31.950 --> 03:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
um Bia Bia uh or bayum to bayum um we
 
03:41:33.950 --> 03:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
also move to positions elsewhere within
 
03:41:36.189 --> 03:41:36.199 align:start position:0%
Public Health as well
 
03:41:41.110 --> 03:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so um so this is this may be
 
03:41:44.030 --> 03:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
the one narrow example of how we open
 
03:41:46.030 --> 03:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
today's session
 
03:41:49.790 --> 03:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
uh about how um pre
 
03:41:53.030 --> 03:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh we had a different sizing
 
03:41:56.630 --> 03:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
and spending level than we do now and we
 
03:42:00.750 --> 03:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
went from in 24 to 349 up to
 
03:42:03.630 --> 03:42:03.640 align:start position:0%
536 and I'm I'm just curious about the
 
03:42:07.389 --> 03:42:07.399 align:start position:0%
incremental justification for that that
 
03:42:10.750 --> 03:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
level of growth so so the the state
 
03:42:13.110 --> 03:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 you were referring to the
 
03:42:15.870 --> 03:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
actual general fund spending that year
 
03:42:18.149 --> 03:42:18.159 align:start position:0%
right I'm looking at at just slide 50
 
03:42:20.510 --> 03:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not looking at the the hb1 I'm
 
03:42:22.389 --> 03:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
looking just at what your briefing book
 
03:42:27.630 --> 03:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
says so it's the actual in 24 was 349
 
03:42:31.149 --> 03:42:31.159 align:start position:0%
according to this document and it jumped
 
03:42:34.790 --> 03:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
in 25 to 536 and that's where the
 
03:42:38.510 --> 03:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
governor is maintaining it in 26 and 27
 
03:42:40.830 --> 03:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
but I'm just curious about the change
 
03:42:45.229 --> 03:42:45.239 align:start position:0%
from 24 to 25 sure so it it may be a
 
03:42:48.309 --> 03:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
little bit more complicated of a story
 
03:42:51.670 --> 03:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
because the use I'm just looking at this
 
03:42:53.790 --> 03:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
so if I look at what was budgeted in
 
03:42:56.469 --> 03:42:56.479 align:start position:0%
this accounting unit in accounting unit
 
03:43:00.309 --> 03:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
let me see here 114 so there was
 
03:43:02.710 --> 03:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
554 million or
 
03:43:05.950 --> 03:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
$554,000 budgeted within this accounting
 
03:43:08.630 --> 03:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
unit in state fiscal year 24 and so the
 
03:43:10.830 --> 03:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
actual spend was lower than that I
 
03:43:13.070 --> 03:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
suspect there's a couple of
 
03:43:16.070 --> 03:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
contributors um contracts line was not
 
03:43:18.790 --> 03:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
fully spent there were vacancies that
 
03:43:21.110 --> 03:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
led to that and so I I don't know if
 
03:43:22.790 --> 03:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of key positions and
 
03:43:25.710 --> 03:43:25.720 align:start position:0%
retirements that occurred that year um
 
03:43:27.149 --> 03:43:27.159 align:start position:0%
it that would have
 
03:43:30.790 --> 03:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
been oh we've got a we yep we've got
 
03:43:37.349 --> 03:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:39.950 --> 03:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
may well welcome just state your name
 
03:43:42.469 --> 03:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
for the record and and get the mic
 
03:43:45.269 --> 03:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
really close closer can you hear me now
 
03:43:47.510 --> 03:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I'm shelle Swanson the finance
 
03:43:50.670 --> 03:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
director for public health um in fep our
 
03:43:52.670 --> 03:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
general funds are only in our contracts
 
03:43:56.389 --> 03:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
line and that is our match for the grant
 
03:43:58.590 --> 03:43:58.600 align:start position:0%
um so what you're seeing the difference
 
03:44:00.510 --> 03:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
is because we didn't spend all of our
 
03:44:04.030 --> 03:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
contract money um so it's 10 most of the
 
03:44:07.710 --> 03:44:07.720 align:start position:0%
contracts are 10% General funds so the
 
03:44:10.630 --> 03:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
the small amount spent is because the
 
03:44:12.990 --> 03:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
contracts weren't all the contract
 
03:44:15.710 --> 03:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation wasn't all spent all right
 
03:44:16.670 --> 03:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't have anything to do with
 
03:44:18.309 --> 03:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
position so that's encouraging some
 
03:44:21.269 --> 03:44:21.279 align:start position:0%
other questions can I but can I go you
 
03:44:24.389 --> 03:44:24.399 align:start position:0%
questioned the changes from our agency
 
03:44:27.429 --> 03:44:27.439 align:start position:0%
to the governor and that was because in
 
03:44:30.309 --> 03:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
our agency we erroneously budgeted
 
03:44:32.389 --> 03:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
General funds in our positions which we
 
03:44:35.630 --> 03:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
don't normally do so we caught that when
 
03:44:38.309 --> 03:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
um we were going through our agency and
 
03:44:39.910 --> 03:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
we asked the governor's office to
 
03:44:41.630 --> 03:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
rectify that so that's what they did for
 
03:44:45.389 --> 03:44:45.399 align:start position:0%
us good catch that yeah so so when you
 
03:44:48.349 --> 03:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
say you underspent contract money in
 
03:44:50.510 --> 03:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
24 what was the
 
03:44:54.950 --> 03:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
impact what what something bad must have
 
03:44:57.389 --> 03:44:57.399 align:start position:0%
happened I don't think anything bad
 
03:45:00.469 --> 03:45:00.479 align:start position:0%
happened um where uh fep is one of our
 
03:45:03.630 --> 03:45:03.640 align:start position:0%
grants where we allowed to um we uh
 
03:45:05.990 --> 03:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
given expanded Authority so if we're not
 
03:45:08.110 --> 03:45:08.120 align:start position:0%
able to get our work done in one year
 
03:45:11.189 --> 03:45:11.199 align:start position:0%
we're um allowed to bring the grant
 
03:45:14.630 --> 03:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
funds forward um and when the contracts
 
03:45:17.030 --> 03:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
are encumbered all that money rules
 
03:45:19.469 --> 03:45:19.479 align:start position:0%
forward so we can do that work in the
 
03:45:21.630 --> 03:45:21.640 align:start position:0%
next year and and I would just add to
 
03:45:23.429 --> 03:45:23.439 align:start position:0%
that this is a place also that it
 
03:45:25.349 --> 03:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
because we have that Dynamic ability to
 
03:45:27.469 --> 03:45:27.479 align:start position:0%
flex between years there are times that
 
03:45:30.790 --> 03:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
we CH change our Direction so it may be
 
03:45:32.550 --> 03:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
that we were not doing something we
 
03:45:34.469 --> 03:45:34.479 align:start position:0%
switched what we were doing and we
 
03:45:37.750 --> 03:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
created a new um uh path forward so you
 
03:45:39.229 --> 03:45:39.239 align:start position:0%
know it's it's pretty Dynamic we can get
 
03:45:40.870 --> 03:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
you the detail of the difference in
 
03:45:42.990 --> 03:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
those contracts but it doesn't
 
03:45:45.950 --> 03:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily reflect coming from in my
 
03:45:49.030 --> 03:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
questions is I'm a former plans officer
 
03:45:51.189 --> 03:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
and I realize that there are times where
 
03:45:54.110 --> 03:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
you have to have a plan and you never
 
03:45:56.550 --> 03:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
execute the plan but you go back and you
 
03:45:59.269 --> 03:45:59.279 align:start position:0%
revisit a plan and you update a plan and
 
03:46:01.349 --> 03:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
it doesn't add a tremendous amount of
 
03:46:06.030 --> 03:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
value and so so I I'm just you know as
 
03:46:07.950 --> 03:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
tight as things are I'm just looking if
 
03:46:09.830 --> 03:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
there's even a few hundred, thousand
 
03:46:12.750 --> 03:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
here yeah I I I appreciate that comment
 
03:46:14.990 --> 03:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
planning is you know you plan for the
 
03:46:16.830 --> 03:46:16.840 align:start position:0%
knowns and then the unknown unknowns as
 
03:46:19.070 --> 03:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
well so that's that is the whole purpose
 
03:46:20.910 --> 03:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
of this group and then to be able to be
 
03:46:23.630 --> 03:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
ready to react in a moment's notice and
 
03:46:26.630 --> 03:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
so the plans are helpful um all the time
 
03:46:28.670 --> 03:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
so that you're ready to
 
03:46:33.950 --> 03:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
go represent the no vacum yes I uh I
 
03:46:35.510 --> 03:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's exactly Hospital
 
03:46:38.590 --> 03:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
preparedness but one of the places that
 
03:46:42.269 --> 03:46:42.279 align:start position:0%
generate a lot of biohazard uh waste are
 
03:46:45.469 --> 03:46:45.479 align:start position:0%
hospitals yes and so my question is
 
03:46:47.750 --> 03:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
who has the responsibility and what does
 
03:46:51.189 --> 03:46:51.199 align:start position:0%
the whole process look like for uh
 
03:46:53.910 --> 03:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
controlling where those wind up and what
 
03:46:56.189 --> 03:46:56.199 align:start position:0%
uh how how the chain of command and
 
03:46:57.670 --> 03:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
everything else because there's some
 
03:46:59.910 --> 03:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
really there's some stuff that probably
 
03:47:02.070 --> 03:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
is not all that hazardous but there's a
 
03:47:04.269 --> 03:47:04.279 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of stuff that is yes so
 
03:47:05.469 --> 03:47:05.479 align:start position:0%
public health does not have the
 
03:47:07.149 --> 03:47:07.159 align:start position:0%
authority to do that we don't do that
 
03:47:09.790 --> 03:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
work in particular of managing their
 
03:47:11.950 --> 03:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
waste product I would imagine that Dees
 
03:47:14.149 --> 03:47:14.159 align:start position:0%
handles some of that um and we can
 
03:47:15.750 --> 03:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
probably find out exactly where that is
 
03:47:18.429 --> 03:47:18.439 align:start position:0%
but that is not in this particular role
 
03:47:20.750 --> 03:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
where we would come into play is again
 
03:47:22.710 --> 03:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
when there might be a terrorism
 
03:47:24.429 --> 03:47:24.439 align:start position:0%
bioterrorism threat or some other
 
03:47:27.110 --> 03:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
chemical we or chemical threat we can
 
03:47:29.389 --> 03:47:29.399 align:start position:0%
test for that in our laboratory and then
 
03:47:32.149 --> 03:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
we have some response to the action so
 
03:47:34.030 --> 03:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
these folks are really the responders
 
03:47:36.670 --> 03:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
and help us manage the incident if and
 
03:47:38.510 --> 03:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
when it ever happens we are thankful
 
03:47:41.070 --> 03:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
when we do not have an incident yeah I'd
 
03:47:42.510 --> 03:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
be interested in that information
 
03:47:43.990 --> 03:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
because you know anybody that's been to
 
03:47:46.710 --> 03:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
a hospital every replace you see
 
03:47:50.910 --> 03:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
biohazard yes uh waste material and um
 
03:47:54.550 --> 03:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
um just wondering how that all is uh is
 
03:47:56.990 --> 03:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
managed thank
 
03:48:00.790 --> 03:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
you all right um another note on this
 
03:48:03.070 --> 03:48:03.080 align:start position:0%
slide on slide 51 the Public Health
 
03:48:06.510 --> 03:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
crisis response um just for you to know
 
03:48:10.030 --> 03:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
this is um budgeted but it is not it is
 
03:48:12.189 --> 03:48:12.199 align:start position:0%
also not funded right now this is a
 
03:48:14.950 --> 03:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
placeholder that uh has been developed
 
03:48:18.070 --> 03:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
um historically within our budget so
 
03:48:20.710 --> 03:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
that when there is an emergency we have
 
03:48:23.189 --> 03:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
a mechanism to accept those money
 
03:48:25.750 --> 03:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
quickly and expend them quickly to the
 
03:48:28.750 --> 03:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
point of um what Nathan described with
 
03:48:31.309 --> 03:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
the other unfunded but awarded this way
 
03:48:32.990 --> 03:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
we can move quickly it's even more
 
03:48:35.630 --> 03:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
important here um where we might
 
03:48:37.950 --> 03:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
anticipate funds for something like bird
 
03:48:40.910 --> 03:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
flu if bird flu were to if we were to
 
03:48:42.309 --> 03:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
find bird flu in this community and
 
03:48:44.149 --> 03:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
there was a risk to human health we
 
03:48:46.389 --> 03:48:46.399 align:start position:0%
would get federal funds we would put
 
03:48:48.710 --> 03:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
them in this um line item and we would
 
03:48:50.550 --> 03:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
be able to expend them immediately both
 
03:48:53.269 --> 03:48:53.279 align:start position:0%
on things like overtime as well as any
 
03:48:55.189 --> 03:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
contracts that we would need to do so it
 
03:48:57.110 --> 03:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
is there's no actual money in here it's
 
03:48:59.110 --> 03:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
simply just
 
03:49:02.349 --> 03:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
budgeted um you can go on to slide 52 we
 
03:49:04.710 --> 03:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
have our radiological emergency response
 
03:49:06.510 --> 03:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
we get some funds from the Department of
 
03:49:08.630 --> 03:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
Safety that they get from that is
 
03:49:11.830 --> 03:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
assessed from Seabrook and um this is
 
03:49:14.750 --> 03:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
allowing us to respond to a radiological
 
03:49:17.550 --> 03:49:17.560 align:start position:0%
event the public Health's response is
 
03:49:19.309 --> 03:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
really about the health impacts of that
 
03:49:21.950 --> 03:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
radiological event if it were to occur
 
03:49:25.269 --> 03:49:25.279 align:start position:0%
um and those are the large those are all
 
03:49:27.590 --> 03:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
of the funding streams in our emergency
 
03:49:29.830 --> 03:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
um preparedness slide 53 you'll just
 
03:49:31.990 --> 03:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
sort of see the the scope of the work
 
03:49:35.229 --> 03:49:35.239 align:start position:0%
again around what we do the fact that we
 
03:49:38.030 --> 03:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
on slide 54 we're you know constantly
 
03:49:40.670 --> 03:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
training people and staff and volunteers
 
03:49:42.750 --> 03:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
that's part of our work you know to your
 
03:49:44.750 --> 03:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
question around what would what would
 
03:49:46.790 --> 03:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
happen if the plan didn't happen well
 
03:49:48.429 --> 03:49:48.439 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we're responsible
 
03:49:50.750 --> 03:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
for is training volunteers so that
 
03:49:53.030 --> 03:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
they're ready to go to administer
 
03:49:55.870 --> 03:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine if it's some sort of vaccine um
 
03:49:58.070 --> 03:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
related event or an event that would
 
03:49:59.910 --> 03:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
need an immediate vaccine we are
 
03:50:01.469 --> 03:50:01.479 align:start position:0%
constantly working with commun
 
03:50:02.910 --> 03:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
Volunteers in the community to be able
 
03:50:04.950 --> 03:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
to respond quickly if there's an
 
03:50:07.070 --> 03:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
emergency one of those emergencies
 
03:50:10.309 --> 03:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
you'll see on slide 55 um just happened
 
03:50:12.229 --> 03:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
and luckily there was no loss of life
 
03:50:14.710 --> 03:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
but you may recall seeing in the news
 
03:50:16.750 --> 03:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
that there was a fire at an assisted
 
03:50:18.670 --> 03:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
living facility in conquered and our
 
03:50:22.309 --> 03:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
team got the call um 9:00 at night 8:00
 
03:50:24.389 --> 03:50:24.399 align:start position:0%
at night to help with the fact that
 
03:50:26.870 --> 03:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
there was the assisted living facility
 
03:50:30.309 --> 03:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
had um to move its residents and so our
 
03:50:32.590 --> 03:50:32.600 align:start position:0%
team worked with the First Responders
 
03:50:35.189 --> 03:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
with Homeland Security to ensure that
 
03:50:37.110 --> 03:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
families were connected to their loved
 
03:50:38.830 --> 03:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
ones who were in that assisted living
 
03:50:40.790 --> 03:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
facility we found that a number of the
 
03:50:42.670 --> 03:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
fam their families were local were able
 
03:50:44.830 --> 03:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
to come meet up with their family member
 
03:50:47.510 --> 03:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
take them home take them to safety um
 
03:50:49.710 --> 03:50:49.720 align:start position:0%
the individuals were moved from Granite
 
03:50:51.910 --> 03:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
Ledges into the conquered Hospital
 
03:50:54.710 --> 03:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
cafeteria and our team was there ready
 
03:50:57.550 --> 03:50:57.560 align:start position:0%
to act ready to support immediately and
 
03:50:59.229 --> 03:50:59.239 align:start position:0%
were there until the we hours of the
 
03:51:01.750 --> 03:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
morning luckily no loss of life everyone
 
03:51:03.910 --> 03:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
was healthy but part of the reason for
 
03:51:06.030 --> 03:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
that is that we had a well-oiled machine
 
03:51:07.630 --> 03:51:07.640 align:start position:0%
of what would do what we would do in a
 
03:51:10.349 --> 03:51:10.359 align:start position:0%
mass casualty
 
03:51:12.670 --> 03:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
event and that's it for emergency
 
03:51:15.590 --> 03:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
preparedness thank you
 
03:51:19.510 --> 03:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
we are at the very last Bureau just
 
03:51:21.590 --> 03:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
forecasting so I appreciate your stamina
 
03:51:24.349 --> 03:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
through here um we are at our Bureau of
 
03:51:27.870 --> 03:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
prevention and wellness beaw um this is
 
03:51:29.469 --> 03:51:29.479 align:start position:0%
this is the place where we have some of
 
03:51:32.110 --> 03:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
our um more chronic diseases and cancer
 
03:51:35.349 --> 03:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
work um it is
 
03:51:37.950 --> 03:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
um interesting to think if we think
 
03:51:39.670 --> 03:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
about the national what's going on at a
 
03:51:41.910 --> 03:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
national level right now we know that
 
03:51:44.030 --> 03:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
the new secretary for Health and Human
 
03:51:46.149 --> 03:51:46.159 align:start position:0%
Services secretary Kennedy is very
 
03:51:48.510 --> 03:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
interested in chronic diseases we will
 
03:51:51.269 --> 03:51:51.279 align:start position:0%
be interested to see what direction um
 
03:51:53.110 --> 03:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
that the feds will go in in this place
 
03:51:55.309 --> 03:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
but he certainly came into his role
 
03:51:56.830 --> 03:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
saying that chronic disease was going to
 
03:51:59.630 --> 03:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
be a prim uh a priority for him so we're
 
03:52:01.389 --> 03:52:01.399 align:start position:0%
we're anxious to see what that will mean
 
03:52:04.710 --> 03:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
for us um we also know in public health
 
03:52:06.710 --> 03:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
that things like infectious disease and
 
03:52:09.870 --> 03:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
chronic disease also are inter uh really
 
03:52:11.870 --> 03:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
play with each other are integrated we
 
03:52:14.229 --> 03:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
know things like even if you have oral
 
03:52:16.110 --> 03:52:16.120 align:start position:0%
health concerns that that can impact
 
03:52:18.590 --> 03:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
your heart or impact premature labor if
 
03:52:19.910 --> 03:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
you're a pregnant woman and you have an
 
03:52:22.469 --> 03:52:22.479 align:start position:0%
infectious disease all of it is so
 
03:52:24.790 --> 03:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
interdependent at the end of the day so
 
03:52:28.070 --> 03:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
our BPA looks at Primary Care Services
 
03:52:29.550 --> 03:52:29.560 align:start position:0%
making sure that we have access to our
 
03:52:31.030 --> 03:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
federally qualified Health Centers we
 
03:52:34.590 --> 03:52:34.600 align:start position:0%
have the the um data around that we have
 
03:52:36.750 --> 03:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
um make sure to support our rural Health
 
03:52:38.630 --> 03:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
Centers and our small hospitals or
 
03:52:40.710 --> 03:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals this works on
 
03:52:42.910 --> 03:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
chronic disease risk factors um
 
03:52:45.229 --> 03:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
addressing the unique needs in our rural
 
03:52:48.070 --> 03:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
community improving access to screening
 
03:52:50.030 --> 03:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
early detention and management that
 
03:52:51.710 --> 03:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
includes our breast and cervical cancer
 
03:52:53.229 --> 03:52:53.239 align:start position:0%
screening program that has been around
 
03:52:55.070 --> 03:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
for a very long time that's very
 
03:52:58.110 --> 03:52:58.120 align:start position:0%
important and ultimately we have um some
 
03:53:00.830 --> 03:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
the uh grant called the opioid data to
 
03:53:03.830 --> 03:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
action so looking at opioid data um
 
03:53:06.510 --> 03:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
overdose and um as well as our
 
03:53:08.269 --> 03:53:08.279 align:start position:0%
prescription drug monitoring program is
 
03:53:11.389 --> 03:53:11.399 align:start position:0%
also nestled within this
 
03:53:14.110 --> 03:53:14.120 align:start position:0%
Bureau we have a just a few more pages
 
03:53:16.910 --> 03:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
left of of budget so three more pages of
 
03:53:18.590 --> 03:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
budget and then then you can call it a
 
03:53:21.229 --> 03:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
day um the first couple of oral Health
 
03:53:23.469 --> 03:53:23.479 align:start position:0%
Grants are pretty small we have some
 
03:53:26.389 --> 03:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
work in tobacco prevention and cessation
 
03:53:29.030 --> 03:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
um and so this fun has both Federal and
 
03:53:30.750 --> 03:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
general funds within it and this
 
03:53:33.389 --> 03:53:33.399 align:start position:0%
provides funds for our Quit Line um it
 
03:53:35.510 --> 03:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
carries out some educational campaigns
 
03:53:38.269 --> 03:53:38.279 align:start position:0%
especially around quitting for older
 
03:53:40.510 --> 03:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
adults we find that most people are in
 
03:53:43.870 --> 03:53:43.880 align:start position:0%
their you know uh Middle Ages and older
 
03:53:45.590 --> 03:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
when they get if they've had a lifetime
 
03:53:47.590 --> 03:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
of smoking usually it's the health
 
03:53:49.510 --> 03:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
conditions that really then make them
 
03:53:51.469 --> 03:53:51.479 align:start position:0%
consider it's time to quit and we
 
03:53:53.590 --> 03:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
provide some resources around Quit Line
 
03:53:55.550 --> 03:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
we also do a lot of primary prevention
 
03:53:57.870 --> 03:53:57.880 align:start position:0%
work with youth and adolescents to
 
03:53:59.830 --> 03:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
prevent them from smoking including
 
03:54:03.309 --> 03:54:03.319 align:start position:0%
vaping along at at the end of the day um
 
03:54:07.469 --> 03:54:07.479 align:start position:0%
so we had about um yes I'm just getting
 
03:54:10.070 --> 03:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
ahead of myself here uh in our
 
03:54:12.510 --> 03:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
Comprehensive Cancer program this is uh
 
03:54:14.750 --> 03:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
another place where we have a small
 
03:54:16.429 --> 03:54:16.439 align:start position:0%
amount of General funds that are a
 
03:54:20.189 --> 03:54:20.199 align:start position:0%
required match um and our comp cancer um
 
03:54:21.950 --> 03:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
includes our breast and cervical cancer
 
03:54:24.710 --> 03:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
program that screen helps with screening
 
03:54:27.429 --> 03:54:27.439 align:start position:0%
and diagnostic costs for mammograms and
 
03:54:29.910 --> 03:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
cervical cancer screening for um
 
03:54:32.070 --> 03:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
individuals who are lowincome between
 
03:54:34.870 --> 03:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
the ages of 22 21 and
 
03:54:38.670 --> 03:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
64 um I'd like to come back to the
 
03:54:42.670 --> 03:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
tobacco prevention great okay that's a
 
03:54:45.429 --> 03:54:45.439 align:start position:0%
3565 breakdown between General funds and
 
03:54:47.910 --> 03:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
federal funds is that a required match
 
03:54:50.269 --> 03:54:50.279 align:start position:0%
is that a no additional funds were added
 
03:54:52.950 --> 03:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
to this over the past several bium to
 
03:54:55.149 --> 03:54:55.159 align:start position:0%
specifically support Outreach to
 
03:54:57.349 --> 03:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
adolescence around vaping and other
 
03:54:57.359 --> 03:54:58.510 align:start position:0%
adolescence around vaping and other
preventative

03:54:58.510 --> 03:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
preventative
 
03:55:01.750 --> 03:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
activities okay so the the 3565
 
03:55:06.910 --> 03:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
breakdown is just coincidental yes okay
 
03:55:11.670 --> 03:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
um now this program may have contributed
 
03:55:14.149 --> 03:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
to some success where at historic lows
 
03:55:17.750 --> 03:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
of of cigarette smoking I
 
03:55:21.950 --> 03:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
believe um and and the um General funds
 
03:55:25.830 --> 03:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
projection on this is set to be
 
03:55:28.590 --> 03:55:28.600 align:start position:0%
607k for quite a
 
03:55:31.870 --> 03:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
while um what what was your thinking
 
03:55:33.830 --> 03:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
here and and maybe maybe you need to
 
03:55:35.710 --> 03:55:35.720 align:start position:0%
bring somebody up but what was your
 
03:55:39.790 --> 03:55:39.800 align:start position:0%
thinking here on uh why this could
 
03:55:43.070 --> 03:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
remain stable during projected
 
03:55:45.510 --> 03:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
inflation um you know what kind of
 
03:55:47.510 --> 03:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
metrics you're using so that we know
 
03:55:49.830 --> 03:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
that this is money well spent I mean it
 
03:55:53.110 --> 03:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
it sounds good but is it effective great
 
03:55:54.429 --> 03:55:54.439 align:start position:0%
thank you I think that's those are
 
03:55:57.269 --> 03:55:57.279 align:start position:0%
always important questions to ask so P
 
03:55:58.349 --> 03:55:58.359 align:start position:0%
you know this is the problem with
 
03:56:00.030 --> 03:56:00.040 align:start position:0%
prevention is you never can stop you
 
03:56:02.149 --> 03:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
know you can we've got youth coming on
 
03:56:03.870 --> 03:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
there are new products all the time that
 
03:56:06.229 --> 03:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
are coming on the on the scene we saw
 
03:56:09.990 --> 03:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
that certainly like pre 2018 2019 we had
 
03:56:12.309 --> 03:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
seen um traditional cigarette use among
 
03:56:13.910 --> 03:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
youth go down which we're all very
 
03:56:15.910 --> 03:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
excited about we''ve you know made some
 
03:56:18.309 --> 03:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
societal shifts around the acceptability
 
03:56:19.990 --> 03:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
of smoking as well as environmental
 
03:56:21.750 --> 03:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
shifts around where you can smoke and
 
03:56:24.429 --> 03:56:24.439 align:start position:0%
where you can't smoke um many of us
 
03:56:26.349 --> 03:56:26.359 align:start position:0%
probably remember having smoking areas
 
03:56:28.710 --> 03:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
in school um and that's certainly we're
 
03:56:30.590 --> 03:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
a long time away from having a smoking
 
03:56:32.750 --> 03:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
area outside the cafeteria or even maybe
 
03:56:34.630 --> 03:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
in the cafeteria if you're a little bit
 
03:56:37.110 --> 03:56:37.120 align:start position:0%
older than I am so that's that's
 
03:56:38.870 --> 03:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
important and that's real savings to
 
03:56:40.550 --> 03:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and to healthcare moving
 
03:56:44.349 --> 03:56:44.359 align:start position:0%
forward we then saw in the 2017 2018 all
 
03:56:46.149 --> 03:56:46.159 align:start position:0%
of a sudden this influx of Vape on the
 
03:56:48.990 --> 03:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
market um and we all of a sudden saw
 
03:56:51.269 --> 03:56:51.279 align:start position:0%
those rates rise way up and that became
 
03:56:53.750 --> 03:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
socially acceptable among kids and so
 
03:56:55.710 --> 03:56:55.720 align:start position:0%
since then and if you look at the data
 
03:56:59.630 --> 03:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
on I think it is on slide 62 you know we
 
03:57:02.429 --> 03:57:02.439 align:start position:0%
saw it Spike up in 2019 the the amount
 
03:57:04.990 --> 03:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
of Youth um use of Vape products and
 
03:57:07.550 --> 03:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
then it starts to come down in 21 and
 
03:57:09.990 --> 03:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
then sort of levels to 23 and so that
 
03:57:11.429 --> 03:57:11.439 align:start position:0%
suggests to me that we still have some
 
03:57:13.550 --> 03:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
work to do as we look at uh and this
 
03:57:14.790 --> 03:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
data comes from that youth RIS
 
03:57:16.469 --> 03:57:16.479 align:start position:0%
behavioral survey this is the only way
 
03:57:17.990 --> 03:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
that we really can have a good sense of
 
03:57:20.189 --> 03:57:20.199 align:start position:0%
how many kids are using these products
 
03:57:22.870 --> 03:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at this data to say um
 
03:57:25.110 --> 03:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
in multifactoral ways like where in the
 
03:57:26.990 --> 03:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
community as you look at the map here
 
03:57:29.070 --> 03:57:29.080 align:start position:0%
are there places where this is more
 
03:57:31.149 --> 03:57:31.159 align:start position:0%
prevalent where should we put be putting
 
03:57:32.990 --> 03:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
in those prevention activities so we're
 
03:57:34.830 --> 03:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
maintaining that level so that we can be
 
03:57:37.950 --> 03:57:37.960 align:start position:0%
dynamic and continue to make that push
 
03:57:40.510 --> 03:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
to try and reduce those those numbers
 
03:57:42.349 --> 03:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
one of the things we know about vaping
 
03:57:46.429 --> 03:57:46.439 align:start position:0%
as well is that it it has um often
 
03:57:48.349 --> 03:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
translated into using combustible
 
03:57:50.189 --> 03:57:50.199 align:start position:0%
cigarettes or regular traditional C
 
03:57:51.710 --> 03:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
cigarettes which we know are even more
 
03:57:54.110 --> 03:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
harmful the jury is still out on the
 
03:57:56.269 --> 03:57:56.279 align:start position:0%
complete harm around vaping it's not
 
03:57:57.710 --> 03:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
good I don't think anybody will tell you
 
03:58:00.229 --> 03:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
it's good for you um we're going to have
 
03:58:02.750 --> 03:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
to understand over decades to know what
 
03:58:04.229 --> 03:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
the long-term effects
 
03:58:08.590 --> 03:58:08.600 align:start position:0%
are and then another on this this
 
03:58:11.750 --> 03:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
67,000 how how much of that uh ends up
 
03:58:15.670 --> 03:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
going into contracts to uh vendors that
 
03:58:17.910 --> 03:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
do things for us probably a good bit of
 
03:58:20.149 --> 03:58:20.159 align:start position:0%
it goes into and and I could ask someone
 
03:58:21.830 --> 03:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
to look at the actual budget in front of
 
03:58:24.510 --> 03:58:24.520 align:start position:0%
me but many we we use vendors so we have
 
03:58:27.469 --> 03:58:27.479 align:start position:0%
a vendor um called uh National Jewish
 
03:58:30.110 --> 03:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
Healthcare it's based out of uh Colorado
 
03:58:32.030 --> 03:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
that helps run our Quit Line we don't
 
03:58:33.750 --> 03:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
have the capacity to run a quit line
 
03:58:35.990 --> 03:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and they do a Quit
 
03:58:38.189 --> 03:58:38.199 align:start position:0%
Line both that's traditional for adults
 
03:58:40.349 --> 03:58:40.359 align:start position:0%
sort of aimed again at that older adult
 
03:58:42.910 --> 03:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
market and they also do text based work
 
03:58:44.790 --> 03:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
for teens because we know that text no
 
03:58:46.710 --> 03:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
teen is going to call I mean again if
 
03:58:48.070 --> 03:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
any of you know a teen they don't
 
03:58:50.550 --> 03:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
actually talk on phones um but we have a
 
03:58:53.710 --> 03:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
text based um support program for that I
 
03:58:54.910 --> 03:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
don't know were you going to say
 
03:58:59.349 --> 03:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
something uh so 100% of the of the
 
03:59:02.349 --> 03:59:02.359 align:start position:0%
general or the contracts 100% of of that
 
03:59:04.309 --> 03:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
is is generally fund or the general
 
03:59:06.830 --> 03:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
funds are in there at 100% I think from
 
03:59:08.550 --> 03:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
a historical perspective if you look at
 
03:59:13.070 --> 03:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
the current Bia when we prepared our um
 
03:59:16.550 --> 03:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
our agency budget request we prepared at
 
03:59:18.790 --> 03:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
the same level the general funds were
 
03:59:20.429 --> 03:59:20.439 align:start position:0%
essentially kept at the same level as
 
03:59:23.189 --> 03:59:23.199 align:start position:0%
they are currently for the 26 27 budget
 
03:59:25.990 --> 03:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
okay could so could I get like the top
 
03:59:28.550 --> 03:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
three most expensive four most expensive
 
03:59:30.750 --> 03:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
contracts in this area not not the
 
03:59:35.510 --> 03:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
contracts but a very short summary of of
 
03:59:37.870 --> 03:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
what we're spending uh I don't need to
 
03:59:39.670 --> 03:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
know who we're spending it with I don't
 
03:59:41.269 --> 03:59:41.279 align:start position:0%
need the vendor name but I want to know
 
03:59:43.590 --> 03:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
the purpose we are likely spending it
 
03:59:45.790 --> 03:59:45.800 align:start position:0%
for the Quit Line and then to do some of
 
03:59:48.590 --> 03:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
the prevention activities for youth um
 
03:59:50.469 --> 03:59:50.479 align:start position:0%
we can get that for you but off the top
 
03:59:51.550 --> 03:59:51.560 align:start position:0%
of my head that's where we're spending
 
03:59:54.309 --> 03:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
majority of those funds okay because I I
 
03:59:56.149 --> 03:59:56.159 align:start position:0%
really I really do want to take a deep
 
03:59:58.790 --> 03:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
dive on this line we can get that for
 
04:00:00.389 --> 04:00:00.399 align:start position:0%
you representative Mooney did you have a
 
04:00:02.229 --> 04:00:02.239 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:00:05.229 --> 04:00:05.239 align:start position:0%
I am uh very curious about this line in
 
04:00:08.070 --> 04:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
one regard I certainly understand the
 
04:00:11.189 --> 04:00:11.199 align:start position:0%
health effects of smoking and this is
 
04:00:14.309 --> 04:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
very important uh but looking forward
 
04:00:16.349 --> 04:00:16.359 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire house has passed now
 
04:00:19.189 --> 04:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
on countless occasions the legalization
 
04:00:21.550 --> 04:00:21.560 align:start position:0%
of marijuana I know we have a governor
 
04:00:23.830 --> 04:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
that makes it very clear she will veto
 
04:00:27.830 --> 04:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
that effort however if that were to pass
 
04:00:31.030 --> 04:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
what would happen to this line would it
 
04:00:35.070 --> 04:00:35.080 align:start position:0%
uh become larger than it is now would it
 
04:00:38.389 --> 04:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
increase or would it become
 
04:00:40.870 --> 04:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
irrelevant or somewhere in between thank
 
04:00:42.670 --> 04:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
you I thank you very much that's a a
 
04:00:44.189 --> 04:00:44.199 align:start position:0%
really insightful question so I don't
 
04:00:45.750 --> 04:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
think it would become irrelevant I don't
 
04:00:46.830 --> 04:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
anticipate that there would be
 
04:00:49.670 --> 04:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
additional funds um in this particular
 
04:00:52.229 --> 04:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
line I know that in many of the packages
 
04:00:54.750 --> 04:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
that we've seen for legalization of of
 
04:00:56.830 --> 04:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
recreational use of cannabis there have
 
04:00:59.590 --> 04:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
been a a p sort of a fund a public
 
04:01:01.309 --> 04:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
health fund that's pulled out of it and
 
04:01:03.870 --> 04:01:03.880 align:start position:0%
a prevention fund and so there are ideas
 
04:01:07.110 --> 04:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
that you would have funds for both um
 
04:01:09.670 --> 04:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
prevention for cannabis use among youth
 
04:01:11.469 --> 04:01:11.479 align:start position:0%
that might occur within Public Health
 
04:01:13.030 --> 04:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
that might occur within the division of
 
04:01:14.950 --> 04:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health servic I don't you
 
04:01:16.229 --> 04:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
know without the funds being
 
04:01:17.510 --> 04:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
appropriated we didn't get to that
 
04:01:19.189 --> 04:01:19.199 align:start position:0%
granular level of sort of who was going
 
04:01:22.710 --> 04:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
to run what we work very closely tobacco
 
04:01:25.110 --> 04:01:25.120 align:start position:0%
and um substance misuse in fact when I
 
04:01:26.790 --> 04:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
was here when um director Fox was
 
04:01:28.870 --> 04:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
talking we talked a little bit about why
 
04:01:31.590 --> 04:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
tobacco wasn't in that budget so tobacco
 
04:01:33.630 --> 04:01:33.640 align:start position:0%
is typ typically in public health the
 
04:01:36.469 --> 04:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
substances is in Behavioral Health so I
 
04:01:39.790 --> 04:01:39.800 align:start position:0%
would anticipate that if if the um if
 
04:01:42.229 --> 04:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
there were to be recreational Cannabis
 
04:01:44.110 --> 04:01:44.120 align:start position:0%
there has been a lot of support and a
 
04:01:45.950 --> 04:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
lot of advocacy for ensuring that there
 
04:01:48.110 --> 04:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
is the prevention components and also
 
04:01:49.670 --> 04:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
sort of managing some of the
 
04:01:51.870 --> 04:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
environmental parts of it we get into
 
04:01:55.590 --> 04:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
that now of like secondhand smoke um you
 
04:01:58.469 --> 04:01:58.479 align:start position:0%
know how do you incorporate things like
 
04:02:00.429 --> 04:02:00.439 align:start position:0%
the secondhand smoke from Canabis as
 
04:02:03.670 --> 04:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
well and and in housing in restaurants
 
04:02:05.790 --> 04:02:05.800 align:start position:0%
all of that the the slightly different
 
04:02:07.990 --> 04:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
thing with cannabis is that the actual
 
04:02:10.670 --> 04:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
use of it um from what we understand or
 
04:02:12.070 --> 04:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
at least I could talk about the
 
04:02:15.189 --> 04:02:15.199 align:start position:0%
therapeutic program the um there's less
 
04:02:17.349 --> 04:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
use of just combustible cannabis or like
 
04:02:19.510 --> 04:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
flour or smoking a joint if I can speak
 
04:02:22.309 --> 04:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
plainly um and there's a growing use of
 
04:02:24.189 --> 04:02:24.199 align:start position:0%
using Edibles and things that don't
 
04:02:27.309 --> 04:02:27.319 align:start position:0%
produce that same sort of
 
04:02:30.750 --> 04:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
smoke thank you representative n vano
 
04:02:32.790 --> 04:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you thank you Mr chairman I
 
04:02:34.710 --> 04:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
want to come back to a comment that uh
 
04:02:37.469 --> 04:02:37.479 align:start position:0%
you made in connection with oral oral
 
04:02:40.870 --> 04:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
health yeah and uh I think it's pretty
 
04:02:42.830 --> 04:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
widespread acknowledgement that
 
04:02:46.550 --> 04:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
inflammation as a general thing is is uh
 
04:02:51.030 --> 04:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
underlies almost uh a lot of areas of uh
 
04:02:53.510 --> 04:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
disease and my question has to do with
 
04:02:55.630 --> 04:02:55.640 align:start position:0%
the fact and a lot of inflammation
 
04:02:59.349 --> 04:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
starts uh with dental dental hygiene so
 
04:03:02.070 --> 04:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering what uh what efforts
 
04:03:04.950 --> 04:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
are me to to link some of this because
 
04:03:06.790 --> 04:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
anybody that go you know I talked to my
 
04:03:10.510 --> 04:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
dentist uh about paradon uh stuff that
 
04:03:12.429 --> 04:03:12.439 align:start position:0%
there's not doesn't seem to a lot of
 
04:03:15.510 --> 04:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
literature a lot of study related to the
 
04:03:18.630 --> 04:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
linkage between uh dental health and the
 
04:03:21.110 --> 04:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
preventative aspects of good dental
 
04:03:23.870 --> 04:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
health uh uh in preventing other
 
04:03:26.510 --> 04:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
diseases I think this is an area we have
 
04:03:29.030 --> 04:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
a ton more education need that needs to
 
04:03:30.670 --> 04:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
be done to do those links because I
 
04:03:32.830 --> 04:03:32.840 align:start position:0%
think there is certainly some suggestion
 
04:03:34.189 --> 04:03:34.199 align:start position:0%
in the literature right now to your
 
04:03:36.630 --> 04:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
point around heart disease around other
 
04:03:38.269 --> 04:03:38.279 align:start position:0%
conditions that are linked to that
 
04:03:40.309 --> 04:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
inflammation so in the oral health
 
04:03:41.830 --> 04:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
programs that are funded by the division
 
04:03:43.389 --> 04:03:43.399 align:start position:0%
of Public Health those are school-based
 
04:03:46.349 --> 04:03:46.359 align:start position:0%
clinics often where um we're going out
 
04:03:49.870 --> 04:03:49.880 align:start position:0%
and doing um sealant um for fluoride
 
04:03:52.750 --> 04:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
fluoride sealant and Fluoride Varnish
 
04:03:54.189 --> 04:03:54.199 align:start position:0%
and sealant those are two different
 
04:03:56.349 --> 04:03:56.359 align:start position:0%
things but both effectively help to
 
04:03:58.429 --> 04:03:58.439 align:start position:0%
prevent cavities or carries among
 
04:04:00.630 --> 04:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
children and then historically this is a
 
04:04:02.750 --> 04:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
place where we've been Dynamic we had a
 
04:04:05.110 --> 04:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
number of community-based Dent oral
 
04:04:06.790 --> 04:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
health programs that would do that for
 
04:04:09.510 --> 04:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
adults we've pulled back on that to some
 
04:04:11.670 --> 04:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
degree now that we have a Medicaid
 
04:04:13.950 --> 04:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
benefit so again Public Health was in
 
04:04:15.309 --> 04:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
there when there wasn't a Medicaid
 
04:04:18.149 --> 04:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
benefit um and even as we've seen kids
 
04:04:20.229 --> 04:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
access their care you know some of those
 
04:04:22.189 --> 04:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
school-based clinics are a little bit
 
04:04:25.110 --> 04:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
you know have less participation because
 
04:04:26.870 --> 04:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
we have better access but until we have
 
04:04:29.269 --> 04:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
great access both for adults and kids
 
04:04:31.510 --> 04:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
these clinics are really helpful for
 
04:04:33.110 --> 04:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
acting as a safety net especially in
 
04:04:34.710 --> 04:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
communities that have some real
 
04:04:37.870 --> 04:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
vulnerable folks or or low-income folks
 
04:04:39.189 --> 04:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
yeah it just seems to me that there's
 
04:04:41.830 --> 04:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
huge potential for from the preventative
 
04:04:44.870 --> 04:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
side of addressing the Dental which in
 
04:04:47.830 --> 04:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
turn would reduce the incidence of
 
04:04:50.309 --> 04:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
inflammation cause you know that causes
 
04:04:52.790 --> 04:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh other diseases yeah it's exactly why
 
04:04:54.229 --> 04:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
we put our oral health program and our
 
04:04:56.510 --> 04:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
chronic disease program okay thank you
 
04:05:00.830 --> 04:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um I am on slide 58 um so we
 
04:05:03.950 --> 04:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
have a number of um two on here that are
 
04:05:06.110 --> 04:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
larger funding funded programs we have
 
04:05:07.750 --> 04:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
something called Wise Women which is
 
04:05:10.309 --> 04:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
about 1.4 million in CDC funds no
 
04:05:12.870 --> 04:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
General funds and this provides a lot of
 
04:05:15.550 --> 04:05:15.560 align:start position:0%
support primarily through our federally
 
04:05:18.750 --> 04:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
qualified Health Centers to per to work
 
04:05:20.790 --> 04:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
with women in particular around heart
 
04:05:23.189 --> 04:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
disease and stroke and really promoting
 
04:05:25.229 --> 04:05:25.239 align:start position:0%
lifestyle factors so we all know about
 
04:05:27.389 --> 04:05:27.399 align:start position:0%
the medications you can take we also
 
04:05:29.429 --> 04:05:29.439 align:start position:0%
know that diet and exercise are really
 
04:05:31.910 --> 04:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
important and so this wise wom program
 
04:05:34.110 --> 04:05:34.120 align:start position:0%
really supports our fqhcs and other
 
04:05:36.630 --> 04:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
places where low-income women are to be
 
04:05:38.550 --> 04:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
able to do some of those lifestyle
 
04:05:40.510 --> 04:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
factors support them in exercise
 
04:05:43.149 --> 04:05:43.159 align:start position:0%
programs support them in in healthy diet
 
04:05:45.189 --> 04:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
so that we can help um mitigate the
 
04:05:48.750 --> 04:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
impact of a cardiovascular disease um
 
04:05:50.910 --> 04:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
similarly we have down and combined
 
04:05:53.510 --> 04:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
chronic disease these are 100% federal
 
04:05:56.189 --> 04:05:56.199 align:start position:0%
funds as well um and this is also where
 
04:05:58.189 --> 04:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
we're doing a lot of quality improvement
 
04:05:59.670 --> 04:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
in our federally qualified Health
 
04:06:01.309 --> 04:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
Centers even our community mental health
 
04:06:04.389 --> 04:06:04.399 align:start position:0%
centers to make sure that we can connect
 
04:06:07.149 --> 04:06:07.159 align:start position:0%
the dots um that our health centers have
 
04:06:08.990 --> 04:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
the resources so they can identify
 
04:06:11.790 --> 04:06:11.800 align:start position:0%
people both at risk and who suffer from
 
04:06:13.710 --> 04:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
chronic diseases and make sure that we
 
04:06:15.710 --> 04:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
Implement some of those lifestyle
 
04:06:17.670 --> 04:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
improvements um that really are going to
 
04:06:19.830 --> 04:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
be beneficial in the long run and really
 
04:06:21.950 --> 04:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
it's about self these programs are
 
04:06:24.349 --> 04:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
primarily around self-management being
 
04:06:26.670 --> 04:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
able to manage your own disease as well
 
04:06:28.510 --> 04:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
as ensuring that we have the right me
 
04:06:30.070 --> 04:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
you know at times we do some quality
 
04:06:32.269 --> 04:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
improvement around medication for
 
04:06:35.309 --> 04:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
hypertension things like that we can go
 
04:06:37.790 --> 04:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
to um slide
 
04:06:40.590 --> 04:06:40.600 align:start position:0%
59 um these again we have two smaller
 
04:06:42.389 --> 04:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
grants that work with the rural
 
04:06:45.349 --> 04:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
hospitals and Rural health centers um we
 
04:06:47.830 --> 04:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
have our rural health and primary care
 
04:06:51.189 --> 04:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
which is again um on uh budget briefing
 
04:06:54.070 --> 04:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
book 62 this is where you see our state
 
04:06:56.070 --> 04:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
loan repayment program something that we
 
04:06:59.030 --> 04:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
often talk about where we provide loan
 
04:07:01.750 --> 04:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
repayment to medical professionals both
 
04:07:04.950 --> 04:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
Physicians MDS dentists all the way down
 
04:07:08.149 --> 04:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
to Master's level providers primarily in
 
04:07:10.429 --> 04:07:10.439 align:start position:0%
the behavioral health space incredibly
 
04:07:12.790 --> 04:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
important to do both the workforce uh
 
04:07:14.910 --> 04:07:14.920 align:start position:0%
recruitment as well as the state loan
 
04:07:17.070 --> 04:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
repayment so that we can focus those
 
04:07:19.510 --> 04:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
folks in serving our most needed
 
04:07:21.510 --> 04:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
residents of the state they have to sign
 
04:07:23.710 --> 04:07:23.720 align:start position:0%
a contract and say they'll work in this
 
04:07:25.750 --> 04:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
um area where they can where there's
 
04:07:28.429 --> 04:07:28.439 align:start position:0%
more need and then finally on that that
 
04:07:29.590 --> 04:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
page we have something called our
 
04:07:31.910 --> 04:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
preventive Health block grant um which
 
04:07:33.830 --> 04:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
also has a required match to it which is
 
04:07:36.950 --> 04:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
the general funds on there um and this
 
04:07:39.870 --> 04:07:39.880 align:start position:0%
is a flexible set of funding from CDC
 
04:07:41.830 --> 04:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
and this funds a ton of things from our
 
04:07:45.830 --> 04:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
rabies clinic all the way to um a lot of
 
04:07:47.750 --> 04:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
work in our laboratory but it's
 
04:07:49.510 --> 04:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
generally for disease prevention and
 
04:07:50.990 --> 04:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
health promotion some nurses
 
04:07:52.830 --> 04:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
occasionally get funded out of here but
 
04:07:55.670 --> 04:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
this is a broad um flexible funding
 
04:07:57.710 --> 04:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
source that we can use for ongoing needs
 
04:08:00.070 --> 04:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
and also as needs change over
 
04:08:03.510 --> 04:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
time I I have a question on uh rural
 
04:08:07.510 --> 04:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
health and Primary Care yes um so uh in
 
04:08:11.590 --> 04:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
the current year we're we're at a A
 
04:08:17.349 --> 04:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
million6 or 7 we're going up um 100,000
 
04:08:17.359 --> 04:08:18.510 align:start position:0%
million6 or 7 we're going up um 100,000
into

04:08:18.510 --> 04:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:08:22.510 --> 04:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
26 uh what what what's constituting that
 
04:08:26.429 --> 04:08:26.439 align:start position:0%
100,000 increase what's that based
 
04:08:29.670 --> 04:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
on I'm just looking at the general funds
 
04:08:32.630 --> 04:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
okay I'm obsessed with General funds
 
04:08:36.389 --> 04:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:40.309 --> 04:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
you okay and so so I'll ask you maybe a
 
04:08:43.630 --> 04:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
different question then which is um do
 
04:08:46.149 --> 04:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
we do we have a little
 
04:08:50.429 --> 04:08:50.439 align:start position:0%
synopsis on exactly uh how these
 
04:08:53.309 --> 04:08:53.319 align:start position:0%
scholarships the scholarship amounts are
 
04:08:55.630 --> 04:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
determined and and and what kind of
 
04:08:58.750 --> 04:08:58.760 align:start position:0%
income eligibility uh the the applicant
 
04:09:02.229 --> 04:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
may need to meet or I I I I just want to
 
04:09:04.510 --> 04:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
understand if we're if we're paying
 
04:09:08.950 --> 04:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
$5,000 for a podiatrist and 50,000 for a
 
04:09:11.630 --> 04:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
you know a nurse anesthetist I I I want
 
04:09:14.469 --> 04:09:14.479 align:start position:0%
to know if there's a distinction based
 
04:09:16.469 --> 04:09:16.479 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
04:09:19.349 --> 04:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
credentialing yes there is let me pull
 
04:09:21.389 --> 04:09:21.399 align:start position:0%
up I have some cheat sheet here so I I'm
 
04:09:23.309 --> 04:09:23.319 align:start position:0%
I might need it to like look at it and
 
04:09:25.950 --> 04:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
absorb it okay so I we're happy to send
 
04:09:28.990 --> 04:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
that to you so again um when we think
 
04:09:33.630 --> 04:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
about the um State loan repayment we H
 
04:09:35.910 --> 04:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
we base the loan they enter into a
 
04:09:38.510 --> 04:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
contract with us and it is uh the
 
04:09:41.109 --> 04:09:41.119 align:start position:0%
different levels so like an MD receives
 
04:09:44.109 --> 04:09:44.119 align:start position:0%
more for loan re loan re ment than a
 
04:09:46.550 --> 04:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
master's level clinician so it's divided
 
04:09:49.309 --> 04:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
by that level of MD level versus
 
04:09:51.550 --> 04:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
Master's level versus RN level so
 
04:09:53.670 --> 04:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
there's a set formula that we use for
 
04:09:56.550 --> 04:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
loan repayment they get that formula and
 
04:09:58.790 --> 04:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
they have to be serving in an medically
 
04:10:00.590 --> 04:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
underserved area so often that's in our
 
04:10:02.389 --> 04:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
federally qualified Health Center or a
 
04:10:05.710 --> 04:10:05.720 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Center primarily
 
04:10:08.109 --> 04:10:08.119 align:start position:0%
so so so just to let you know my my
 
04:10:10.510 --> 04:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
general concern as I as I go into this
 
04:10:14.389 --> 04:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
with you later um
 
04:10:16.870 --> 04:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
these General funds get paid by you know
 
04:10:19.070 --> 04:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
plumbers and carpenters and people who
 
04:10:21.670 --> 04:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
drive trucks you know there's a lot of
 
04:10:24.309 --> 04:10:24.319 align:start position:0%
those uh skills up in the north country
 
04:10:27.750 --> 04:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
that are also underserved and we're not
 
04:10:30.309 --> 04:10:30.319 align:start position:0%
um subsid not subsidizing is not the
 
04:10:31.710 --> 04:10:31.720 align:start position:0%
right word we're not
 
04:10:35.149 --> 04:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
incentivizing those skill sets to go
 
04:10:38.109 --> 04:10:38.119 align:start position:0%
into that area and so there's I think
 
04:10:39.910 --> 04:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
there's a fundamental fairness question
 
04:10:42.429 --> 04:10:42.439 align:start position:0%
to this program and I I just I just want
 
04:10:44.870 --> 04:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
to take a fresh fair look at it I think
 
04:10:46.349 --> 04:10:46.359 align:start position:0%
that's fair you know I would suggest
 
04:10:48.750 --> 04:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
that those plumbers and you know other
 
04:10:50.189 --> 04:10:50.199 align:start position:0%
folks all need healthc care and
 
04:10:52.389 --> 04:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
especially if in your in Coos you need
 
04:10:54.349 --> 04:10:54.359 align:start position:0%
to be able to access a doctor yeah a
 
04:10:56.670 --> 04:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
nurse needs a plumber too though so it's
 
04:10:59.469 --> 04:10:59.479 align:start position:0%
it's a mutual need Society it's a maslo
 
04:11:01.389 --> 04:11:01.399 align:start position:0%
hierarchy of needs I think we also need
 
04:11:02.950 --> 04:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
healthc care providers to have optimal
 
04:11:04.469 --> 04:11:04.479 align:start position:0%
lives so that you can be a plumber so
 
04:11:05.750 --> 04:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
that you don't have the chronic disease
 
04:11:07.830 --> 04:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
that keeps you out of work so you know
 
04:11:10.189 --> 04:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
it's a healthy conversation to have
 
04:11:11.870 --> 04:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
public health problem if you don't have
 
04:11:13.950 --> 04:11:13.960 align:start position:0%
plumbers well that's the part about the
 
04:11:15.910 --> 04:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
septic system that the health officers
 
04:11:18.950 --> 04:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
take care of but um but truly you know
 
04:11:21.630 --> 04:11:21.640 align:start position:0%
all kidding aside I think over time we
 
04:11:24.229 --> 04:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
have prioritized ensuring that we have
 
04:11:26.670 --> 04:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
access to qualified health providers in
 
04:11:28.790 --> 04:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
every corner of the state because
 
04:11:32.469 --> 04:11:32.479 align:start position:0%
naturally it is harder to get a a great
 
04:11:35.149 --> 04:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
doctor to work up north or out in the
 
04:11:37.389 --> 04:11:37.399 align:start position:0%
community than it is in the Boston metro
 
04:11:40.189 --> 04:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
area so so so I've spent 50 years in
 
04:11:42.149 --> 04:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
healthc care I love the industry I love
 
04:11:44.790 --> 04:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
our professionals I understand the rural
 
04:11:48.269 --> 04:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
environment uh I I I I I'm still just
 
04:11:51.109 --> 04:11:51.119 align:start position:0%
troubled by the fundamental fairness of
 
04:11:54.349 --> 04:11:54.359 align:start position:0%
of of the program when we're not doing
 
04:11:58.750 --> 04:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
it for similarly shortage skills yes so
 
04:12:02.030 --> 04:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
if if we could just look at it thank you
 
04:12:05.030 --> 04:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
all right great um are there any other
 
04:12:07.870 --> 04:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
questions here we have some data around
 
04:12:09.670 --> 04:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
slurp later in a slide if you just want
 
04:12:12.590 --> 04:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
to see how the uptake on it in a bit all
 
04:12:17.389 --> 04:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
right um slide 50 uh slide 60 just the
 
04:12:18.750 --> 04:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
last few of these this is our
 
04:12:20.830 --> 04:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
prescription drug monitoring program no
 
04:12:22.469 --> 04:12:22.479 align:start position:0%
General funds in the prescription drug
 
04:12:24.269 --> 04:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
monitoring that was designed when the
 
04:12:27.070 --> 04:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
program was designed just a you know a
 
04:12:29.670 --> 04:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
memory for memory lane um prescription
 
04:12:31.870 --> 04:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
drug monitoring used to be an oplc in
 
04:12:33.389 --> 04:12:33.399 align:start position:0%
the office of professional Li Insurance
 
04:12:36.349 --> 04:12:36.359 align:start position:0%
certification it moved over to um the
 
04:12:38.030 --> 04:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:12:39.590 --> 04:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
in public health this is one of those
 
04:12:42.349 --> 04:12:42.359 align:start position:0%
places where our net number got a little
 
04:12:44.630 --> 04:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
bit bigger but took a program that was
 
04:12:46.149 --> 04:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
existing in another part of the state
 
04:12:49.070 --> 04:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
and put it in public health um we have
 
04:12:50.469 --> 04:12:50.479 align:start position:0%
some funds through the Department of
 
04:12:52.389 --> 04:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
Justice and then some federal funds to
 
04:12:54.750 --> 04:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
do that work we also have some opioid
 
04:12:56.910 --> 04:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
surveillance funding um that really
 
04:12:59.510 --> 04:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
looks at overdose data in a in a pretty
 
04:13:02.710 --> 04:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
comprehensive way um and so that's it
 
04:13:05.070 --> 04:13:05.080 align:start position:0%
for all of our budgets for the division
 
04:13:07.349 --> 04:13:07.359 align:start position:0%
of Public Health Services again as you
 
04:13:09.070 --> 04:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
go through the the remainder slides
 
04:13:10.550 --> 04:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
these are just some highlights of the
 
04:13:12.750 --> 04:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
great work that the team behind me does
 
04:13:15.389 --> 04:13:15.399 align:start position:0%
around you know the 1500 people that are
 
04:13:18.630 --> 04:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
served through um bccp for breast and
 
04:13:20.990 --> 04:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
cervical cancer screening the number you
 
04:13:24.229 --> 04:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
know 689 adults in our arthritis program
 
04:13:27.309 --> 04:13:27.319 align:start position:0%
doing some healthy active living work um
 
04:13:28.790 --> 04:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
and some great work that we're doing in
 
04:13:31.510 --> 04:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
diabetes prevention great data here in
 
04:13:34.590 --> 04:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
six side 62 around um vaping around
 
04:13:37.149 --> 04:13:37.159 align:start position:0%
youth vaping and the way that that plays
 
04:13:38.910 --> 04:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
what I it was a little too busy but I
 
04:13:41.309 --> 04:13:41.319 align:start position:0%
think it is interesting to note we have
 
04:13:43.510 --> 04:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
flip-flopped over time around boys and
 
04:13:45.229 --> 04:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
girls talking about how do we use this
 
04:13:48.070 --> 04:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
yrbs data there's um girls are more
 
04:13:50.189 --> 04:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
likely to start vaping earlier which is
 
04:13:52.830 --> 04:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
fascinating to me early on it was all
 
04:13:55.870 --> 04:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
mostly boys and then finally the last
 
04:13:59.070 --> 04:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
slide of any consequence slide 63 talks
 
04:14:01.630 --> 04:14:01.640 align:start position:0%
about the state loan repayment program
 
04:14:04.510 --> 04:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
and um shows that increase specifically
 
04:14:06.790 --> 04:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
among Behavioral Health Providers so
 
04:14:09.750 --> 04:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
that is um 2:15 which is almost exactly
 
04:14:12.429 --> 04:14:12.439 align:start position:0%
when we thought we would be done um and
 
04:14:14.510 --> 04:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any more questions
 
04:14:17.229 --> 04:14:17.239 align:start position:0%
and I I appreciate your patience with me
 
04:14:21.309 --> 04:14:21.319 align:start position:0%
as um as I came in to pinch hit today I
 
04:14:23.349 --> 04:14:23.359 align:start position:0%
you're again you're great so let's look
 
04:14:27.229 --> 04:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
at at slide 61 supporting healthy active
 
04:14:31.149 --> 04:14:31.159 align:start position:0%
lives I think we have a question about
 
04:14:33.630 --> 04:14:33.640 align:start position:0%
um the extent to which we ought to be
 
04:14:35.830 --> 04:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
monitoring Alzheimer and dementia if
 
04:14:37.269 --> 04:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
there's anything we should be doing
 
04:14:40.670 --> 04:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
that's sort of in a similar vein here so
 
04:14:42.670 --> 04:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
typically the work around Alzheimer's
 
04:14:45.990 --> 04:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
and other dementias has been within our
 
04:14:48.309 --> 04:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
um divisional long-term services in in
 
04:14:50.229 --> 04:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
healthy aging that's where you know
 
04:14:53.070 --> 04:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
we've divided the pi so um Public Health
 
04:14:55.469 --> 04:14:55.479 align:start position:0%
has not taken a a lead role in that
 
04:14:57.950 --> 04:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
space but our aging work our folks who
 
04:14:59.950 --> 04:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
do adult and elderly services which is
 
04:15:01.309 --> 04:15:01.319 align:start position:0%
not their name anymore but I'm blanking
 
04:15:03.109 --> 04:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
on their new name um that's where the
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
work of Alzheimer's happens all right um
 
04:15:09.469 --> 04:15:09.479 align:start position:0%
representative n van yeah um I'm not
 
04:15:11.389 --> 04:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
sure whether it was covered uh in a
 
04:15:13.510 --> 04:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
previous session that I had but it
 
04:15:16.630 --> 04:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh or whether it's U appropriate to ask
 
04:15:19.590 --> 04:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
it here on the whole question of um
 
04:15:21.710 --> 04:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
licensing of
 
04:15:25.670 --> 04:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
nurses and uh reciprocity and what uh is
 
04:15:29.429 --> 04:15:29.439 align:start position:0%
that in in your that's in a different is
 
04:15:31.149 --> 04:15:31.159 align:start position:0%
that would occur within the office of
 
04:15:32.750 --> 04:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
professional lure and
 
04:15:35.109 --> 04:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
certification yeah because I I think
 
04:15:36.870 --> 04:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
I've I think I asked the question but
 
04:15:38.229 --> 04:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I got the answer and that
 
04:15:41.070 --> 04:15:41.080 align:start position:0%
is one of the things that uh occurs to
 
04:15:43.950 --> 04:15:43.960 align:start position:0%
me my my wife is a retired nurse but
 
04:15:46.070 --> 04:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
there's often uh difficulties in
 
04:15:47.830 --> 04:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
accepting accreditation and everything
 
04:15:50.910 --> 04:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
else that could alleviate some of
 
04:15:53.550 --> 04:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
the yeah absolutely and I think that
 
04:15:55.750 --> 04:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
that's a place with the Board of Nursing
 
04:15:58.070 --> 04:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
and and oplc that they're wrestling with
 
04:16:00.109 --> 04:16:00.119 align:start position:0%
that but we certainly agree and we see
 
04:16:02.510 --> 04:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
that in the healthcare providers that um
 
04:16:03.990 --> 04:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
around the state that some of those
 
04:16:06.950 --> 04:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
licensing and credentialing issues um
 
04:16:09.309 --> 04:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
are best address well they are uh
 
04:16:10.990 --> 04:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
statutorily need to be addressed within
 
04:16:13.670 --> 04:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
oplc instead of DHHS so so the Loan
 
04:16:17.590 --> 04:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
program for example uh is that a so if
 
04:16:21.109 --> 04:16:21.119 align:start position:0%
you attract a nurse from another uh
 
04:16:25.109 --> 04:16:25.119 align:start position:0%
location uh who had the loans
 
04:16:27.870 --> 04:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
outstanding they be able to access that
 
04:16:30.030 --> 04:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
kind of a program or this is they would
 
04:16:31.309 --> 04:16:31.319 align:start position:0%
have to be licensed here in New
 
04:16:32.590 --> 04:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and ready to work in New
 
04:16:34.550 --> 04:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right I mean they could sign
 
04:16:36.309 --> 04:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
the same kind of an agreement it said
 
04:16:39.229 --> 04:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm uh newly graduated or I
 
04:16:41.990 --> 04:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
graduated a while ago and I still have
 
04:16:43.990 --> 04:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
outstanding loans they would be able to
 
04:16:46.149 --> 04:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
qualify assuming they met the
 
04:16:47.950 --> 04:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
contractual Arrangements correct and
 
04:16:49.149 --> 04:16:49.159 align:start position:0%
they were serving in those medically
 
04:16:51.429 --> 04:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
underserved areas correct okay thank you

help in these areas that we are needing
 
04:17:34.750 --> 04:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
in um so you're looking at slide 20 2794
 
04:17:37.910 --> 04:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
yeah 2794 so yes so we've been working
 
04:17:40.189 --> 04:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
closely with bate Primary Care they have
 
04:17:42.389 --> 04:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
been our contractor to do Recruitment
 
04:17:44.830 --> 04:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
and so so yes over time and we can share
 
04:17:46.630 --> 04:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
those numbers with you as well of the
 
04:17:48.389 --> 04:17:48.399 align:start position:0%

primarily for us in those medically
 
04:17:56.149 --> 04:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
underserved areas again public health is
 
04:17:58.990 --> 04:17:59.000 align:start position:0%

wellness policies and are very concerned
 
04:19:56.550 --> 04:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
about prevention programs starting at
 
04:19:58.750 --> 04:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
Birth all the way uh through the Life
 
04:20:01.630 --> 04:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
Span so we do support um The Family
 
04:20:03.309 --> 04:20:03.319 align:start position:0%
Resource Centers the comprehensive
 
04:20:06.070 --> 04:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
family child supports also childhood
 
04:20:08.870 --> 04:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
lead poisoning prevention um and I also
 
04:20:10.349 --> 04:20:10.359 align:start position:0%
just did want to mention that we are
 
04:20:11.910 --> 04:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
very supportive of our Universal
 
04:20:14.910 --> 04:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
childhood vacc program and we do have
 
04:20:18.070 --> 04:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
serious concerns about House Bill 524
 
04:20:19.790 --> 04:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
the last thing I'll just say is just an
 
04:20:23.429 --> 04:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
anecdotal story about um vaping um I've
 
04:20:25.349 --> 04:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
worked in public health for about 20
 
04:20:28.590 --> 04:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
years and both my college age girls
 
04:20:31.870 --> 04:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
ended up vaping um and uh they both
 
04:20:34.070 --> 04:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
through their providers re were referred
 
04:20:36.149 --> 04:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
to the Quit Line and they were
 
04:20:38.309 --> 04:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
successfully able to text back and forth
 
04:20:41.309 --> 04:20:41.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to say both are no longer
 
04:20:44.309 --> 04:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
Bing good
 
04:20:46.550 --> 04:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
so I have a straight question for new
 
04:20:49.030 --> 04:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
Futures looking at the public health
 
04:20:51.109 --> 04:20:51.119 align:start position:0%
budget is there any area here that you
 
04:20:53.429 --> 04:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
think we've over resourced that we maybe
 
04:20:55.269 --> 04:20:55.279 align:start position:0%
be able to take some money from to
 
04:20:58.510 --> 04:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
support more higher priorities it's a
 
04:21:01.670 --> 04:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
very difficult question and I take it on
 
04:21:03.149 --> 04:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
um a lot harder because I used to work
 
04:21:04.429 --> 04:21:04.439 align:start position:0%
in the division of Public Health
 
04:21:08.030 --> 04:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
Services so I don't envy any of you
 
04:21:10.790 --> 04:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
about making these difficult decisions
 
04:21:13.750 --> 04:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
um I think as I said we're very
 
04:21:16.870 --> 04:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
concerned for we are very attentive to
 
04:21:20.229 --> 04:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
prevention programs um however I think
 
04:21:22.030 --> 04:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of very important
 
04:21:23.590 --> 04:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
programs within this budget so
 
04:21:25.750 --> 04:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I can't guide you to one
 
04:21:27.510 --> 04:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
specific line and I don't envy your
 
04:21:30.269 --> 04:21:30.279 align:start position:0%
position yeah I I I want to also just
 
04:21:33.309 --> 04:21:33.319 align:start position:0%
mention that um a member of new Futures
 
04:21:35.950 --> 04:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
contacted me before the session started
 
04:21:38.149 --> 04:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
this year like in the fall and was
 
04:21:40.429 --> 04:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
asking for support on expanding the
 
04:21:43.109 --> 04:21:43.119 align:start position:0%
adult Medicaid dental Medicaid program
 
04:21:45.389 --> 04:21:45.399 align:start position:0%
MH and I explained that this was not the
 
04:21:48.389 --> 04:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
year to to be doing that and I I I
 
04:21:50.990 --> 04:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate that new Futures didn't take
 
04:21:53.750 --> 04:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
try to take that Hill anyways no we did
 
04:21:55.229 --> 04:21:55.239 align:start position:0%
we did not that's what not one of our
 
04:21:56.469 --> 04:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
budget priorities that would have been
 
04:21:58.229 --> 04:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
in the division of Medicaid services and
 
04:22:00.469 --> 04:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
I don't believe we prioritize that all
 
04:22:02.910 --> 04:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
right is there anyone else in the
 
04:22:05.710 --> 04:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
audience come on
 
04:22:11.030 --> 04:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:12.950 --> 04:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you Mr chairman Mike
 
04:22:14.790 --> 04:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
Rolo American Cancer Society cancer
 
04:22:16.550 --> 04:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
Action Network I'm going to be very
 
04:22:19.429 --> 04:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
brief and and and somewhat repetitive
 
04:22:22.389 --> 04:22:22.399 align:start position:0%
what Kate fry just said um the Cancer
 
04:22:23.870 --> 04:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
Society has a number of budget
 
04:22:25.349 --> 04:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
priorities as well as you can imagine
 
04:22:28.030 --> 04:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
the cancer registry might be one of them
 
04:22:30.790 --> 04:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
um the uh tobacco control program is one
 
04:22:33.269 --> 04:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
of them in the comprehensive uh cancer
 
04:22:36.349 --> 04:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
um uh line is another um area as well as
 
04:22:38.830 --> 04:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
the office of rural Health we' be uh
 
04:22:40.990 --> 04:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
supportive of of the funding levels that
 
04:22:44.750 --> 04:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
are within uh that were presented today
 
04:22:47.510 --> 04:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
all right so similar question do you see
 
04:22:49.670 --> 04:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
any areas that we could reduce funding
 
04:22:51.309 --> 04:22:51.319 align:start position:0%
to support your
 
04:22:53.590 --> 04:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
priorities uh no I believe that the
 
04:22:55.990 --> 04:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
department and the governor presented a
 
04:23:00.990 --> 04:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
a budget that um um is reasonable and uh
 
04:23:03.149 --> 04:23:03.159 align:start position:0%
no I I don't believe that uh within the
 
04:23:05.189 --> 04:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Health that there's
 
04:23:07.109 --> 04:23:07.119 align:start position:0%
probably room to make Cuts if it's only
 
04:23:09.389 --> 04:23:09.399 align:start position:0%
2% of the overall call them
 
04:23:12.590 --> 04:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
recalibrations here but thank you of
 
04:23:16.750 --> 04:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
course um all right um anything else oh
 
04:23:18.670 --> 04:23:18.680 align:start position:0%
I yes I did want to remind you all that
 
04:23:19.910 --> 04:23:19.920 align:start position:0%

calendar and that there will be an
 
04:23:22.710 --> 04:23:22.720 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire's community health centers
 
04:24:49.590 --> 04:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
and Vermont's community health centers
 
04:24:51.389 --> 04:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire our health centers
 
04:24:55.269 --> 04:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
serve over a 100,000 Granite Staters and
 
04:24:57.910 --> 04:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
they exist in areas that are designated
 
04:25:00.429 --> 04:25:00.439 align:start position:0%
as medically underserved or have
 
04:25:03.229 --> 04:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
residents who um are designated as
 
04:25:04.910 --> 04:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
medically underserved
 
04:25:08.389 --> 04:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
populations so we exist um to help
 
04:25:10.830 --> 04:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
people Access Health Care Services that
 
04:25:13.030 --> 04:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
they would otherwise go without our
 
04:25:14.990 --> 04:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
health centers do receive limited
 
04:25:17.309 --> 04:25:17.319 align:start position:0%
Federal funding that hasn't been changed
 
04:25:21.109 --> 04:25:21.119 align:start position:0%
in a decade and we also rely on state
 
04:25:24.349 --> 04:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
contracts and Commercial Insurance to um
 
04:25:27.149 --> 04:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
do this work our health centers serve
 
04:25:30.309 --> 04:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
approximately 36% commercially insured
 
04:25:32.590 --> 04:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
and about the same in Medicaid it
 
04:25:35.189 --> 04:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
depends on the health center um and we
 
04:25:37.790 --> 04:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
do have some uninsured patients but I I
 
04:25:39.870 --> 04:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to speak to offer us as a
 
04:25:42.670 --> 04:25:42.680 align:start position:0%
resource to you we do as um Trish
 
04:25:44.790 --> 04:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned manag the recruitment center
 
04:25:46.510 --> 04:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
contract with the state of New Hampshire
 
04:25:49.309 --> 04:25:49.319 align:start position:0%
and so we work with people across the
 
04:25:50.870 --> 04:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
country who want to come to New
 
04:25:52.830 --> 04:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and practice in our beautiful
 
04:25:54.710 --> 04:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
state and we've been doing that work for
 
04:25:56.910 --> 04:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
over 30 years in partnership with the
 
04:25:59.550 --> 04:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
state and we've recruited well over 700
 
04:26:01.630 --> 04:26:01.640 align:start position:0%
clinicians so we're happy to give you
 
04:26:04.030 --> 04:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
any data that would be helpful for you
 
04:26:07.269 --> 04:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
as you craft the budget um but to
 
04:26:10.030 --> 04:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
anticipate your question I don't think
 
04:26:12.550 --> 04:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
you could ever overspend on prevention
 
04:26:14.870 --> 04:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
right I I mean as a personal it's a
 
04:26:17.750 --> 04:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
personal choice too um how do you spend
 
04:26:19.630 --> 04:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
your money in your personal budget I try
 
04:26:22.389 --> 04:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
and prevent big expenses so I think the
 
04:26:24.510 --> 04:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
state can do the same and the division
 
04:26:27.149 --> 04:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
of health is very responsible with their
 
04:26:29.950 --> 04:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
Investments and we've had a wonderful
 
04:26:31.630 --> 04:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
relationship partnering with them on
 
04:26:33.630 --> 04:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
everything from covid to healthcare
 
04:26:35.910 --> 04:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
Workforce recruitment so happy to serve
 
04:26:37.950 --> 04:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
as a resource to you as you make these
 
04:26:41.870 --> 04:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
tough decisions thank you may I ask a
 
04:26:44.109 --> 04:26:44.119 align:start position:0%
question you didn't anticipate
 
04:26:47.870 --> 04:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh since you uh have had so
 
04:26:50.229 --> 04:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
much experience recruiting uh
 
04:26:52.950 --> 04:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
professionals from out of state what do
 
04:26:54.910 --> 04:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
you think would be more effective if you
 
04:26:56.870 --> 04:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
could only do one of two things would it
 
04:26:59.229 --> 04:26:59.239 align:start position:0%
be more effective recruiting out ofate
 
04:27:02.349 --> 04:27:02.359 align:start position:0%
professionals if you offered some basic
 
04:27:05.710 --> 04:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
relocation package or a loan forgiveness
 
04:27:08.030 --> 04:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
program well forgiveness that was not
 
04:27:09.710 --> 04:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
the question I thought you were going to
 
04:27:12.389 --> 04:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
ask I didn't I I wanted to surprise you
 
04:27:15.389 --> 04:27:15.399 align:start position:0%
so I think it's it's there's a couple of
 
04:27:18.189 --> 04:27:18.199 align:start position:0%
things there right um we the state has
 
04:27:21.389 --> 04:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
invested in marketing materials for us
 
04:27:23.950 --> 04:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
to use at the national level and the
 
04:27:26.309 --> 04:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
reason is is because this within the
 
04:27:29.229 --> 04:27:29.239 align:start position:0%
state we don't have enough or we are not
 
04:27:31.469 --> 04:27:31.479 align:start position:0%
producing enough clinicians to meet the
 
04:27:35.349 --> 04:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
demands that that um exist in our state
 
04:27:38.429 --> 04:27:38.439 align:start position:0%
currently so in a Senate Bill there are
 
04:27:40.550 --> 04:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
investments that we've requested to do
 
04:27:43.309 --> 04:27:43.319 align:start position:0%
just that so new Hampshire unfortunately
 
04:27:45.590 --> 04:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
is one of the states that doesn't invest
 
04:27:48.510 --> 04:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
in our area health education centers and
 
04:27:51.870 --> 04:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
these organizations are designed to get
 
04:27:54.149 --> 04:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
kids interested in the healthc care
 
04:27:56.349 --> 04:27:56.359 align:start position:0%
profession they also help current
 
04:27:59.349 --> 04:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
practitioners move up the career ladder
 
04:28:02.149 --> 04:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
so I think you could um do multiple
 
04:28:04.550 --> 04:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
things you should invest in programs
 
04:28:06.590 --> 04:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
that develop clinicians within our state
 
04:28:10.189 --> 04:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
borders but also recruit um outside of
 
04:28:12.750 --> 04:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
our state borders because we do need to
 
04:28:15.750 --> 04:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
do both right one isn't just the only
 
04:28:18.630 --> 04:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
answer um the other thing that we would
 
04:28:20.990 --> 04:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
ask is that we continue to support and
 
04:28:23.189 --> 04:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
you have in the past the Coos County
 
04:28:25.910 --> 04:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
family health services they have a um
 
04:28:28.710 --> 04:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
Family Practice um Residency program
 
04:28:31.030 --> 04:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
that they're working on getting stood up
 
04:28:33.990 --> 04:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
and they expect to receive residents in
 
04:28:37.750 --> 04:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
July 2026 so we need to grow our own but
 
04:28:40.030 --> 04:28:40.040 align:start position:0%
we also need to help them stay here and
 
04:28:41.670 --> 04:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
to that's the second part of your
 
04:28:44.229 --> 04:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
question right we do need loan repayment
 
04:28:45.870 --> 04:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities and the state loan
 
04:28:47.670 --> 04:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
repayment program has been very
 
04:28:50.590 --> 04:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
successful in helping us recruit and
 
04:28:53.870 --> 04:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
retain professionals because um it's
 
04:28:55.950 --> 04:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
really hard right to get someone to the
 
04:28:58.590 --> 04:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
North Country to and get them to stay
 
04:29:01.309 --> 04:29:01.319 align:start position:0%
there particularly if they're married or
 
04:29:03.309 --> 04:29:03.319 align:start position:0%
have a partner and children because
 
04:29:05.070 --> 04:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
their partner and their kids might not
 
04:29:07.429 --> 04:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
have the same economic opportunities
 
04:29:09.630 --> 04:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
that they do as a clinician and so the
 
04:29:11.670 --> 04:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
loan repayment programs that the state
 
04:29:15.189 --> 04:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
offers they kind of offset that um
 
04:29:17.429 --> 04:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
unfortunate circumstance and so they've
 
04:29:20.070 --> 04:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
been amazing in helping us get
 
04:29:23.229 --> 04:29:23.239 align:start position:0%
clinicians into the state and stay
 
04:29:27.070 --> 04:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
here would you take another one sure
 
04:29:29.269 --> 04:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
okay so if you could only do one of two
 
04:29:31.870 --> 04:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
things which would you do if your goal
 
04:29:35.510 --> 04:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
is to uh increase the number of instate
 
04:29:38.790 --> 04:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
kids going to college and to become a
 
04:29:42.870 --> 04:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
health professional would you do uh a
 
04:29:45.670 --> 04:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
scholarship to help them pay for school
 
04:29:47.870 --> 04:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
or would you do a loan repayment after
 
04:29:50.309 --> 04:29:50.319 align:start position:0%
they've already successfully graduated
 
04:29:51.910 --> 04:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to hate that you ask me
 
04:29:53.870 --> 04:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
this question representative Edwards no
 
04:29:56.229 --> 04:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
I like the information you're the expert
 
04:29:59.429 --> 04:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
teach me something it depends right so
 
04:30:01.870 --> 04:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
if someone is going to school to be a
 
04:30:04.510 --> 04:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
dental hygienist a scholarship upfront
 
04:30:07.349 --> 04:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
is more helpful to them because their um
 
04:30:09.229 --> 04:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
debt burden is lower than if you're
 
04:30:11.309 --> 04:30:11.319 align:start position:0%
going to dental school so if someone's
 
04:30:13.349 --> 04:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
going to Dental school scholarships are
 
04:30:15.429 --> 04:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
great but what they really need is loan
 
04:30:17.469 --> 04:30:17.479 align:start position:0%
repayment on the back end to help them
 
04:30:20.030 --> 04:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
pay their loans down because dentists
 
04:30:21.550 --> 04:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
graduate with over
 
04:30:25.309 --> 04:30:25.319 align:start position:0%
$300,000 in dental school debt um dental
 
04:30:28.349 --> 04:30:28.359 align:start position:0%
hygienists don't have $300,000 in
 
04:30:30.750 --> 04:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
hygienist school debt so it truly
 
04:30:32.870 --> 04:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
depends on what type of clinician they
 
04:30:35.590 --> 04:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
are and this is why we like to do both
 
04:30:37.469 --> 04:30:37.479 align:start position:0%
we have the state loan repayment program
 
04:30:39.349 --> 04:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
but it would be wonderful if we did have
 
04:30:40.910 --> 04:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
more scholarship
 
04:30:43.189 --> 04:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
opportunities so given we have a fixed
 
04:30:45.309 --> 04:30:45.319 align:start position:0%
set of money what does it seem like we
 
04:30:47.710 --> 04:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
should be looking at our student loan
 
04:30:50.990 --> 04:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
repayment program to diversify it so
 
04:30:52.630 --> 04:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
that we could have a little bit of
 
04:30:54.870 --> 04:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
relocation money so that we could have a
 
04:30:57.349 --> 04:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
little scholarship money for the kid
 
04:30:59.750 --> 04:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
trying to pay for school those things
 
04:31:01.750 --> 04:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
are not in the in the loan repayment
 
04:31:05.389 --> 04:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
program now are they um no Mr chair
 
04:31:07.830 --> 04:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
they're not um but I would say that the
 
04:31:09.870 --> 04:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
state loan repayment program I believe
 
04:31:13.309 --> 04:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
is empty right now so it has exp it has
 
04:31:15.710 --> 04:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
extended all of its contracts due to
 
04:31:18.790 --> 04:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
demand and so we're relying on jua
 
04:31:21.309 --> 04:31:21.319 align:start position:0%
funding for contracts at the current
 
04:31:23.670 --> 04:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
moment that means that there is more
 
04:31:26.429 --> 04:31:26.439 align:start position:0%
demand than the state can currently um
 
04:31:29.830 --> 04:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
Supply in funds and so I I wouldn't
 
04:31:34.149 --> 04:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
divert slurp I would um try and address
 
04:31:36.229 --> 04:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
it a different way and I'm happy to chat
 
04:31:38.469 --> 04:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
with you about ideas because we we don't
 
04:31:40.550 --> 04:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the federal loan
 
04:31:42.349 --> 04:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
repayment program
 
04:31:44.510 --> 04:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
um for reasons that may have been
 
04:31:46.630 --> 04:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
explained earlier so there other are
 
04:31:48.389 --> 04:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
there are other opportunities that we
 
04:31:50.510 --> 04:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
could look at to meet the needs of
 
04:31:52.070 --> 04:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
people all right well thank you do you
 
04:31:54.349 --> 04:31:54.359 align:start position:0%
have a question representative Daniels
 
04:31:57.030 --> 04:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you are there any existing CTE
 
04:31:59.149 --> 04:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
programs that would uh get somebody
 
04:32:01.590 --> 04:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
started on a pathway to a
 
04:32:04.590 --> 04:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
clinician yes so the um area health
 
04:32:08.429 --> 04:32:08.439 align:start position:0%
education centers do have um training
 
04:32:09.950 --> 04:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
programs and I'm happy to get you more
 
04:32:12.030 --> 04:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
information on that if that would be
 
04:32:14.510 --> 04:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you was there a question
 
04:32:14.520 --> 04:32:16.070 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you was there a question
over

04:32:16.070 --> 04:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
over
 
04:32:22.349 --> 04:32:22.359 align:start position:0%

morning yes ma'am
representative

04:33:43.590 --> 04:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:33:47.510 --> 04:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
Walmer I was wondering if the um
 
04:33:49.830 --> 04:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
chairman of the finance committee has
 
04:33:53.670 --> 04:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
set a date and a time for the public
 
04:33:55.551 --> 04:33:55.561 align:start position:0%
hearing I think there are a lot of
 
04:33:57.869 --> 04:33:57.879 align:start position:0%
people who are waiting to to hear about
 
04:33:59.910 --> 04:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
the public hearing and when when it will
 
04:33:59.920 --> 04:34:01.470 align:start position:0%
the public hearing and when when it will
take

04:34:01.470 --> 04:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
take
 
04:34:04.750 --> 04:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
place uh the big public Hearing in the
 
04:34:07.709 --> 04:34:07.719 align:start position:0%
in the house chambers that one yes yes
 
04:34:10.789 --> 04:34:10.799 align:start position:0%
uh I I'm I'm not aware of a date yet U
 
04:34:12.910 --> 04:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
Mr rippled have you you heard a rumor of
 
04:34:16.109 --> 04:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
a date I've heard a rumor of March 12th
 
04:34:18.869 --> 04:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
but I don't think it's been formally set
 
04:34:21.670 --> 04:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
yet okay all right so that's the same
 
04:34:24.230 --> 04:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
rumor representative Mooney herd so we
 
04:34:26.230 --> 04:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
don't we don't know but if you pencil in
 
04:34:28.949 --> 04:34:28.959 align:start position:0%
March 12th you might be right and I I'll
 
04:34:31.470 --> 04:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
I'll follow up though the reason I asked
 
04:34:34.230 --> 04:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
is because I think a lot of people who
 
04:34:36.990 --> 04:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
are interested in the budget want to
 
04:34:39.789 --> 04:34:39.799 align:start position:0%
make plans to come and I was also told
 
04:34:42.789 --> 04:34:42.799 align:start position:0%
that that is town meeting night I I'm
 
04:34:44.510 --> 04:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
from conquer I thought it was the 11th
 
04:34:46.869 --> 04:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
was town meeting Town meeting's the 11th
 
04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
I believe I saw one someone sent me a
 
04:34:50.429 --> 04:34:50.439 align:start position:0%
screenshot New London has one on March
 
04:34:51.869 --> 04:34:51.879 align:start position:0%
12th and I think there's a couple other
 
04:34:54.189 --> 04:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
towns found out last time um I think
 
04:34:57.470 --> 04:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
generally it's the 11 so so you you're
 
04:35:00.910 --> 04:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
you serve as the um minority member for
 
04:35:03.551 --> 04:35:03.561 align:start position:0%
the committee the full committee right
 
04:35:04.990 --> 04:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:35:08.750 --> 04:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
correct okay so representative wer is
 
04:35:10.590 --> 04:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
probably more available to you than to
 
04:35:12.830 --> 04:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
me so
 
04:35:15.310 --> 04:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
wow yeah yeah no that's how that's how
 
04:35:20.789 --> 04:35:20.799 align:start position:0%
you rate so um okay I I um I I think
 
04:35:22.750 --> 04:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
that's what I wanted to say Mr Ripple do
 
04:35:24.269 --> 04:35:24.279 align:start position:0%
you want to finish us off do you got
 
04:35:28.070 --> 04:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
