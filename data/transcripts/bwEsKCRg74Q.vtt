00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 align:start position:0%
Fred's missing and uh Jason's missing
 
00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
missing I can't can't leave my guy
 
00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 align:start position:0%
that's right me you were the only one
 
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
apparently it's all right we'll get it
 
00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 align:start position:0%
done you were up all night were all
 
00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 align:start position:0%
right so$ 12299 um was the bill dealing
 
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
with the fire educator for the community
 
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 align:start position:0%
college system um wanting to add that in
 
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh for people who can continue to stay
 
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
in group two after they've had 10 years
 
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
of fire service experience um testimony
 
00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
about this bill was all negative I don't
 
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
think we had any um positive uh
 
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
testimony on it um it seemed to me that
 
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
uh there were a couple of reasons for
 
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
that uh negative testimony there were
 
00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
oppositional testimony um the first was
 
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh the 10 years fire service experience
 
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't enough time after 10 to go into a
 
00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 align:start position:0%
position like this and be able to stay
 
00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 align:start position:0%
in group two which was primarily created
 
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
um because of the risk to life and limb
 
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
um the benefit was primarily for that
 
00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
was just not enough time of investment
 
00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 align:start position:0%
um to move over to this kind of position
 
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
and maintain group two status and I
 
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
understand that and the other is concern
 
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
about other people who would like to get
 
00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 align:start position:0%
into group two who upon seeing this
 
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
might think well here's reason for us to
 
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
be able to get into group two as well um
 
00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
so what I have proposed as the bill
 
00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 align:start position:0%
stands um
 
00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
I I there seems to be pretty much
 
00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 align:start position:0%
unanimous consent among all of the
 
00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
players anyway that uh the bill should
 
00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 align:start position:0%
be it and I don't think that there's
 
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
been much support on the committee from
 
00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 align:start position:0%
anybody I've talked to either however
 
00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
I'm floating this idea in um this
 
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
0300 that if the fire educator for the
 
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
community college system had 20 years of
 
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
fire service experience in the field
 
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
then then they would be able to move
 
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
over into the position and keep their
 
00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 align:start position:0%
group to benefits um my reasoning for
 
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
that and I've talked to a few people um
 
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
on the issue is it seems to me that the
 
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
fire educator in the community college
 
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
system should be somebody who has some
 
00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 align:start position:0%
field experience yeah no question and
 
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
and you are asking those people with the
 
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
field experience to give up a tremendous
 
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
amount of their benefit that they've
 
00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 align:start position:0%
earned hey there's a guy now we can take
 
00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 align:start position:0%
a vote come sit now you're great
 
00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't be happier to see
 
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.470 align:start position:0%
couldn't be happier to see
you

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
um you're asking them to take a huge hit
 
00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 align:start position:0%
to their benefit to come over to this
 
00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 align:start position:0%
educator um position and uh so I can
 
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
understand why they would be reticent to
 
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
do so um at 20 years they've they've
 
00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
completed most of their retirement um
 
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
obligation um as far as service is cons
 
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
concerned and we do have some other
 
00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 align:start position:0%
positions that they can move into um
 
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
such as a a fire chief who are no longer
 
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
traditionally dealing directly oh yeah
 
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.470 align:start position:0%
traditionally dealing directly oh yeah
um

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank you see
 
00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 align:start position:0%
right talking highlighted highlighted
 
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
yeah the B the bolded part um such as a
 
00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 align:start position:0%
fire chief who um although is still an
 
00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.439 align:start position:0%
integral part of you know the
 
00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
firefighting system is no longer
 
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
traditionally going out and figh
 
00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 align:start position:0%
fighting the fires himself um so I think
 
00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:01.159 align:start position:0%
that we do have some um
 
00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
some examples that we can go by there
 
00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
yeah precedent thank you um so I wanted
 
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
to float this idea out there because I
 
00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
do think that there needs to be some way
 
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
for for people who have actual field
 
00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
experience to be able to take these
 
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
positions um so that we're getting
 
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 align:start position:0%
Educators who have field experience and
 
00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
aren't just um you know armchair
 
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
philosophers to a certain extent um
 
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
because these are the people who are
 
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
going to be training the people who are
 
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
in the field and the people in the field
 
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
are the ones who going to be protecting
 
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
our citizens um so that was my thought
 
00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 align:start position:0%
I'll open it up for any comments from
 
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee or from the room as
 
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
well if I
 
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
might I think your points are well taken
 
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
uh especially the idea that somebody who
 
00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 align:start position:0%
already has 20 years in and has that
 
00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 align:start position:0%
that 20 years acral of benefits and so
 
00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
forth and so on to sacrifice all that uh
 
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
for the purp
 
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 align:start position:0%
in the interest of becoming a a trainer
 
00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
or educator is a that's a big sacrifice
 
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
so I I think your your language here is
 
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm amenable to
 
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
that excellent J any comments anybody
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
from the room I know it was mostly
 
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
negative so please feel free to come up
 
00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 align:start position:0%
concerns yes please oh yes people may
 
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
want to watch from the outside and they
 
00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 align:start position:0%
can't hear you without it I wasn't sure
 
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
this type of meeting was also streamed
 
00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
um I'm Shannon Reed I'm here
 
00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
representing the community college
 
00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 align:start position:0%
system and we had testified in
 
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill at the hearing
 
00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
um this is the first time seeing or
 
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
hearing of the amendment so I haven't
 
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
really had a chance to review it with
 
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
others in my organization but I think
 
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
that you know we would still be
 
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
concerned about a couple of things one
 
00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 align:start position:0%
is creating two separate classifications
 
00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
within our faculty Workforce within nhrs
 
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 align:start position:0%
um and and two is again that this could
 
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
open a a wider door to faculty and other
 
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
disciplines like um all of our criminal
 
00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
justice programs and most of many of our
 
00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
instructors are people who who come from
 
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
municipal or state police forces or some
 
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
other um law enforcement entity um I'm
 
00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:21.759 align:start position:0%
pretty sure but I will need to confirm
 
00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:23.150 align:start position:0%
pretty sure but I will need to confirm
this

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
that field experience is probably a
 
00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:28.039 align:start position:0%
requirement of this of this job so it's
 
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
not a it's not it's not a situation
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
where um because we currently don't have
 
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
someone maintaining group two we
 
00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
therefore would end up with instructors
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
who don't have field experience I think
 
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
that that for this program in particular
 
00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 align:start position:0%
is is likely a requirement if not
 
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
something that's um something that we
 
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
would 100% look for in hiring an
 
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
instructor so those those remain our
 
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
concerns that we we don't we don't want
 
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
to create this kind of separate Avenue
 
00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
to nhrs classification within our
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
faculty Workforce thank you um and I'm
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
glad that you're here because you were
 
00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
the very person that I was hoping was
 
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
going to show up because you're the one
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
person who's outside of just the you
 
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
know group two retirement um um kind of
 
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
Paradigm um if you could speak more
 
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
specifically if you wouldn't mind to the
 
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
concerns of having the two groups is it
 
00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:21.879 align:start position:0%
administrative is it um fairness is it
 
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
what are your concerns I think it's as I
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
reviewed this with rhr folks internally
 
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
I think the concern is fairness and
 
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
Equity Within our within our faculty um
 
00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759 align:start position:0%
our faculty across the community college
 
00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
system are one bargaining unit um
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
they're we we try as hard as we can to
 
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
maintain Equity within that group um in
 
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
terms of pay and compensation it's all
 
00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
kind of consistent and we would like to
 
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
maintain that within that um employee
 
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
group um in your opinion
 
00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:56.919 align:start position:0%
um how many other faculty
 
00:07:59.469 --> 00:07:59.479 align:start position:0%
members might be affected by this might
 
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
look at it and say oh wait if they can
 
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
do that then how about us because you
 
00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:05.919 align:start position:0%
mentioned criminal justice and and
 
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
things of that nature I'm just trying to
 
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:08.840 align:start position:0%
get a feel for the right I think there'd
 
00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:10.919 align:start position:0%
be two Avenues one is kind of program
 
00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:12.879 align:start position:0%
specific and folks coming into teaching
 
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
in in criminal justice or in a Homeland
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
Security we have we have those um
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
programs as well and and second would
 
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
simply be someone who's who whose
 
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
background and professional career has
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
been in one of those fields who comes
 
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
into teach in any other profession which
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
is certainly possible we have folks who
 
00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:29.319 align:start position:0%
might have a background in Criminal
 
00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:32.039 align:start position:0%
justice and human services who come to
 
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:33.800 align:start position:0%
teach in a Human Service profession but
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
but had been members of group two so I
 
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
think there are a couple areas where you
 
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
could see some of that
 
00:08:41.469 --> 00:08:41.479 align:start position:0%
um leakage isn't quite the right word
 
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
but you could see some of that that door
 
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:45.320 align:start position:0%
opening to additional folks Beyond just
 
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
the fire okay uh one last question from
 
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
me if you don't mind um what would be
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
your concern about the benefits
 
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
spreading to those other
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
individuals well cost would be be one I
 
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
mean the cost when it's one person or
 
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
two is fairly minimal as we outlined in
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
our fiscal note to this bill um the more
 
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
we the more of those folks we we are
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
covering you know in terms of their um
 
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
the benefits I think it's about two and
 
00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
a half times the cost for benefits if
 
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
you're group two as opposed to group one
 
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
so at some point that does that does add
 
00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:22.839 align:start position:0%
up in a college budget which are pretty
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
tight um I'm sorry your question was our
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
concerns about other people I think
 
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:31.160 align:start position:0%
again just would come back to that um
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
the concept of equity within a an
 
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
employee group right and that's what I
 
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
was saying if the equity if we say we
 
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
were not philosophically opposed to it
 
00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
spreading to those other individuals and
 
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
them also being able to to take that
 
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
same benefit the primary concern at that
 
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
point wouldn't be Equity of be cost yes
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
okay and again this is just um this is
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
just I'm kind of thinking out loud here
 
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
I I would ideally like to and the timing
 
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
might not permit that but I would
 
00:10:00.069 --> 00:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
ideally like to have vetted this
 
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
particular idea more internally with
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
some of my colleagues but um you know
 
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
based on my conversations with them so
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
far I think what I'm saying is is fairly
 
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:11.480 align:start position:0%
um fairly reflective of what they would
 
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
also think sure yeah um and I mean this
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
will still have to go before the full
 
00:10:18.069 --> 00:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
committee anyway so you would even if we
 
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
passed this amendment out of the
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee today you would still have
 
00:10:23.949 --> 00:10:23.959 align:start position:0%
time probably to get some feedback to us
 
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
before we were at the full committee
 
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
stage unfortunately you know how
 
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
legislation goes it's got to keep
 
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
marching so of course
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
but um any other questions for yeah
 
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.550 align:start position:0%
but um any other questions for yeah
Representative

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
Representative
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
no if nobody else wants to weigh in at
 
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
this point art are
 
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
you just
 
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
comment yeah just want I'll have you
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
come up in just a sec yeah uh I I think
 
00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:51.399 align:start position:0%
the other aspect is the reverse of what
 
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
we were talking about before that
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
somebody if they've got 20 years in all
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
that acrude benefit and so forth to
 
00:11:00.629 --> 00:11:00.639 align:start position:0%
sacrifice that to to go into the other
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
thing but the reality is how many people
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
are there out there that are going to
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
are going to be 20y year veterans who
 
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
would be would fall into this category
 
00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:15.959 align:start position:0%
um and therefore and also who would want
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
to teach because that's what we're
 
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
talking about that's that's one of the
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
Prime criteria uh for you know allowing
 
00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:27.639 align:start position:0%
them to be into the group is that they
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
have all the background
 
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:32.200 align:start position:0%
so they're not teaching or something
 
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
they learn in a book but they don't have
 
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
any practical experience so just
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
thought well thank you very much I
 
00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:42.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate you thank you and I guess I
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
would just say by closing if I if I may
 
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
that I think this amendment certainly
 
00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
makes sense when you're looking at an
 
00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:48.839 align:start position:0%
individual's kind
 
00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:51.959 align:start position:0%
of pathway but our our concerns are more
 
00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:53.839 align:start position:0%
kind of institutionally based yeah no
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.959 --> 00:12:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
come join
 
00:12:06.829 --> 00:12:06.839 align:start position:0%
us thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
Arthur bodri I represent the New
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State permanent firefighters
 
00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
retirement Association I'm not going to
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
speak in favor or against this but
 
00:12:21.069 --> 00:12:21.079 align:start position:0%
um as I stated in my original testimony
 
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
that group two was set up because of
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
life expectancy and the rigor of the job
 
00:12:29.069 --> 00:12:29.079 align:start position:0%
um educators are in group one because
 
00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
the the life expectancy is longer and
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
the rigor is not as as much as being a
 
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.710 align:start position:0%
the rigor is not as as much as being a
firefighter

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
firefighter
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
um what you did I think is is better
 
00:12:41.629 --> 00:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
than 10 years but when I look at group
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
one they're in group one right now
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's why they have a um a split
 
00:12:47.949 --> 00:12:47.959 align:start position:0%
benefit clause in the retirement system
 
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
so this individual could work 20 years
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
in there as group to collecting
 
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
depending on when they joined it could
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
be 2% or two and a half percent and then
 
00:12:59.110 --> 00:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
go into group one and they would collect
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
they would start U collecting 1.67% a
 
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
year but they'd also be eligible for
 
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
Social Security so I would look at
 
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
somebody that has 20 years of service
 
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
depending on their age if they're in
 
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:10.430 align:start position:0%
depending on their age if they're in
their

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
40s it might be beneficial for them to
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
stay in group one and collect the 1.67%
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
and be eligible for full Social Security
 
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
then going into group two and not being
 
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
eligible for so Social Security so it it
 
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
is something that the individuals are
 
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
going to have to look at when it comes
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
to that that point but 20 years is a lot
 
00:13:33.389 --> 00:13:33.399 align:start position:0%
more palatable than 10 years because
 
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
like I said group two should be for
 
00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
high-risk jobs and and jobs that your
 
00:13:41.949 --> 00:13:41.959 align:start position:0%
life expectancy is is is less than a
 
00:13:41.959 --> 00:13:43.310 align:start position:0%
life expectancy is is is less than a
normal

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
normal
 
00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:45.959 align:start position:0%
population thank you um just a point of
 
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
clarification because I it's hard to
 
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
remember everything the windfall act how
 
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
would that how would that affect in this
 
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
situation though I mean yes they're they
 
00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
qualify for Social Security but at some
 
00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
point doesn't that I think they the
 
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
group two time will still put them under
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
the windfall act um but probably not as
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
great because they're going to have more
 
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:07.240 align:start position:0%
years of service working in Social
 
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
Security and I don't I don't know the
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
formula but social security has a
 
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
formula of how much how many years
 
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
you've worked in you know as a police
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
officer or a firefighter and how many
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
years you've worked you know as a social
 
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
security recipient so they have a
 
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
formula I'm not sure but I this
 
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
individual would still be under the
 
00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:28.279 align:start position:0%
windfall act uh I believe going forward
 
00:14:28.279 --> 00:14:30.350 align:start position:0%
windfall act uh I believe going forward
okay

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you very much
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
time so I mean we've got a few things to
 
00:14:44.829 --> 00:14:44.839 align:start position:0%
take into consideration obviously uh
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
things that we're trying to balance and
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
and from my perspective the primary
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
thing that I'm trying to kind of wrap my
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
mind around is the purpose of the
 
00:14:55.949 --> 00:14:55.959 align:start position:0%
program purpose of the program from
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
everything that I've been able to glean
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
is to prepare firefighters for work in
 
00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.389 align:start position:0%
is to prepare firefighters for work in
the

00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
field um in order to do that well I just
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
I I don't see how we do that without
 
00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
somebody who has field experience and
 
00:15:11.069 --> 00:15:11.079 align:start position:0%
we're having a hard time getting people
 
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
with field experience to come over
 
00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
because they've got to change over their
 
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
benefits package and why not just
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
stay in working in a way that allows
 
00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
them to acrew that group to benefit um
 
00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:24.759 align:start position:0%
so we we lost instructors according to
 
00:15:26.189 --> 00:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
testimony anyway we lost instructors
 
00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:28.279 align:start position:0%
last year over that very reason because
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
they would have to change over to group
 
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
one from group two um so I would just uh
 
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:35.720 align:start position:0%
from my own perspective as I'm kind of
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
processing this the way that I've been
 
00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
you know kind of thinking about it um is
 
00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:43.759 align:start position:0%
we are when it comes to other
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
instructors we're not it's not we're not
 
00:15:49.309 --> 00:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
setting a precedent as a wide open door
 
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
they'd have to have 20 years of field
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
experience before we would even consider
 
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
allowing them to stay in group two this
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
isn't for new hires this isn't for
 
00:15:59.629 --> 00:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
somebody with 12 years experience
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
they've had to have 20 years experience
 
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
to your point representative Smith they
 
00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
have to want to be faculty member and
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
teach at that point which isn't for
 
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
everybody who goes into this profession
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
um for sure
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know I mean I I'd have to
 
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
hear testimony on it but I'm just
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
curious to know whether or not it
 
00:16:20.189 --> 00:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be beneficial to have some of
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
the people in those other professions
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
with 20 years of experience be able to
 
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
stay in group two and come over and
 
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
instruct I I don't want to say no to
 
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
this one just because we're afraid
 
00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:32.759 align:start position:0%
somebody else might also qualify if we
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
feel like those other people qualifying
 
00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:37.480 align:start position:0%
might be a reasonable and good thing and
 
00:16:41.069 --> 00:16:41.079 align:start position:0%
uh I say that completely recognizing um
 
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
the school's position of expense
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
and administrative complication um so
 
00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not completely ignoring that um just
 
00:16:52.749 --> 00:16:52.759 align:start position:0%
trying to weigh the two and figure out
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.990 align:start position:0%
 
comments

00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
I think you've expressed the situation
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
well it's a balancing there's no
 
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
question about it you're giving up
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
something uh to uh if you don't have the
 
00:17:12.189 --> 00:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
20 years experience and the 20 years the
 
00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:14.919 align:start position:0%
20 years are cruel that's a key aspect
 
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:16.839 align:start position:0%
something that you're giving up a lot of
 
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:19.640 align:start position:0%
benefit on the other hand Mr bod's point
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
that uh you know
 
00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:27.079 align:start position:0%
that uh um well it's slipped my mind
 
00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
this is that very moment
 
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
but but your point is also very well
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
taken uh and so it is a balancing and
 
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
again it's not mandatory that's saying
 
00:17:40.029 --> 00:17:40.039 align:start position:0%
when you get to if you're still in the
 
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
service at at that point now you get
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
shifted they can
 
00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:46.919 align:start position:0%
choose not everybody wants to be a
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
teacher some people are eager to
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
demonstrate their skill and they they
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
always want to show other people what
 
00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:55.039 align:start position:0%
they can do and so forth and so on but
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
not everybody wants to get up in front
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:07.549 --> 00:18:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
please thank you just just one one point
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
I would like to make is that this this
 
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
bill you're you're speaking about it as
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
if it's a bill that would um help the
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
community college system but we're not
 
00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
asking for this bill the college system
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
is not seeking this bill we we believe
 
00:18:27.909 --> 00:18:27.919 align:start position:0%
we can fill this position without this
 
00:18:31.149 --> 00:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
provision so um you know in so far as
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
you're looking at ways to kind of
 
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
bolster our ability to provide
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate instruction we we don't
 
00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
believe that A change is necessary to
 
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
enable us to do that yes thank
 
00:18:45.789 --> 00:18:45.799 align:start position:0%
you all right
 
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to keep pondering it for
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
the next 20 minutes anyway we'll come
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
back to
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
it let's go we got a few other bills we
 
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
got to hit
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
1211 um relative to part-time employment
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
of the retirement system um so we hear
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
this bill every year I feel like um from
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
testimony and conversations that I've
 
00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
had I feel like we're in the same spot
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
we always are which is there's there's
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
no need uh for this bill people who are
 
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
working part-time aren't coming close to
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
their maximum allowance as it is so
 
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
increasing the maximum number of hours
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
that they can work um is I don't think
 
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
it's going to do anything uh to help the
 
00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:28.919 align:start position:0%
situation and it does create
 
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of complication uh into the
 
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
system so uh I personally am not in
 
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill but I'll entertain
 
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
any comments from anybody on the
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or any thoughts that
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
it I agree with your point all right if
 
00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
that's the case on 1211 I'm going to
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
move that we recommend itl to the full
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
committee on HB 1211 do have a second on
 
00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:57.230 align:start position:0%
committee on HB 1211 do have a second on
that

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:02.630 align:start position:0%
 
Peter

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
any further
 
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:08.200 align:start position:0%
comment all right all all in favor it's
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
easiest that way all right so 30 on itl
 
00:20:13.549 --> 00:20:13.559 align:start position:0%
all right we'll make that recommendation
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
to the full committee
 
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.310 align:start position:0%
to the full committee
then

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:22.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.149 --> 00:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
1421 um relative to investment
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
consulting services in the New Hampshire
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
retirement system uh my impression from
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
uh rep Mr Carlin's
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
um explanation of the situation was that
 
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh there was some misunderstanding of
 
00:20:42.549 --> 00:20:42.559 align:start position:0%
how we handle this um the independent
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
investment firms aren't the ones
 
00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
actually making the investment choices
 
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:47.720 align:start position:0%
the board is they're just paying for
 
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
consultation uh and information so I
 
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
don't think that the spell would do what
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
the sponsor wanted it to do um that's my
 
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.870 align:start position:0%
 
committee

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
okay yeah representative peon would you
 
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
like to join us this your
 
00:21:16.269 --> 00:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:16.279 --> 00:21:21.350 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh it simply because the
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
um what I want to have happen and what I
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
want the investment committee to do this
 
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
bill will not make that happen right
 
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
it's not going to do it what we still
 
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
have some issues with what they're doing
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
or not doing is really the problem what
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
they're not doing um but I think that
 
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to figure
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
out a little bit different way of making
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
the pressure be applied um keeping in
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
mind that we have a
 
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature has a separation from
 
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
the retirement system in the sense that
 
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
we're not permitted to micromanage them
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
but we can
 
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:13.400 align:start position:0%
certainly remind them that the term
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
fiduciary responsibility is not a
 
00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
buzzword it actually does mean something
 
00:22:23.149 --> 00:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
so but in this case yes this bill is is
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh is not going to do it it's not going
 
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
to get it there yeah yeah so thank you
 
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
for your testimony appreciate it
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh that being the case I will move that
 
00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:33.559 align:start position:0%
we recommend itl on 1421 to the full
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
committee do I have a
 
00:22:39.789 --> 00:22:39.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
J any further
 
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
comments no oh okay all in favor all
 
00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:52.990 align:start position:0%
comments no oh okay all in favor all
right

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
three all right um so
 
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
1307 is a bill that is looking for a
 
00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
one-time uh Cola of $500 to be paid to
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
retired members of the retirement system
 
00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:08.200 align:start position:0%
receiving an allowance or beneficiary of
 
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:11.240 align:start position:0%
such member for survivorship uh pension
 
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
benefit who are eligible with the
 
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
following criteria um so as a general
 
00:23:20.029 --> 00:23:20.039 align:start position:0%
rule on this bill uh my position is I'm
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
totally fine with it uh I feel like this
 
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
when the cola went through last year
 
00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:25.559 align:start position:0%
these people should have been included
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
in that Cola they were left out I like
 
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much just an oversight uh
 
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
the only question and I don't have an
 
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
official amendment I would have to go
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
get one so we wouldn't be able to vote
 
00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
on it today if this was the case excuse
 
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
me if you can describe you could
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
describe the amendment clearly and the
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee knows exactly what they're
 
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
voting on you can do it and then get the
 
00:23:48.669 --> 00:23:48.679 align:start position:0%
amendment and bring it to the Z session
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you madam
 
00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:52.919 align:start position:0%
chair um so it would be to raise the
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
threshold to $50,000 and would you like
 
00:24:02.269 --> 00:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:03.789 --> 00:24:03.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I don't have to
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
say my name again do I you no it's just
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
a sub commmittee meeting um the $50,000
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
as I testified on this bill uh group two
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
the the median uh or the actually the
 
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
average uh earnings for a Group Two Fire
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
is about
 
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
$45,000 um so uh it every every time
 
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
they have a stiping I wouldn't call this
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
a cola because a cola in my opinion is
 
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
put on your base and compounded this is
 
00:24:32.389 --> 00:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
a stien um so the group two has been
 
00:24:35.549 --> 00:24:35.559 align:start position:0%
left out we've uh we've put in two bills
 
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
in the last two years for for colas and
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
they ended up turning them into stiens
 
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
and reducing the the number to 30,000 to
 
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
40,000 which pretty much wipes out a
 
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
good number of group two people um so by
 
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
putting this to 50 uh $50,000 I believe
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
um um mty had mentioned that it could be
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 70 to 80 additional uh
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
members would be eligible for this stien
 
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
if you put it to the 50,000 and that was
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
what we re requested and I know the
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
sponsor was was supportive of that
 
00:25:12.389 --> 00:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
also um yeah at such a small number of
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
people I I personally don't have any
 
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
problem with that anybody else everybody
 
00:25:19.389 --> 00:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
feel okay with that thank you very much
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
appr um so I would like to put in an
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to to raise it to the
 
00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
$50,000 threshold
 
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
um and I would make a motion to
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
recommend to the committee OTP as
 
00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
amended with the $50,000 threshold do I
 
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
second guys I got people fighting over
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
it this is
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
great so who's my
 
00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
official well Jason put your hand yeah
 
00:25:53.549 --> 00:25:53.559 align:start position:0%
okay all right I'll in favor all right
 
00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
three Z all right we'll make that
 
00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:57.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the committee see how
 
00:25:59.710 --> 00:25:59.720 align:start position:0%
they feel about about it all right um to
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
the to the big one HB
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:36.630 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
just for the record Mr chairman I may
 
00:26:42.029 --> 00:26:42.039 align:start position:0%
have misheard I thought you said 1467
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
and in point of fact it is
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
1647 so just Ju Just to correct the
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
record yeah yeah you heard the same my
 
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
dislexia kicked in again I apologize for
 
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
those who are the vast television
 
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:56.200 align:start position:0%
audience tuning
 
00:26:59.470 --> 00:26:59.480 align:start position:0%
in all right so uh when we met last uh
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
we were looking over the language of the
 
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
bill and realized that there were a few
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
things missing so this um Amendment uh
 
00:27:09.789 --> 00:27:09.799 align:start position:0%
well actually this amendment changes the
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
bill to reduce the overall cost um by
 
00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:16.919 align:start position:0%
limiting some of the people who would
 
00:27:19.789 --> 00:27:19.799 align:start position:0%
qualify for the increased 2.5%
 
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
multiplier um so in two different
 
00:27:24.549 --> 00:27:24.559 align:start position:0%
sections we've added the language um but
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
only for group two members in service
 
00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
who have attained age regardless of the
 
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
number years of credible service or who
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
work their full age and service
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
requirements and retire under service
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
retirement if a member retires prior to
 
00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
reaching the full age and service
 
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
requirements then their uh annuity
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
multiplier Remains the Same as their
 
00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
first 10 years of credible service um so
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
this was both looked at as a cost saving
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
measure on this bill and also as a
 
00:27:52.029 --> 00:27:52.039 align:start position:0%
potential retention um because if you
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
don't stay to your full retirement um
 
00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
obligations uh you're going to lose so a
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
fairly significant part of your benefit
 
00:28:03.389 --> 00:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
um so it might encourage people to stay
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
longer um while also cutting cost to the
 
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
bill uh so that that gets thrown in
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
there in the two sections uh that have
 
00:28:16.029 --> 00:28:16.039 align:start position:0%
to do with um the new 2.5% multiplier uh
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
eligibility for that multiplier so that
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
would be on page one lines 12 through 16
 
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
and on page two lines 6 through
 
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
11 uh the other thing that we changed in
 
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
the bill comes on line
 
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
32 um because of the the change that we
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
made uh we also said that members who
 
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
retire upon ordinary disability um or
 
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
qualify for accidental death benefits as
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
outlined in RSA
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
108a um shall not be subject to the full
 
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
age and service requirements listed
 
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
under the changes that we just made so
 
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:56.440 align:start position:0%
we would be limiting people's benefits
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
to the 2% unless they meet their full
 
00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
age requirements or they're at least 60
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
years old
 
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
unless um they end up on ordinary
 
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
disability or die in the line of duty
 
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
and then they get the 2.5% multiplier
 
00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:13.039 align:start position:0%
regardless whether they work 12 years or
 
00:29:15.389 --> 00:29:15.399 align:start position:0%
14 years or 16 years or whatever they
 
00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
they would still get the 2.5
 
00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
multiplier understood what's that
 
00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
understood yeah
 
00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:24.799 align:start position:0%
yeah um thought thoughts thoughts from
 
00:29:24.799 --> 00:29:26.310 align:start position:0%
yeah um thought thoughts thoughts from
the

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.509 align:start position:0%
the
subcommittee

00:29:29.509 --> 00:29:29.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
no anybody want to speak to it from yes
 
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:41.789 align:start position:0%
no anybody want to speak to it from yes
Mr

00:29:41.789 --> 00:29:41.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
real thank you good morning for the
 
00:29:45.789 --> 00:29:45.799 align:start position:0%
record Brian real uh president of the
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
professional firefighters of New
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm going to be very brief um
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
we worked extremely hard in the
 
00:29:53.909 --> 00:29:53.919 align:start position:0%
retirement commission uh on this very
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
issue uh this is an amendment that we
 
00:29:59.149 --> 00:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
drafted up up together um as a
 
00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
collaborative to try and narrow the
 
00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
focus here uh so we can land the dart on
 
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
the bullseye when this thing heads to
 
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
the Senate and uh lower the cost uh
 
00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
enough to get into that range that's
 
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
palatable for them so um I would ask the
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
subcomittee to support this thank you
 
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
much seeing no other comments um I will
 
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
move OTP or we recommend otpa uh to the
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
full committee um with Amendment
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
326h attached to it do I have a second
 
00:30:36.159 --> 00:30:48.950 align:start position:0%
326h attached to it do I have a second
on

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.230 align:start position:0%
 
favor

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
favor
 
00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.870 align:start position:0%
favor
okay

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
um so that brings us back to the only
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
1299 so I guess for me the main point of
 
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
contention at the moment is um the
 
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
college system is saying they feel like
 
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
they can fill the position uh the people
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
in charge of instructing say they're not
 
00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
getting somebody to fill the position
 
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
um and to me that's kind of the the Crux
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
of The Proposal that I brought forward
 
00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:48.799 align:start position:0%
and whether or not we should do it um
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not that position is going to
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
be filled by somebody who has a
 
00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
significant amount of field
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
experience um with without this so um
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
Madam chair would you like
 
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
to to hear from
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
you yes I I would be very concerned
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
about this because there are only one or
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
two positions that qualify and we hate
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
to tweak the retirement system for one
 
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
or two people it we we don't want to
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
pass bills for one or two
 
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
people if it was a broad class of
 
00:32:30.789 --> 00:32:30.799 align:start position:0%
individuals who would be covered by this
 
00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
I might might support it but not for one
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
or two people in a specific program
 
00:32:40.389 --> 00:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
that's that's just too narrow and too
 
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
personal and too M too much like doing
 
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
something for an individual which
 
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
is poor legislative practice if we had a
 
00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
a better way to define it so that it
 
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%
would covered a bunch of people like for
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
example we say say that if you're in a
 
00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
um an elected position you can retain in
 
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
group two um or a commissioner level
 
00:33:09.549 --> 00:33:09.559 align:start position:0%
position that's um but not for one or
 
00:33:09.559 --> 00:33:10.470 align:start position:0%
position that's um but not for one or
two

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
instructors is so I'm I'm I'm would be
 
00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
against anything to uh move this forward
 
00:33:18.509 --> 00:33:18.519 align:start position:0%
yeah no I appreciate that and the
 
00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:20.200 align:start position:0%
thought has crossed my mind too I think
 
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
my only concern with that is it's only
 
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
for two people but I I don't know that
 
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
the the reach of the bill
 
00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
is is simply the retirement system um it
 
00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
is educating people for the field um so
 
00:33:38.909 --> 00:33:38.919 align:start position:0%
the educator will affect hundreds of
 
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
people those hundreds of people will
 
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
protect millions of people um so that
 
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
was my only my only kind of
 
00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
counterbalancing to that because as a
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
general rule I agree that you know we
 
00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:49.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to legislate for just one or
 
00:33:52.509 --> 00:33:52.519 align:start position:0%
two people uh but because of because it
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
has such wide ranging effects in my
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
opinion I'm just not sure that it ends
 
00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
up only affecting a couple of people it
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
does from the Retirement System point of
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
view I agree with that but um it's
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
concerned on the educational side of it
 
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
that's what the Bill's about the
 
00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.750 align:start position:0%
that's what the Bill's about the
retirement

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.629 align:start position:0%
retirement
system

00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
thoughts to the degree that we bring it
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
forth from the subcommittee we give the
 
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
full committee an opportunity weigh in
 
00:34:26.589 --> 00:34:26.599 align:start position:0%
on Carol's point which is a valid one we
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
and but the year counter that one gets
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
two gets and so forth the multiplier
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
effect is a
 
00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.230 align:start position:0%
effect is a
reality

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
reality
 
00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
so to the degree that we bring it
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
forward and let the full committee weigh
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
in on
 
00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
it see how they
 
00:34:48.669 --> 00:34:48.679 align:start position:0%
feel all right well since we need to get
 
00:34:50.349 --> 00:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
this out of here today so that we can
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
get it to the full committee here's what
 
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do I'm going to make the
 
00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:55.589 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do I'm going to make the
motion

00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:34:58.349 --> 00:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
otpa and if we agree to that I'll just
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
let the chair mop the floor with me in
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
the regular full committee meeting um
 
00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:07.480 align:start position:0%
and I'll I'll I'll take that
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
humility I'll be right there with you on
 
00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:14.079 align:start position:0%
M Patrol so will you second every all
 
00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
otpa and I don't even know how I'll vote
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
for it in the end but um I don't know
 
00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
either but I I I think it's appropriate
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
to have the full committee weigh in um
 
00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
all right we'll go send a 30 and then
 
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
we'll it it it'll be a um a reserved
 
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
otpa um and we'll see how it goes from
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
there all right thank you everybody I'm

00:56:06.589 --> 00:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
know there
 
00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
are like in any any most businesses of
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
any size and or the military whatever
 
00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:14.839 align:start position:0%
you've got salary ranges and so there's
 
00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
one tied to your position okay if people
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
are familiar with that and the
 
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
legislature New Hampshire's um you know
 
00:56:26.109 --> 00:56:26.119 align:start position:0%
has is in charge of what get spent and
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
has authority over what positions are
 
00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
each one of these uh salary ranges but
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
issues come up where there need to be
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
either new positions or adjustments are
 
00:56:37.069 --> 00:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
requested throughout you know the year
 
00:56:38.109 --> 00:56:38.119 align:start position:0%
so you
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
don't um you know there legislature
 
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
can't deal with it in a timely manner so
 
00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
there statute that gives this committee
 
00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:48.200 align:start position:0%
the authority to do
 
00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:49.950 align:start position:0%
the authority to do
temporary

00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
temporary
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
assignments or and then um every couple
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
years they're supposed to supposed to be
 
00:56:57.789 --> 00:56:57.799 align:start position:0%
a bill put in that is everything the
 
00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
committee decided to do over the last
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
two years and then it comes to the uh
 
00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
legislature to confirm it and if you
 
00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:07.240 align:start position:0%
know there's people in the legislature
 
00:57:08.549 --> 00:57:08.559 align:start position:0%
who think the committee didn't do the
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
right thing then you know it can be
 
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
amended um I think usually it ends up
 
00:57:15.309 --> 00:57:15.319 align:start position:0%
just being approved but you know that's
 
00:57:17.309 --> 00:57:17.319 align:start position:0%
that's extra oversight there and the
 
00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
legislature has the authority so what
 
00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:21.720 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
is is it incorporates all of the changes
 
00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
is that the committee did over the last
 
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:30.200 align:start position:0%
couple of years and um and those
 
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
two-letter codes are the
 
00:57:35.109 --> 00:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
salary codes and the bill doesn't
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
actually have um the monetary amounts
 
00:57:41.029 --> 00:57:41.039 align:start position:0%
but if you are interested you can look
 
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
at look I didn't print copies for
 
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
everybody but I've got one here you can
 
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
look up um
 
00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
RSA uh 94
 
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
1-A and it actually lists um what are
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
the salary ranges for each one of those
 
00:57:59.789 --> 00:57:59.799 align:start position:0%
um those positions and if you look in
 
00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:02.200 align:start position:0%
there you'll actually see two sets and
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
that's because when the we did the
 
00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:07.400 align:start position:0%
budget last year there was uh one set
 
00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
that occurred you know started in uh
 
00:58:11.789 --> 00:58:11.799 align:start position:0%
beginning of
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
July and then there's a it's a two-year
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
budget so there's an a further
 
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
adjustment next July and the uh you know
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
if you remember there were raises given
 
00:58:24.549 --> 00:58:24.559 align:start position:0%
in general to all of uh state employees
 
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
and and that was uh split over the two
 
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
years and that resulted in um you know
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
all of these salary ranges being raised
 
00:58:36.589 --> 00:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
by whatever the percentage was and uh
 
00:58:38.309 --> 00:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
and that's why you would
 
00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
find um two in there and that's that's
 
00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:44.200 align:start position:0%
what this is and the process is
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
typically you know the department wants
 
00:58:50.029 --> 00:58:50.039 align:start position:0%
to uh assign some salary range to a new
 
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
employee or they want to change an
 
00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:53.640 align:start position:0%
existing one there is an outside
 
00:58:55.950 --> 00:58:55.960 align:start position:0%
consulting firm that that the state
 
00:58:58.270 --> 00:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
contracts with and so the department
 
00:59:02.029 --> 00:59:02.039 align:start position:0%
will write a uh job description pretty
 
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
detailed and who reports to them and
 
00:59:06.829 --> 00:59:06.839 align:start position:0%
what you know everything about their
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
responsibility and the consultant looks
 
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
at you know other um how that relates to
 
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
other positions in the state and
 
00:59:17.109 --> 00:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and they come up with a
 
00:59:20.789 --> 00:59:20.799 align:start position:0%
recommendation for the um you know the
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
classification or the salary range and
 
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
which might be the Department's going to
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
ask for one the consultant's going to
 
00:59:28.589 --> 00:59:28.599 align:start position:0%
come back with one which might be what
 
00:59:30.349 --> 00:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
the department asked or or you know
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
we've certainly seen it where it's
 
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
different and then the committee will
 
00:59:36.549 --> 00:59:36.559 align:start position:0%
hear from um somebody from the
 
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
department and then have a you know have
 
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
a discussion a vote and decide what to
 
00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:44.200 align:start position:0%
do and more often than not especially if
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
the department and the consultant agree
 
00:59:49.029 --> 00:59:49.039 align:start position:0%
we typically go along but there have
 
00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
been cases where uh where we didn't and
 
00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
especially where there's a differ you
 
00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
know consultant says one that department
 
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
wants another we'll have a discussion
 
00:59:58.990 --> 00:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
and you know the committee proposes
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
whatever it decides whatever it's going
 
01:00:04.029 --> 01:00:04.039 align:start position:0%
to decide and um that's anyway that's
 
01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
what's in the bill is um this thing
 
01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:08.680 align:start position:0%
updated based on any changes over the
 
01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
last two years so be glad to take
 
01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions
 
01:00:17.029 --> 01:00:17.039 align:start position:0%
representative assment thank you madam
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
chair um yeah just uh representative
 
01:00:22.829 --> 01:00:22.839 align:start position:0%
Lucas at the bottom um the salaries as
 
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
they listed do those include benefits or
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
are benefits above and beyond those
 
01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
numbers uh my understanding is that's
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
the uh the salary the salary okay right
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
and then benefits that would be uh in
 
01:00:36.910 --> 01:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
addition okay thank you and that that
 
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
last part there that actually has
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
numbers in it um those are special
 
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
exceptions that have been done so there
 
01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:46.119 align:start position:0%
are some positions that special
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
positions that um are diff difficult to
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
recruit for there's few potential
 
01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:53.000 align:start position:0%
candidates and there are you know
 
01:00:55.029 --> 01:00:55.039 align:start position:0%
specific exemptions kind of outside of
 
01:00:58.270 --> 01:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
what's normal for those and and that the
 
01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
the committee deals with that as
 
01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
groda thank you um representative leus I
 
01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
think in the past Edna has seen a bill
 
01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
similar to this because we have this
 
01:01:16.029 --> 01:01:16.039 align:start position:0%
done every two years so I think that
 
01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
this is something that we look at on a
 
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
regular basis and have approved in the
 
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
past and have have uh voted OTP in the
 
01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
past correct
 
01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:27.640 align:start position:0%
correct I remember um you know while I
 
01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
was on the committee dealing with the
 
01:01:30.789 --> 01:01:30.799 align:start position:0%
same issue from the other side of the
 
01:01:30.799 --> 01:01:32.109 align:start position:0%
same issue from the other side of the
table

01:01:32.109 --> 01:01:32.119 align:start position:0%
table
 
01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
so okay thank you representative gold
 
01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:37.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just wanted to
 
01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
clarify I notice in the positions to be
 
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
removed this state um epidermiology
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
which is line nine on page one and then
 
01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
line 26 on page two
 
01:01:59.950 --> 01:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
interesting the he's the state
 
01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist is being taken out of the
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
normal classification of salary ranges
 
01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
and given a I believe significantly
 
01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:19.559 align:start position:0%
higher salary because of scarcity right
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
and that's one of those exceptions I
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned but yeah they can't be in both
 
01:02:23.359 --> 01:02:26.269 align:start position:0%
mentioned but yeah they can't be in both
so

01:02:26.269 --> 01:02:26.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
that would confuse the bureaucracy any
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Brown uh
 
01:02:32.109 --> 01:02:32.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
U thank you Tony for taking my question
 
01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:37.720 align:start position:0%
representative leus um so all of these
 
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
changes the number of these people have
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
already gotten their pay raise change is
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
that over the past two years would that
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
be accurate that's accurate because we
 
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
have the committee has the authority to
 
01:02:50.829 --> 01:02:50.839 align:start position:0%
temporarily do it I suppose if we you
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
know the legislature didn't like one of
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
them and changed it then uh you know it
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
would go to whatever the legislature
 
01:02:58.670 --> 01:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
wanted it to be yeah just understanding
 
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions thank you
 
01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
very much representative leus
 
01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:16.510 align:start position:0%
very much representative leus
representative

01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:19.640 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair and
 
01:03:22.829 --> 01:03:22.839 align:start position:0%
morning colleagues uh so as a a
 
01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
long-term member of this J joint
 
01:03:28.029 --> 01:03:28.039 align:start position:0%
committee on employee classification I
 
01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
thought I would do a little tutorial
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
here very briefly and just that the way
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
the system works is that the jce is the
 
01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
executive committee on this particular
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh area of state government um but the
 
01:03:47.309 --> 01:03:47.319 align:start position:0%
the way it works is the issue is brought
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
to the attention of The JCC by the
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
usually the commissioner of Das okay we
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
have a staffer that's Bradley uh
 
01:04:01.269 --> 01:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
previously it was Pam smling but Bradley
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
has taken over uh the the function uh
 
01:04:07.870 --> 01:04:07.880 align:start position:0%
it's brought in we we hear from the
 
01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner or assistant commissioner
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh in you know in in our little hearing
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
room down in
 
01:04:20.109 --> 01:04:20.119 align:start position:0%
104 um and we we have that a executive
 
01:04:23.309 --> 01:04:23.319 align:start position:0%
Authority but the the process is that
 
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:26.200 align:start position:0%
the statute then has to be changed to
 
01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
reflect all these changes that we
 
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
authorize that's the function of Edna
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
committee it gets brought to us uh we
 
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
then make
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
our uh it's it's it's kind of a
 
01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
technical committee on our part but it's
 
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
also a technical committee on Edna's
 
01:04:48.190 --> 01:04:48.200 align:start position:0%
part but our our function is to put the
 
01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
thing into the statute then it moves
 
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
along to the finance committee um and
 
01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
they then put it into the budget and so
 
01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
that the JCC is made up of two members
 
01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
from the house from Edna that's
 
01:05:05.470 --> 01:05:05.480 align:start position:0%
representative lein and myself in this
 
01:05:07.829 --> 01:05:07.839 align:start position:0%
particular instance and then one member
 
01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
from the finance committee that's
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
represent representative Tracy Emerich
 
01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
some of you on the Republican side know
 
01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
him well I know him well because he used
 
01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:18.799 align:start position:0%
to sit next to me in the house and he
 
01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
served with me on now on JCC as well and
 
01:05:23.789 --> 01:05:23.799 align:start position:0%
then there are three members of the
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
Senate it will also um come from similar
 
01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
committees so in any case then it goes
 
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
to the finance committee where
 
01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:37.400 align:start position:0%

01:05:43.029 --> 01:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
the budget because it's a financial
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%

01:07:58.950 --> 01:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:01.309 --> 01:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
calendar I certainly don't expect it to
 
01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:07.400 align:start position:0%
floor all
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
right out of executive
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
session and I'm opening the hearing on
 
01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1411 and call the prime
 
01:08:22.189 --> 01:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
com thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:26.679 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um I come
 
01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
before you today uh to offer this bill
 
01:08:32.669 --> 01:08:32.679 align:start position:0%
that it's pretty simple I'm sure that
 
01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:35.799 align:start position:0%
simple is never that simple according to
 
01:08:39.669 --> 01:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
representative leus um but it's saying
 
01:08:42.669 --> 01:08:42.679 align:start position:0%
that the state their contractors and
 
01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
subcontractors must accept cash as a
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
form of payment at all transaction
 
01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
points the reason I bring this forth is
 
01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
because I
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
have constituents and I work with people
 
01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
um that don't even have checking
 
01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:05.470 align:start position:0%
um that don't even have checking
accounts

01:09:05.470 --> 01:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
and they rely on cash to pay most of
 
01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:10.309 align:start position:0%
and they rely on cash to pay most of
their

01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:09:16.349 --> 01:09:16.359 align:start position:0%
bills it's really a hardship for them to
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
go and get a money order which cost them
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
more money or a lot of times if they pay
 
01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
with a debit card um they actually have
 
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
to pay a transaction fee um and it
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
really is a disservice to those on the
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
lower income scale and it actually is
 
01:09:37.749 --> 01:09:37.759 align:start position:0%
harmful because it costs them more than
 
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
the regular citizen that could pay by
 
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
check or through their checking
 
01:09:47.149 --> 01:09:47.159 align:start position:0%
account um and I'm open for any
 
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative P
 
01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:50.829 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative P
representative

01:09:50.829 --> 01:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
Gart just curious an example of somebody
 
01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
to doesn't accept
 
01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.750 align:start position:0%
to doesn't accept
cash

01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
cash
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
um well right now I know in the private
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
sector there are businesses uh that
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
don't accept cash now any any longer um
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
my son just ran into that um but I know
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
that on the Spalding Turnpike you can no
 
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:16.830 --> 01:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
tolls okay represent man py thank you
 
01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking my
 
01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
question is that can we regulate as
 
01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
legislators whether it's government or
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
private entity to accept cash
 
01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
irrespective of who I mean their policy
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative this has nothing to do
 
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
with Private Industry this is only
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
regarding the state uh in their
 
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
contractors and subcontractors that are
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
directly related to work for the state
 
01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:51.229 align:start position:0%
directly related to work for the state
other

01:10:51.229 --> 01:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:53.709 --> 01:10:53.719 align:start position:0%
agencies I have a question represent
 
01:10:56.590 --> 01:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
comt I can understand saying that the
 
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
DMV or the or the Dr must accept cash
 
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
but how do you deal with online
 
01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
purchases because you can't really slip
 
01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
a a a $20 bill into your
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
computer um I didn't really think about
 
01:11:17.709 --> 01:11:17.719 align:start position:0%
the online portion I was just thinking
 
01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
at a transaction point and I guess I was
 
01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
thinking a physical transaction Point
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question Madam
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
chair any representative Dolan and then
 
01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair um thank
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
question U I know in the town that I
 
01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
live in londondary the town will not
 
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
accept cash at the town dump the drop
 
01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
off center anymore and that was
 
01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
because um security of people hand
 
01:11:57.910 --> 01:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
handling cash uh and so forth are there
 
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
any provisions in this bill that would
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
allow the an exception in cases like
 
01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
that um thank you for the question and I
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
haven't put anything in there however um
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
I had learned
 
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday that with the cards that we
 
01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
carry around the chips that anyone can
 
01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
scan them from 18 in away so um you're
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
already in jeopardy
 
01:12:27.070 --> 01:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
and kind of like cash is probably a
 
01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
little bit safer at this moment in time
 
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh depending because no one can scan
 
01:12:35.790 --> 01:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative
 
01:12:38.830 --> 01:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I want to go
 
01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:43.030 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I want to go
back

01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
to the example you brought up this
 
01:12:45.199 --> 01:12:47.070 align:start position:0%
to the example you brought up this
balding

01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:47.080 align:start position:0%
balding
 
01:12:50.110 --> 01:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
turnpike would we have to
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
put individuals back into the toll boost
 
01:12:56.430 --> 01:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
to take cash if this passed and redo
 
01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
that whole section of roadway
 
01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
over uh thank you representative goalie
 
01:13:04.149 --> 01:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
for that question and uh I remember a
 
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
time when you didn't have to have
 
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
individuals necessarily but there was a
 
01:13:11.229 --> 01:13:11.239 align:start position:0%
spot where you could deposit cash into
 
01:13:11.239 --> 01:13:13.910 align:start position:0%
spot where you could deposit cash into
the

01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
tolls okay represent Bailey and then
 
01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:17.750 align:start position:0%
tolls okay represent Bailey and then
maner

01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
maner
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
py okay represent man py um thank you
 
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair again it is the toll is one
 
01:13:32.189 --> 01:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
place but it's also adds to the whole uh
 
01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
slew of uh who's collecting that and so
 
01:13:38.590 --> 01:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
you have to put a Personnel will won't
 
01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
that add cost to the state highway
 
01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
department uh thank you for the question
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
representative um I am not sure about
 
01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
the cost to the state but what I do know
 
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
is by not accepting cash we are harming
 
01:13:59.110 --> 01:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
those that rely on it and they're the
 
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
people that I am here to
 
01:14:04.030 --> 01:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
represent thank you representative shuid
 
01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
and then groda thank you madam chair um
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
I'm particularly concerned about um
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
including contractors and subcontractors
 
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
who work for the state however uh that
 
01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
may not be their sole business uh they
 
01:14:23.470 --> 01:14:23.480 align:start position:0%
have private Enterprise aside from from
 
01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
when they're doing jobs for the state um
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
this would probably require them to
 
01:14:32.830 --> 01:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
change their whole um business operation
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
if they only accept credit or cards as a
 
01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
normal business is that not true uh
 
01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative shuid this is
 
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
only for payments that is administered
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
if they're doing work for a commissioner
 
01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
or collected by a department it has
 
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with any of their other
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
business I understand what you're saying
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
um but I can you know I see what's
 
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
happening in the Private
 
01:15:05.950 --> 01:15:05.960 align:start position:0%
Industry and I see that we're going that
 
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
way in the government and
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
I work in manufacturing and I see people
 
01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
struggling and when they have to incur a
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
fee or they have to go and get a money
 
01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
order and pay additional amounts of
 
01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
money where they're already struggling
 
01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
cash is their best option for them to
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
pay um they don't have bank accounts
 
01:15:35.310 --> 01:15:35.320 align:start position:0%
they don't have checking accounts I'm
 
01:15:36.629 --> 01:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
01:15:39.070 --> 01:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
reality repres
 
01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
Vera thank you representative K I do
 
01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
understand that the situation that
 
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
you're trying to solve however I'm
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
wondering if this description is Broad
 
01:15:54.830 --> 01:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
too broad because because we have no
 
01:15:57.950 --> 01:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
limit so if somebody has I I'm going to
 
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
use an example that somebody has a bill
 
01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:01.470 align:start position:0%
use an example that somebody has a bill
for

01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
$220,000 and they hand over $20,000 in
 
01:16:07.470 --> 01:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
cash to somebody that's not very safe
 
01:16:11.149 --> 01:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
either so it would you be amable to some
 
01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
sort of cash limit if it's truly for
 
01:16:15.550 --> 01:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
people who don't have checking accounts
 
01:16:17.070 --> 01:16:17.080 align:start position:0%
who are of meager
 
01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
means can we put some sort of limit on
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
here so that we don't open up
 
01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
ourselves to problems in another area
 
01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for the
 
01:16:32.590 --> 01:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
question um yes I mean this bill is now
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
in the committee's hands and um so thank
 
01:16:39.550 --> 01:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
you for the question okay okay
 
01:16:42.430 --> 01:16:42.440 align:start position:0%
representative goalie just one more when
 
01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
we're talking
 
01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:48.280 align:start position:0%
about um including contractors and
 
01:16:52.350 --> 01:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
whatnot hired through a department to do
 
01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
their business and
 
01:16:57.390 --> 01:16:57.400 align:start position:0%
one of the instances I'm thinking of is
 
01:16:59.550 --> 01:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
fishing game
 
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
contracts with somebody for their
 
01:17:03.709 --> 01:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
licensing and their services set up
 
01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
fees I don't know how that contractor
 
01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
would like the chair explained
 
01:17:15.550 --> 01:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
questioned how they would get the cash
 
01:17:17.950 --> 01:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
from an individual for an online
 
01:17:20.229 --> 01:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
purchase and I'm just having that
 
01:17:22.110 --> 01:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
contractor in there is setting up some
 
01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
of the Departments that are already in a
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
contract not a short-term contract you
 
01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
know some could be four or five year
 
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
contracts with
 
01:17:33.229 --> 01:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
these how we would go about doing that
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
the way this bill is worded uh thank you
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative goalie and like I had
 
01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
said before I wasn't really thinking of
 
01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
online transactions so maybe there could
 
01:17:44.629 --> 01:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
be an exclusion for anything that's
 
01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
online but I'm talking physical
 
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
transaction points was what was my
 
01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
intent thank you other questions
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative Brown uh thank you madam
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
chair I I don't know if you had an
 
01:18:01.709 --> 01:18:01.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at the fiscal
 
01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
note and if you have you might be the
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
wrong person to ask because fcll wrote
 
01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
this do you do you understand what that
 
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
last paragraph means lastly while there
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
might be an increase in Revenue due to
 
01:18:17.790 --> 01:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
the mandated acceptance of cash it may
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
be partially offset by the absence of
 
01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
fees or fines imposed on complete cash
 
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.110 align:start position:0%
fees or fines imposed on complete cash
payments

01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
payments
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh so thank you representative Brown for
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
that question and yes I did read that um
 
01:18:33.669 --> 01:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
the thing is is you're already being
 
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
posed uh
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
fees uh if you pay your property taxes
 
01:18:42.270 --> 01:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
or your car online through a uh credit
 
01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
card so I don't understand um right now
 
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's any fees or fines
 
01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
for paying cash but I put that in just
 
01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
in case because we are seeing that um
 
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
you know like I said these people have a
 
01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
hard time just with the
 
01:19:04.510 --> 01:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
uh so followup followup so my apologies
 
01:19:07.950 --> 01:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
for maybe being dense everyone but so
 
01:19:09.229 --> 01:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
what we're saying is they may be
 
01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
increase in state revenues because the
 
01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
state will not be paying fees for
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
electronic transactions correct thank
 
01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:21.520 align:start position:0%

Schmidt thank you Madam
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
chair so it was already referenced uh
 
01:19:31.229 --> 01:19:31.239 align:start position:0%
but the the reality is in those areas
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
where we have turnpikes and where we
 
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
have U you know now the easy paths I I I
 
01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
live right on I live in Dober and I pass
 
01:19:43.870 --> 01:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
to the Spalding turnpikes on a constant
 
01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
basis um there there are no toos anymore
 
01:19:51.790 --> 01:19:51.800 align:start position:0%
all three cities uh that that have they
 
01:19:54.910 --> 01:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
part of of the sping Turnpike it's just
 
01:19:59.629 --> 01:19:59.639 align:start position:0%
the automatic you go through uh and so
 
01:20:01.110 --> 01:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
people who live in those areas are going
 
01:20:04.229 --> 01:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
to be going through those things or not
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
every day uh and so having to pay you
 
01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
know in cash that that that's just not
 
01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
going to work so we're going to have to
 
01:20:13.709 --> 01:20:13.719 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:20:16.990 --> 01:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
that other questions may I respond yes
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
please thank you madam chair and and
 
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for bringing up
 
01:20:23.870 --> 01:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
that point however
 
01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if you understand that easy
 
01:20:30.149 --> 01:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
pass um actually hurts the same people
 
01:20:32.629 --> 01:20:32.639 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to help here because you're
 
01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
required to keep at least $20 on an Easy
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
Pass Easy Pass doesn't pay interest on
 
01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:39.550 align:start position:0%
Pass Easy Pass doesn't pay interest on
your

01:20:39.550 --> 01:20:39.560 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
money you get no benefits and then when
 
01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
these people do go through the toll if
 
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
they can't afford to have an Easy Pass
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
they charge an additional fee of $150 to
 
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
have that pay paper uh mail to them so
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
people I don't disagree with the
 
01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
represent I just said recognize also
 
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
that that it's not going to be would be
 
01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
unsafe for people who are everybody else
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
is going through those those tolls
 
01:21:19.149 --> 01:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
taking devices at 55 or miles an hour
 
01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
and having somebody veering off to pay
 
01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:24.639 align:start position:0%
their their toll in cash that's just not
 
01:21:26.430 --> 01:21:26.440 align:start position:0%
gonna that's not safe it's not going to
 
01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
work so I'm just saying we're going to
 
01:21:32.590 --> 01:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
have to see how we handle that thank
 
01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
you representative Brown uh thank you
 
01:21:38.669 --> 01:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
madam chair so to follow up on that do
 
01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:41.239 align:start position:0%
you know what when when you get the
 
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
letter that says you've gone through the
 
01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
Easy Pass you owe x amount of dollars is
 
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
there a place where you can walk to or
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:51.639 --> 01:21:54.590 align:start position:0%
 
cash

01:21:54.590 --> 01:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
cash
 
01:21:56.590 --> 01:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question there are
 
01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
Easy Pass places uh I believe one is on
 
01:22:03.629 --> 01:22:03.639 align:start position:0%
off the hooks at uh exit um where they
 
01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
have there but I can tell you that I
 
01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
have had more complaints about people
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
where their Easy Pass H or transpond has
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
not been working or that they're getting
 
01:22:14.750 --> 01:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
bills that aren't even related to a
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
own you're welcome okay other
 
01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative gold thank thank you
 
01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
question um as a homesteader who's lived
 
01:22:33.149 --> 01:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
very meally I've frequently encountered
 
01:22:35.149 --> 01:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
the exact circumstance you're talking
 
01:22:38.590 --> 01:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
about here so I just wanted to make sure
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
that you would be ad meable to um a
 
01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
committee working on some amendment that
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
would put some safeguards in place but
 
01:22:50.110 --> 01:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
uh I think this is a really important
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
bill that there are more and more people
 
01:22:54.430 --> 01:22:54.440 align:start position:0%
that are low income that are living
 
01:22:58.430 --> 01:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
modestly that do not have the funds to
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
um to pay the fines to begin with or
 
01:23:03.790 --> 01:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
whatever the fee is or anything I I had
 
01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
an Easy Pass when you get below that
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
$20 limit I changed cards and I didn't
 
01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
give them my new number they just take
 
01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:14.719 align:start position:0%
your money and shut your easy pass off
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
so it is a system designed to harm the
 
01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
least able to pay in our um in our
 
01:23:25.629 --> 01:23:25.639 align:start position:0%
current situation so uh thank you and
 
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to to accept some
 
01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
of these amendments thank you
 
01:23:31.709 --> 01:23:31.719 align:start position:0%
representative for the question and yes
 
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%

that

01:35:53.149 --> 01:35:53.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:56.350 --> 01:35:56.360 align:start position:0%
wow this is interesting because have you
 
01:36:14.109 --> 01:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:14.119 --> 01:36:16.669 align:start position:0%
 
supporting

01:36:16.669 --> 01:36:16.679 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:50.270 align:start position:0%
 
want

01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:20.189 align:start position:0%
 
that's

01:37:20.189 --> 01:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:20.199 --> 01:37:35.030 align:start position:0%
 
ridiculous

01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
it being 10:45 I would like to open the
 
01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
public hearing on hb1
 
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
1271 and call the uh esteemed and
 
01:37:49.870 --> 01:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:52.669 --> 01:37:52.679 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you thank you Mr
 
01:37:55.510 --> 01:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
chair good morning committee I'm Carol
 
01:37:58.950 --> 01:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
Maguire representing marac District 27
 
01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
which is the towns of Allenstown
 
01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
Dunbarton Epsom and hookit and House
 
01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:05.950 align:start position:0%
Dunbarton Epsom and hookit and House
Bill

01:38:05.950 --> 01:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
1271 essentially converts a number of
 
01:38:12.750 --> 01:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
the professional licensing boards into
 
01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:14.790 align:start position:0%
the professional licensing boards into
advisory

01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
advisory
 
01:38:19.350 --> 01:38:19.360 align:start position:0%
boards these are all boards that have a
 
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
small number of licensees
 
01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:24.229 align:start position:0%
small number of licensees
so

01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:26.669 --> 01:38:26.679 align:start position:0%
that those are the boards that have
 
01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:28.679 align:start position:0%
trouble finding people to serve on the
 
01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
boards they have trouble attaining a
 
01:38:33.709 --> 01:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
quorum even if they do have a quorum
 
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
they meet infrequently so they can't
 
01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
respond in any timely manner to any
 
01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
issues and if there are issues with uh
 
01:38:48.189 --> 01:38:48.199 align:start position:0%
complaint or that needs to be
 
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
investigated it's a small state we all
 
01:38:52.189 --> 01:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
know each other
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
you would end up with a significant
 
01:38:56.990 --> 01:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
portion of the board having to recuse
 
01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
themselves in any significant
 
01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:00.910 align:start position:0%
themselves in any significant
investigation

01:39:00.910 --> 01:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
01:39:05.149 --> 01:39:05.159 align:start position:0%
so for these reasons these boards are
 
01:39:08.350 --> 01:39:08.360 align:start position:0%
more appropriate for the advisory
 
01:39:12.589 --> 01:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
model instead of being responsible for
 
01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
actually generating the rules they would
 
01:39:18.109 --> 01:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
review them for technical accuracy and
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
compliance with the statute and with the
 
01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
professional guidelines that they
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
know they would serve as advisors to the
 
01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
executive director and the oplc to make
 
01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
01:39:38.350 --> 01:39:38.360 align:start position:0%
the um the the profession is properly
 
01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:40.870 align:start position:0%
the um the the profession is properly
managed

01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
managed
 
01:39:45.149 --> 01:39:45.159 align:start position:0%
and it it's simpler and easier for these
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
small boards with a small number of
 
01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
professionals to work as an Advisory
 
01:39:51.589 --> 01:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
Board rather than a full regul atory
 
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
board and that's why I agreed to to
 
01:39:56.189 --> 01:39:56.199 align:start position:0%
submit this
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
legislation and I will mention that
 
01:40:01.229 --> 01:40:01.239 align:start position:0%
section n on the board of registration
 
01:40:04.149 --> 01:40:04.159 align:start position:0%
of medical technicians is already
 
01:40:07.870 --> 01:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
covered in House Bill 1410 so it should
 
01:40:10.030 --> 01:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
probably be eliminated from this
 
01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
bill I will answer whatever questions I
 
01:40:15.070 --> 01:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
have but I believe the executive
 
01:40:17.830 --> 01:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
director is here for more details thank
 
01:40:19.149 --> 01:40:19.159 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony any
 
01:40:21.189 --> 01:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative leas
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative black as I excuse me
 
01:40:28.270 --> 01:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
you're co-p sorry sorry good
 
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
point representative man did you have a
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
question I'm
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
debating thank you uh Mr chair thank you
 
01:40:39.589 --> 01:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
for taking my question is this in line
 
01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
with what uh the committee did last year
 
01:40:45.790 --> 01:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
kind of moving the process of Licensing
 
01:40:50.589 --> 01:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
toc's responsibility and the board as a
 
01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh if
 
01:40:54.629 --> 01:40:54.639 align:start position:0%
it relies on the oplc having the
 
01:40:57.510 --> 01:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility for licensing but it is
 
01:40:59.870 --> 01:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
totally independent of that I mean once
 
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
that has been accomplished whether it's
 
01:41:04.990 --> 01:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
an Advisory board or a full board is a
 
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.910 align:start position:0%
an Advisory board or a full board is a
different

01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:10.830 --> 01:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
decision any other questions seeing none
 
01:41:12.629 --> 01:41:12.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
01:41:15.109 --> 01:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
much uh Jody Bell from the New Hampshire
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:37.430 align:start position:0%
 
Association

01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:39.920 align:start position:0%

01:41:48.629 --> 01:41:48.639 align:start position:0%
information with as this committee goes
 
01:41:51.709 --> 01:41:51.719 align:start position:0%
forward making decisions regarding HB
 
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
1271 may remember I was here last week
 
01:41:58.589 --> 01:41:58.599 align:start position:0%
rep regarding HB 1676 FN my name is jod
 
01:42:00.750 --> 01:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
Bell I'm a licensed acupuncturist here
 
01:42:02.589 --> 01:42:02.599 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I serve on the board of
 
01:42:06.030 --> 01:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
acupuncture licensing since 2020 but I'm
 
01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
here today as a representative for our
 
01:42:11.350 --> 01:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
state professional association the New
 
01:42:13.589 --> 01:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire acupuncture and Asian medicine
 
01:42:17.070 --> 01:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
Association we called nahama I wish to
 
01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
present our the letter to the committee
 
01:42:21.790 --> 01:42:21.800 align:start position:0%
demonstrating our association stand you
 
01:42:23.950 --> 01:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
should all have a copy of that letter
 
01:42:27.229 --> 01:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
near or around you so in the interest of
 
01:42:29.629 --> 01:42:29.639 align:start position:0%
time I won't read every single word of
 
01:42:31.229 --> 01:42:31.239 align:start position:0%
that letter but I'd like to call your
 
01:42:36.430 --> 01:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:40.669 --> 01:42:40.679 align:start position:0%
that so primarily hb1 1271 does not
 
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
maintain that The Advisory Board as an
 
01:42:45.189 --> 01:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
active regulatory body with complete
 
01:42:48.270 --> 01:42:48.280 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over its profession so the
 
01:42:51.149 --> 01:42:51.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire acupuncture asan medicine
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
Association must oppose HB
 
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
1271 in addition acupuncture is the only
 
01:42:59.910 --> 01:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
diagnostic healthc care profession
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
proposed for change in
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
hp71 once again the members of the
 
01:43:06.709 --> 01:43:06.719 align:start position:0%
general court wish to group us with
 
01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:08.719 align:start position:0%
occupations that don't require a level
 
01:43:11.229 --> 01:43:11.239 align:start position:0%
of Education or training or a level of
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
liability to practice do not look at our
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
number of licenses when determining this
 
01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
action look at the possible harm to the
 
01:43:20.229 --> 01:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
public health when mistakes are made in
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
implementing a new system acupuncture
 
01:43:26.430 --> 01:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
requires a 3,000 hour master's degree
 
01:43:28.830 --> 01:43:28.840 align:start position:0%
which is also people can do an advanced
 
01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
practice to a doctorate level which
 
01:43:33.189 --> 01:43:33.199 align:start position:0%
includes no less than 900 hours of
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
clinical training three National
 
01:43:39.870 --> 01:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
standardized board exams one of which is
 
01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
biomedicine and a separate National
 
01:43:43.910 --> 01:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
standardized clean needle technique
 
01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
certification assuring Public Safety
 
01:43:48.830 --> 01:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
members of the general court continue to
 
01:43:50.990 --> 01:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
draft bills to set acupuncture up apart
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
from the other diagnostic Health
 
01:43:54.990 --> 01:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
Professions in the state even the
 
01:43:57.629 --> 01:43:57.639 align:start position:0%
attempt in doing so in this bill shows a
 
01:43:59.790 --> 01:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
lack of understanding of our profession
 
01:44:02.550 --> 01:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
education and license what seems to be a
 
01:44:04.589 --> 01:44:04.599 align:start position:0%
subtle change of merely exchanging the
 
01:44:07.270 --> 01:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
word executive and director for the word
 
01:44:11.870 --> 01:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
board in the RSA 328g is not subtle it
 
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
strips away a vital supervisory role and
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
Authority the change allows for a
 
01:44:18.629 --> 01:44:18.639 align:start position:0%
consultation but does not require a
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
consensus or agreement between the
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
executive director and the advisory the
 
01:44:25.709 --> 01:44:25.719 align:start position:0%
executive director a single person not
 
01:44:28.109 --> 01:44:28.119 align:start position:0%
the body of professions has the ultimate
 
01:44:30.149 --> 01:44:30.159 align:start position:0%
rule hb1
 
01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
1271 moves professional boards to
 
01:44:34.750 --> 01:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
advisory and the executive director has
 
01:44:37.709 --> 01:44:37.719 align:start position:0%
the sole supervision taking over a
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
growing number of professions and Prof
 
01:44:42.189 --> 01:44:42.199 align:start position:0%
and professionals the possibility of
 
01:44:44.669 --> 01:44:44.679 align:start position:0%
costly mistake Rises how can this be in
 
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
the interest of the
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
public we also wish to point out that if
 
01:44:51.870 --> 01:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
this passes the sole responsibility of
 
01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
the profession of acupuncture would be
 
01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
ruled by a body excuse me has repeatedly
 
01:44:58.910 --> 01:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
shown that it does not understand the
 
01:45:01.470 --> 01:45:01.480 align:start position:0%
profession the bill would give the
 
01:45:03.910 --> 01:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
executive director the ability to
 
01:45:05.830 --> 01:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
consult The Advisory before a rule is
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
added or change still it only requires
 
01:45:10.510 --> 01:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
it as an option not a mandate of
 
01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
Consulting The Advisory when holding the
 
01:45:15.910 --> 01:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
license e to the rules of the RSA 328
 
01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
acupuncture is a diagnostic healthc care
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
profession practiced independently
 
01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
similar to Medical Doctors chiropractors
 
01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
doctors of naturopathic medicine and
 
01:45:27.990 --> 01:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
should be treated as such therefore
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
since hb1 1271 does not maintain that
 
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
The Advisory Board as an active
 
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
regulatory body with complete
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over its profession and hb1
 
01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
1271 does not keep acupuncture and
 
01:45:42.589 --> 01:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
integral Health Care profession alongsid
 
01:45:45.390 --> 01:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
other independent diagnostic practices
 
01:45:49.149 --> 01:45:49.159 align:start position:0%
and hb1 1271 does not put Public Safety
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
First nama respectfully request this
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
body to amend H
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
b1271 by excluding acupuncture
 
01:46:01.950 --> 01:46:01.960 align:start position:0%
entirely also um with regard
 
01:46:05.709 --> 01:46:05.719 align:start position:0%
to uh representative Maguire's comments
 
01:46:08.990 --> 01:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh trouble finding people to serve uh
 
01:46:11.550 --> 01:46:11.560 align:start position:0%
for our board that has not been an issue
 
01:46:14.109 --> 01:46:14.119 align:start position:0%
also finding a quorum the only time
 
01:46:17.310 --> 01:46:17.320 align:start position:0%
that's been an issue is when we've had
 
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
emergency meetings right before a
 
01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:21.589 align:start position:0%
emergency meetings right before a
holiday

01:46:21.589 --> 01:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
holiday
 
01:46:24.430 --> 01:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
and then the part about having to recuse
 
01:46:26.550 --> 01:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
ourselves because we know who's coming
 
01:46:29.430 --> 01:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
under Fire that's not been an issue for
 
01:46:32.830 --> 01:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
us either so um that's one reason those
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
are several reasons why we feel
 
01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
acupuncture should not be part of
 
01:46:40.109 --> 01:46:40.119 align:start position:0%
1271 and I
 
01:46:43.229 --> 01:46:43.239 align:start position:0%
also we have consulted our national
 
01:46:45.870 --> 01:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
board and uh we have letters of
 
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
testimony from them which I only made 10
 
01:46:51.189 --> 01:46:51.199 align:start position:0%
copies so I need to submit that to you
 
01:46:53.470 --> 01:46:53.480 align:start position:0%
to you all for your consideration so
 
01:46:55.870 --> 01:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
they really reiterate what we have put
 
01:46:58.149 --> 01:46:58.159 align:start position:0%
in our letter but just having it come
 
01:46:59.870 --> 01:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
from the national board that has
 
01:47:03.669 --> 01:47:03.679 align:start position:0%
oversight on 46 other states would be
 
01:47:05.550 --> 01:47:05.560 align:start position:0%
significant I believe for your
 
01:47:08.990 --> 01:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
decision-making process I'm open to any
 
01:47:10.629 --> 01:47:10.639 align:start position:0%
questions great thank you for your
 
01:47:11.950 --> 01:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
testimony are there any questions
 
01:47:14.229 --> 01:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
representative man depy thank you Mr
 
01:47:17.229 --> 01:47:17.239 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
01:47:21.790 --> 01:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
um how would this imp impact your
 
01:47:25.030 --> 01:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
professional practice in the
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
state or would it
 
01:47:31.990 --> 01:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
not having the acupuncture licensing
 
01:47:35.790 --> 01:47:35.800 align:start position:0%
board go to an advisory status we feel
 
01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
that it will we'll lose the
 
01:47:43.030 --> 01:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
maintaining vigilance over our
 
01:47:45.390 --> 01:47:45.400 align:start position:0%
profession and then the fact that an
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board is an option then when
 
01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
they do want to consult us it's it's
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
going to be like being on call and how
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
many people can stop their practices I
 
01:47:58.550 --> 01:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
mean anyone who's been here myself
 
01:48:01.189 --> 01:48:01.199 align:start position:0%
included we rearrange everything to
 
01:48:04.830 --> 01:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
accommodate what the legislature and the
 
01:48:07.669 --> 01:48:07.679 align:start position:0%
board wants to do to us so we're sort
 
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
of it would be an unfortunate strategy
 
01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
for us because it would catch us off
 
01:48:16.149 --> 01:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
guard and create
 
01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
undo disruptions to Patient
 
01:48:19.239 --> 01:48:21.709 align:start position:0%
undo disruptions to Patient
Care

01:48:21.709 --> 01:48:21.719 align:start position:0%
Care
 
01:48:23.550 --> 01:48:23.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the
 
01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you for your
 
01:48:28.430 --> 01:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
testimony all right so these um extra
 
01:48:30.310 --> 01:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
copies I have I can yeah you can pass
 
01:48:32.270 --> 01:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
them around we at least one for the file
 
01:48:39.950 --> 01:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:49.199 --> 01:48:52.510 align:start position:0%
 
Kerwin

01:48:52.510 --> 01:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:54.030 --> 01:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure you just said man Vicki
 
01:48:56.950 --> 01:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
Irwin yes okay very good hi thank you
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
for your time thank you for uh allowing
 
01:49:01.510 --> 01:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
me to speak today my name is Vicki Irwin
 
01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
I'm a licensed acupuncturist with a
 
01:49:04.589 --> 01:49:04.599 align:start position:0%
private practice in Nashville New
 
01:49:08.350 --> 01:49:08.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um while I am here as only an
 
01:49:10.589 --> 01:49:10.599 align:start position:0%
individual I have previously served for
 
01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:12.719 align:start position:0%
six years on the State Association for
 
01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
acupunctur and I am currently on the
 
01:49:17.669 --> 01:49:17.679 align:start position:0%
licensing board uh but I am here to
 
01:49:20.669 --> 01:49:20.679 align:start position:0%
testify against this bill um of course
 
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit biased towards the
 
01:49:24.270 --> 01:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
acupuncture specific pieces of the bill
 
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
but I did read it in its entirety um and
 
01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
I do have a few concerns the executive
 
01:49:30.990 --> 01:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
director is simply a single person with
 
01:49:33.990 --> 01:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
only a few exceptions um this bill did
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
not say executive director or their AE
 
01:49:38.070 --> 01:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
or oplc as an
 
01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
organization if the intent is to speed
 
01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
up licensing Pro and the process of
 
01:49:45.550 --> 01:49:45.560 align:start position:0%
applications I do wonder what happens
 
01:49:47.310 --> 01:49:47.320 align:start position:0%
when Lindsay is out what if she's on a
 
01:49:49.589 --> 01:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
medical leave moves on to another job or
 
01:49:49.599 --> 01:49:50.709 align:start position:0%
medical leave moves on to another job or
retires

01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
retires
 
01:49:52.350 --> 01:49:52.360 align:start position:0%
it would seem a nearly insurmountable
 
01:49:54.229 --> 01:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
task to find another single person who's
 
01:49:56.350 --> 01:49:56.360 align:start position:0%
willing to take on the responsibility
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
the entire responsibility of nine
 
01:50:01.229 --> 01:50:01.239 align:start position:0%
separate wildly unrelated boards as well
 
01:50:04.270 --> 01:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
as manage an organization that handles
 
01:50:07.149 --> 01:50:07.159 align:start position:0%
many many more I'm also concerned that
 
01:50:08.709 --> 01:50:08.719 align:start position:0%
there's no clear indication of when the
 
01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
advisory boards must be consulted there
 
01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
appears to be this appears to be left to
 
01:50:15.709 --> 01:50:15.719 align:start position:0%
the discretion of a single person who
 
01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
likely knows very little about many of
 
01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
these professions the lack of oversight
 
01:50:22.430 --> 01:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
and checks and balances is concerning to
 
01:50:25.229 --> 01:50:25.239 align:start position:0%
me as someone who has served on a New
 
01:50:27.030 --> 01:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire licensing boorn I made it my
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
business to learn the ropes I read the
 
01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
statutes I read the rules I've tried to
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
learn the order of operations when a
 
01:50:34.669 --> 01:50:34.679 align:start position:0%
change needs to happen even with
 
01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
quarterly plus meetings I find it a
 
01:50:38.830 --> 01:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
difficult concept and I can only imagine
 
01:50:40.589 --> 01:50:40.599 align:start position:0%
the confusion that an Advisory Board
 
01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
that's only called now and then would
 
01:50:46.910 --> 01:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
face we do understand that uh the
 
01:50:49.149 --> 01:50:49.159 align:start position:0%
licensing process needs to speed up and
 
01:50:50.830 --> 01:50:50.840 align:start position:0%
we have as an acupuncture licensing
 
01:50:52.950 --> 01:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
board have understood that in the past
 
01:50:54.870 --> 01:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
we have attempted to form a subcommittee
 
01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
to review licenses that were received
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
between our meetings and to be ratified
 
01:51:01.149 --> 01:51:01.159 align:start position:0%
at the next meeting but every time there
 
01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
was a staff turn over the subcommittee
 
01:51:05.310 --> 01:51:05.320 align:start position:0%
idea was lost and had to be
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
reintroduced we've also put together a
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
clear and easy to understand Matrix that
 
01:51:11.910 --> 01:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
oplc could use to approve very
 
01:51:14.470 --> 01:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
straightforward license applications but
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
again with staff turnover that document
 
01:51:18.910 --> 01:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
was lost the same seems to be true for
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
work we did in helping to determine
 
01:51:22.870 --> 01:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
states that qualify for
 
01:51:25.310 --> 01:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
reciprocity despite this and despite the
 
01:51:26.830 --> 01:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
absence of actual rules defining
 
01:51:29.069 --> 01:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
reciprocity in place yet applications
 
01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
are being approved without our
 
01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:32.870 align:start position:0%
are being approved without our
review

01:51:32.870 --> 01:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
review
 
01:51:35.109 --> 01:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
um while I do think that some things
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
need to change and be streamlined and
 
01:51:39.069 --> 01:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
sped up in their process I do think that
 
01:51:41.229 --> 01:51:41.239 align:start position:0%
this particular bill is shortsighted and
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
should not pass as written and with that
 
01:51:46.109 --> 01:51:46.119 align:start position:0%
I thank you for your time and I'd be
 
01:51:47.629 --> 01:51:47.639 align:start position:0%

all thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:52:37.470 --> 01:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Ned Gordon and I'm
 
01:52:39.910 --> 01:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
a resident of Bristol and I here
 
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
represent my myself today but I also
 
01:52:44.510 --> 01:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
represent the guardian that lightam
 
01:52:47.350 --> 01:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
board Guardian the lium
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
board uh was established about 25 years
 
01:52:55.109 --> 01:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
ago uh prior to its establishment it uh
 
01:52:58.669 --> 01:52:58.679 align:start position:0%
we had Guardian at Liams who uh who
 
01:53:00.750 --> 01:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
perform a very important function in the
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
State uh they are appointed by the court
 
01:53:06.669 --> 01:53:06.679 align:start position:0%
basically to represent the interests of
 
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
children they have a huge influence on
 
01:53:12.990 --> 01:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
families and the decisions that the
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
court makes with regard to uh parenting
 
01:53:22.669 --> 01:53:22.679 align:start position:0%
time uh and other issues for example if
 
01:53:28.149 --> 01:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
you have a dad who says J mom has a
 
01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
boyfriend and they're involved in
 
01:53:31.350 --> 01:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and I don't think
 
01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
Johnny should live there and you have um
 
01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:40.719 align:start position:0%
uh uh mom who says Dad is selling drugs
 
01:53:42.149 --> 01:53:42.159 align:start position:0%
out of the house I don't think Johnny
 
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
should live there a judge can't go out
 
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
and uh go out and investigate the
 
01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
household to figure out what's going
 
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
going on somebody has to be appointed to
 
01:53:54.990 --> 01:53:55.000 align:start position:0%
do that and in this particular case a
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
guardian at Liam is appointed by the
 
01:53:58.950 --> 01:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
court to do that go out do an
 
01:54:01.109 --> 01:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
investigation and make a recommendation
 
01:54:02.910 --> 01:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
as to what is in the child's best
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
interest and that's important function
 
01:54:07.470 --> 01:54:07.480 align:start position:0%
it's a hugely important function for the
 
01:54:10.750 --> 01:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
courts prior to 25 years ago the court
 
01:54:12.430 --> 01:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
was appointing guardian of items who
 
01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:13.310 align:start position:0%
was appointing guardian of items who
were

01:54:13.310 --> 01:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:54:16.990 --> 01:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
completely untrained could be
 
01:54:19.229 --> 01:54:19.239 align:start position:0%
unqualified there were no standards for
 
01:54:21.589 --> 01:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
Guardians at lium and there was no
 
01:54:24.149 --> 01:54:24.159 align:start position:0%
discipline for Guardian at lims who
 
01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
engaged in
 
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
misconduct the guardian at Lim board was
 
01:54:31.390 --> 01:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
established standards were put in place
 
01:54:33.589 --> 01:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
training has been provided there are
 
01:54:35.790 --> 01:54:35.800 align:start position:0%
minimum qualifications to become a
 
01:54:38.189 --> 01:54:38.199 align:start position:0%
guardian at lium and continuing
 
01:54:40.629 --> 01:54:40.639 align:start position:0%
qualifications education for Guardian at
 
01:54:42.830 --> 01:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
lims over time that's all been done by
 
01:54:45.149 --> 01:54:45.159 align:start position:0%
the guardian at Li
 
01:54:48.030 --> 01:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
board so now we have a bill before us
 
01:54:49.229 --> 01:54:49.239 align:start position:0%
that says we was want to make the
 
01:54:51.470 --> 01:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
guardian the lium board and Advisory
 
01:54:54.510 --> 01:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
Board it has seven members currently
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
they're all in one way or another
 
01:55:00.510 --> 01:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
involved in the guardian the lium
 
01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
process there uh with the exception of
 
01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
two Representatives one a senator and
 
01:55:09.629 --> 01:55:09.639 align:start position:0%
one a House member who participate on
 
01:55:09.639 --> 01:55:11.030 align:start position:0%
one a House member who participate on
the

01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
board I read the bill I saw in the bill
 
01:55:17.189 --> 01:55:17.199 align:start position:0%
basically the purpose was to reduce
 
01:55:21.629 --> 01:55:21.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:25.270 --> 01:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
supervision I wonder uh if anybody did
 
01:55:27.629 --> 01:55:27.639 align:start position:0%
any study to find out if there was a
 
01:55:30.910 --> 01:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
need to reduce Workforce barriers I
 
01:55:32.790 --> 01:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
don't believe the committee has ever
 
01:55:34.830 --> 01:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
received a report from anyone saying
 
01:55:37.149 --> 01:55:37.159 align:start position:0%
that there are Workforce unreasonable
 
01:55:39.470 --> 01:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
Workforce barriers other than the
 
01:55:41.229 --> 01:55:41.239 align:start position:0%
minimum requirements that are required
 
01:55:42.790 --> 01:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
to become a guardian that
 
01:55:46.310 --> 01:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
lium and to provide State supervision I
 
01:55:47.669 --> 01:55:47.679 align:start position:0%
think the guardian of the lien board has
 
01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
done a good job of that and uh just at
 
01:55:52.270 --> 01:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
our last meeting we had a meeting last
 
01:55:53.910 --> 01:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
Friday at the guardian lighting board we
 
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
meet it each month uh we were given a
 
01:56:00.310 --> 01:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
sheet of uh fairly
 
01:56:02.830 --> 01:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
recently uh in the your legislation
 
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
which was passed in the last session it
 
01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
was agreed that the guardian the
 
01:56:09.790 --> 01:56:09.800 align:start position:0%
lightting board would now uh review the
 
01:56:11.430 --> 01:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
do the initial review of complaints and
 
01:56:12.270 --> 01:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
do an
 
01:56:14.149 --> 01:56:14.159 align:start position:0%
investigation and we thought that was a
 
01:56:16.270 --> 01:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
great idea because they have the
 
01:56:19.990 --> 01:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
resources to do that on last Friday we
 
01:56:23.229 --> 01:56:23.239 align:start position:0%
got a thing showing that currently there
 
01:56:26.350 --> 01:56:26.360 align:start position:0%
are 20 complaints that say they just
 
01:56:29.069 --> 01:56:29.079 align:start position:0%
been intake just since
 
01:56:31.149 --> 01:56:31.159 align:start position:0%
intake which means they haven't been
 
01:56:34.790 --> 01:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
acted on going back to last February
 
01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
almost a year
 
01:56:39.709 --> 01:56:39.719 align:start position:0%
ago and this is this is who we want we
 
01:56:43.310 --> 01:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
want oplc now to take over
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
managing the guarding the lighten
 
01:56:50.350 --> 01:56:50.360 align:start position:0%
board and when we ask well why why is
 
01:56:52.629 --> 01:56:52.639 align:start position:0%
that happening and and the person that
 
01:56:54.149 --> 01:56:54.159 align:start position:0%
comes to our meeting says well that's
 
01:56:56.069 --> 01:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
the enforcement side I can't I don't
 
01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
have an answer for you so I just don't
 
01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
think that the guardian the lightting
 
01:57:04.589 --> 01:57:04.599 align:start position:0%
board is going to be prepared to provide
 
01:57:06.790 --> 01:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
the training I don't think they're going
 
01:57:09.069 --> 01:57:09.079 align:start position:0%
to be able to understand the standards
 
01:57:11.149 --> 01:57:11.159 align:start position:0%
and if you look at what they said is
 
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to change those seven
 
01:57:14.950 --> 01:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
members who are generally involved in
 
01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
Guardian that liem industry and know
 
01:57:18.830 --> 01:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
what standards should be applied what
 
01:57:21.629 --> 01:57:21.639 align:start position:0%
training might be necessary and how
 
01:57:24.589 --> 01:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
people should act we're going to replace
 
01:57:27.310 --> 01:57:27.320 align:start position:0%
them with just three members now one
 
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
member being appointed by
 
01:57:33.950 --> 01:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
oplc one member being appointed by the
 
01:57:36.510 --> 01:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and remember the guardian
 
01:57:38.830 --> 01:57:38.840 align:start position:0%
liting board was taken away from the
 
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
courts so that it would be separate from
 
01:57:44.709 --> 01:57:44.719 align:start position:0%
the courts and one representative from
 
01:57:48.950 --> 01:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
Casa and Casa provides is basically is a
 
01:57:50.750 --> 01:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
guardian n liem which we hire to be a
 
01:57:53.550 --> 01:57:53.560 align:start position:0%
guardian that liem and then they hire
 
01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
individuals to serve in abuse neglect
 
01:57:58.990 --> 01:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
cases but not all the abuse neglect
 
01:58:00.270 --> 01:58:00.280 align:start position:0%
cases because they don't have the
 
01:58:01.870 --> 01:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
resources to provide them for the whole
 
01:58:03.470 --> 01:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
state so there are lots of our Guardian
 
01:58:06.030 --> 01:58:06.040 align:start position:0%
at Lems that are doing abuse neglect
 
01:58:09.750 --> 01:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
cases long and a short is I just think
 
01:58:12.310 --> 01:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh making the guardian the light and
 
01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
board uh an Advisory Board is ill
 
01:58:19.750 --> 01:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
advised I I looked at the sponsors I've
 
01:58:21.270 --> 01:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
never seen him one of the sponsors of
 
01:58:24.350 --> 01:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
this bill come to a a guardian em board
 
01:58:28.589 --> 01:58:28.599 align:start position:0%
meeting to know what we do why we do it
 
01:58:31.189 --> 01:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
h and why it should be done
 
01:58:35.109 --> 01:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
differently so that's my testimony today
 
01:58:36.910 --> 01:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
I hope that you'll delete the guardian
 
01:58:39.550 --> 01:58:39.560 align:start position:0%
at light and provision from this bill it
 
01:58:41.669 --> 01:58:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh it makes from my perspective it makes
 
01:58:41.679 --> 01:58:43.310 align:start position:0%
uh it makes from my perspective it makes
no

01:58:43.310 --> 01:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:58:45.990 --> 01:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
sense thank you for your testimony uh
 
01:58:48.510 --> 01:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative Goa thank you this
 
01:58:50.189 --> 01:58:50.199 align:start position:0%
one of the the prime sponsor of the bill
 
01:58:53.069 --> 01:58:53.079 align:start position:0%
said that this um
 
01:58:55.950 --> 01:58:55.960 align:start position:0%
addresses a where there are a small
 
01:58:58.830 --> 01:58:58.840 align:start position:0%
number of licenses so can you tell us
 
01:59:02.950 --> 01:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
how many people um are Guardian at Liams
 
01:59:05.109 --> 01:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
are Guardian at Lums and how many of
 
01:59:06.910 --> 01:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
them are licensed I mean I would imagine
 
01:59:10.109 --> 01:59:10.119 align:start position:0%
it's not a small number no we have we
 
01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
have a number of people who I I can't I
 
01:59:14.990 --> 01:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
don't have a number at hand so I can't
 
01:59:16.950 --> 01:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
tell you but I'd certainly be willing to
 
01:59:20.310 --> 01:59:20.320 align:start position:0%
find that out for you but I'm not sure
 
01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
that that's really the I don't think the
 
01:59:24.709 --> 01:59:24.719 align:start position:0%
number of Guardian items is really what
 
01:59:27.189 --> 01:59:27.199 align:start position:0%
the key issue is it's the responsibility
 
01:59:30.030 --> 01:59:30.040 align:start position:0%
of guarding that items which is really
 
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
what the issue is and when I look at the
 
01:59:33.870 --> 01:59:33.880 align:start position:0%
complaints that H you know have been
 
01:59:35.709 --> 01:59:35.719 align:start position:0%
there for sitting there for a year and
 
01:59:39.390 --> 01:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
haven't been acted on by
 
01:59:42.750 --> 01:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
oplc some of them being multiple guard
 
01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
some of them being multiple complaints
 
01:59:48.030 --> 01:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
against one Guardian at light them say
 
01:59:50.030 --> 01:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
this this isn't right
 
01:59:53.510 --> 01:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
um follow up followup I don't ask the
 
01:59:56.470 --> 01:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
question for justification I just ask
 
01:59:58.030 --> 01:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
the question because that's how it was
 
02:00:01.589 --> 02:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
presented to us and I don't agree that
 
02:00:03.910 --> 02:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
the number for example of cardian items
 
02:00:06.189 --> 02:00:06.199 align:start position:0%
is small so that's I would just like you
 
02:00:09.149 --> 02:00:09.159 align:start position:0%
to confirm that for me thank you we'll
 
02:00:11.550 --> 02:00:11.560 align:start position:0%
get a number for you thank you
 
02:00:14.350 --> 02:00:14.360 align:start position:0%
representative Manti thank you Mr chair
 
02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um my
 
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
question is on reverse side
 
02:00:24.310 --> 02:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
it's not how many Guardian Liam or CA
 
02:00:27.750 --> 02:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
members are but how many cases do you
 
02:00:30.669 --> 02:00:30.679 align:start position:0%
represent so that
 
02:00:34.910 --> 02:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
dictates what the load is correct right
 
02:00:38.350 --> 02:00:38.360 align:start position:0%
there there are and again I I wouldn't
 
02:00:40.950 --> 02:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
have a number for you a number of cases
 
02:00:44.189 --> 02:00:44.199 align:start position:0%
but uh F first of all they're extremely
 
02:00:48.189 --> 02:00:48.199 align:start position:0%
important cases uh and I'm I'm sure in
 
02:00:51.750 --> 02:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
the year it's hundreds if not if not in
 
02:00:54.589 --> 02:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
the thousands of cases
 
02:00:57.709 --> 02:00:57.719 align:start position:0%
Statewide representative gold thank you
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:01:03.709 --> 02:01:03.719 align:start position:0%
question I'm thinking that part of the
 
02:01:06.750 --> 02:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
discrepancy in terms of the numbers um
 
02:01:09.629 --> 02:01:09.639 align:start position:0%
that were reported and what the actual
 
02:01:12.149 --> 02:01:12.159 align:start position:0%
boots on the ground experiences has to
 
02:01:16.350 --> 02:01:16.360 align:start position:0%
do with cassa being licensed but they
 
02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
provide a vast array of guardian items
 
02:01:21.750 --> 02:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
into the system do you think that's a
 
02:01:25.870 --> 02:01:25.880 align:start position:0%
piece of that right yeah and follow up
 
02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:26.750 align:start position:0%
piece of that right yeah and follow up
follow

02:01:26.750 --> 02:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
follow
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
up so as a professional in the field for
 
02:01:33.910 --> 02:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
many years thank you for what you've
 
02:01:36.069 --> 02:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
done on the board and big thanks to the
 
02:01:37.870 --> 02:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
guardian of Lems who protect the
 
02:01:40.550 --> 02:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
children but back when cassa first got
 
02:01:43.669 --> 02:01:43.679 align:start position:0%
involved in Vol volunteers took over the
 
02:01:46.830 --> 02:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
role that was traditionally done by
 
02:01:49.109 --> 02:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
attorneys I have some pretty serious
 
02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
concerns I've always had pretty serious
 
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
concerns about
 
02:01:56.350 --> 02:01:56.360 align:start position:0%
volunteers and about the training and
 
02:01:57.750 --> 02:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
the understanding they have of the
 
02:02:00.870 --> 02:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
system versus an attorney who's really
 
02:02:03.510 --> 02:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
representing that child's best
 
02:02:06.390 --> 02:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
interest and I use my experience in
 
02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
child welfare and going into the courts
 
02:02:10.149 --> 02:02:10.159 align:start position:0%
when you go into a child abuse and
 
02:02:13.229 --> 02:02:13.239 align:start position:0%
neglect case there are so many interests
 
02:02:16.350 --> 02:02:16.360 align:start position:0%
flying around you the best advice I ever
 
02:02:18.069 --> 02:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
got and what I practiced was keep your
 
02:02:19.830 --> 02:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
eye on the child
 
02:02:21.910 --> 02:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
and that's the guardian at Liam's role
 
02:02:24.189 --> 02:02:24.199 align:start position:0%
and it's been a lesson I've learned
 
02:02:27.030 --> 02:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
that's car worked well for me in these
 
02:02:29.870 --> 02:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
hearings so the child at this point is
 
02:02:32.629 --> 02:02:32.639 align:start position:0%
what will best serve children in the
 
02:02:37.189 --> 02:02:37.199 align:start position:0%
Long Haul and I guess I'd like to ask
 
02:02:40.629 --> 02:02:40.639 align:start position:0%
you as an Advisory Board as opposed to a
 
02:02:40.639 --> 02:02:43.189 align:start position:0%
you as an Advisory Board as opposed to a
licensing

02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
02:02:45.750 --> 02:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
board what exactly would you see the
 
02:02:48.069 --> 02:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
change in your role would you not still
 
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
be there and advising director Courtney
 
02:02:53.350 --> 02:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:02:56.950 --> 02:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
staff I don't frankly I don't know what
 
02:02:58.550 --> 02:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
an Advisory
 
02:03:04.669 --> 02:03:04.679 align:start position:0%
Board would do the I guess the Advisory
 
02:03:06.170 --> 02:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
Board is only going to
 
02:03:06.180 --> 02:03:07.310 align:start position:0%
Board is only going to
[Music]

02:03:07.310 --> 02:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:03:12.390 --> 02:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
be answering questions if oplc has some
 
02:03:14.990 --> 02:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
concerns is if it says well we we're
 
02:03:16.669 --> 02:03:16.679 align:start position:0%
going to do some Ru making we want to
 
02:03:18.629 --> 02:03:18.639 align:start position:0%
have some input or something like that
 
02:03:18.639 --> 02:03:19.430 align:start position:0%
have some input or something like that
but

02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
I frankly if all you're going to do is
 
02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
have an Advisory Board you might as well
 
02:03:25.750 --> 02:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
not have any board at all from my
 
02:03:27.950 --> 02:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
perspective and with regard to your
 
02:03:30.950 --> 02:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
comment about attorneys doing being
 
02:03:34.030 --> 02:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
Guardian at Liams or non attorneys the
 
02:03:36.270 --> 02:03:36.280 align:start position:0%
one thing that is most important with a
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
guardian that lium is that they need to
 
02:03:41.310 --> 02:03:41.320 align:start position:0%
have some common sense and Common Sense
 
02:03:43.149 --> 02:03:43.159 align:start position:0%
isn't something you can teach it's not
 
02:03:44.629 --> 02:03:44.639 align:start position:0%
about being a lawyer or not being a
 
02:03:46.189 --> 02:03:46.199 align:start position:0%
lawyer it's
 
02:03:49.669 --> 02:03:49.679 align:start position:0%
about um knowing how families work and
 
02:03:53.870 --> 02:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:56.990 --> 02:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
children representative goalie thank you
 
02:03:58.549 --> 02:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
02:03:58.559 --> 02:04:00.830 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
question

02:04:00.830 --> 02:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:04:03.990 --> 02:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
yeah because I too was a little
 
02:04:05.470 --> 02:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
concerned about the way the language was
 
02:04:06.870 --> 02:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
written in the bill when you brought up
 
02:04:08.629 --> 02:04:08.639 align:start position:0%
the sentence it says uh this is to
 
02:04:10.750 --> 02:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
reduce Workforce barriers and provide
 
02:04:12.510 --> 02:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
State supervision responsibility and
 
02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:20.270 --> 02:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
chapter I'm I'm just perplexed as to
 
02:04:23.069 --> 02:04:23.079 align:start position:0%
how going from a board to an Advisory
 
02:04:26.229 --> 02:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
Board reduces that role because I my
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
understanding was oplc already has was
 
02:04:32.030 --> 02:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
given the authority to Grant licenses
 
02:04:35.149 --> 02:04:35.159 align:start position:0%
upon approval as well as a met
 
02:04:35.159 --> 02:04:36.830 align:start position:0%
upon approval as well as a met
qualifications

02:04:36.830 --> 02:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
qualifications
 
02:04:39.990 --> 02:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if you can tell me how
 
02:04:41.589 --> 02:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
changing you to an Advisory Board is
 
02:04:43.350 --> 02:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
going to make that
 
02:04:47.350 --> 02:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
even more proficient than what's already
 
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
going on for the statement to be in the
 
02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
bill uh well given the history of oplc
 
02:04:56.790 --> 02:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
so far I have no confidence at all that
 
02:04:59.229 --> 02:04:59.239 align:start position:0%
it would make an improvement
 
02:05:03.189 --> 02:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:06.390 --> 02:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
up and the other concern I had and
 
02:05:09.069 --> 02:05:09.079 align:start position:0%
you've been around long
 
02:05:11.950 --> 02:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
enough when you're putting together an
 
02:05:11.960 --> 02:05:14.310 align:start position:0%
enough when you're putting together an
Advisory

02:05:14.310 --> 02:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
Advisory
 
02:05:16.990 --> 02:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
Board and you have the person in charge
 
02:05:19.270 --> 02:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
now making the two picks of they want
 
02:05:20.510 --> 02:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
versus the
 
02:05:23.350 --> 02:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
governor wouldn't that be some sort of a
 
02:05:25.470 --> 02:05:25.480 align:start position:0%
conflict going
 
02:05:28.790 --> 02:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
forward I I I fully agree if you have an
 
02:05:30.910 --> 02:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
Advisory board for oplc and you have
 
02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
oplc appointing The Advisory Board it
 
02:05:37.149 --> 02:05:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:39.310 --> 02:05:39.320 align:start position:0%
me any further
 
02:05:41.189 --> 02:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony thank you
 
02:05:45.229 --> 02:05:45.239 align:start position:0%
everybody appreciate
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%

02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you chairman Simon and
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
thanks to all of you for allowing me to
 
02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
speak to you today about why I support
 
02:06:10.669 --> 02:06:10.679 align:start position:0%
this bill I am a licensed acupuncturist
 
02:06:13.390 --> 02:06:13.400 align:start position:0%

Manchester could you just state your
 
02:06:16.430 --> 02:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
name for the record please since I got
 
02:06:21.030 --> 02:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
it wrong um Elizabeth r r P so um I'm
 
02:06:23.149 --> 02:06:23.159 align:start position:0%
here to speak about why the license
 
02:06:25.549 --> 02:06:25.559 align:start position:0%
acupuncture Licensing Board needs to be
 
02:06:28.470 --> 02:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
transitioned into an Advisory Board I
 
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
have three main points that I need to
 
02:06:33.390 --> 02:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
make one is that the acupuncture board
 
02:06:35.229 --> 02:06:35.239 align:start position:0%
is bad at basic
 
02:06:37.910 --> 02:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
Administration the second is the board
 
02:06:41.229 --> 02:06:41.239 align:start position:0%
upholds an exclusive law and finally the
 
02:06:43.950 --> 02:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
board is inconsistent in enforcing their
 
02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:45.390 align:start position:0%
board is inconsistent in enforcing their
burdensome

02:06:45.390 --> 02:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
burdensome
 
02:06:48.790 --> 02:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
rules so um they have five members they
 
02:06:50.950 --> 02:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
have a hard time meeting Quorum maybe
 
02:06:53.069 --> 02:06:53.079 align:start position:0%
that's just for emergency meetings but
 
02:06:55.629 --> 02:06:55.639 align:start position:0%
the board was asked to expand and they
 
02:06:58.109 --> 02:06:58.119 align:start position:0%
would not cting personal differences and
 
02:07:00.510 --> 02:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
I got that information from the meeting
 
02:07:03.069 --> 02:07:03.079 align:start position:0%
minutes um when the pandemic started the
 
02:07:06.549 --> 02:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
board met remotely and I had
 
02:07:09.629 --> 02:07:09.639 align:start position:0%
questions and those questions I didn't
 
02:07:11.189 --> 02:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
get answers and I and they weren't
 
02:07:13.069 --> 02:07:13.079 align:start position:0%
posting their meeting minutes and I
 
02:07:14.549 --> 02:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
asked where were their meeting minutes
 
02:07:16.030 --> 02:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
and again I didn't get an answer or
 
02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:17.069 align:start position:0%
and again I didn't get an answer or
meeting

02:07:17.069 --> 02:07:17.079 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:07:20.669 --> 02:07:20.679 align:start position:0%
minutes and um at some point the board
 
02:07:23.669 --> 02:07:23.679 align:start position:0%
formed a subcommittee on ear acupuncture
 
02:07:26.189 --> 02:07:26.199 align:start position:0%
I specialize in ear acupuncture and I am
 
02:07:28.549 --> 02:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
a supervisor for acupuncture
 
02:07:31.709 --> 02:07:31.719 align:start position:0%
detoxification Specialists who practice
 
02:07:34.589 --> 02:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
ear acupuncture I would have liked to
 
02:07:37.189 --> 02:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
have had the opportunity to weigh in on
 
02:07:39.350 --> 02:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
those secret
 
02:07:41.589 --> 02:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
meetings my second point is that the
 
02:07:44.950 --> 02:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
board upholds an exclusive law so um
 
02:07:47.790 --> 02:07:47.800 align:start position:0%
your committee has received over a dozen
 
02:07:49.870 --> 02:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
letters in support of this bill and many
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
of them are from licensed acupuncturists
 
02:07:54.750 --> 02:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
who want reciprocity from practitioners
 
02:07:56.510 --> 02:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
from out other
 
02:07:59.310 --> 02:07:59.320 align:start position:0%
states and the board currently does not
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
allow reciprocity last year the board
 
02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
reviewed laws from other states and
 
02:08:05.470 --> 02:08:05.480 align:start position:0%
determined that no state meets or
 
02:08:07.709 --> 02:08:07.719 align:start position:0%
exceeds New Hampshire standards and one
 
02:08:10.430 --> 02:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
of the biggest factors is a Balor
 
02:08:12.189 --> 02:08:12.199 align:start position:0%
requirement so that's having a
 
02:08:14.430 --> 02:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree in addition to a
 
02:08:17.109 --> 02:08:17.119 align:start position:0%
master's level degree from an accredited
 
02:08:19.189 --> 02:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
Acupuncture school and that Master Level
 
02:08:21.189 --> 02:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
degree takes three three and a half to
 
02:08:22.390 --> 02:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
four years to
 
02:08:26.109 --> 02:08:26.119 align:start position:0%
complete um that requirement is unfair
 
02:08:28.549 --> 02:08:28.559 align:start position:0%
and it is unreasonable Most states do
 
02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
not have this requirement we are I
 
02:08:31.870 --> 02:08:31.880 align:start position:0%
thought I were I thought we were the
 
02:08:33.669 --> 02:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
only one but I believe New Jersey has
 
02:08:36.470 --> 02:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
that requirement as well um and the
 
02:08:38.629 --> 02:08:38.639 align:start position:0%
board has the power to change this
 
02:08:40.069 --> 02:08:40.079 align:start position:0%
that's just not something they seem to
 
02:08:42.669 --> 02:08:42.679 align:start position:0%
be interested in um and to demonstrate
 
02:08:45.229 --> 02:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
how ridiculous and irrelevant that
 
02:08:47.149 --> 02:08:47.159 align:start position:0%
requirement is I I have a bachelor's
 
02:08:49.030 --> 02:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
degree and my bachelor's degree
 
02:08:53.189 --> 02:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
is in Liberal Arts so nothing in my
 
02:08:54.910 --> 02:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree has to do with
 
02:08:58.270 --> 02:08:58.280 align:start position:0%
Healthcare or Health Sciences um luckily
 
02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
I had it when I wanted to relocate to
 
02:09:02.990 --> 02:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but not everyone has that
 
02:09:05.990 --> 02:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
degree um and finally my last point is
 
02:09:08.510 --> 02:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
about how the board is inconsistent in
 
02:09:14.430 --> 02:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
on um my colleague Laura kie is not here
 
02:09:21.390 --> 02:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
here today to tell her story um she's
 
02:09:22.709 --> 02:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
she completed her last round of
 
02:09:24.790 --> 02:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
chemotherapy last week please keep her
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
in your
 
02:09:28.109 --> 02:09:28.119 align:start position:0%
thoughts and so I'm going to tell her
 
02:09:30.390 --> 02:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
story about how she was styed by
 
02:09:32.310 --> 02:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
legislative rules that the licensing
 
02:09:35.390 --> 02:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
board wrote Laura is a trainer with the
 
02:09:37.270 --> 02:09:37.280 align:start position:0%
national acupuncture detoxification
 
02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
Association NADA and she wrote the NADA
 
02:09:43.350 --> 02:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
manual which is the standard that New
 
02:09:44.830 --> 02:09:44.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has set for training
 
02:09:47.310 --> 02:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
acupuncture detoxification Specialists
 
02:09:49.669 --> 02:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does allow for other ACU
 
02:09:51.790 --> 02:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
detox trainings to be approved by the
 
02:09:55.270 --> 02:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
board and so Laura submitted her manual
 
02:09:57.149 --> 02:09:57.159 align:start position:0%
the same manual that she trains with
 
02:09:59.510 --> 02:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
under NADA and the board would not
 
02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:00.390 align:start position:0%
under NADA and the board would not
approve

02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
approve
 
02:10:03.109 --> 02:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
it however the board did approve a
 
02:10:05.109 --> 02:10:05.119 align:start position:0%
manual from another trainer by the name
 
02:10:07.510 --> 02:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
of Dave worel and I reached out to him
 
02:10:09.069 --> 02:10:09.079 align:start position:0%
to know how he managed to fit all the
 
02:10:10.589 --> 02:10:10.599 align:start position:0%
requirements of his training into a
 
02:10:13.510 --> 02:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
single weekend and he I have his email
 
02:10:16.350 --> 02:10:16.360 align:start position:0%
response with me today um he said that
 
02:10:18.709 --> 02:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
he doesn't spend much time on need in
 
02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
technique or clean needle
 
02:10:24.310 --> 02:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
technique and that is what the training
 
02:10:27.149 --> 02:10:27.159 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be about how to safely
 
02:10:30.750 --> 02:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
needle the ear needling technique and
 
02:10:32.549 --> 02:10:32.559 align:start position:0%
clean needle technique are listed in the
 
02:10:34.669 --> 02:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
rules as the third and fourth items in
 
02:10:37.870 --> 02:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
board approved curriculum
 
02:10:40.229 --> 02:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
training and for some reason the board
 
02:10:42.109 --> 02:10:42.119 align:start position:0%
decided to wave the four-month waiting
 
02:10:44.790 --> 02:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
period for him so acupuncture licensing
 
02:10:47.189 --> 02:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
board members promoted his training and
 
02:10:49.750 --> 02:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
hosted his training and that 4mon
 
02:10:52.589 --> 02:10:52.599 align:start position:0%
waiting period is in the rules that the
 
02:10:55.870 --> 02:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
board wrote and that's a shall not a may
 
02:10:57.790 --> 02:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
have a four-month waiting period before
 
02:11:02.470 --> 02:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
the first training so these are glaring
 
02:11:04.750 --> 02:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies on how the board treated
 
02:11:07.470 --> 02:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
Laura kie versus day worel and I don't
 
02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
know if this is bias I don't know if
 
02:11:12.030 --> 02:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
this is favoritism I don't know if this
 
02:11:12.040 --> 02:11:14.069 align:start position:0%
this is favoritism I don't know if this
is

02:11:14.069 --> 02:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:11:16.310 --> 02:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
retribution but yeah anyway these are my
 
02:11:18.629 --> 02:11:18.639 align:start position:0%
points does anyone have any questions
 
02:11:19.709 --> 02:11:19.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
02:11:22.750 --> 02:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative goota so I
 
02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
looked on the acupuncture Board website
 
02:11:29.189 --> 02:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
and they're very transparent as to when
 
02:11:32.430 --> 02:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
they meet and they have meeting minutes
 
02:11:36.390 --> 02:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
for their meetings so I really you know
 
02:11:39.069 --> 02:11:39.079 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about your you may have an
 
02:11:40.750 --> 02:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
issue when it comes
 
02:11:44.229 --> 02:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
to um your questions about the treatment
 
02:11:44.239 --> 02:11:45.790 align:start position:0%
to um your questions about the treatment
of

02:11:45.790 --> 02:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:11:49.589 --> 02:11:49.599 align:start position:0%
individuals but I don't see based on
 
02:11:51.229 --> 02:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
this information I haven't read these
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
many minutes but I don't see um how if
 
02:12:00.430 --> 02:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
your your first point is legitimate or
 
02:12:02.189 --> 02:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
can you can you speak more about that
 
02:12:06.350 --> 02:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
because they are meeting and they are um
 
02:12:09.270 --> 02:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
they have minutes so they have to have a
 
02:12:12.109 --> 02:12:12.119 align:start position:0%
quorum so I'm just wondering how that
 
02:12:14.470 --> 02:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
fits into your narrative yeah I'm
 
02:12:17.669 --> 02:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
speaking of between 2020 when the
 
02:12:20.149 --> 02:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic started in March of 2020 pretty
 
02:12:22.189 --> 02:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
much through I want to say
 
02:12:25.229 --> 02:12:25.239 align:start position:0%
2020 last year
 
02:12:28.629 --> 02:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
even they met in 2022 so yeah meeting in
 
02:12:32.069 --> 02:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
2022 so remotely and I would go and look
 
02:12:33.709 --> 02:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
I was looking for meeting minutes mostly
 
02:12:35.790 --> 02:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
because I wanted answers to my questions
 
02:12:37.350 --> 02:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
and they weren't getting posted and
 
02:12:39.069 --> 02:12:39.079 align:start position:0%
after a certain point the meeting
 
02:12:42.430 --> 02:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
minutes are get removed from the website
 
02:12:46.229 --> 02:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
so they only go back what like another
 
02:12:48.430 --> 02:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
year so that's not an issue ISS with the
 
02:12:50.229 --> 02:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
board it's an issue with the website
 
02:12:53.189 --> 02:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
isn't it I'm looking for minutes and
 
02:12:54.629 --> 02:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
that's where I go to find them and if
 
02:12:55.990 --> 02:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
they weren't there they weren't there I
 
02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.430 align:start position:0%
they weren't there they weren't there I
don't

02:12:58.430 --> 02:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
know anything yes representative man
 
02:13:03.430 --> 02:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:13:05.709 --> 02:13:05.719 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:13:09.830 --> 02:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
um pandemic was an anomaly right we
 
02:13:12.669 --> 02:13:12.679 align:start position:0%
don't have Pandemic every this is the
 
02:13:18.510 --> 02:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
first one in my lifetime so to base
 
02:13:20.189 --> 02:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
just on your
 
02:13:23.750 --> 02:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
experience during pandemic and the
 
02:13:26.950 --> 02:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
changes to the rules or the
 
02:13:30.510 --> 02:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility for oplc and the board
 
02:13:36.109 --> 02:13:36.119 align:start position:0%
changed last year so has it been long
 
02:13:38.310 --> 02:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
enough to kind of
 
02:13:41.990 --> 02:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
say this is not working let's change the
 
02:13:44.709 --> 02:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
whole thing and I'm just having a hard
 
02:13:48.069 --> 02:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
time coming to terms with that from you
 
02:13:49.910 --> 02:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
your angle
 
02:13:51.830 --> 02:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
perspective I don't think I understand
 
02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:56.030 align:start position:0%
perspective I don't think I understand
your

02:13:56.030 --> 02:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:58.669 --> 02:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
question are you saying has it been long
 
02:14:01.030 --> 02:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
enough since the pandemic to see whether
 
02:14:03.990 --> 02:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
or not the problems been
 
02:14:07.149 --> 02:14:07.159 align:start position:0%
remediated yeah the problems during
 
02:14:11.030 --> 02:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic was one time kind of thing so
 
02:14:13.830 --> 02:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
to take what happened during pandemic in
 
02:14:17.430 --> 02:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
extrapolate that's the practice I think
 
02:14:17.440 --> 02:14:19.430 align:start position:0%
extrapolate that's the practice I think
that's

02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:14:23.709 --> 02:14:23.719 align:start position:0%
expanding beyond that emergency okay so
 
02:14:26.430 --> 02:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
okay so let me see if how I can answer
 
02:14:28.589 --> 02:14:28.599 align:start position:0%
this so I think it was last year in the
 
02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
meeting minutes the board was asked to
 
02:14:32.870 --> 02:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
expand members so they could meet Quorum
 
02:14:34.790 --> 02:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
and I read they didn't want to and they
 
02:14:37.589 --> 02:14:37.599 align:start position:0%
cited personality differences that
 
02:14:39.430 --> 02:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like a really good reason
 
02:14:43.270 --> 02:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
to not expand the board um let's see
 
02:14:46.750 --> 02:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
what else um there was I read about the
 
02:14:49.270 --> 02:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee m on ear acupuncture and
 
02:14:50.870 --> 02:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
then wondered okay so when are these
 
02:14:52.430 --> 02:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
meetings happening and if they're having
 
02:14:55.149 --> 02:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meetings that does have to
 
02:14:58.030 --> 02:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
get public notice and if it doesn't get
 
02:14:59.830 --> 02:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
public notice that is a violation of the
 
02:15:00.910 --> 02:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
right to no
 
02:15:03.549 --> 02:15:03.559 align:start position:0%
law and if they're not responding to
 
02:15:05.790 --> 02:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
email email inquiries within 5 days
 
02:15:07.589 --> 02:15:07.599 align:start position:0%
again also a violation of the right to
 
02:15:10.189 --> 02:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
no law and so so these are some recent
 
02:15:12.430 --> 02:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
things yes they happened also in the
 
02:15:16.149 --> 02:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:19.189 --> 02:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
continued uh yes represent
 
02:15:21.030 --> 02:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
so were these concerns brought up to the
 
02:15:23.629 --> 02:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
oplc yes they were and how did they
 
02:15:28.030 --> 02:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
address them I let's see I emailed oplc
 
02:15:30.990 --> 02:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
I want to say in
 
02:15:34.310 --> 02:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
2021 and my my main question of reaching
 
02:15:36.109 --> 02:15:36.119 align:start position:0%
out during the pandemic was to know how
 
02:15:37.709 --> 02:15:37.719 align:start position:0%
I was supposed to address supervision
 
02:15:39.350 --> 02:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
for acupuncture detoxification
 
02:15:41.430 --> 02:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
Specialists because acupuncturists were
 
02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
told we couldn't practice for some time
 
02:15:45.750 --> 02:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic we weren't
 
02:15:49.270 --> 02:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
considered um essential workers but that
 
02:15:50.589 --> 02:15:50.599 align:start position:0%
didn't include the acupuncture
 
02:15:52.549 --> 02:15:52.559 align:start position:0%
detoxification Specialists and there
 
02:15:54.030 --> 02:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't any mention so I needed to know
 
02:15:56.830 --> 02:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
how to proceed and I had I did talk to
 
02:15:59.709 --> 02:15:59.719 align:start position:0%
somebody at oplc who didn't know what I
 
02:16:00.870 --> 02:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
was talking
 
02:16:04.149 --> 02:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
about and so and then I had to clarify
 
02:16:06.510 --> 02:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
like I'm a supervisor I supervise these
 
02:16:08.030 --> 02:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
these people some of them are essential
 
02:16:10.030 --> 02:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
workers using ear
 
02:16:10.040 --> 02:16:11.589 align:start position:0%
workers using ear
acupuncture

02:16:11.589 --> 02:16:11.599 align:start position:0%
acupuncture
 
02:16:15.109 --> 02:16:15.119 align:start position:0%
um I don't remember this was 2021 and
 
02:16:16.549 --> 02:16:16.559 align:start position:0%
then I asked about meeting minutes and
 
02:16:18.149 --> 02:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
she said I don't know where the meeting
 
02:16:19.790 --> 02:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
minutes are did you ask the board and I
 
02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
showed her a screenshot of my email to
 
02:16:24.350 --> 02:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
the board asking for their meeting
 
02:16:29.669 --> 02:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
minutes follow up so I just want you to
 
02:16:32.110 --> 02:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
understand that you're asking you're
 
02:16:36.230 --> 02:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
supporting The Advisory Board yet oplc
 
02:16:38.830 --> 02:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
was not able to answer your questions
 
02:16:40.709 --> 02:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
regarding your
 
02:16:43.429 --> 02:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
specialty so you do understand that
 
02:16:43.439 --> 02:16:44.349 align:start position:0%
specialty so you do understand that
you're

02:16:44.349 --> 02:16:44.359 align:start position:0%
you're
 
02:16:47.709 --> 02:16:47.719 align:start position:0%
supporting an organization that had not
 
02:16:50.070 --> 02:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
been able to assist you in the past can
 
02:16:53.790 --> 02:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
you confirm that I think that members of
 
02:16:55.910 --> 02:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
oplc could do their job if we had a
 
02:16:59.110 --> 02:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
chance to educate them about what adss
 
02:17:01.150 --> 02:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
are and what they
 
02:17:03.950 --> 02:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
do representative
 
02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
Brown uh thank you Mr chair uh excuse me
 
02:17:09.349 --> 02:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so
 
02:17:11.629 --> 02:17:11.639 align:start position:0%
going back to previous testimony and
 
02:17:13.309 --> 02:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
question from representative
 
02:17:15.709 --> 02:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
goalie uh aside from some of these
 
02:17:17.669 --> 02:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
administrations administrative
 
02:17:17.679 --> 02:17:19.110 align:start position:0%
administrations administrative
conversations

02:17:19.110 --> 02:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
02:17:23.150 --> 02:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
M do you feel that this this law would
 
02:17:25.190 --> 02:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
help to eliminate Workforce barriers for
 
02:17:27.750 --> 02:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
people coming here to New Hampshire to
 
02:17:30.629 --> 02:17:30.639 align:start position:0%
enter this field and that it's a
 
02:17:31.830 --> 02:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
two-piece question because it's a
 
02:17:34.830 --> 02:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
two-piece sentence and that it provides
 
02:17:36.589 --> 02:17:36.599 align:start position:0%
State supervision over these regulatory
 
02:17:38.230 --> 02:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
bodies which I guess follows up on
 
02:17:39.830 --> 02:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative grod's comment but
 
02:17:41.750 --> 02:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
basically do you think it's going to
 
02:17:44.110 --> 02:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
help eliminate Workforce barriers I
 
02:17:47.230 --> 02:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
think so I'm open to further discussion
 
02:17:49.309 --> 02:17:49.319 align:start position:0%
but I think it would it would I mean at
 
02:17:51.709 --> 02:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
the moment we have a board that doesn't
 
02:17:53.270 --> 02:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
want to that looked at all the
 
02:17:55.589 --> 02:17:55.599 align:start position:0%
acupuncture laws of all the other states
 
02:17:58.709 --> 02:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
and said oh all these states require
 
02:18:00.750 --> 02:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
don't require a bachelor's degree but we
 
02:18:02.870 --> 02:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
do let's keep it the same for no
 
02:18:05.549 --> 02:18:05.559 align:start position:0%
particular reason whereas if we had The
 
02:18:07.750 --> 02:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board model we could say all
 
02:18:09.389 --> 02:18:09.399 align:start position:0%
right let's match some of the other
 
02:18:11.990 --> 02:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
states and let's not just arbitrarily
 
02:18:16.509 --> 02:18:16.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:16.519 --> 02:18:18.270 align:start position:0%
 
out

02:18:18.270 --> 02:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:18:21.669 --> 02:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
okay representative gr thank you for
 
02:18:24.429 --> 02:18:24.439 align:start position:0%
some reason I just had this moment of
 
02:18:27.709 --> 02:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
remembrance okay so my first term as a
 
02:18:30.469 --> 02:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
legislature the Edna committee did look
 
02:18:34.309 --> 02:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
at standards for the uh acupuncture
 
02:18:38.309 --> 02:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
board and I specifically remember that
 
02:18:41.990 --> 02:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
this test was something that everybody
 
02:18:45.950 --> 02:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
in wanted and there was no opposition in
 
02:18:47.990 --> 02:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
fact I know that Miss was part of
 
02:18:50.629 --> 02:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
my subcommittee okay so I want to
 
02:18:51.950 --> 02:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
understand why all of a sudden the
 
02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
change in attitude about the test the
 
02:18:56.589 --> 02:18:56.599 align:start position:0%
national test the oh no this isn't about
 
02:19:00.270 --> 02:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
the national test okay so what is it I'm
 
02:19:02.910 --> 02:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
sorry I Mis I misunderstand you're yeah
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
you're talking about certification and
 
02:19:08.349 --> 02:19:08.359 align:start position:0%
all that was all straightened out five
 
02:19:10.270 --> 02:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
years ago or four years ago so why all
 
02:19:11.629 --> 02:19:11.639 align:start position:0%
of a sudden are we all talking about
 
02:19:14.669 --> 02:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
this again so the national test is
 
02:19:16.469 --> 02:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
something that acupuncturists take when
 
02:19:18.589 --> 02:19:18.599 align:start position:0%
they graduate from AC puncture school
 
02:19:20.990 --> 02:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
and generally everyone needs that when
 
02:19:23.629 --> 02:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
applying for a license I don't think
 
02:19:28.790 --> 02:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:33.629 --> 02:19:33.639 align:start position:0%
that it's so you need a if so pretty
 
02:19:35.990 --> 02:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
much every state says pretty much every
 
02:19:37.950 --> 02:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
state law will say acupunctur should at
 
02:19:42.190 --> 02:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
least have two years of
 
02:19:44.429 --> 02:19:44.439 align:start position:0%
postsecondary education prior to
 
02:19:47.910 --> 02:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
Acupuncture school um so so there are
 
02:19:50.510 --> 02:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
plenty of acupuncturists who might like
 
02:19:52.309 --> 02:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
well no we had some acupuncturists who
 
02:19:53.670 --> 02:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
testified for this bill they are
 
02:19:56.429 --> 02:19:56.439 align:start position:0%
licensed acupuncturists they either are
 
02:19:57.710 --> 02:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
from another state and just want
 
02:19:59.830 --> 02:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
reciprocity they have passed the exams
 
02:20:01.309 --> 02:20:01.319 align:start position:0%
they are have a license and good
 
02:20:03.550 --> 02:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
standing in another state some of them
 
02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
only have maybe the two years of college
 
02:20:08.389 --> 02:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
required to be trained in acupuncture
 
02:20:09.710 --> 02:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
and serve in the state that they
 
02:20:12.309 --> 02:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
currently live in I don't know what the
 
02:20:14.990 --> 02:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
test has to do with
 
02:20:20.070 --> 02:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
it um followup thank you so um I get you
 
02:20:21.550 --> 02:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
had mentioned something about a
 
02:20:22.990 --> 02:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree you had mentioned
 
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
something about the test you had
 
02:20:25.429 --> 02:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned something I didn't mention the
 
02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
test okay so
 
02:20:33.670 --> 02:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
um with oplc taking over licensing now
 
02:20:35.830 --> 02:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
that burden of reciprocity should be

02:20:43.670 --> 02:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you so much for your

so thank you thank you so much for your
testimony

02:20:54.030 --> 02:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
please my concern is
 
02:20:57.429 --> 02:20:57.439 align:start position:0%
you your concern is with the direction
 
02:21:00.510 --> 02:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
the board is going currently and not
 
02:21:02.550 --> 02:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
being open to some of these discussions
 
02:21:05.750 --> 02:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:08.309 --> 02:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
is how do you know this Advisory Board
 
02:21:09.830 --> 02:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be made up of some of the
 
02:21:11.750 --> 02:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
individuals that are currently on the
 
02:21:15.150 --> 02:21:15.160 align:start position:0%
board as it sits and you're still where
 
02:21:17.590 --> 02:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
you're at so this doesn't solve your
 
02:21:20.190 --> 02:21:20.200 align:start position:0%
problem completely does it I would hope
 
02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question I would hope
 
02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
that we would have term limits and the
 
02:21:26.790 --> 02:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
board actually abides by those term
 
02:21:30.070 --> 02:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
limits and that's not the case at the
 
02:21:31.710 --> 02:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
moment thank you so much for your
 
02:21:35.110 --> 02:21:35.120 align:start position:0%

know advisers I do know
 
02:22:47.870 --> 02:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
people prior to acupuncture I was a
 
02:22:50.510 --> 02:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
general surgeon for 12 years in Boston
 
02:22:53.230 --> 02:22:53.240 align:start position:0%

medicine to preserve my mental and

physical health in 2018 I was a widow
 
02:23:00.469 --> 02:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
looking for a new career I enrolled in
 
02:23:03.510 --> 02:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
Acupuncture school I graduated from the
 
02:23:05.469 --> 02:23:05.479 align:start position:0%
program at the Massachusetts College of
 
02:23:07.190 --> 02:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy and Health
 
02:23:10.590 --> 02:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
Sciences which I will shorten to mcphs
 
02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
in September of
 
02:23:14.790 --> 02:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
2021 getting my acupuncture license in
 
02:23:16.429 --> 02:23:16.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was not a simple and
 
02:23:19.750 --> 02:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
streamlined process mcphs provided
 
02:23:21.230 --> 02:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
transcripts to
 
02:23:23.750 --> 02:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
oplc which included transcripts from
 
02:23:27.110 --> 02:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
Georgetown medical school mcphs had
 
02:23:29.670 --> 02:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
taken many of my credits from Georgetown
 
02:23:31.950 --> 02:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
for duplicate courses however the
 
02:23:33.750 --> 02:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
licensing board would not Grant my
 
02:23:35.830 --> 02:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
license without proof that I had
 
02:23:37.990 --> 02:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
obtained a bachelor's degree prior to
 
02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
attending medical school it took weeks
 
02:23:42.950 --> 02:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
to get a copy of my college transcripts
 
02:23:45.630 --> 02:23:45.640 align:start position:0%
I was an undergraduate student my email
 
02:23:47.830 --> 02:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
says 30 years ago I'm ashamed to say it
 
02:23:51.670 --> 02:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
was 42 years ago I graduated with a ba
 
02:23:51.680 --> 02:23:52.550 align:start position:0%
was 42 years ago I graduated with a ba
in

02:23:52.550 --> 02:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:23:55.110 --> 02:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
Spanish I do I don't understand why the
 
02:23:56.990 --> 02:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
board doesn't know that every medical
 
02:23:58.910 --> 02:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
school in the United States requires a
 
02:24:00.910 --> 02:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
four-year Balor
 
02:24:03.389 --> 02:24:03.399 align:start position:0%
degree many of my Acupuncture school
 
02:24:05.070 --> 02:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
classmates are like me We go to
 
02:24:07.510 --> 02:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
Acupuncture school after several years
 
02:24:10.469 --> 02:24:10.479 align:start position:0%
of other professional life experiences a
 
02:24:12.510 --> 02:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
master's program in acupuncture and
 
02:24:15.110 --> 02:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
integrative medicine is rigorous we need
 
02:24:17.590 --> 02:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
to pass three national board boards not
 
02:24:21.070 --> 02:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
one three national boards to be licensed
 
02:24:24.030 --> 02:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
and those boards are RIS why is that not
 
02:24:25.950 --> 02:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
enough to get an acupuncture license in
 
02:24:28.190 --> 02:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire requiring a
 
02:24:30.429 --> 02:24:30.439 align:start position:0%
master of acupuncture should be enough
 
02:24:33.429 --> 02:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
to allow lure in the state and I thank
 
02:24:35.389 --> 02:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
uh the woman who spoke previously and
 
02:24:38.469 --> 02:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
and told you how many hours we dedicate
 
02:24:40.670 --> 02:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
to our
 
02:24:42.830 --> 02:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
profession um when my husband and I
 
02:24:45.110 --> 02:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
moved to New Hampshire in 2008 there was
 
02:24:46.950 --> 02:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
already a shortage of primary care
 
02:24:49.269 --> 02:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
providers in the state my husband with
 
02:24:51.710 --> 02:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
cancer was assigned a PCP nurse
 
02:24:54.349 --> 02:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
practitioner after an emergency room
 
02:24:56.670 --> 02:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
visit I had to wait for my husband's
 
02:24:58.910 --> 02:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
passing in order to take his place and
 
02:25:01.230 --> 02:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
become a patient of hers in that
 
02:25:04.590 --> 02:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
Internal Medicine practice this was in
 
02:25:07.030 --> 02:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
2014 right now our medical system is
 
02:25:08.910 --> 02:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
taxed by sheer numbers of patients
 
02:25:10.710 --> 02:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
experiencing short and long-term effects
 
02:25:13.710 --> 02:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
of covid illness I wonder if any of you
 
02:25:15.230 --> 02:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
have been to your local emergency
 
02:25:18.110 --> 02:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
department recently
 
02:25:20.309 --> 02:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
last August I waited 45 minutes in the
 
02:25:23.389 --> 02:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
ER with a terminally ill friend lucky
 
02:25:25.550 --> 02:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
for us she looked sick and had medical
 
02:25:27.630 --> 02:25:27.640 align:start position:0%
records to prove how sick she was and so
 
02:25:30.670 --> 02:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
we only waited 45 minutes before we were
 
02:25:33.269 --> 02:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
moved to a triage room for treatment the
 
02:25:34.910 --> 02:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
remainder of the patients in the
 
02:25:36.469 --> 02:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
overflowing waiting room had been
 
02:25:39.030 --> 02:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
waiting for at least 6 hours this was a
 
02:25:41.670 --> 02:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
Monday afternoon this is why I'm writing
 
02:25:44.309 --> 02:25:44.319 align:start position:0%
this email today we need more healthcare
 
02:25:46.349 --> 02:25:46.359 align:start position:0%
workers providing acute and chronic
 
02:25:48.510 --> 02:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
treatment to to P to people like those
 
02:25:50.750 --> 02:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
waiting in the emergency department that
 
02:25:53.429 --> 02:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
day in August and acupuncturists do this
 
02:25:56.030 --> 02:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
every day we need more practitioners to
 
02:25:57.790 --> 02:25:57.800 align:start position:0%
take the pressure off of our Western
 
02:26:00.030 --> 02:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
Medical counterparts does the
 
02:26:01.830 --> 02:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
acupuncture licensing board think we
 
02:26:02.910 --> 02:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
have enough
 
02:26:04.990 --> 02:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist I think it's incumbent
 
02:26:06.510 --> 02:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
Upon Our licensing
 
02:26:10.150 --> 02:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
boards sorry to make it easier to bring
 
02:26:12.269 --> 02:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers to our state please
 
02:26:13.790 --> 02:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
make the licensing process for
 
02:26:16.510 --> 02:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
acupuncture easier and allow reciprocity
 
02:26:18.910 --> 02:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
of acupuncture licenses across all other
 
02:26:21.510 --> 02:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
states people need access to health care
 
02:26:23.830 --> 02:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
in whatever form we have to offer
 
02:26:25.750 --> 02:26:25.760 align:start position:0%

asked the previous speaker
 
02:26:50.469 --> 02:26:50.479 align:start position:0%
how making this board advisory which
 
02:26:52.150 --> 02:26:52.160 align:start position:0%
could still be the same
 
02:26:55.870 --> 02:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
individuals address your concerns it
 
02:26:58.630 --> 02:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
could it could not I don't know as I
 
02:27:00.510 --> 02:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
said at the at the beginning I I don't
 
02:27:03.070 --> 02:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
know boards I don't know
 
02:27:05.870 --> 02:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
um I I I don't know enough to say that I
 
02:27:08.349 --> 02:27:08.359 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that question but I
 
02:27:10.429 --> 02:27:10.439 align:start position:0%
can tell you since I've been a licensed
 
02:27:12.150 --> 02:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
acupunctur for a year and a half I
 
02:27:14.990 --> 02:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
suddenly realized there's a lot more to
 
02:27:18.070 --> 02:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
just me doing my job it's me speaking up
 
02:27:20.150 --> 02:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
about my experience and maybe trying to
 
02:27:22.590 --> 02:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
join the board maybe that's something I
 
02:27:24.590 --> 02:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
should do whether it's a board or an
 
02:27:27.630 --> 02:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
advisory committee and I know people I
 
02:27:31.870 --> 02:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:34.590 --> 02:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
people and one last followup sure

02:27:39.750 --> 02:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
going understanding the importance of
 
02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:41.870 align:start position:0%
going understanding the importance of
the

02:27:41.870 --> 02:27:41.880 align:start position:0%

profession wouldn't you as a
practitioner

02:27:45.670 --> 02:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
practitioner
 
02:27:48.670 --> 02:27:48.680 align:start position:0%
want the board to have a little more say
 
02:27:52.070 --> 02:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
than just making a recommendation to an
 
02:27:54.309 --> 02:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
individual has who has no experience in
 
02:27:56.510 --> 02:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
your field and that person decides
 
02:27:58.790 --> 02:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not they want to listen to
 
02:28:00.230 --> 02:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
your recommendation because you're only
 
02:28:03.110 --> 02:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
advisory and you're not a true board
 
02:28:05.550 --> 02:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be more better to keep a
 
02:28:09.389 --> 02:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
board on its own than having a say
 
02:28:12.070 --> 02:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
that doesn't say in statute it has to be
 
02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:13.030 align:start position:0%
that doesn't say in statute it has to be
listened

02:28:13.030 --> 02:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
listened
 
02:28:16.309 --> 02:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
to I think it'd be wonderful if all of
 
02:28:19.030 --> 02:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
the if the if the acupuncturist in in
 
02:28:22.630 --> 02:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire had a good representation
 
02:28:25.910 --> 02:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
on some committee board or advisory on
 
02:28:29.269 --> 02:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
on an advisory um
 
02:28:32.469 --> 02:28:32.479 align:start position:0%
sense all I can say is we trust in
 
02:28:34.830 --> 02:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
people we trust the people that come
 
02:28:36.510 --> 02:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
here to practice we trust the people
 
02:28:39.150 --> 02:28:39.160 align:start position:0%
that run our our country our
 
02:28:42.389 --> 02:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
state I'm trusting in the board at the
 
02:28:45.070 --> 02:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
same time that I'm questioning how well
 
02:28:47.349 --> 02:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
are we doing and how how much Common
 
02:28:50.309 --> 02:28:50.319 align:start position:0%
Sense are we using and is there any way
 
02:28:52.230 --> 02:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
we can help provide relief to the
 
02:28:54.950 --> 02:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
Western Medical system which is almost
 
02:28:58.550 --> 02:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
broken maybe you can remember covid this
 
02:29:00.790 --> 02:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
this was a terrible time why can't we
 
02:29:03.469 --> 02:29:03.479 align:start position:0%
just try and get treatment the more
 
02:29:06.070 --> 02:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
acupunctur we have the more treatment we
 
02:29:10.269 --> 02:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
provide and yes we we we expect that
 
02:29:12.309 --> 02:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
people who are coming here are going to
 
02:29:15.309 --> 02:29:15.319 align:start position:0%
be moral they're going to abide by the
 
02:29:17.389 --> 02:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
rules they're going going to be trained
 
02:29:19.710 --> 02:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
we know they're well trained we know
 
02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
they have clean needle technique
 
02:29:24.030 --> 02:29:24.040 align:start position:0%
certification they pass three boards We
 
02:29:25.469 --> 02:29:25.479 align:start position:0%
Trust in their
 
02:29:27.910 --> 02:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
performance so we have to trust that
 
02:29:30.990 --> 02:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
whoever is advising us already knows the
 
02:29:34.990 --> 02:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:38.269 --> 02:29:38.279 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Midwifery Council we are one

of this bill completely we are a council
 
02:31:34.750 --> 02:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
we have six
 
02:31:36.590 --> 02:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
members an
 
02:31:39.590 --> 02:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
obstetrician a pediatrician three
 
02:31:42.790 --> 02:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
midwives and a public member in this
 
02:31:45.429 --> 02:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
bill an Advisory Board brings us to two
 
02:31:48.670 --> 02:31:48.680 align:start position:0%
midwives and one physician so we would
 
02:31:51.910 --> 02:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
have to pick do we take an obstetrician
 
02:31:54.630 --> 02:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
do we take a pediatrician there is no
 
02:31:56.910 --> 02:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
overlap in their
 
02:32:00.750 --> 02:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
expertise so as the board we pride
 
02:32:04.269 --> 02:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
ourselves on um being there for the
 
02:32:07.070 --> 02:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
public health and safety of people doing
 
02:32:10.309 --> 02:32:10.319 align:start position:0%

in New
 
02:32:14.510 --> 02:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um this Council has a lot
 
02:32:16.630 --> 02:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
of expertise coming into it this this
 
02:32:21.030 --> 02:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
bill scratches that not to mention I
 
02:32:26.269 --> 02:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
read the 47 pages of this bill and our
 
02:32:30.349 --> 02:32:30.359 align:start position:0%
you my part was on page 26 to page 29
 
02:32:33.429 --> 02:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
but I kept on seeing the executive
 
02:32:35.550 --> 02:32:35.560 align:start position:0%
director the power goes to the executive
 
02:32:37.990 --> 02:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
director the executive director will
 
02:32:39.870 --> 02:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
consult with advisory
 
02:32:44.389 --> 02:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
boards but um ultimately the executive
 
02:32:47.269 --> 02:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
director has the say
 
02:32:50.190 --> 02:32:50.200 align:start position:0%
um I will add that we have been working
 
02:32:50.200 --> 02:32:51.070 align:start position:0%
um I will add that we have been working
with

02:32:51.070 --> 02:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:32:54.030 --> 02:32:54.040 align:start position:0%
oplc in the last few
 
02:32:57.429 --> 02:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
years 1999 was the first time the
 
02:33:01.190 --> 02:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
Midwifery law went into effect in um New
 
02:33:04.110 --> 02:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there have been nine
 
02:33:08.550 --> 02:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
repeals on our um I guess that's title
 
02:33:11.469 --> 02:33:11.479 align:start position:0%
30 occupations and professions Midwifery
 
02:33:11.479 --> 02:33:12.590 align:start position:0%
30 occupations and professions Midwifery
nine

02:33:12.590 --> 02:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
nine
 
02:33:15.389 --> 02:33:15.399 align:start position:0%
repeals eight out of those nine repeals
 
02:33:16.710 --> 02:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
have happened
 
02:33:19.950 --> 02:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
in the last two to three years when we
 
02:33:22.990 --> 02:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
have been under
 
02:33:25.349 --> 02:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
State um what is the
 
02:33:27.389 --> 02:33:27.399 align:start position:0%
word State
 
02:33:31.190 --> 02:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
supervision I think the um to reduce
 
02:33:33.269 --> 02:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
Workforce barriers and provide State
 
02:33:35.990 --> 02:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
supervision over regulatory bodies this
 
02:33:39.630 --> 02:33:39.640 align:start position:0%
is in 1271 so we have been working with
 
02:33:42.269 --> 02:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
oplc and they have provided very nice
 
02:33:45.349 --> 02:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
administrative services for us but as
 
02:33:47.389 --> 02:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
we've been having a this relationship
 
02:33:49.590 --> 02:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
more and more repeals have been
 
02:33:53.870 --> 02:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
happening to our Midwifery law and this
 
02:33:56.790 --> 02:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
next step is a huge one to basically cut
 
02:33:59.030 --> 02:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
our our mid burey Council not only does
 
02:34:01.830 --> 02:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
it take away our autonomy it's a very
 
02:34:06.910 --> 02:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
unique profession but it also Cuts our
 
02:34:10.710 --> 02:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
um Council down to three and compromises
 
02:34:13.830 --> 02:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
the expertise going into that so I'll
 
02:34:15.950 --> 02:34:15.960 align:start position:0%

02:35:33.550 --> 02:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
not include nurse midwives so these are
 
02:35:36.670 --> 02:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
we call ourselves Community midwives
 
02:35:38.510 --> 02:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
because we do home birth and birth
 
02:35:41.469 --> 02:35:41.479 align:start position:0%
center birth so we don't do births in
 
02:35:41.479 --> 02:35:43.710 align:start position:0%
center birth so we don't do births in
the

02:35:43.710 --> 02:35:43.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:35:47.750 --> 02:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
hospital follow up thank you one
 
02:35:49.510 --> 02:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
followup to
 
02:35:54.830 --> 02:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
that so you are supervised by Midwife
 
02:35:58.150 --> 02:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
not or your board has doctors
 
02:36:02.429 --> 02:36:02.439 align:start position:0%
obstetrician and pediatrician so but on
 
02:36:05.590 --> 02:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
a supervisory to get your license it is
 
02:36:11.349 --> 02:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
a midwife that provides the so the um
 
02:36:15.030 --> 02:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
as historically this Council has had all
 
02:36:16.990 --> 02:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
of the regulatory
 
02:36:19.710 --> 02:36:19.720 align:start position:0%
autonomy and that's certification
 
02:36:23.190 --> 02:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
discipline making rules and regulations
 
02:36:25.990 --> 02:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
um of late and I believe this is one of
 
02:36:30.590 --> 02:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
the repeals um the oplc is has taken
 
02:36:34.070 --> 02:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
discipline away from the mid rfy Council
 
02:36:36.710 --> 02:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
and um we still are making rules and
 
02:36:39.910 --> 02:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
regulations under Bill 1271 the
 
02:36:43.710 --> 02:36:43.720 align:start position:0%
executive Council the executive director
 
02:36:46.910 --> 02:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
has the the say over our rules and
 
02:36:49.710 --> 02:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
regulations with a consultation of an
 
02:36:53.630 --> 02:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board of three of three people
 
02:36:56.110 --> 02:36:56.120 align:start position:0%
who don't span the expertise so it's
 
02:36:58.950 --> 02:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
just the Midwifery Council has to come
 
02:37:01.510 --> 02:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
out of this bill and I'll follow up with
 
02:37:05.269 --> 02:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:07.389 --> 02:37:07.399 align:start position:0%
repeals seeing no other questions thank
 
02:37:10.389 --> 02:37:10.399 align:start position:0%
you so much for your testimony thank
 
02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:26.070 align:start position:0%
 
reboard

02:37:26.070 --> 02:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:28.830 --> 02:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
good morning and allot for allowing me
 
02:37:31.870 --> 02:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
to speak I am Mark caring I'm a
 
02:37:34.630 --> 02:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
pediatrician who is also on the uh
 
02:37:37.389 --> 02:37:37.399 align:start position:0%
Midwifery board I've been on the m wiffy
 
02:37:40.630 --> 02:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
board for the last 10 years um so I'm
 
02:37:43.110 --> 02:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
the physician representative for
 
02:37:47.190 --> 02:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics and uh I currently um am a
 
02:37:49.670 --> 02:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
nursery rounder at conquered hospital as
 
02:37:52.030 --> 02:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
well so I take care of newborns in my
 
02:37:55.590 --> 02:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
professional life and being a member of
 
02:37:58.230 --> 02:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
the mid rery board is somewhat out of
 
02:38:01.710 --> 02:38:01.720 align:start position:0%
the spectrum for most pediatricians
 
02:38:04.349 --> 02:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
because I'm supporting home
 
02:38:07.389 --> 02:38:07.399 align:start position:0%
birthing um but because I feel that
 
02:38:10.349 --> 02:38:10.359 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire need to have a
 
02:38:14.469 --> 02:38:14.479 align:start position:0%
choice that they can make I support this
 
02:38:17.389 --> 02:38:17.399 align:start position:0%
but I oppose this bill that's being put
 
02:38:19.910 --> 02:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
forward um I think the Midwifery board
 
02:38:23.990 --> 02:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
has done an incredible job in in
 
02:38:28.030 --> 02:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
supervising the midwif fre people in the
 
02:38:30.309 --> 02:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and I think this
 
02:38:32.710 --> 02:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
bill will take that power completely
 
02:38:34.389 --> 02:38:34.399 align:start position:0%
away and I think it's going to give it
 
02:38:36.870 --> 02:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
to an organization that I really feel
 
02:38:39.070 --> 02:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the medical expertise to
 
02:38:41.710 --> 02:38:41.720 align:start position:0%
really take it over and that's my
 
02:38:43.870 --> 02:38:43.880 align:start position:0%
biggest concern because right now we
 
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
have an obstetrician who knows about
 
02:38:48.670 --> 02:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
Women's Care you have a pediatrician who
 
02:38:51.750 --> 02:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
takes care of newborns you have midwives
 
02:38:54.150 --> 02:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
that are in the community taking care of
 
02:38:57.550 --> 02:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
women and we help to supervise that and
 
02:38:59.389 --> 02:38:59.399 align:start position:0%
help with that and I just don't think
 
02:39:03.070 --> 02:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
the oplc has the understanding to do
 
02:39:05.349 --> 02:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
that I mean it's much like I don't see
 
02:39:07.349 --> 02:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine I don't see the
 
02:39:09.750 --> 02:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
board of dentistry I don't see the uh
 
02:39:12.790 --> 02:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing being taken over by the
 
02:39:16.269 --> 02:39:16.279 align:start position:0%
oplc and I feel our committee is in that
 
02:39:17.269 --> 02:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
02:39:19.910 --> 02:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
Stratus that we take care of patients
 
02:39:21.870 --> 02:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of medical expertise
 
02:39:23.510 --> 02:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
that you need to have that they just
 
02:39:27.030 --> 02:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
don't have and so I think also when we
 
02:39:29.269 --> 02:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
talk about what they're proposing of
 
02:39:32.710 --> 02:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
their being only a thre member board it
 
02:39:34.710 --> 02:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
shows a true lack of under
 
02:39:37.590 --> 02:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding by the oplc of exactly
 
02:39:40.349 --> 02:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
what we do and so that's the reason I
 
02:39:41.429 --> 02:39:41.439 align:start position:0%
oppose the
 
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
bill great uh do you take questions
 
02:39:47.750 --> 02:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely representative manui thank
 
02:39:49.590 --> 02:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
02:39:53.269 --> 02:39:53.279 align:start position:0%
question how is this community mid viery
 
02:39:56.830 --> 02:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
has being able to provide much needed
 
02:40:00.190 --> 02:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
care in rural New Hampshire where the
 
02:40:04.710 --> 02:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
access to uh Hospital might be an hour
 
02:40:06.950 --> 02:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
away or two hours away well it all
 
02:40:09.190 --> 02:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
depends so you know certainly in New
 
02:40:10.230 --> 02:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the biggest thing we're
 
02:40:13.269 --> 02:40:13.279 align:start position:0%
running into is the fact that more and
 
02:40:16.150 --> 02:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
more hospitals are are reducing their
 
02:40:18.389 --> 02:40:18.399 align:start position:0%
maternity care so you just can't birth a
 
02:40:20.990 --> 02:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
baby in some areas of New Hampshire
 
02:40:23.830 --> 02:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
because hospitals can no longer support
 
02:40:27.990 --> 02:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
the medical staff to to birth so that
 
02:40:29.469 --> 02:40:29.479 align:start position:0%
does give the
 
02:40:33.230 --> 02:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity that there can be
 
02:40:35.910 --> 02:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
Community birthing
 
02:40:38.750 --> 02:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
care that could be available it would be
 
02:40:42.670 --> 02:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
with a with a midwife who tend to be in
 
02:40:44.510 --> 02:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
those sort of rural
 
02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:47.269 align:start position:0%
those sort of rural
areas

02:40:47.269 --> 02:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
areas
 
02:40:49.190 --> 02:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
02:40:51.510 --> 02:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
Brown uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:40:53.550 --> 02:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh following
 
02:40:55.990 --> 02:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
up on some of the other uh testimony and
 
02:40:59.469 --> 02:40:59.479 align:start position:0%
represent goalie's question um do you
 
02:41:04.469 --> 02:41:04.479 align:start position:0%
see that this if passed would eliminate
 
02:41:07.190 --> 02:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
Workforce barriers for midwives wanting
 
02:41:09.670 --> 02:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
to work in New
 
02:41:13.950 --> 02:41:13.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it I I'm not sure actually but
 
02:41:17.550 --> 02:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
it there there's always been sort of an
 
02:41:23.269 --> 02:41:23.279 align:start position:0%
an issue between sort of the medical o
 
02:41:27.870 --> 02:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
epical care and midwives in a sense and
 
02:41:30.710 --> 02:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
so it all depends on who they elect or
 
02:41:34.990 --> 02:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
who gets placed on the as that advisory
 
02:41:38.309 --> 02:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
physician if you actually had an
 
02:41:41.710 --> 02:41:41.720 align:start position:0%
OBGYN that was opposed to Midwifery you
 
02:41:44.309 --> 02:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
could have a complete change in the
 
02:41:46.070 --> 02:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
whole setting of mid wiffy in the state
 
02:41:47.309 --> 02:41:47.319 align:start position:0%
of New
 
02:41:49.389 --> 02:41:49.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh thank you that's fair thank
 
02:41:51.389 --> 02:41:51.399 align:start position:0%
you yes representative
 
02:41:55.309 --> 02:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
Gro thank you so perhaps because this
 
02:41:58.670 --> 02:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
bill says that it's supposed to
 
02:42:01.070 --> 02:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
eliminate Workforce barriers and provide
 
02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:02.230 align:start position:0%
eliminate Workforce barriers and provide
St

02:42:02.230 --> 02:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
St
 
02:42:04.349 --> 02:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
supervision I think what we're trying to
 
02:42:06.230 --> 02:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
do is really get to the nut of the
 
02:42:08.870 --> 02:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
matter and I think what changes the
 
02:42:12.429 --> 02:42:12.439 align:start position:0%
changes to advisory boards I think we
 
02:42:16.190 --> 02:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
really affects the potential quality of
 
02:42:17.990 --> 02:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
care that
 
02:42:20.830 --> 02:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
our residents our New Hampshire Gran
 
02:42:23.389 --> 02:42:23.399 align:start position:0%
Staters would receive is that can you
 
02:42:24.990 --> 02:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
comment on that because we're we're all
 
02:42:27.269 --> 02:42:27.279 align:start position:0%
we're focused on the efficiency yet
 
02:42:29.349 --> 02:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
there's nothing about quality of care
 
02:42:31.469 --> 02:42:31.479 align:start position:0%
here and my concern is that this
 
02:42:35.269 --> 02:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
Direction takes some of these boards
 
02:42:35.279 --> 02:42:37.309 align:start position:0%
Direction takes some of these boards
into

02:42:37.309 --> 02:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:42:41.309 --> 02:42:41.319 align:start position:0%
potential um what's the word unforeseen
 
02:42:43.790 --> 02:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances regarding quality of care
 
02:42:45.429 --> 02:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
so could you comment on that please
 
02:42:47.790 --> 02:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
where I think this is shortsighted is
 
02:42:50.429 --> 02:42:50.439 align:start position:0%
because when you do look at and as I
 
02:42:53.590 --> 02:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
said before we're a medical board I
 
02:42:55.110 --> 02:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
don't see the Board of Medicine I don't
 
02:42:57.070 --> 02:42:57.080 align:start position:0%
see the board of dentistry I don't see
 
02:42:59.429 --> 02:42:59.439 align:start position:0%
the Board of Nursing being put into this
 
02:43:02.469 --> 02:43:02.479 align:start position:0%
role but yet we are when I feel that our
 
02:43:05.309 --> 02:43:05.319 align:start position:0%
board does the medical care it looks
 
02:43:08.670 --> 02:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
over it it well we don't have the
 
02:43:10.790 --> 02:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
license you're in a sense anymore we get
 
02:43:13.150 --> 02:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
the we get the clearance once it goes to
 
02:43:16.389 --> 02:43:16.399 align:start position:0%
op but the other part is is that when
 
02:43:19.790 --> 02:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
you look at the sort of medical
 
02:43:22.670 --> 02:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
supervision that we give to the midwives
 
02:43:24.510 --> 02:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
that is really what our function is and
 
02:43:27.469 --> 02:43:27.479 align:start position:0%
raising the standard to a certain bar
 
02:43:29.349 --> 02:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
and I think that you know certainly with
 
02:43:33.389 --> 02:43:33.399 align:start position:0%
an Advisory Board again the what
 
02:43:35.110 --> 02:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
information comes in is going to be
 
02:43:37.429 --> 02:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
first screened and then asked to the
 
02:43:39.630 --> 02:43:39.640 align:start position:0%
person if that person doesn't have that
 
02:43:41.830 --> 02:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
medical expertise to even know what
 
02:43:41.840 --> 02:43:43.030 align:start position:0%
medical expertise to even know what
they're

02:43:43.030 --> 02:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:43:45.429 --> 02:43:45.439 align:start position:0%
seeing that's I I think is just just
 
02:43:47.710 --> 02:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
02:43:51.190 --> 02:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
dismal thank you uh representative Shu
 
02:43:54.110 --> 02:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I've kind of
 
02:43:56.710 --> 02:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
addressed this issue previously and I
 
02:44:02.110 --> 02:44:02.120 align:start position:0%
recall hearing that um midwives are a
 
02:44:06.150 --> 02:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
great deal of Health Care for Women
 
02:44:09.070 --> 02:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
particularly in rural areas the North
 
02:44:12.469 --> 02:44:12.479 align:start position:0%
country of New Hampshire where perhaps a
 
02:44:14.710 --> 02:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
medical professional such as your heal
 
02:44:14.720 --> 02:44:15.710 align:start position:0%
medical professional such as your heal
yourself

02:44:15.710 --> 02:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
02:44:18.469 --> 02:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
is not readily available would you see
 
02:44:20.309 --> 02:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
that that's still the
 
02:44:23.550 --> 02:44:23.560 align:start position:0%
case yeah I I think that's an issue
 
02:44:27.349 --> 02:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire is that you
 
02:44:30.469 --> 02:44:30.479 align:start position:0%
know it's it's so interesting as healthc
 
02:44:34.070 --> 02:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
care has become more for profit um and
 
02:44:36.790 --> 02:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
you know it's no longer being subsidized
 
02:44:39.590 --> 02:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's no longer I mean and you see that
 
02:44:42.389 --> 02:44:42.399 align:start position:0%
because you just can't support a
 
02:44:45.590 --> 02:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
hospital you're closing different areas
 
02:44:49.030 --> 02:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
Obstetricians require you know at least
 
02:44:51.429 --> 02:44:51.439 align:start position:0%
three Obstetricians in one area so that
 
02:44:53.429 --> 02:44:53.439 align:start position:0%
you can cover call and do everything and
 
02:44:55.830 --> 02:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
have a life and you can find that
 
02:44:57.630 --> 02:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
hospitals just can't afford them anymore
 
02:44:59.030 --> 02:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
so that's what's New Hampshire's running
 
02:45:01.910 --> 02:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
into anyway is the fact that you just
 
02:45:04.550 --> 02:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
can't you you're seeing us the the the
 
02:45:07.230 --> 02:45:07.240 align:start position:0%
birthing centers being put in larger
 
02:45:09.670 --> 02:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
areas where they can afford to have more
 
02:45:11.910 --> 02:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
Physicians and you can actually have a
 
02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
professional life and a personal
 
02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:16.950 align:start position:0%
professional life and a personal
life

02:45:16.950 --> 02:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
life
 
02:45:19.070 --> 02:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative gold thank you Mr
 
02:45:20.550 --> 02:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:45:23.269 --> 02:45:23.279 align:start position:0%
question I I have a few questions trying
 
02:45:25.750 --> 02:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
to understand I could have asked anybody
 
02:45:29.349 --> 02:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you who's testified but um my
 
02:45:31.510 --> 02:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
first question is are you paid as a
 
02:45:34.750 --> 02:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
board member nope it's all okay follow
 
02:45:40.110 --> 02:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:45.389 --> 02:45:45.399 align:start position:0%
um if the Advisory Board in the bill was
 
02:45:47.510 --> 02:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
written in such a way that it would
 
02:45:49.870 --> 02:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
maintain the same
 
02:45:53.590 --> 02:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
members would you oppose have the same
 
02:45:55.110 --> 02:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
opposition would that lessen your
 
02:45:57.150 --> 02:45:57.160 align:start position:0%
opposition to it I still would I still
 
02:46:01.790 --> 02:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
would I I again I I I go back to that I
 
02:46:05.590 --> 02:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
just don't feel feel the oplc has the
 
02:46:05.600 --> 02:46:07.110 align:start position:0%
just don't feel feel the oplc has the
medical

02:46:07.110 --> 02:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
medical
 
02:46:11.230 --> 02:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
expertise to review these cases and I
 
02:46:12.469 --> 02:46:12.479 align:start position:0%
understand that I don't mean to cut you
 
02:46:17.830 --> 02:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
off right no um so the question I have
 
02:46:20.550 --> 02:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
is if you're volunteer would there be
 
02:46:22.590 --> 02:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
anything and and you may not have the
 
02:46:24.349 --> 02:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
whole answer to this but would there be
 
02:46:27.469 --> 02:46:27.479 align:start position:0%
anything precluding you all from
 
02:46:30.269 --> 02:46:30.279 align:start position:0%
continuing to meet regularly and provide
 
02:46:32.429 --> 02:46:32.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of the work that you're doing and
 
02:46:36.150 --> 02:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
be available if oplc had any technical
 
02:46:37.630 --> 02:46:37.640 align:start position:0%
questions which they're already doing
 
02:46:40.910 --> 02:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
the licensing correct correct but not
 
02:46:43.830 --> 02:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
they're not doing the medical case
 
02:46:47.110 --> 02:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
reviews and and that's what we we review
 
02:46:49.870 --> 02:46:49.880 align:start position:0%
so if someone has a complaint we review
 
02:46:52.830 --> 02:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
it if in fact our
 
02:46:56.790 --> 02:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
board has a form that if anyone is
 
02:46:59.790 --> 02:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
transferred to the hospital mother or
 
02:47:02.389 --> 02:47:02.399 align:start position:0%
infant that is brought before the board
 
02:47:04.110 --> 02:47:04.120 align:start position:0%
and reviewed
 
02:47:08.710 --> 02:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
so we we just don't work on patient
 
02:47:13.790 --> 02:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
complaints we also are supervising and
 
02:47:16.630 --> 02:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
doing an overview of Midwifery practice
 
02:47:19.349 --> 02:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
in the state of New
 
02:47:22.670 --> 02:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire okay thank you yeah and I
 
02:47:25.630 --> 02:47:25.640 align:start position:0%
guess in I just don't think the oplc can
 
02:47:28.750 --> 02:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
take that on one last followup sure so
 
02:47:30.309 --> 02:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
it's your understanding that through
 
02:47:34.110 --> 02:47:34.120 align:start position:0%
this bill that um that review role that
 
02:47:36.230 --> 02:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
the board's currently doing would no
 
02:47:39.830 --> 02:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
longer be done by the advisory committee
 
02:47:43.429 --> 02:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
I I don't know exactly what the Advisory
 
02:47:45.590 --> 02:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
Board other than some someone saying I
 
02:47:48.070 --> 02:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
have a case we want you to look at it
 
02:47:51.070 --> 02:47:51.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that will help me to
 
02:47:53.990 --> 02:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
follow up with questions later on thank
 
02:47:56.309 --> 02:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony thank
 
02:47:58.030 --> 02:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
you yes and the executive director will
 
02:47:59.510 --> 02:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
be giving testimony so I'm sure she can
 
02:48:03.510 --> 02:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
clarify the intent there um do
 
02:48:05.510 --> 02:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
Juvia hi
 
02:48:10.950 --> 02:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:14.269 --> 02:48:14.279 align:start position:0%
office that's correct uh good morning
 
02:48:15.950 --> 02:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
still for five more minutes just for the
 
02:48:18.030 --> 02:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
record D jurus from Governor cun's
 
02:48:19.750 --> 02:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
office uh just here to make myself
 
02:48:21.990 --> 02:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
available for any questions for the
 
02:48:24.830 --> 02:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
committee any
 
02:48:28.030 --> 02:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
02:48:32.030 --> 02:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
goie thank you Mr chair and um ask you
 
02:48:33.830 --> 02:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
the same question I've asked others as
 
02:48:36.110 --> 02:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
to the statement about reducing barriers
 
02:48:38.469 --> 02:48:38.479 align:start position:0%
and how going from a board to advisory
 
02:48:40.710 --> 02:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
is doing that because I
 
02:48:44.790 --> 02:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
thought by us giving oplc the ability to
 
02:48:46.550 --> 02:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
move licensing along as long as the
 
02:48:48.670 --> 02:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
person met qualifications was already
 
02:48:50.510 --> 02:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
doing that process and I'm not sure how
 
02:48:52.429 --> 02:48:52.439 align:start position:0%
making boards
 
02:48:55.790 --> 02:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
advisory expands upon that if you could
 
02:48:58.110 --> 02:48:58.120 align:start position:0%
explain why that statement's in here and
 
02:49:01.269 --> 02:49:01.279 align:start position:0%
how this reduces barriers yeah happy to
 
02:49:03.790 --> 02:49:03.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and um I I
 
02:49:05.910 --> 02:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
think you make a fair point um I think
 
02:49:07.710 --> 02:49:07.720 align:start position:0%
that was the kind of the general purpose
 
02:49:10.469 --> 02:49:10.479 align:start position:0%
statement for a number of the priorities
 
02:49:13.710 --> 02:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
for the reg regul regulatory reform
 
02:49:16.389 --> 02:49:16.399 align:start position:0%
which this bill was included in taking a
 
02:49:18.910 --> 02:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
look more broadly at the licensing um
 
02:49:20.389 --> 02:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
the boards across the board and
 
02:49:24.309 --> 02:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
Workforce in general um I think a more
 
02:49:27.550 --> 02:49:27.560 align:start position:0%
accurate uh description of the intent
 
02:49:29.510 --> 02:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
for this specific
 
02:49:31.830 --> 02:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
legislation um I think part of it was
 
02:49:34.429 --> 02:49:34.439 align:start position:0%
definitely looking at the the increase
 
02:49:36.910 --> 02:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
in liability because of the lower number
 
02:49:39.070 --> 02:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
of lenses and and director Courtney will
 
02:49:41.630 --> 02:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
speak more specifically to this but um
 
02:49:43.510 --> 02:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
kind of the coff metric we used was
 
02:49:46.710 --> 02:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
under 200 licens genes was recommending
 
02:49:47.870 --> 02:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
and then under a certain number of
 
02:49:50.590 --> 02:49:50.600 align:start position:0%
complaints recommended to go to advisory
 
02:49:52.030 --> 02:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
um and as this committee is really
 
02:49:55.150 --> 02:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
familiar with the um the board of dental
 
02:49:56.830 --> 02:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
examiners out of North Carolina Supreme
 
02:49:59.150 --> 02:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
Court case where board members can be
 
02:50:02.269 --> 02:50:02.279 align:start position:0%
held personally liable for antitrust
 
02:50:05.070 --> 02:50:05.080 align:start position:0%
violations against other professionals
 
02:50:07.750 --> 02:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
um I think this this U group is also
 
02:50:10.670 --> 02:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
aware that the the state of Vermont uh
 
02:50:12.229 --> 02:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
all of their boards including their
 
02:50:14.190 --> 02:50:14.200 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine their Board of Nursing
 
02:50:17.389 --> 02:50:17.399 align:start position:0%
are advisory specifically because of
 
02:50:20.990 --> 02:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
that liability concern um so it's it's
 
02:50:23.269 --> 02:50:23.279 align:start position:0%
not a a value statement of the
 
02:50:25.590 --> 02:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
profession or the importance or even
 
02:50:27.469 --> 02:50:27.479 align:start position:0%
health and safety in that regard because
 
02:50:29.389 --> 02:50:29.399 align:start position:0%
the licensing protections are still in
 
02:50:31.790 --> 02:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
place um but the mechanism of that
 
02:50:34.590 --> 02:50:34.600 align:start position:0%
advisory role removes the liability from
 
02:50:36.349 --> 02:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
the individuals on the board those
 
02:50:38.510 --> 02:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
volunteers who are also professionals
 
02:50:40.590 --> 02:50:40.600 align:start position:0%
with livelihoods and places that solely
 
02:50:41.870 --> 02:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
on the state who would take the
 
02:50:43.870 --> 02:50:43.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement action so I would say that's
 
02:50:46.150 --> 02:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
the that would be the
 
02:50:48.750 --> 02:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
primary push behind this specific
 
02:50:51.469 --> 02:50:51.479 align:start position:0%
legislation and the workforce barriers
 
02:50:54.630 --> 02:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
is more um that's a a broader picture
 
02:50:56.349 --> 02:50:56.359 align:start position:0%
that that purpose statement is kind of
 
02:50:58.670 --> 02:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
included in all of the legislation that
 
02:51:00.389 --> 02:51:00.399 align:start position:0%
you've seen about this regulatory reform
 
02:51:01.990 --> 02:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
so I hope that helps clear it up I think
 
02:51:03.710 --> 02:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
your point is well
 
02:51:07.229 --> 02:51:07.239 align:start position:0%
taken uh yes followup
 
02:51:09.309 --> 02:51:09.319 align:start position:0%
representative and
 
02:51:12.830 --> 02:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
I understand the court case that came
 
02:51:17.590 --> 02:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
forward question but I also thought that
 
02:51:19.990 --> 02:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
by giving the authority of the executive
 
02:51:23.990 --> 02:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
director to review applicants and pro
 
02:51:26.870 --> 02:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:29.469 --> 02:51:29.479 align:start position:0%
licensing was a way of solving that
 
02:51:30.830 --> 02:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
problem and not the board's doing the
 
02:51:33.710 --> 02:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
licensing and approving licensing
 
02:51:37.229 --> 02:51:37.239 align:start position:0%
themselves am I wrong
 
02:51:40.750 --> 02:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
in as to a reason why we went that way I
 
02:51:42.309 --> 02:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
I think you are correct that was a big
 
02:51:44.070 --> 02:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of the workforce barriers and
 
02:51:45.750 --> 02:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
expedite in the process that's the
 
02:51:48.190 --> 02:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
reason that we went that direction uh
 
02:51:49.830 --> 02:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
when I say we really you right it was
 
02:51:51.309 --> 02:51:51.319 align:start position:0%
your subcommittee that did the work that
 
02:51:54.150 --> 02:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
determined that this was needed um and
 
02:51:55.469 --> 02:51:55.479 align:start position:0%
and then pass the bills in the last
 
02:51:57.510 --> 02:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
legislative session so I would agree
 
02:51:58.950 --> 02:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
with you that was a big piece of it on
 
02:52:01.590 --> 02:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
that efficiencies the liability I think
 
02:52:04.190 --> 02:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
is still there because they are
 
02:52:06.229 --> 02:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
ultimately making that determination the
 
02:52:08.830 --> 02:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
investigation is still happening with
 
02:52:10.750 --> 02:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
well is now happening with the office
 
02:52:12.309 --> 02:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
but I I do still think there's that
 
02:52:14.190 --> 02:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
decision with the board so I don't think
 
02:52:16.950 --> 02:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
that liabilities totally removed for
 
02:52:19.229 --> 02:52:19.239 align:start position:0%
licensing board as ex exists and any
 
02:52:21.070 --> 02:52:21.080 align:start position:0%
other specifics I will I will defer to
 
02:52:23.590 --> 02:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
director Courtney yeah yes
 
02:52:23.600 --> 02:52:25.229 align:start position:0%
director Courtney yeah yes
representative

02:52:25.229 --> 02:52:25.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:52:27.830 --> 02:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
groa maybe this question is better for
 
02:52:30.309 --> 02:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
representative Gro representative I mean
 
02:52:32.750 --> 02:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh oh my god um you're giving her a
 
02:52:35.429 --> 02:52:35.439 align:start position:0%
promotion executive director Courtney
 
02:52:39.030 --> 02:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
but um when you talk about licensing
 
02:52:41.510 --> 02:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
less than 200 lenses and the number of
 
02:52:45.110 --> 02:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
complaints aren't those um
 
02:52:46.990 --> 02:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
how did you I mean is was there a
 
02:52:48.590 --> 02:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
mechanism to determine whether or not
 
02:52:51.070 --> 02:52:51.080 align:start position:0%
the complaints were a result
 
02:52:55.910 --> 02:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
of of uh bored inefficiencies or bored
 
02:52:58.110 --> 02:52:58.120 align:start position:0%
inexperience or you know I mean just
 
02:52:59.429 --> 02:52:59.439 align:start position:0%
have the number of complaints it could
 
02:53:01.830 --> 02:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
be complaints against licensing which
 
02:53:04.389 --> 02:53:04.399 align:start position:0%
you know we took care of in the last so
 
02:53:06.150 --> 02:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to have more definition of
 
02:53:09.389 --> 02:53:09.399 align:start position:0%
that and I um also would like to comment
 
02:53:11.590 --> 02:53:11.600 align:start position:0%
that the fact that you know you put this
 
02:53:13.790 --> 02:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
broad thing and then you P you know as
 
02:53:17.309 --> 02:53:17.319 align:start position:0%
far as removing barriers and then put
 
02:53:21.469 --> 02:53:21.479 align:start position:0%
all these boards in here under you know
 
02:53:23.190 --> 02:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
something where your intentions are
 
02:53:25.510 --> 02:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
quite different I think changes the
 
02:53:27.150 --> 02:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
whole focus of
 
02:53:29.389 --> 02:53:29.399 align:start position:0%
this of this
 
02:53:31.950 --> 02:53:31.960 align:start position:0%
group can you comment on that yeah I'd
 
02:53:33.429 --> 02:53:33.439 align:start position:0%
be happy to I think I addressed a lot of
 
02:53:34.870 --> 02:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
that in my response to representative
 
02:53:38.070 --> 02:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
goalie but I will also
 
02:53:40.910 --> 02:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
say as a former member of the House and
 
02:53:42.190 --> 02:53:42.200 align:start position:0%
as someone who spent a lot of time with
 
02:53:43.710 --> 02:53:43.720 align:start position:0%
legislation I think purpose statements
 
02:53:46.229 --> 02:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
can get uh challenging they can kind of
 
02:53:49.190 --> 02:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
Muddy the statute um so for me
 
02:53:50.910 --> 02:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
personally I'm not I'm not sure that
 
02:53:52.590 --> 02:53:52.600 align:start position:0%
they're necessarily helpful be because
 
02:53:55.389 --> 02:53:55.399 align:start position:0%
of exactly what you're mentioning um so
 
02:53:57.070 --> 02:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
I think like I said I think it was kind
 
02:53:58.750 --> 02:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
of a broad piece that was attached to
 
02:54:02.229 --> 02:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
each of those um and I do I do
 
02:54:03.710 --> 02:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
understand that the your point is well
 
02:54:05.990 --> 02:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
taken about the text on the page does
 
02:54:07.990 --> 02:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
not tell the whole story I think that is
 
02:54:09.389 --> 02:54:09.399 align:start position:0%
often the case I think we all read
 
02:54:11.750 --> 02:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
legislation and say what what prompted
 
02:54:13.190 --> 02:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
that what possibly could have prompted
 
02:54:16.710 --> 02:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:19.830 --> 02:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
hearings representative man py thank you
 
02:54:22.630 --> 02:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
Mr CH thank you for taking my question
 
02:54:27.590 --> 02:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
um in terms of a broad sweep just taking
 
02:54:31.349 --> 02:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
under 200 lenses less complaints or no
 
02:54:34.830 --> 02:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
complaints whatever um that's one
 
02:54:37.990 --> 02:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
arbitrary measure that was taken to kind
 
02:54:41.030 --> 02:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
of list all the boards when you talk
 
02:54:44.630 --> 02:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
about other states which are advised
 
02:54:47.710 --> 02:54:47.720 align:start position:0%
board are the volunteer advisory boards
 
02:54:50.349 --> 02:54:50.359 align:start position:0%
or are they paid advisory boards or a
 
02:54:52.630 --> 02:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
professional Advisory board has that
 
02:54:52.640 --> 02:54:54.229 align:start position:0%
professional Advisory board has that
been

02:54:54.229 --> 02:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:54:56.990 --> 02:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
compared thank you for the question I do
 
02:54:58.429 --> 02:54:58.439 align:start position:0%
not know the answer to that I'd be happy
 
02:55:00.269 --> 02:55:00.279 align:start position:0%
to look into that for you um director
 
02:55:03.469 --> 02:55:03.479 align:start position:0%
courner may also know um for that case
 
02:55:05.870 --> 02:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
as well um as you know though it is all
 
02:55:07.389 --> 02:55:07.399 align:start position:0%
volunteers in New Hampshire whether it's
 
02:55:09.110 --> 02:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
professionals or public
 
02:55:12.710 --> 02:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
members I would also say um the cut off
 
02:55:17.670 --> 02:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
of 200 was a deliber choice but it the
 
02:55:20.670 --> 02:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
idea was to not discriminate based on
 
02:55:24.030 --> 02:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
what profession or how important anyone
 
02:55:26.990 --> 02:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
individual thought that was but to say
 
02:55:31.550 --> 02:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
here's objective an objective uh not
 
02:55:34.349 --> 02:55:34.359 align:start position:0%
yeah a not subjective way to say below
 
02:55:37.590 --> 02:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
this number will convert to advisory um
 
02:55:39.830 --> 02:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
just because the ratio of board members
 
02:55:39.840 --> 02:55:40.630 align:start position:0%
just because the ratio of board members
to

02:55:40.630 --> 02:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:55:43.269 --> 02:55:43.279 align:start position:0%
lenses gets higher the smaller number of
 
02:55:45.670 --> 02:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
lenses and the larger number of board
 
02:55:47.910 --> 02:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
members so it it was meant to be a more
 
02:55:49.309 --> 02:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
objective measure rather than just
 
02:55:51.990 --> 02:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
saying well you know such and such
 
02:55:53.590 --> 02:55:53.600 align:start position:0%
profession is yeah they're fine they're
 
02:55:55.269 --> 02:55:55.279 align:start position:0%
doing okay there's only a few of them we
 
02:55:56.750 --> 02:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
can just make them advisory that was
 
02:55:59.469 --> 02:55:59.479 align:start position:0%
that really was not the calculus so just
 
02:56:01.990 --> 02:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
for clarification on that point you're
 
02:56:03.950 --> 02:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
saying the 200 cuto off isn't so much
 
02:56:05.670 --> 02:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
about the two the number of the 200 it's
 
02:56:08.190 --> 02:56:08.200 align:start position:0%
the the ratio between the board members
 
02:56:11.070 --> 02:56:11.080 align:start position:0%
and the lenses and how how tight that
 
02:56:13.429 --> 02:56:13.439 align:start position:0%
ratio is that that's how the 200 number
 
02:56:17.349 --> 02:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
was was decided was to say that the the
 
02:56:19.910 --> 02:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
risk of antitrust violations or
 
02:56:22.429 --> 02:56:22.439 align:start position:0%
liability would increase as that
 
02:56:24.590 --> 02:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
percentage is larger right to board
 
02:56:25.710 --> 02:56:25.720 align:start position:0%
members to
 
02:56:29.349 --> 02:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
licenses so if you have um you know five
 
02:56:31.389 --> 02:56:31.399 align:start position:0%
board members and 50
 
02:56:35.469 --> 02:56:35.479 align:start position:0%
lenses then you're you're taking 10 10%
 
02:56:37.389 --> 02:56:37.399 align:start position:0%
of the profession is advising the whole
 
02:56:40.510 --> 02:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
piece so there's greater opportunity for
 
02:56:42.229 --> 02:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
that potential and not saying anything
 
02:56:45.110 --> 02:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
about motives of members at all um but
 
02:56:47.870 --> 02:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
just that potential liability exists
 
02:56:50.070 --> 02:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
there thank you representative Brown did
 
02:56:54.070 --> 02:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:59.670 --> 02:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:02.710 --> 02:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
questions you're under the gun we can
 
02:57:06.269 --> 02:57:06.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:09.630 --> 02:57:09.640 align:start position:0%
like so based on on your answer to
 
02:57:09.640 --> 02:57:12.590 align:start position:0%
like so based on on your answer to
representative

02:57:12.590 --> 02:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:17.070 --> 02:57:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:21.349 --> 02:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
if we can fix a liability problem that
 
02:57:23.190 --> 02:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
all the boards can stay the way they are
 
02:57:27.510 --> 02:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:30.870 --> 02:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
doing with reservations I will say yes
 
02:57:33.389 --> 02:57:33.399 align:start position:0%
if we can fix the liability problem I'm
 
02:57:36.870 --> 02:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
not sure what that mechanism would look
 
02:57:39.349 --> 02:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
like given of the that it's a US Supreme
 
02:57:42.990 --> 02:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
Court decision but in theory yes thank
 
02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:44.830 align:start position:0%
Court decision but in theory yes thank
you

02:57:44.830 --> 02:57:44.840 align:start position:0%

Courtney and if you would be so kind
 
02:57:55.190 --> 02:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
during your testimony to clarify the
 
02:57:57.389 --> 02:57:57.399 align:start position:0%
difference between the board and
 
02:58:07.429 --> 02:58:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:09.990 --> 02:58:10.000 align:start position:0%

02:58:16.990 --> 02:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
certification and with me is our general
 
02:58:18.349 --> 02:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
councel Douglas
 
02:58:22.670 --> 02:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
osterhout um so I I think there's a a a
 
02:58:23.510 --> 02:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
02:58:26.070 --> 02:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding about what an Advisory
 
02:58:29.710 --> 02:58:29.720 align:start position:0%
Board is what the purpose is um and I
 
02:58:31.190 --> 02:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
just I just want to give a brief
 
02:58:32.670 --> 02:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
overview I know that some of you
 
02:58:35.429 --> 02:58:35.439 align:start position:0%
probably already know this um but we do
 
02:58:37.429 --> 02:58:37.439 align:start position:0%
have seven advisory boards already in
 
02:58:40.269 --> 02:58:40.279 align:start position:0%
existence in New Hampshire and they work
 
02:58:42.670 --> 02:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
very well and they're in they cover very
 
02:58:44.429 --> 02:58:44.439 align:start position:0%
different fields
 
02:58:47.349 --> 02:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
um but essentially uh it's a different
 
02:58:50.550 --> 02:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
regulatory model that provides State
 
02:58:53.229 --> 02:58:53.239 align:start position:0%
supervision and in the last 10 years a
 
02:58:55.110 --> 02:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
lot of States including Vermont have
 
02:58:59.349 --> 02:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
started to move in the direction of um
 
02:59:02.710 --> 02:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
providing active State supervision over
 
02:59:04.269 --> 02:59:04.279 align:start position:0%
what what were their independent
 
02:59:06.309 --> 02:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
regulatory boards and it really stems
 
02:59:09.469 --> 02:59:09.479 align:start position:0%
from the 2015 Supreme Court case North
 
02:59:12.750 --> 02:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
Carolina um Dental examiners and
 
02:59:15.070 --> 02:59:15.080 align:start position:0%
basically in that case North Carolina
 
02:59:17.190 --> 02:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
Dental Board issued a bunch of cease and
 
02:59:20.389 --> 02:59:20.399 align:start position:0%
disce to individuals um who were not
 
02:59:22.710 --> 02:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
dentists saying you need to stop
 
02:59:25.150 --> 02:59:25.160 align:start position:0%
advertising for teeth whing because that
 
02:59:27.670 --> 02:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
is the practice of dentistry and the
 
02:59:29.790 --> 02:59:29.800 align:start position:0%
federal government stepped in and said
 
02:59:31.790 --> 02:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
um essentially this is an
 
02:59:34.510 --> 02:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive act um you're trying to
 
02:59:34.520 --> 02:59:35.790 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive act um you're trying to
limit

02:59:35.790 --> 02:59:35.800 align:start position:0%
limit
 
02:59:38.309 --> 02:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
competition the state took the position
 
02:59:41.070 --> 02:59:41.080 align:start position:0%
that they were Li they were immune um
 
02:59:43.950 --> 02:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
because they were acting um as the North
 
02:59:45.630 --> 02:59:45.640 align:start position:0%
Carolina regulatory board they were
 
02:59:47.510 --> 02:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
acting as the state so they were immune
 
02:59:50.469 --> 02:59:50.479 align:start position:0%
from liability under the Sherman Act the
 
02:59:52.670 --> 02:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court said no uh and the reason
 
02:59:56.309 --> 02:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
for that was this board like most of our
 
02:59:58.950 --> 02:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
boards in New Hampshire are comprised
 
03:00:01.030 --> 03:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
primarily a majority of active Market
 
03:00:03.710 --> 03:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
participants and what this means is they
 
03:00:05.550 --> 03:00:05.560 align:start position:0%
work in the field they are
 
03:00:08.990 --> 03:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
lenes and what the Supreme Court said is
 
03:00:10.550 --> 03:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
you know essentially without passing
 
03:00:13.309 --> 03:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
judgment it is very hard almost
 
03:00:16.550 --> 03:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
impossible POS for people to wear two
 
03:00:20.870 --> 03:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
hats um it is it's very hard for them to
 
03:00:24.710 --> 03:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
um not uh regulate when they have this
 
03:00:26.229 --> 03:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
bias which is that they're business
 
03:00:28.309 --> 03:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
owners and they're also Professionals in
 
03:00:30.710 --> 03:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
the field and so unless the state is
 
03:00:32.750 --> 03:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
going to provide what they call Active
 
03:00:32.760 --> 03:00:33.630 align:start position:0%
going to provide what they call Active
State

03:00:33.630 --> 03:00:33.640 align:start position:0%
State
 
03:00:35.870 --> 03:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
supervision uh the state is not immune
 
03:00:38.070 --> 03:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
from liability and so as a result of
 
03:00:41.550 --> 03:00:41.560 align:start position:0%
that um which was kind of a um it was a
 
03:00:43.870 --> 03:00:43.880 align:start position:0%
very important case in the field of of
 
03:00:45.990 --> 03:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
Occupational regulation because of that
 
03:00:47.229 --> 03:00:47.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of states started moving in the
 
03:00:49.429 --> 03:00:49.439 align:start position:0%
direction of providing State supervision
 
03:00:50.710 --> 03:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
now there are a couple of ways to do
 
03:00:53.150 --> 03:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
this advisory model is one which is
 
03:00:55.750 --> 03:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
essentially you utilize the expertise of
 
03:00:58.229 --> 03:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
the board members but you give State
 
03:00:59.870 --> 03:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
oversight and somebody who's not an
 
03:01:01.510 --> 03:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
active participant that'll that'll
 
03:01:03.190 --> 03:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
Shield you from liability that is one
 
03:01:05.790 --> 03:01:05.800 align:start position:0%
model and we have that in our state the
 
03:01:07.469 --> 03:01:07.479 align:start position:0%
other model is to just completely
 
03:01:09.910 --> 03:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
eliminate the board and just put it all
 
03:01:12.670 --> 03:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
in the hands of a state body um or a
 
03:01:15.469 --> 03:01:15.479 align:start position:0%
state actor uh we have that in New
 
03:01:18.229 --> 03:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well with opic dispensing I
 
03:01:19.830 --> 03:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
personally don't like that model because
 
03:01:21.429 --> 03:01:21.439 align:start position:0%
it leaves the agency without the
 
03:01:23.269 --> 03:01:23.279 align:start position:0%
authority to have that consultation
 
03:01:27.229 --> 03:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
method with the experts and I have um uh
 
03:01:29.670 --> 03:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
actually supported um the creation of
 
03:01:32.870 --> 03:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
boards a board in the past um and then
 
03:01:34.750 --> 03:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
the third is really just to make the
 
03:01:37.830 --> 03:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
boards a majority of public members
 
03:01:39.950 --> 03:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
because if the majority of the board is
 
03:01:41.750 --> 03:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
not comprised of active Market
 
03:01:44.269 --> 03:01:44.279 align:start position:0%
participants then that
 
03:01:46.030 --> 03:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
the the concern raised by the Supreme
 
03:01:49.030 --> 03:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
Court in that case is not relevant from
 
03:01:51.190 --> 03:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
our perspective that one is difficult we
 
03:01:52.469 --> 03:01:52.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't really be able to implement
 
03:01:55.309 --> 03:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
that here given that we already have uh
 
03:01:57.710 --> 03:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
a huge problem filling public member
 
03:02:01.710 --> 03:02:01.720 align:start position:0%
seats so that's the gist of why a lot of
 
03:02:03.870 --> 03:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
states have moved in this direction
 
03:02:07.830 --> 03:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
again it's not um it's not a value
 
03:02:09.950 --> 03:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
judgment about which boards are more
 
03:02:11.870 --> 03:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
important it's really to Shield the
 
03:02:14.550 --> 03:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
state from liability and will say and
 
03:02:16.550 --> 03:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to get into
 
03:02:18.710 --> 03:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
examples but we have those issues in New
 
03:02:20.349 --> 03:02:20.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we absolutely have those
 
03:02:22.630 --> 03:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
issues in New Hampshire um where
 
03:02:25.750 --> 03:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
regulations are put into place um that
 
03:02:28.190 --> 03:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
maybe theoretically on its face are for
 
03:02:31.389 --> 03:02:31.399 align:start position:0%
public safety reasons but um if you are
 
03:02:32.870 --> 03:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
privy to the conversations behind the
 
03:02:34.710 --> 03:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
scenes it's really to starve out
 
03:02:38.030 --> 03:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
competition um and so uh while we have
 
03:02:40.309 --> 03:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
not had any lawsuits in New Hampshire
 
03:02:42.790 --> 03:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
yet that I'm aware of um there is there
 
03:02:45.950 --> 03:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
is a risk of liability so um just want
 
03:02:47.910 --> 03:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
to put that on the table in terms of
 
03:02:49.389 --> 03:02:49.399 align:start position:0%
practice how does it work in New
 
03:02:52.429 --> 03:02:52.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so we have seven advisory
 
03:02:54.190 --> 03:02:54.200 align:start position:0%
boards and then we have the registration
 
03:02:56.630 --> 03:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
which is alic dispensing and they cover
 
03:02:58.990 --> 03:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
all types of fields Medical Imaging
 
03:03:01.349 --> 03:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
massage body art reflexology Respiratory
 
03:03:03.110 --> 03:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
Care which is in the health field
 
03:03:05.150 --> 03:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
recreational ther therapy and court
 
03:03:08.229 --> 03:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
reporters totally different and what it
 
03:03:09.790 --> 03:03:09.800 align:start position:0%
does is I think it's the perfect
 
03:03:11.910 --> 03:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
marriage between the two you've got
 
03:03:13.950 --> 03:03:13.960 align:start position:0%
experts in the field of administration
 
03:03:16.429 --> 03:03:16.439 align:start position:0%
internal controls um the ability to
 
03:03:19.110 --> 03:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
actually uh govern um and then you've
 
03:03:20.990 --> 03:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
got experts in the field and you have to
 
03:03:23.229 --> 03:03:23.239 align:start position:0%
collaborate and we do and that's why I
 
03:03:24.710 --> 03:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
don't really like these pieces of
 
03:03:26.750 --> 03:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
legislation because it pits the boards
 
03:03:28.750 --> 03:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
against the office but I would say that
 
03:03:30.190 --> 03:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
we have a very collaborative
 
03:03:33.309 --> 03:03:33.319 align:start position:0%
relationship with these advisory boards
 
03:03:35.269 --> 03:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
um and we're able to have very
 
03:03:38.030 --> 03:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
productive conversations and and get the
 
03:03:39.950 --> 03:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
regulations um
 
03:03:44.830 --> 03:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
done so um I've circulated some
 
03:03:47.950 --> 03:03:47.960 align:start position:0%
statistics uh for the various boards
 
03:03:52.150 --> 03:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
that are um proposing this bill to go to
 
03:03:54.190 --> 03:03:54.200 align:start position:0%
advisory um and you'll see the number of
 
03:03:56.710 --> 03:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
meetings they had in FY 23 the number of
 
03:03:58.670 --> 03:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
lienes the number of
 
03:04:02.150 --> 03:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
complaints um I would say that I would
 
03:04:04.630 --> 03:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
agree that the transfer of Licensing
 
03:04:06.750 --> 03:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
Authority has really helped because
 
03:04:09.309 --> 03:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
we're no longer required to go to a
 
03:04:10.870 --> 03:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
board meeting and so we're no longer
 
03:04:13.030 --> 03:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
waiting for boards to make a decision so
 
03:04:15.990 --> 03:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
Corum really isn't impacting that area
 
03:04:19.750 --> 03:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
um anymore um but if there are no rules
 
03:04:22.030 --> 03:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
in place there is nothing that we can do
 
03:04:23.190 --> 03:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
and I would draw your attention to
 
03:04:25.750 --> 03:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
installation standards in particular
 
03:04:27.670 --> 03:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
they've had one meeting their rules are
 
03:04:29.750 --> 03:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
expired we're out of compliance with the
 
03:04:31.790 --> 03:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
federal government and there's literally
 
03:04:36.229 --> 03:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
nothing that the state can do because um
 
03:04:38.349 --> 03:04:38.359 align:start position:0%
because they're not meeting and that
 
03:04:39.870 --> 03:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
particular board the majority of the
 
03:04:41.190 --> 03:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
appointments are not done by the
 
03:04:43.469 --> 03:04:43.479 align:start position:0%
governor so we're really just held
 
03:04:47.550 --> 03:04:47.560 align:start position:0%
hostage by by um the lack of ability to
 
03:04:50.269 --> 03:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
to secure a quum now if it were an
 
03:04:53.389 --> 03:04:53.399 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board essentially um the lack
 
03:04:55.630 --> 03:04:55.640 align:start position:0%
of a quorum would not necessarily be a
 
03:04:59.830 --> 03:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
problem um if we would prefer to convene
 
03:05:04.070 --> 03:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
a meeting obviously um and and go
 
03:05:06.070 --> 03:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
through that process but even if there
 
03:05:08.030 --> 03:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
was one person available to have a phone
 
03:05:09.469 --> 03:05:09.479 align:start position:0%
call so we could get the expertise
 
03:05:10.990 --> 03:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
needed we could at least move forward
 
03:05:13.030 --> 03:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
with an initial proposal and try to come
 
03:05:14.469 --> 03:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
into compliance with the federal
 
03:05:17.309 --> 03:05:17.319 align:start position:0%
government right now we have no ability
 
03:05:20.990 --> 03:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
to do that um so so that's a concern the
 
03:05:22.550 --> 03:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
thing I wanted to point out is massage
 
03:05:24.510 --> 03:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
and reflexology are already advisory
 
03:05:26.349 --> 03:05:26.359 align:start position:0%
boards what's proposed in this bill is
 
03:05:28.469 --> 03:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
actually merging them and I had a really
 
03:05:30.590 --> 03:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
good conversation with the massage board
 
03:05:33.070 --> 03:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
about this I said look what why why were
 
03:05:34.590 --> 03:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
these separated out because if you look
 
03:05:37.670 --> 03:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
at other states um they have reflexology
 
03:05:38.990 --> 03:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
Asian Bodywork and structural
 
03:05:41.429 --> 03:05:41.439 align:start position:0%
integration with the massage board and
 
03:05:43.030 --> 03:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
they said it actually happened many
 
03:05:45.389 --> 03:05:45.399 align:start position:0%
years years ago and it had to do over um
 
03:05:47.389 --> 03:05:47.399 align:start position:0%
changing of national exams and they
 
03:05:49.309 --> 03:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
actually opposed it at the time and they
 
03:05:52.830 --> 03:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
were supportive of merging um the board
 
03:05:54.870 --> 03:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh the boards together so I did want to
 
03:05:57.830 --> 03:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
make I did want to make that comment um
 
03:05:59.429 --> 03:05:59.439 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of comments made and
 
03:06:00.950 --> 03:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
I think I just want to take the
 
03:06:03.269 --> 03:06:03.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to kind of correct uh the
 
03:06:08.630 --> 03:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
record the first the first being um that
 
03:06:12.550 --> 03:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh as you know um statutes when they
 
03:06:14.910 --> 03:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
give an agent Authority they don't give
 
03:06:16.670 --> 03:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
it to the department they don't give it
 
03:06:18.269 --> 03:06:18.279 align:start position:0%
to the office they give it to the
 
03:06:20.150 --> 03:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner and that's because the
 
03:06:22.550 --> 03:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner the director is responsible
 
03:06:26.070 --> 03:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
under statute for all execution of those
 
03:06:27.830 --> 03:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that doesn't mean that
 
03:06:30.269 --> 03:06:30.279 align:start position:0%
that person does everything that is
 
03:06:31.950 --> 03:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
required in that statute I mean that
 
03:06:34.030 --> 03:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
would not be possible so when we look at
 
03:06:36.309 --> 03:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
the statutory framework it's not that I
 
03:06:37.670 --> 03:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
personally am going to be looking at
 
03:06:40.550 --> 03:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
every application that's not true I will
 
03:06:42.510 --> 03:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
say practically I am involved in every
 
03:06:44.630 --> 03:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
rulemaking for every Advisory Board
 
03:06:46.510 --> 03:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
under the office I personally review
 
03:06:50.229 --> 03:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
them I personally respond to comments um
 
03:06:52.510 --> 03:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm not saying that's necessary but
 
03:06:55.830 --> 03:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
I personally do that um but but it's not
 
03:06:58.750 --> 03:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
one person taking on that task so I just
 
03:07:00.150 --> 03:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
I I know you know that but I just wanted
 
03:07:03.110 --> 03:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
to say that for the record the other um
 
03:07:05.469 --> 03:07:05.479 align:start position:0%
issue that came up concerned Guardian
 
03:07:08.510 --> 03:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
guardian ad items and I agree these are
 
03:07:10.710 --> 03:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
incredibly important roles and and
 
03:07:12.710 --> 03:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
that's one of the challenges with the
 
03:07:15.150 --> 03:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
current structure which is that they've
 
03:07:18.429 --> 03:07:18.439 align:start position:0%
they've only had three meetings in FY 23
 
03:07:19.910 --> 03:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
and when we talk about the complaints
 
03:07:23.110 --> 03:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
that were received the statute that
 
03:07:26.229 --> 03:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
authorized oplc to investigate didn't go
 
03:07:29.429 --> 03:07:29.439 align:start position:0%
into effect until very recently and my
 
03:07:30.750 --> 03:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
understanding is previously what was
 
03:07:32.630 --> 03:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
happening is that there was a member of
 
03:07:34.110 --> 03:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
the board and another member of the
 
03:07:35.590 --> 03:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
board that I guess would come into the
 
03:07:37.710 --> 03:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
office and review the complaints but
 
03:07:39.910 --> 03:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
unless the board was actually meeting
 
03:07:41.190 --> 03:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
there was nothing that could get done on
 
03:07:44.070 --> 03:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
the complaints so I take issue with the
 
03:07:47.510 --> 03:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
the um uh the representation that the
 
03:07:49.110 --> 03:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
office hasn't acted when it had the
 
03:07:51.389 --> 03:07:51.399 align:start position:0%
ability to do so because that that is
 
03:07:52.389 --> 03:07:52.399 align:start position:0%
not the
 
03:07:56.389 --> 03:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
case um I
 
03:08:01.150 --> 03:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
think I I think that um you know
 
03:08:03.190 --> 03:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
regardless of what the committee you
 
03:08:05.950 --> 03:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
know decides to do with these boards I
 
03:08:07.830 --> 03:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
just want to reiterate mainly for the
 
03:08:09.630 --> 03:08:09.640 align:start position:0%
people in this room that the the goal of
 
03:08:11.830 --> 03:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
the office is to ensure compliance with
 
03:08:14.950 --> 03:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
the law to ensure that we're not um
 
03:08:16.469 --> 03:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
promoting or facilitating
 
03:08:16.479 --> 03:08:17.910 align:start position:0%
promoting or facilitating
anti-competitive

03:08:17.910 --> 03:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive
 
03:08:20.349 --> 03:08:20.359 align:start position:0%
regulations um to be efficient and then
 
03:08:21.429 --> 03:08:21.439 align:start position:0%
to work
 
03:08:24.110 --> 03:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
collaboratively um with those who are
 
03:08:26.830 --> 03:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
experts um because I don't know midwif
 
03:08:29.910 --> 03:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
Frey for example um but I do know uh the
 
03:08:31.670 --> 03:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
statutory framework and I do know the
 
03:08:34.309 --> 03:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
laws that relates to 91a and 541a and
 
03:08:36.389 --> 03:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
the practice acts and I think working
 
03:08:38.070 --> 03:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
together we can come up with some
 
03:08:40.070 --> 03:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
regulations for the benefit of our
 
03:08:41.910 --> 03:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
constituents with that I'd be happy to
 
03:08:43.750 --> 03:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
03:08:45.389 --> 03:08:45.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much executive director
 
03:08:47.590 --> 03:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
any questions yes representative goalie
 
03:08:50.229 --> 03:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
then Brown thank you Mr chair thank you
 
03:08:54.110 --> 03:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so my question
 
03:08:58.510 --> 03:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
is since we have and I'll go back to I
 
03:09:00.630 --> 03:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
had asked this
 
03:09:03.349 --> 03:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
previously since we have given more
 
03:09:05.349 --> 03:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
authority to your
 
03:09:08.070 --> 03:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
office in dispensing of
 
03:09:10.590 --> 03:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
Licensing and the in as well as the
 
03:09:13.870 --> 03:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
invest investigate you know what I'm
 
03:09:13.880 --> 03:09:15.190 align:start position:0%
invest investigate you know what I'm
talking

03:09:15.190 --> 03:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
talking
 
03:09:15.200 --> 03:09:20.269 align:start position:0%
talking
investigatory

03:09:20.269 --> 03:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:22.429 --> 03:09:22.439 align:start position:0%
requirements wouldn't that
 
03:09:25.469 --> 03:09:25.479 align:start position:0%
be in a way
 
03:09:28.990 --> 03:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
enough to cover what was in that Supreme
 
03:09:31.429 --> 03:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
Court case as to giving to you that
 
03:09:33.910 --> 03:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
Authority so it's it it will cover most
 
03:09:36.309 --> 03:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
it won't cover the regulation piece and
 
03:09:38.309 --> 03:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
I'll give you an example of of how this
 
03:09:40.670 --> 03:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
has worked in New Hampshire um I think
 
03:09:42.550 --> 03:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
to the state's benefit so a couple of
 
03:09:45.070 --> 03:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
years ago the legislature passed a
 
03:09:48.590 --> 03:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
statute that said um for microblading
 
03:09:50.110 --> 03:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
which is basically tattooing of the
 
03:09:53.110 --> 03:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
eyebrows and other parts of your face um
 
03:09:55.229 --> 03:09:55.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to allow cosmetologists to
 
03:09:57.229 --> 03:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
engage in this cosmetic procedure and
 
03:10:00.590 --> 03:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
not just body artists and um they have
 
03:10:03.309 --> 03:10:03.319 align:start position:0%
to the board or the office has to have
 
03:10:05.590 --> 03:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
rules in place in order to allow that to
 
03:10:07.030 --> 03:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
happen the person's going to have to get
 
03:10:10.469 --> 03:10:10.479 align:start position:0%
a license and y y yada so at the time
 
03:10:11.790 --> 03:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
the body artart board which is an
 
03:10:13.550 --> 03:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board was very supportive of
 
03:10:14.990 --> 03:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
this and the legislature passed the
 
03:10:17.150 --> 03:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
statute well come to find out the other
 
03:10:19.389 --> 03:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
body artists in the industry were not so
 
03:10:20.870 --> 03:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
happy about that because there are a lot
 
03:10:23.110 --> 03:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
of cosmetologists who were who and this
 
03:10:26.110 --> 03:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
is this is a growing industry who are
 
03:10:28.110 --> 03:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
really interested in microblading and
 
03:10:32.750 --> 03:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
cosmetic um uh practices so they were
 
03:10:33.790 --> 03:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
concerned they were going to lose
 
03:10:36.150 --> 03:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
business and so the body art board said
 
03:10:37.590 --> 03:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
no no no no just kidding we don't want
 
03:10:40.030 --> 03:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
to do those rules well because the
 
03:10:41.469 --> 03:10:41.479 align:start position:0%
office had rulemaking Authority I
 
03:10:43.590 --> 03:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
basically said to them look we got to do
 
03:10:45.510 --> 03:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
it the legislature said we have to do it
 
03:10:46.990 --> 03:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do it but I really like
 
03:10:48.910 --> 03:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
your advice and your expertise so I
 
03:10:50.590 --> 03:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
don't mess this up and we were able to
 
03:10:53.030 --> 03:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
get it done but if they had been an
 
03:10:55.030 --> 03:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
independent regulatory body there would
 
03:10:57.190 --> 03:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
be no rules I guarantee it today which
 
03:10:58.790 --> 03:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
could create a risk to the state if
 
03:11:00.910 --> 03:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
somebody wanted to bring in enforcement
 
03:11:06.910 --> 03:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:09.630 --> 03:11:09.640 align:start position:0%
example representative Brown uh thank
 
03:11:11.710 --> 03:11:11.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you director for
 
03:11:13.670 --> 03:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:11:16.469 --> 03:11:16.479 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for clarifying for the
 
03:11:18.309 --> 03:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
board that you don't do all of the work
 
03:11:20.389 --> 03:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
in these
 
03:11:23.790 --> 03:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
laws um but to kind of follow up on that
 
03:11:26.469 --> 03:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
there was a number of comments made that
 
03:11:28.510 --> 03:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
as as this work gets passed down through
 
03:11:31.389 --> 03:11:31.399 align:start position:0%
your through your employees there isn't
 
03:11:33.190 --> 03:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
the expertise to make the decisions
 
03:11:36.590 --> 03:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
needed so can you can you speak to that
 
03:11:38.510 --> 03:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
so you think the decision points are
 
03:11:41.990 --> 03:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
really at the ru making well I should
 
03:11:45.190 --> 03:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
say they're at the R making um level and
 
03:11:48.229 --> 03:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
then also in disciplinary hearings and
 
03:11:50.150 --> 03:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
so I'll talk about rle making first
 
03:11:51.630 --> 03:11:51.640 align:start position:0%
obviously that has to go through public
 
03:11:55.150 --> 03:11:55.160 align:start position:0%
hearing so um so there's always going to
 
03:11:56.990 --> 03:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
be opportunity to receive input from
 
03:11:58.389 --> 03:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
professionals and we have a statutory
 
03:12:00.710 --> 03:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
obligation to notify them but the way it
 
03:12:04.670 --> 03:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
works uh practically for us is we do Ru
 
03:12:07.550 --> 03:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
making um we draft a set of rules
 
03:12:09.590 --> 03:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
usually based on what was previously in
 
03:12:12.349 --> 03:12:12.359 align:start position:0%
place we convene a meeting um we come to
 
03:12:15.429 --> 03:12:15.439 align:start position:0%
a ensus and agreement with the board and
 
03:12:17.790 --> 03:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
then we file the IP that's how it
 
03:12:20.429 --> 03:12:20.439 align:start position:0%
practically works so we get their input
 
03:12:23.510 --> 03:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
on on that now sometimes uh we don't get
 
03:12:25.630 --> 03:12:25.640 align:start position:0%
the input and we just move forward and
 
03:12:27.389 --> 03:12:27.399 align:start position:0%
then I'll give you another example
 
03:12:30.590 --> 03:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
regarding body art um body art uh had
 
03:12:32.630 --> 03:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
wanted for years to do facility
 
03:12:34.190 --> 03:12:34.200 align:start position:0%
licensing we thought we needed a
 
03:12:36.030 --> 03:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
statutory change come to find out I took
 
03:12:37.429 --> 03:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
a separate look second look at the
 
03:12:38.830 --> 03:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
statute I'm like I don't think we need a
 
03:12:41.389 --> 03:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
statutory change so we decided to move
 
03:12:43.070 --> 03:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
forward with ruem now the board very
 
03:12:46.469 --> 03:12:46.479 align:start position:0%
much wanted establishment ler so we put
 
03:12:48.349 --> 03:12:48.359 align:start position:0%
together a set of rules based on another
 
03:12:50.670 --> 03:12:50.680 align:start position:0%
state and we sent it to the board we
 
03:12:52.070 --> 03:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
asked them to review we asked them to
 
03:12:53.469 --> 03:12:53.479 align:start position:0%
review we asked them to review and they
 
03:12:54.750 --> 03:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
didn't get back so we just moved forward
 
03:12:58.070 --> 03:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
with the IP um and then we had held the
 
03:13:00.429 --> 03:13:00.439 align:start position:0%
public hearing well the public they were
 
03:13:02.870 --> 03:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
not very excited about this um and we
 
03:13:04.349 --> 03:13:04.359 align:start position:0%
got some really good feedback that I
 
03:13:05.550 --> 03:13:05.560 align:start position:0%
didn't get from the boards and we
 
03:13:08.349 --> 03:13:08.359 align:start position:0%
withdrew The Proposal um so there there
 
03:13:10.429 --> 03:13:10.439 align:start position:0%
are many instances to receive that
 
03:13:12.790 --> 03:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
feedback our hope is that in the board
 
03:13:14.229 --> 03:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
can provide that feedback prior to
 
03:13:17.590 --> 03:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
filing um you know filing an IP the
 
03:13:20.030 --> 03:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
other instance is with disciplinary
 
03:13:22.790 --> 03:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
proceedings so many of our boards we
 
03:13:26.030 --> 03:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
contract with Consultants to provide
 
03:13:30.150 --> 03:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
investigative support um I would say
 
03:13:31.510 --> 03:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit more flexibility
 
03:13:33.790 --> 03:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
with the advisory boards because
 
03:13:36.150 --> 03:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
typically the complaint will come in um
 
03:13:39.070 --> 03:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
to enforcement it'll get investigated
 
03:13:41.150 --> 03:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
and then it'll proceed and it goes to
 
03:13:43.710 --> 03:13:43.720 align:start position:0%
our uh hearings office officer who then
 
03:13:46.910 --> 03:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
will consult with the board um if
 
03:13:49.469 --> 03:13:49.479 align:start position:0%
necessary but sometimes enforcement
 
03:13:52.590 --> 03:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
needs an expert and
 
03:13:55.910 --> 03:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
because the agency can act without a
 
03:13:58.670 --> 03:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
quorum of the board we can utilize that
 
03:14:00.750 --> 03:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
person as part of the investigation
 
03:14:02.389 --> 03:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
instead of as part of the adjudicatory
 
03:14:04.750 --> 03:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
hearing you know we get a lot of massage
 
03:14:06.670 --> 03:14:06.680 align:start position:0%
complaints that have to do with you know
 
03:14:09.510 --> 03:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
sex assault that don't necessarily uh
 
03:14:12.110 --> 03:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
require expertise and we can act on them
 
03:14:12.120 --> 03:14:13.269 align:start position:0%
require expertise and we can act on them
quickly

03:14:13.269 --> 03:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
03:14:16.550 --> 03:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
but then there are others that um that
 
03:14:18.510 --> 03:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
we absolutely need their expertise and
 
03:14:20.150 --> 03:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a very collaborative
 
03:14:21.389 --> 03:14:21.399 align:start position:0%
relationship and that's what I would
 
03:14:24.950 --> 03:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
like to emphasize um and and how they
 
03:14:27.389 --> 03:14:27.399 align:start position:0%
provide that consultation to the highest
 
03:14:30.510 --> 03:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
level of their um capability thank you
 
03:14:34.630 --> 03:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
may follow up you may thank you U it it
 
03:14:37.830 --> 03:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
is related I believe so based on that
 
03:14:39.990 --> 03:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
you you sort of answered this to some
 
03:14:41.469 --> 03:14:41.479 align:start position:0%
degree I
 
03:14:41.479 --> 03:14:43.150 align:start position:0%
degree I
think

03:14:43.150 --> 03:14:43.160 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:14:45.630 --> 03:14:45.640 align:start position:0%
based on some testimony and what I'm
 
03:14:47.070 --> 03:14:47.080 align:start position:0%
kind of hearing between the lines from
 
03:14:51.190 --> 03:14:51.200 align:start position:0%
others how do you feel about the comment
 
03:14:54.070 --> 03:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
that if this passes The Advisory boards
 
03:14:57.269 --> 03:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
don't have anything to do that they they
 
03:15:00.950 --> 03:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
have no place and that they become uh
 
03:15:03.389 --> 03:15:03.399 align:start position:0%
pointless I I strongly disagree with
 
03:15:05.550 --> 03:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
that and there and we try we strive to
 
03:15:07.429 --> 03:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
treat our advisory boards in the same
 
03:15:10.590 --> 03:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
manner as um our independent regulatory
 
03:15:13.150 --> 03:15:13.160 align:start position:0%
bodies um you know they get paid a per
 
03:15:14.630 --> 03:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
DM just like everybody else they get
 
03:15:16.750 --> 03:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
invited to the board chair meetings we
 
03:15:18.229 --> 03:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
spend time with them there's a little
 
03:15:19.830 --> 03:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
bit greater
 
03:15:22.870 --> 03:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility um because the agency can
 
03:15:25.830 --> 03:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
the agency can act um which which is
 
03:15:29.510 --> 03:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
good when um particularly you have few
 
03:15:31.750 --> 03:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
lienes and there have been instances
 
03:15:33.389 --> 03:15:33.399 align:start position:0%
where we've had boards had to completely
 
03:15:35.750 --> 03:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
recuse themselves from a disciplinary
 
03:15:38.229 --> 03:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
matter and the case just doesn't go
 
03:15:40.189 --> 03:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
anywhere because nobody is able to step
 
03:15:44.429 --> 03:15:44.439 align:start position:0%
in and act on their behalf um um so I
 
03:15:47.229 --> 03:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
would say that um if there is an active
 
03:15:50.790 --> 03:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board which most of them are uh
 
03:15:53.590 --> 03:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
they they fully participate um as you'll
 
03:15:56.110 --> 03:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
see massage regularly
 
03:15:59.110 --> 03:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
meets um well they've increased the
 
03:16:00.469 --> 03:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
number of meetings because we've been
 
03:16:02.229 --> 03:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
talking about different pieces of
 
03:16:03.590 --> 03:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
legislation and how to handle the
 
03:16:05.030 --> 03:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
establishment issue in particularly
 
03:16:06.590 --> 03:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
human trafficking which is a separate
 
03:16:10.950 --> 03:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
issue um but uh but they they regularly
 
03:16:13.030 --> 03:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
meet um
 
03:16:16.349 --> 03:16:16.359 align:start position:0%
so we and so does MRT they meet
 
03:16:19.429 --> 03:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
monthly thank you representative Le us
 
03:16:20.750 --> 03:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
as much as I would love your input
 
03:16:23.189 --> 03:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
you're on the bill just had an exchange
 
03:16:24.710 --> 03:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
email exchange with the clerk on this
 
03:16:27.269 --> 03:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
point okay and the response from him is
 
03:16:28.950 --> 03:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor should present their bill
 
03:16:31.389 --> 03:16:31.399 align:start position:0%
and not return to the table co-sponsors
 
03:16:33.550 --> 03:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
May either testify or ask questions but
 
03:16:36.229 --> 03:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
not both and I have not testified I love
 
03:16:37.790 --> 03:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
that clarification I'd love for you to
 
03:16:40.870 --> 03:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
join in okay thank you uh I thought I'd
 
03:16:42.030 --> 03:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
remember it that way but I could have
 
03:16:45.309 --> 03:16:45.319 align:start position:0%
been wrong so Mike this gets back to to
 
03:16:48.349 --> 03:16:48.359 align:start position:0%
what extent we did already has um
 
03:16:51.229 --> 03:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
eliminated the liability issue and this
 
03:16:53.269 --> 03:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
gets to the question I understand that
 
03:16:56.269 --> 03:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
the investigation part has moved to
 
03:17:00.670 --> 03:17:00.680 align:start position:0%
oplc entirely I think um but on the ad
 
03:17:03.389 --> 03:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
judicary I you know making the Judgment
 
03:17:05.750 --> 03:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
making the final decision if it's an
 
03:17:07.990 --> 03:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board I understand that's with
 
03:17:10.750 --> 03:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
oplc but if it's a regular board isn't
 
03:17:12.750 --> 03:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
that still with the board and doesn't
 
03:17:15.229 --> 03:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
that potentially leave the board and the
 
03:17:17.910 --> 03:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
state open to liability and to clarify
 
03:17:19.590 --> 03:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
that the liability to on the board is
 
03:17:21.830 --> 03:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
individual to the people on the board is
 
03:17:24.670 --> 03:17:24.680 align:start position:0%
that correct it it can be um and yes
 
03:17:28.229 --> 03:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
that they yes it under independent
 
03:17:30.429 --> 03:17:30.439 align:start position:0%
regulatory bodies have sole Authority
 
03:17:33.070 --> 03:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
for adjudication the office only
 
03:17:36.469 --> 03:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
provides um a hearings examiner that has
 
03:17:38.309 --> 03:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
certain procedural Authority but the
 
03:17:41.790 --> 03:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
substance is lies with the board okay
 
03:17:42.830 --> 03:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:17:45.030 --> 03:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
clarification on that while it's on the
 
03:17:47.870 --> 03:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
table in that scenario is the state also
 
03:17:49.510 --> 03:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
liable or is it just the members of the
 
03:17:52.990 --> 03:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
board well I think um no the state could
 
03:17:54.870 --> 03:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
always be liable I mean any lawyer can
 
03:17:57.150 --> 03:17:57.160 align:start position:0%
make of a claim
 
03:17:59.790 --> 03:17:59.800 align:start position:0%
um so and having defended the state in a
 
03:18:02.309 --> 03:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
lot of uh wacky cases you can always you
 
03:18:05.469 --> 03:18:05.479 align:start position:0%
can always make an argument um so
 
03:18:07.870 --> 03:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
certainly that's always an issue and
 
03:18:09.990 --> 03:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
when oplc acts that's an issue right but
 
03:18:12.710 --> 03:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
then there are immunities involved MH
 
03:18:15.990 --> 03:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:18.910 --> 03:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
goalie so I'm glad you clarified your
 
03:18:21.590 --> 03:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
attachment because um Miss jurus had
 
03:18:25.150 --> 03:18:25.160 align:start position:0%
said that the these boards were on this
 
03:18:28.630 --> 03:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
bill because there were less than 200
 
03:18:30.830 --> 03:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
lies had to do with the number of
 
03:18:33.110 --> 03:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
complaints and the ratio between the
 
03:18:34.710 --> 03:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
number of board members and the number
 
03:18:37.150 --> 03:18:37.160 align:start position:0%
of lenses none of which is on your
 
03:18:39.229 --> 03:18:39.239 align:start position:0%
attachment other than the
 
03:18:42.710 --> 03:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
complaints so is it possible to get this
 
03:18:45.150 --> 03:18:45.160 align:start position:0%
kind the information on which these
 
03:18:48.510 --> 03:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
boards were determined because it says I
 
03:18:51.710 --> 03:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
do did I Mis misunderstand that these or
 
03:18:54.670 --> 03:18:54.680 align:start position:0%
that these boards were chosen because
 
03:18:57.469 --> 03:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
that there were less than 200 licenses
 
03:18:59.349 --> 03:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
and that had to do with and also the
 
03:19:03.189 --> 03:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
ratio of the board members to The lenses
 
03:19:05.550 --> 03:19:05.560 align:start position:0%
and also the number of complaints not to
 
03:19:08.269 --> 03:19:08.279 align:start position:0%
put any bias on the profession so this
 
03:19:11.550 --> 03:19:11.560 align:start position:0%
the criteria for which these boards were
 
03:19:11.560 --> 03:19:13.030 align:start position:0%
the criteria for which these boards were
chosen

03:19:13.030 --> 03:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
chosen
 
03:19:14.550 --> 03:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
can you share that with the committee
 
03:19:16.950 --> 03:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
because it's not on this attachment so I
 
03:19:20.710 --> 03:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
understood her testimony to be that um
 
03:19:24.150 --> 03:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
it that it was a flat 200 being the
 
03:19:26.830 --> 03:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
objective standard and when you consider
 
03:19:29.469 --> 03:19:29.479 align:start position:0%
200 in relation to the number of board
 
03:19:31.469 --> 03:19:31.479 align:start position:0%
members whatever that is it's usually
 
03:19:35.309 --> 03:19:35.319 align:start position:0%
five or seven um the ratio is so small
 
03:19:36.550 --> 03:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
so I don't think there was an
 
03:19:39.150 --> 03:19:39.160 align:start position:0%
independent calculation based on how
 
03:19:41.269 --> 03:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
many board members are on acupuncture
 
03:19:42.590 --> 03:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
versus how many
 
03:19:45.229 --> 03:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
are on you know G's versus installation
 
03:19:48.110 --> 03:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
standards it was 200 now the one thing I
 
03:19:49.349 --> 03:19:49.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to draw your attention was
 
03:19:51.309 --> 03:19:51.319 align:start position:0%
medical technicians and we talked about
 
03:19:55.030 --> 03:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
that um th that obviously doesn't have
 
03:19:58.150 --> 03:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
the 200 lcy threshold the challenge with
 
03:20:00.429 --> 03:20:00.439 align:start position:0%
medical technicians is that it's not an
 
03:20:03.070 --> 03:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
actual profession nobody identifies as a
 
03:20:04.590 --> 03:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
medical technician it's just somebody
 
03:20:06.910 --> 03:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
who's otherwise unlicensed who may come
 
03:20:09.110 --> 03:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
into contact with a controlled drug
 
03:20:12.189 --> 03:20:12.199 align:start position:0%
that's not a profession and by virtue of
 
03:20:15.830 --> 03:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
that we cannot recruit board members so
 
03:20:17.630 --> 03:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
they've had zero meetings for years
 
03:20:19.469 --> 03:20:19.479 align:start position:0%
we've received complaints we can't act
 
03:20:21.870 --> 03:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
on them so regardless of what the
 
03:20:23.830 --> 03:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
legislature decides to do I would say
 
03:20:25.429 --> 03:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
it's largely dysfunctional and something
 
03:20:27.670 --> 03:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
needs to happen so that's why that one
 
03:20:29.429 --> 03:20:29.439 align:start position:0%
is on this list even though it doesn't
 
03:20:33.110 --> 03:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
meet the the criteria that Miss jerius
 
03:20:35.550 --> 03:20:35.560 align:start position:0%
um previously
 
03:20:38.189 --> 03:20:38.199 align:start position:0%
stated follow up so when you meet when
 
03:20:40.510 --> 03:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
you say installation standards you're
 
03:20:44.429 --> 03:20:44.439 align:start position:0%
talking about number five which is the
 
03:20:46.429 --> 03:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing installation
 
03:20:49.469 --> 03:20:49.479 align:start position:0%
standards right yes actually the name of
 
03:20:51.630 --> 03:20:51.640 align:start position:0%
the license though is a it's it's an
 
03:20:55.309 --> 03:20:55.319 align:start position:0%
install it's an installer so yes correct
 
03:20:57.630 --> 03:20:57.640 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you representative
 
03:21:00.469 --> 03:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr
 
03:21:03.510 --> 03:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
chair first I want to go well we're back
 
03:21:06.269 --> 03:21:06.279 align:start position:0%
on what representative groa asked and
 
03:21:07.950 --> 03:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
your response to the medical technicians
 
03:21:10.630 --> 03:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
and I thought I heard you say you had
 
03:21:12.389 --> 03:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
numerous complaints this sheet says one
 
03:21:15.750 --> 03:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
complaint in 2023 would you reiterate
 
03:21:19.030 --> 03:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
yes this is FY 23 so we have have we
 
03:21:21.510 --> 03:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
have other complaints that were received
 
03:21:23.830 --> 03:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
outside the FY 23 time frame they
 
03:21:26.070 --> 03:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
haven't met in years so we received some
 
03:21:29.950 --> 03:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
in fy22 we've received some in fy2 24 we
 
03:21:32.469 --> 03:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
received one in FY
 
03:21:35.510 --> 03:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
23 that the way it stated it sounded
 
03:21:36.750 --> 03:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
like you had numerous complaints in a
 
03:21:40.110 --> 03:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
year but I see only one here but M can
 
03:21:45.910 --> 03:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:48.910 --> 03:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
you stated that you rely on the medical
 
03:21:51.790 --> 03:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
or expertise on the boards correct can
 
03:21:54.150 --> 03:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
you explain why we heard concerns from
 
03:21:55.469 --> 03:21:55.479 align:start position:0%
both the Midwifery board and the
 
03:21:57.790 --> 03:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
guardian Liam board as to members being
 
03:21:59.269 --> 03:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
removed from the board that they feel
 
03:22:02.670 --> 03:22:02.680 align:start position:0%
are important in experience and
 
03:22:04.710 --> 03:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
expertise um that should remain on the
 
03:22:06.429 --> 03:22:06.439 align:start position:0%
board as to why they were removed if
 
03:22:09.189 --> 03:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
you're going to rely on the expertise of
 
03:22:10.750 --> 03:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
these individuals are you talking about
 
03:22:14.510 --> 03:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
specific people or positions positions I
 
03:22:17.710 --> 03:22:17.720 align:start position:0%
think we heard one was an OB position
 
03:22:22.269 --> 03:22:22.279 align:start position:0%
and um pediatrician pediatrician and
 
03:22:24.670 --> 03:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
there was uh also I think a position or
 
03:22:27.990 --> 03:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
two mentioned by uh Mr Gordon uh at the
 
03:22:30.150 --> 03:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
guard guardium at Liam that they were
 
03:22:33.110 --> 03:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
were curious about why they were removed
 
03:22:34.950 --> 03:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I can't speak to that specific
 
03:22:37.110 --> 03:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
policy decision I will say that all of
 
03:22:39.189 --> 03:22:39.199 align:start position:0%
our current advisory boards are only
 
03:22:42.309 --> 03:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
three um so it could just be that that
 
03:22:44.469 --> 03:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
is the model I will say several years
 
03:22:46.070 --> 03:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
ago I don't know if you recall but there
 
03:22:48.349 --> 03:22:48.359 align:start position:0%
was another bill introduced to propose
 
03:22:51.030 --> 03:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
to move Midwifery to
 
03:22:55.269 --> 03:22:55.279 align:start position:0%
advisory um and that bill I believe was
 
03:22:57.950 --> 03:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
ited but we worked with the council in
 
03:22:59.590 --> 03:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
between and we came up with some
 
03:23:02.269 --> 03:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
legislation that they were agreeable to
 
03:23:05.229 --> 03:23:05.239 align:start position:0%
um to move to advisory it's a little bit
 
03:23:07.150 --> 03:23:07.160 align:start position:0%
different from this language I think it
 
03:23:09.349 --> 03:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
included five people and included two
 
03:23:11.750 --> 03:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
positions that they were interested in
 
03:23:13.469 --> 03:23:13.479 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to circulate that
 
03:23:16.070 --> 03:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
language um that they had agreed to
 
03:23:20.150 --> 03:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
previously um G's I can't speak to that
 
03:23:23.389 --> 03:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
particular issue again we haven't had a
 
03:23:26.229 --> 03:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
my primary concern with G's is that they
 
03:23:28.349 --> 03:23:28.359 align:start position:0%
continue to have Quorum issues in large
 
03:23:29.670 --> 03:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
part because the legislative members
 
03:23:31.990 --> 03:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
don't attend um but they've only had
 
03:23:33.790 --> 03:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
three meetings in a year so that's
 
03:23:36.790 --> 03:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:38.870 --> 03:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
challenge any other questions from the
 
03:23:41.389 --> 03:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative man thank
 
03:23:44.990 --> 03:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr Mr chair question to me is just
 
03:23:47.550 --> 03:23:47.560 align:start position:0%
listening to your
 
03:23:50.389 --> 03:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
testimony the shift of
 
03:23:54.309 --> 03:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility for several boards is
 
03:23:58.189 --> 03:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
going from distributed amongst different
 
03:24:01.990 --> 03:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
regulatory boards to
 
03:24:06.630 --> 03:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
oplc that is too much Powers shift in
 
03:24:10.950 --> 03:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
terms of Regulation and uh oversight
 
03:24:13.550 --> 03:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
don't you think think that is that shift
 
03:24:16.830 --> 03:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
is huge mega
 
03:24:20.389 --> 03:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
shift um well I would disagree with that
 
03:24:23.349 --> 03:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
I would say that um you know
 
03:24:26.030 --> 03:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
fundamentally right and this may be
 
03:24:26.040 --> 03:24:27.070 align:start position:0%
fundamentally right and this may be
somewhat

03:24:27.070 --> 03:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
03:24:31.630 --> 03:24:31.640 align:start position:0%
controversial uh no profession is has
 
03:24:33.630 --> 03:24:33.640 align:start position:0%
entitlement to regulate their own
 
03:24:36.349 --> 03:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
profession it's it's the states the
 
03:24:38.189 --> 03:24:38.199 align:start position:0%
state has chosen this model and it's a
 
03:24:40.670 --> 03:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
very popular model but the reason why
 
03:24:43.429 --> 03:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
lure exists is to protect the public and
 
03:24:45.110 --> 03:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
so when we talk about your right to
 
03:24:47.510 --> 03:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
practice a particular profession the
 
03:24:49.910 --> 03:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
state has imposed a barrier saying you
 
03:24:51.830 --> 03:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
can't do this profession unless you have
 
03:24:54.150 --> 03:24:54.160 align:start position:0%
a license because the state deems it
 
03:24:56.349 --> 03:24:56.359 align:start position:0%
necessary to regulate that and restrict
 
03:24:59.030 --> 03:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
entry and the state has many options for
 
03:25:00.910 --> 03:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
determining how to regulate it
 
03:25:02.990 --> 03:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
historically the board the state has
 
03:25:04.870 --> 03:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
decided to put that Authority with
 
03:25:07.269 --> 03:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
independent regulatory bodies but that
 
03:25:09.389 --> 03:25:09.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't need that doesn't need to be the
 
03:25:12.830 --> 03:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
case and other states have different
 
03:25:15.030 --> 03:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
models and I would say it's up to the
 
03:25:16.710 --> 03:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
state the legislature as to how it
 
03:25:19.269 --> 03:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
chooses to regulate because the
 
03:25:20.950 --> 03:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
legislator you are delegating that
 
03:25:25.030 --> 03:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:28.630 --> 03:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
body any further questions I most of
 
03:25:31.150 --> 03:25:31.160 align:start position:0%
mine got touched on I just had one left
 
03:25:33.950 --> 03:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
on my list um you had mentioned trouble
 
03:25:35.229 --> 03:25:35.239 align:start position:0%
meeting compliance with Federal
 
03:25:36.950 --> 03:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
Regulations can you give us some idea of
 
03:25:38.469 --> 03:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
if you're not meeting those regulations
 
03:25:39.429 --> 03:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
what the
 
03:25:41.550 --> 03:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
consequences generally I know it's Broad
 
03:25:45.550 --> 03:25:45.560 align:start position:0%
but you know what they could be I guess
 
03:25:47.830 --> 03:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
it's not going to impact us it's going
 
03:25:50.510 --> 03:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
to impact the individuals who purchase
 
03:25:53.790 --> 03:25:53.800 align:start position:0%
manufactured homes in terms of what
 
03:25:56.189 --> 03:25:56.199 align:start position:0%
standards they must comply with for
 
03:25:59.150 --> 03:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
installation and as you probably can
 
03:26:01.910 --> 03:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate the federal standards impose
 
03:26:06.150 --> 03:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
costs um it I know it's shocking um so
 
03:26:07.790 --> 03:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
we don't want that to be the case so
 
03:26:09.469 --> 03:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
it's really it's it's it really could
 
03:26:11.150 --> 03:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
impact the constituents and it's less
 
03:26:13.150 --> 03:26:13.160 align:start position:0%
about the regulations because if we
 
03:26:15.229 --> 03:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
don't have regulations in place that are
 
03:26:16.990 --> 03:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
effective then the federal standards
 
03:26:20.189 --> 03:26:20.199 align:start position:0%
apply which are more burning some okay
 
03:26:21.950 --> 03:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
and and actually just clarification on
 
03:26:24.710 --> 03:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
the composition of the advisory boards
 
03:26:26.150 --> 03:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
if we move forward with this particular
 
03:26:30.830 --> 03:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
model um does the department um have
 
03:26:32.910 --> 03:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
concerns with potentially opening The
 
03:26:35.150 --> 03:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
Advisory board up to more members than
 
03:26:37.070 --> 03:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
are currently there or there anything
 
03:26:38.229 --> 03:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
like any pitfalls that we would have to
 
03:26:41.110 --> 03:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
be concerned about in So doing we don't
 
03:26:42.870 --> 03:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
have concerns about that I mean we want
 
03:26:45.790 --> 03:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
to make it um you know 20 people is
 
03:26:48.750 --> 03:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
difficult to work with but you know
 
03:26:51.910 --> 03:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
it if if there's a need to make it 5
 
03:26:54.389 --> 03:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
seven I we prefer odd numbers for Quorum
 
03:26:56.469 --> 03:26:56.479 align:start position:0%
purposes but we we don't have a problem
 
03:26:59.269 --> 03:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
with that okay thank you so much for
 
03:27:01.550 --> 03:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you for your
 
03:27:04.229 --> 03:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
time does anybody else wish to testify
 
03:27:07.349 --> 03:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:09.750 --> 03:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
1271 uh seeing none uh this is going to
 
03:27:12.830 --> 03:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
go to subcommittee uh Tony's and Tony do
 
03:27:14.830 --> 03:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
you want to work with Jackie and split
 
03:27:15.790 --> 03:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
on this
 
03:27:18.870 --> 03:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
or okay and uh I will close the public
 
03:27:20.750 --> 03:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
hearing and we will recess for lunch and
 
03:27:40.309 --> 03:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:40.319 --> 03:50:38.229 align:start position:0%
 
1:15

03:50:38.229 --> 03:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:38.239 --> 04:09:10.990 align:start position:0%
 
for

04:09:10.990 --> 04:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:13.349 --> 04:09:13.359 align:start position:0%

lot to say about it it merges some
 
04:09:56.950 --> 04:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
boards and make some other changes um

04:10:11.670 --> 04:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:21.269 --> 04:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:36.429 --> 04:10:36.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:36.439 --> 04:10:43.710 align:start position:0%
 
Barry

04:10:43.710 --> 04:10:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:43.720 --> 04:10:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:10:53.510 --> 04:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:55.630 --> 04:10:55.640 align:start position:0%
have good afternoon Madam chair
 
04:10:57.349 --> 04:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee uh my
 
04:10:58.670 --> 04:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
name is Jake Barry I'm the vice
 
04:11:00.990 --> 04:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
president of policy and new Futures as
 
04:11:02.269 --> 04:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
many of you know new Futures as a
 
04:11:04.349 --> 04:11:04.359 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan nonprofit Health policy and
 
04:11:06.670 --> 04:11:06.680 align:start position:0%
advocacy organization we've been working
 
04:11:08.550 --> 04:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
for more than 20 5 years to help address
 
04:11:09.990 --> 04:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
substance use and behavioral health
 
04:11:12.950 --> 04:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
issues in our state um I feel a little
 
04:11:14.670 --> 04:11:14.680 align:start position:0%
bit funny testifying before somebody has
 
04:11:16.429 --> 04:11:16.439 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to sort of outline
 
04:11:19.149 --> 04:11:19.159 align:start position:0%
the bill but I do want to um stress new
 
04:11:20.710 --> 04:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
Futures concerns about this bill
 
04:11:22.870 --> 04:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
specifically the provision proposing to
 
04:11:24.070 --> 04:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
merge the board of mental health
 
04:11:26.149 --> 04:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
practice with the board of psychologists
 
04:11:29.030 --> 04:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
and especially the the late act board uh
 
04:11:30.550 --> 04:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
we certainly understand and appreciate
 
04:11:32.109 --> 04:11:32.119 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill for years we've
 
04:11:35.550 --> 04:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
worked to increase uh or overcome to
 
04:11:37.469 --> 04:11:37.479 align:start position:0%
help our state overcome barriers to care
 
04:11:39.950 --> 04:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
including increasing efficiencies uh in
 
04:11:41.670 --> 04:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
licensing and eliminating bureaucratic
 
04:11:44.630 --> 04:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
hurdles within our licensing boards um
 
04:11:45.990 --> 04:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
certainly we understand there's much
 
04:11:47.710 --> 04:11:47.720 align:start position:0%
work left to do on that front to get our
 
04:11:50.469 --> 04:11:50.479 align:start position:0%
licensing process where we need it to be
 
04:11:53.670 --> 04:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh but frankly we feel that um we don't
 
04:11:55.070 --> 04:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
believe that combining these critical
 
04:11:57.950 --> 04:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
boards is the way to do it um as you
 
04:11:59.309 --> 04:11:59.319 align:start position:0%
know each of these boards serves an
 
04:12:00.910 --> 04:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
independent and specific field within
 
04:12:02.790 --> 04:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
our behavioral health treatment system
 
04:12:04.429 --> 04:12:04.439 align:start position:0%
each one has its own specialty training
 
04:12:06.070 --> 04:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
its own education and Professional
 
04:12:08.750 --> 04:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
Standards uh we a we have a state have
 
04:12:10.550 --> 04:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
worked very hard to establish grow and
 
04:12:12.070 --> 04:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
Define these professions so they're able
 
04:12:13.870 --> 04:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
to meet the unique needs of the people
 
04:12:15.950 --> 04:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
they serve uh to merge these boards
 
04:12:17.910 --> 04:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
without deep review evaluation and
 
04:12:19.550 --> 04:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
consultation with the professionals they
 
04:12:21.309 --> 04:12:21.319 align:start position:0%
serve could deeply harm and undermine
 
04:12:22.750 --> 04:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
our treatment system we've worked so
 
04:12:25.070 --> 04:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
hard to build uh it would sacrifice the
 
04:12:26.830 --> 04:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
autonomy of these professions and create
 
04:12:28.630 --> 04:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
confusion across the network which could
 
04:12:30.109 --> 04:12:30.119 align:start position:0%
contribute to licensing delays and
 
04:12:32.469 --> 04:12:32.479 align:start position:0%
further Workforce shortages uh again
 
04:12:33.630 --> 04:12:33.640 align:start position:0%
this could undermine our treatment
 
04:12:35.710 --> 04:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
system and limit our ability to overcome
 
04:12:37.349 --> 04:12:37.359 align:start position:0%
our ongoing addiction and mental health
 
04:12:40.030 --> 04:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
crisis and to prevent the next one uh
 
04:12:41.790 --> 04:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
with that uh I thank you for your time
 
04:12:44.070 --> 04:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take
 
04:12:46.990 --> 04:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions
 
04:12:49.550 --> 04:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
representative maputi thank you madam
 
04:12:52.710 --> 04:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Mr Barry for taking my
 
04:12:56.149 --> 04:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
question sure um you said 25 years ago
 
04:12:59.189 --> 04:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
was uh when new Futures started in
 
04:13:03.309 --> 04:13:03.319 align:start position:0%
advocating um from your perspective was
 
04:13:05.469 --> 04:13:05.479 align:start position:0%
these two boards separate or were
 
04:13:07.710 --> 04:13:07.720 align:start position:0%
created separately
 
04:13:09.790 --> 04:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
that some of the psychology and the
 
04:13:12.189 --> 04:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Board psychologist and the
 
04:13:13.830 --> 04:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Board I'm certain thank
 
04:13:14.950 --> 04:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative I'm
 
04:13:16.109 --> 04:13:16.119 align:start position:0%
certain there are others in the room who
 
04:13:18.109 --> 04:13:18.119 align:start position:0%
can recount the history uh better than I
 
04:13:19.950 --> 04:13:19.960 align:start position:0%
can but certainly uh you know I think
 
04:13:21.870 --> 04:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
that with the establishment specifically
 
04:13:24.630 --> 04:13:24.640 align:start position:0%
of the the the lak board the board of
 
04:13:27.149 --> 04:13:27.159 align:start position:0%
other Alcohol and Other Drug counselors
 
04:13:29.070 --> 04:13:29.080 align:start position:0%
uh you know that was really a critical
 
04:13:31.269 --> 04:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
part of the effort to establish again
 
04:13:33.189 --> 04:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
this field as sort of freestanding is
 
04:13:34.830 --> 04:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
separate from you know is it's a
 
04:13:36.269 --> 04:13:36.279 align:start position:0%
separate field it's a separate science
 
04:13:37.710 --> 04:13:37.720 align:start position:0%
it's a separate medicine and in some
 
04:13:40.389 --> 04:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
ways from uh mental health there there's
 
04:13:42.229 --> 04:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
obviously some areas of overlap and we
 
04:13:43.950 --> 04:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
have really worked hard to increase uh
 
04:13:45.630 --> 04:13:45.640 align:start position:0%
sort of collaboration within those areas
 
04:13:47.349 --> 04:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
of overlap but they are freestanding
 
04:13:49.149 --> 04:13:49.159 align:start position:0%
fields and we and we feel strongly that
 
04:13:54.109 --> 04:13:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:57.349 --> 04:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
such representative Schmidt thank you
 
04:14:00.389 --> 04:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
madam chair so um
 
04:14:02.790 --> 04:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
Jake the this committee was the
 
04:14:05.469 --> 04:14:05.479 align:start position:0%
operative committee and the hearing on
 
04:14:07.670 --> 04:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
the bill to separate
 
04:14:09.550 --> 04:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
psychologist out of the board of mental
 
04:14:12.830 --> 04:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
health practice about 10 years ago I
 
04:14:14.830 --> 04:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
think sure maybe not quite 10
 
04:14:19.229 --> 04:14:19.239 align:start position:0%
years has that uh separation worked in
 
04:14:21.630 --> 04:14:21.640 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the psychologists
 
04:14:23.630 --> 04:14:23.640 align:start position:0%
and the people in New Hampshire and your
 
04:14:25.790 --> 04:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
opinion um again thank you
 
04:14:26.990 --> 04:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative for the question again I
 
04:14:28.149 --> 04:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
think that there are other folks
 
04:14:29.830 --> 04:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
practicing in the field uh who are in
 
04:14:30.990 --> 04:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
the room today who could speak more
 
04:14:33.510 --> 04:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
directly to it I think that um you know
 
04:14:34.790 --> 04:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
it has helped having these separate
 
04:14:36.030 --> 04:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
boards has helped to sort of maintain
 
04:14:37.870 --> 04:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
the nuances between these practices for
 
04:14:40.149 --> 04:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
sure and again help to support uh uh the
 
04:14:41.630 --> 04:14:41.640 align:start position:0%
existence of the as separate
 
04:14:43.229 --> 04:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
freestanding Fields but I I would I
 
04:14:45.590 --> 04:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
would argue again knowing that our focus
 
04:14:47.790 --> 04:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
at new new Futures is primarily on the
 
04:14:49.630 --> 04:14:49.640 align:start position:0%
the substance use side of things again
 
04:14:51.550 --> 04:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
these are are are separate Fields there
 
04:14:53.550 --> 04:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
separate fields of medicine again we we
 
04:14:55.149 --> 04:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
think that um they need to be treated as
 
04:14:58.830 --> 04:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:01.030 --> 04:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
04:15:04.229 --> 04:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much any other
 
04:15:15.710 --> 04:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:17.630 --> 04:15:17.640 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name
 
04:15:19.990 --> 04:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
is uh you can call me
 
04:15:23.269 --> 04:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
Reggie sorry my French accent okay
 
04:15:25.469 --> 04:15:25.479 align:start position:0%
that's okay thank you um esteemed
 
04:15:27.790 --> 04:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
members um I was hoping to go towards
 
04:15:29.269 --> 04:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
the end because there's going to be
 
04:15:30.469 --> 04:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
quite a few things that people are going
 
04:15:32.830 --> 04:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
to say before me I am currently a member
 
04:15:35.870 --> 04:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
of the leak board have been a member
 
04:15:39.309 --> 04:15:39.319 align:start position:0%
since um February of last
 
04:15:42.429 --> 04:15:42.439 align:start position:0%
year uh my concerns in terms of this
 
04:15:46.109 --> 04:15:46.119 align:start position:0%
particular bill is as Mr Barry had said
 
04:15:49.189 --> 04:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
before me is that although there are
 
04:15:49.199 --> 04:15:50.189 align:start position:0%
before me is that although there are
many

04:15:50.189 --> 04:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
many
 
04:15:52.670 --> 04:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
similarities uh regarding the profession
 
04:15:56.590 --> 04:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
of mental health um each one has its own
 
04:15:59.269 --> 04:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
particular aspects to it that are unique
 
04:16:02.830 --> 04:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
to the profession um I cannot speak to
 
04:16:05.510 --> 04:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
school psychologist but I am duly
 
04:16:09.030 --> 04:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
licensed I am licensed as an mlc but
 
04:16:11.149 --> 04:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
also as a clinical mental health
 
04:16:14.070 --> 04:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
counselor so I report basically my
 
04:16:16.030 --> 04:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
licenses are under the jurisdiction of
 
04:16:19.550 --> 04:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
two boards oh and one more acupuncture I
 
04:16:22.229 --> 04:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
do the not a protocol for persons with
 
04:16:26.229 --> 04:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
addiction acupuncture for detoxification
 
04:16:32.149 --> 04:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
purposes in any case um my concern is
 
04:16:32.159 --> 04:16:33.790 align:start position:0%
purposes in any case um my concern is
that

04:16:33.790 --> 04:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:16:36.389 --> 04:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh persons I'm always thinking about the
 
04:16:38.429 --> 04:16:38.439 align:start position:0%
public saf safety I remind myself of
 
04:16:41.149 --> 04:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
that every time I go to a board meeting
 
04:16:43.149 --> 04:16:43.159 align:start position:0%
uh if ever you'd like to attend second
 
04:16:46.910 --> 04:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
Thursday of the month uh at oplc 9:00
 
04:16:48.950 --> 04:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
a.m. for the public meeting you're
 
04:16:53.910 --> 04:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
always welcome um the lak profession I
 
04:16:56.070 --> 04:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
was just sharing with a representative
 
04:16:57.870 --> 04:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
from the board of mental health who's
 
04:17:00.429 --> 04:17:00.439 align:start position:0%
with us today I find that it is
 
04:17:02.030 --> 04:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
basically mental health counseling with
 
04:17:04.670 --> 04:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
a specialization in substance use and
 
04:17:06.870 --> 04:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
addiction you know I think of it in term
 
04:17:09.349 --> 04:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
terms of and I do this with my clients I
 
04:17:11.670 --> 04:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
like to give analogies the dealing with
 
04:17:14.870 --> 04:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
medical because most people get that um
 
04:17:17.229 --> 04:17:17.239 align:start position:0%
for instance if I'm a doctor I'm a
 
04:17:19.750 --> 04:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
general practitioner of
 
04:17:24.229 --> 04:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
PCP and I have a patient who has
 
04:17:27.550 --> 04:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
problems with their kidneys I'm not an
 
04:17:29.309 --> 04:17:29.319 align:start position:0%
expert in kidneys I'm going to refer
 
04:17:32.590 --> 04:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
them to a nephologist who has a medical
 
04:17:37.389 --> 04:17:37.399 align:start position:0%
degree but had specialized training
 
04:17:37.399 --> 04:17:39.429 align:start position:0%
degree but had specialized training
for

04:17:39.429 --> 04:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:17:39.439 --> 04:17:41.510 align:start position:0%
for
nefrology

04:17:41.510 --> 04:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
nefrology
 
04:17:46.269 --> 04:17:46.279 align:start position:0%
right making the analogy real life uh in
 
04:17:50.269 --> 04:17:50.279 align:start position:0%
terms of with uh the professions I'm in
 
04:17:53.070 --> 04:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
I've had several referrals from Mental
 
04:17:55.429 --> 04:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
Health Counselors
 
04:17:58.510 --> 04:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
who find they're not qualified to deal
 
04:18:00.030 --> 04:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
with persons with
 
04:18:02.910 --> 04:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
addictions and they refer them to a
 
04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
person who is licensed to deal with such
 
04:18:05.720 --> 04:18:07.550 align:start position:0%
person who is licensed to deal with such
persons

04:18:07.550 --> 04:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
persons
 
04:18:11.750 --> 04:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
um and that's perfectly fine however the
 
04:18:15.990 --> 04:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
training needed to become a licensed ALC
 
04:18:20.510 --> 04:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
alcohol drug counselor N&amp;M leak is very
 
04:18:23.349 --> 04:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
specific in addition to the mental
 
04:18:28.469 --> 04:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
health so in in that sense um yes rules
 
04:18:31.469 --> 04:18:31.479 align:start position:0%
would be different and the experts
 
04:18:33.710 --> 04:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
needed would be different with the
 
04:18:37.830 --> 04:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
proposed composition of em merged board
 
04:18:39.830 --> 04:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
the newly merged board would be reduced
 
04:18:43.630 --> 04:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
to one mlac who by the way also needs to
 
04:18:43.640 --> 04:18:44.389 align:start position:0%
to one mlac who by the way also needs to
be

04:18:44.389 --> 04:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:18:46.469 --> 04:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about the Certified
 
04:18:48.429 --> 04:18:48.439 align:start position:0%
Recovery service
 
04:18:52.389 --> 04:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
worker that is something very different
 
04:18:55.149 --> 04:18:55.159 align:start position:0%
from an mlc or lak
 
04:18:57.670 --> 04:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
position it's your you could call it a
 
04:19:00.870 --> 04:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
licensed peer recovery support
 
04:19:03.550 --> 04:19:03.560 align:start position:0%
worker I will be fully transparent with
 
04:19:06.309 --> 04:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
you I don't know much about Certified
 
04:19:08.710 --> 04:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
Recovery service support
 
04:19:10.630 --> 04:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
workers that's why we have a
 
04:19:12.830 --> 04:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative on the board yes I of
 
04:19:15.030 --> 04:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
course I do know something but when
 
04:19:17.189 --> 04:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
there's something very intricate I turn
 
04:19:20.830 --> 04:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
to that current member which statute
 
04:19:24.149 --> 04:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
requires there be a crsw member present
 
04:19:26.950 --> 04:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
to be to be able to answer such
 
04:19:29.389 --> 04:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
questions and I feel very confident when
 
04:19:30.710 --> 04:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
I do turn to
 
04:19:34.070 --> 04:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
her with the newly merged boards there
 
04:19:37.469 --> 04:19:37.479 align:start position:0%
would not be such a person
 
04:19:40.070 --> 04:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
then with the newly formed board
 
04:19:42.830 --> 04:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
proposed board any questions regarding
 
04:19:45.149 --> 04:19:45.159 align:start position:0%
an mlac aak or
 
04:19:48.630 --> 04:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
crsw all other members would have no
 
04:19:51.670 --> 04:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge of that they would need more
 
04:19:54.710 --> 04:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
knowledge of and all of that would rest
 
04:19:58.429 --> 04:19:58.439 align:start position:0%
a decision maybe probably on one
 
04:20:01.790 --> 04:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
person there wouldn't be much
 
04:20:03.670 --> 04:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
deliberation no fault of the
 
04:20:05.710 --> 04:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
psychologists or the mental health
 
04:20:09.269 --> 04:20:09.279 align:start position:0%
boards that's not their area of
 
04:20:12.269 --> 04:20:12.279 align:start position:0%
specialty and I think also today as we
 
04:20:14.590 --> 04:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
know New Hampshire is in the top five of
 
04:20:19.510 --> 04:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:21.910 --> 04:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
overdoses I work in an organization
 
04:20:24.910 --> 04:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
where they also offer sober housing in
 
04:20:27.630 --> 04:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
Nashwood I'm a resident of
 
04:20:30.830 --> 04:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
Hollis they had an noose death last week
 
04:20:34.990 --> 04:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
in the house two weeks ago excuse me
 
04:20:37.070 --> 04:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
opioid some of you may have been
 
04:20:40.070 --> 04:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
affected by alcoholism substance use
 
04:20:41.590 --> 04:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
either personally your family member or
 
04:20:44.990 --> 04:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
friend maybe some of you unfortunately
 
04:20:47.030 --> 04:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
with the state being so
 
04:20:53.149 --> 04:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:56.550 --> 04:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
deaths leex mlx
 
04:20:59.070 --> 04:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
csws go through specialized training to
 
04:21:02.109 --> 04:21:02.119 align:start position:0%
deal with such things I attended one
 
04:21:04.109 --> 04:21:04.119 align:start position:0%
just two weeks ago through the New
 
04:21:05.349 --> 04:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire alcohol and drug abuse
 
04:21:07.790 --> 04:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
Counselors Association
 
04:21:09.030 --> 04:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
how to
 
04:21:12.590 --> 04:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
deal with the ones left
 
04:21:16.550 --> 04:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
behind after an opiate overdose
 
04:21:20.510 --> 04:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
death people that might come see me for
 
04:21:20.520 --> 04:21:22.070 align:start position:0%
death people that might come see me for
therapy

04:21:22.070 --> 04:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
04:21:25.870 --> 04:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
right so I know I'm just scratching the
 
04:21:27.950 --> 04:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
surface and I allotted five minutes
 
04:21:29.950 --> 04:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
because I thought that perhaps there'd
 
04:21:33.030 --> 04:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
be many people before me who would uh
 
04:21:35.269 --> 04:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
speak and I could just say I'm here to
 
04:21:37.429 --> 04:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
support what they say I didn't think I
 
04:21:39.790 --> 04:21:39.800 align:start position:0%
would be the first or second
 
04:21:43.590 --> 04:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
person so I do thank you for your time I
 
04:21:45.630 --> 04:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
thank you each for the work that you're
 
04:21:47.750 --> 04:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
doing because I'm sure you don't get
 
04:21:51.070 --> 04:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
paid much for being here today just like
 
04:21:54.950 --> 04:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
me so thank you and uh I'm open to
 
04:21:57.910 --> 04:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative G thank you
 
04:21:59.389 --> 04:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:22:01.429 --> 04:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
question in your analogy you talked
 
04:22:03.229 --> 04:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
about the kidney doctor that the general
 
04:22:05.469 --> 04:22:05.479 align:start position:0%
practitioner might send somebody to is
 
04:22:07.630 --> 04:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
does the kidney doctor have a kidney
 
04:22:10.269 --> 04:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
license no but I would believe and again
 
04:22:12.149 --> 04:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not a medical person that would they
 
04:22:13.550 --> 04:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
would probably have to be board
 
04:22:16.109 --> 04:22:16.119 align:start position:0%
certified by the neologist you know for
 
04:22:18.030 --> 04:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
instance um a
 
04:22:20.910 --> 04:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
dermatologist right so if they're going
 
04:22:23.269 --> 04:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
to be a primary care physician they
 
04:22:25.309 --> 04:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
could be board certified and those
 
04:22:27.229 --> 04:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
usually last 10 years by the internal
 
04:22:29.750 --> 04:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
board uh Board of internal medicine and
 
04:22:31.790 --> 04:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
then they would have to pass an exam
 
04:22:34.109 --> 04:22:34.119 align:start position:0%
take specialized studies for Dermatology
 
04:22:35.910 --> 04:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
or nephology and if you want to continue
 
04:22:38.349 --> 04:22:38.359 align:start position:0%
that in analogy and then be board
 
04:22:40.189 --> 04:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
certified now that's something that
 
04:22:44.750 --> 04:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
insurance companies require and um thank
 
04:22:47.910 --> 04:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
you and so likewise we could do the same
 
04:22:50.070 --> 04:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
with the I'm yeah my education and
 
04:22:52.469 --> 04:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
background was in mental health field so
 
04:22:53.670 --> 04:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
we could do the same in the mental
 
04:22:55.149 --> 04:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
health field correct we could have
 
04:22:58.510 --> 04:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
different certifications but not have to
 
04:23:01.070 --> 04:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
have a board for every
 
04:23:03.109 --> 04:23:03.119 align:start position:0%
specialty right there aren't boards for
 
04:23:06.429 --> 04:23:06.439 align:start position:0%
every Specialties um however this one in
 
04:23:09.349 --> 04:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
particular given what's going on in our
 
04:23:13.950 --> 04:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
country and in particular New Hampshire
 
04:23:17.309 --> 04:23:17.319 align:start position:0%
um this is uh you know addiction is
 
04:23:20.389 --> 04:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
something that affects mental health as
 
04:23:21.790 --> 04:23:21.800 align:start position:0%
you well
 
04:23:24.550 --> 04:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
know and unfortunately it takes someone
 
04:23:26.830 --> 04:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
who needs to be trained to determine if
 
04:23:29.670 --> 04:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
a person has not has stopped using
 
04:23:31.149 --> 04:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
whatever drug there is and they're
 
04:23:34.910 --> 04:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
depressed or anxious or very paranoid
 
04:23:38.510 --> 04:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
after stop Shing for 2 three months we
 
04:23:41.510 --> 04:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
need to keep in mind that that's
 
04:23:43.790 --> 04:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
probably upon further assessment of
 
04:23:46.229 --> 04:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
course due to their cessation of drug
 
04:23:49.309 --> 04:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
use now and this is nothing to against a
 
04:23:51.109 --> 04:23:51.119 align:start position:0%
mental health counselor if they haven't
 
04:23:52.469 --> 04:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
been open to their mental health
 
04:23:55.469 --> 04:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
counselor and uh unfortunately I've seen
 
04:23:57.309 --> 04:23:57.319 align:start position:0%
instances where people stop using
 
04:24:00.229 --> 04:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
methamphetamine and they develop
 
04:24:02.710 --> 04:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
schizophrenic types of symptoms hearing
 
04:24:04.830 --> 04:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
voices audio and visual hallucinations
 
04:24:07.349 --> 04:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
which they never experienced before or
 
04:24:08.910 --> 04:24:08.920 align:start position:0%
they see a mental health counselor don't
 
04:24:11.670 --> 04:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
tell them about their substance use or
 
04:24:14.870 --> 04:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
may but that person may not know enough
 
04:24:16.790 --> 04:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
and misdiagnose
 
04:24:20.269 --> 04:24:20.279 align:start position:0%
them so we have to really be careful we
 
04:24:22.950 --> 04:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
have to really be careful and as I said
 
04:24:26.510 --> 04:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
I keep in in first and foremost in my
 
04:24:31.389 --> 04:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
mind Public Safety Public Safety um I
 
04:24:33.269 --> 04:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
signed up if you want to call it that I
 
04:24:35.389 --> 04:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
applied and was humbly accepted to serve
 
04:24:36.830 --> 04:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
on the board
 
04:24:38.790 --> 04:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
and uh when I you know I don't tell too
 
04:24:40.950 --> 04:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
many people that I do because you know I
 
04:24:42.429 --> 04:24:42.439 align:start position:0%
don't want them to treat me differently
 
04:24:45.109 --> 04:24:45.119 align:start position:0%
or whatever the case might be but I
 
04:24:46.870 --> 04:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
always make sure that I use the word
 
04:24:49.870 --> 04:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
serve I serve the board I serve on the
 
04:24:51.670 --> 04:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
board I serve the people of New
 
04:24:54.830 --> 04:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I want what's best for them in
 
04:24:58.309 --> 04:24:58.319 align:start position:0%

04:25:00.349 --> 04:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
substance use so thank you for the
 
04:25:03.229 --> 04:25:03.239 align:start position:0%

or good afternoon chair McGuire and
 
04:25:28.189 --> 04:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
honorable committee members thank you
 
04:25:29.550 --> 04:25:29.560 align:start position:0%
for your time today and considering
 
04:25:31.710 --> 04:25:31.720 align:start position:0%
these remarks my name is laara gruner or
 
04:25:33.070 --> 04:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm a licensed clinical mental
 
04:25:34.269 --> 04:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
health counselor in the state of New
 
04:25:36.590 --> 04:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm here today on on behalf of
 
04:25:38.070 --> 04:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
the board of mental health practice
 
04:25:40.109 --> 04:25:40.119 align:start position:0%
where I am a board member we hold public
 
04:25:41.790 --> 04:25:41.800 align:start position:0%
meetings the third Friday of every month
 
04:25:44.229 --> 04:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
which you are always welcome to join the
 
04:25:45.990 --> 04:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
board of mental health is opposed to hb1
 
04:25:48.229 --> 04:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
1408 due to concerns about the
 
04:25:50.109 --> 04:25:50.119 align:start position:0%
consolidation of the current Board of
 
04:25:52.429 --> 04:25:52.439 align:start position:0%
mental health the board of psychologists
 
04:25:54.189 --> 04:25:54.199 align:start position:0%
and the board of Licensing for Alcohol
 
04:25:55.870 --> 04:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
and Other Drug use which broadly
 
04:25:57.510 --> 04:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
represents the range of mental health
 
04:25:59.389 --> 04:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
licenses and professions in New
 
04:26:01.830 --> 04:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what this bill proposes is to
 
04:26:04.510 --> 04:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
consolidate 13 license types under one
 
04:26:06.269 --> 04:26:06.279 align:start position:0%
shrunken down board with a mammoth
 
04:26:08.510 --> 04:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
Practice Act with the current proposal
 
04:26:10.349 --> 04:26:10.359 align:start position:0%
this would eliminate three boards and
 
04:26:12.550 --> 04:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
consolidate them to one with seven
 
04:26:14.910 --> 04:26:14.920 align:start position:0%
members these seven members alone would
 
04:26:17.349 --> 04:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
be responsible for licensing 13
 
04:26:19.630 --> 04:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
different license types this would be a
 
04:26:21.189 --> 04:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
Monumental task even with a more
 
04:26:23.309 --> 04:26:23.319 align:start position:0%
proportionate number of board members
 
04:26:25.590 --> 04:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
the elimination of specific licenses to
 
04:26:27.550 --> 04:26:27.560 align:start position:0%
rep to represent on the board would
 
04:26:29.830 --> 04:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
deprive these professions of their voice
 
04:26:32.790 --> 04:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
each lure type has its own ethical code
 
04:26:36.229 --> 04:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
rules laws and standards of care to
 
04:26:39.429 --> 04:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
consider this extends from um complaints
 
04:26:41.950 --> 04:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
to rulemaking having entire professions
 
04:26:43.950 --> 04:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
underrepresented when the board
 
04:26:46.750 --> 04:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
promulgates rules is irresponsible we
 
04:26:48.389 --> 04:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
continue to work with the oplc to
 
04:26:49.830 --> 04:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
increase the speed and efficiency of
 
04:26:51.510 --> 04:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
lure within our state and have made
 
04:26:53.630 --> 04:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
great progress through the use of online
 
04:26:55.750 --> 04:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
applications simpler ways of tracking
 
04:26:57.670 --> 04:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
continuing education credits and
 
04:26:59.429 --> 04:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
streamlining internal systems to
 
04:27:01.469 --> 04:27:01.479 align:start position:0%
decrease any unnecessary barriers to
 
04:27:03.670 --> 04:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
those seeking lure our hope is that you
 
04:27:05.189 --> 04:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
would reconsider changes to the current
 
04:27:07.109 --> 04:27:07.119 align:start position:0%
board structure to ensure continued
 
04:27:09.269 --> 04:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
ethical and appropriate oversight to the
 
04:27:11.229 --> 04:27:11.239 align:start position:0%
care of New Hampshire citizens I thank
 
04:27:12.790 --> 04:27:12.800 align:start position:0%

for hearing my testimony and opposition
 
04:27:45.309 --> 04:27:45.319 align:start position:0%
to hb1 1408 the seeks to consolidate the
 
04:27:47.389 --> 04:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
licensing board of psychologists with
 
04:27:50.189 --> 04:27:50.199 align:start position:0%
Board of mental health practice I am Dr

Celia Oliver I'm a psychologist and I'm

nonprofit professional membership
 
04:28:02.750 --> 04:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
organization that is a state chapter of
 
04:28:05.870 --> 04:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
the national APA we have a total of 32
 
04:28:08.070 --> 04:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
27 members in New
 
04:28:10.630 --> 04:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire many of my colleagues very
 
04:28:13.070 --> 04:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
much wanted to stand with me today
 
04:28:15.389 --> 04:28:15.399 align:start position:0%
because this is such an critical issue
 
04:28:17.910 --> 04:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
for all of us however this is an
 
04:28:20.109 --> 04:28:20.119 align:start position:0%
exceptionally busy time of year for
 
04:28:22.510 --> 04:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
psychologist since mental health issues
 
04:28:24.710 --> 04:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
especially anxiety and depression
 
04:28:26.950 --> 04:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
increased dramatically after the
 
04:28:28.990 --> 04:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
holidays and they were not able to clear
 
04:28:31.990 --> 04:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
their schedules to be here I have
 
04:28:34.429 --> 04:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
recently retired and closed my clinical
 
04:28:36.670 --> 04:28:36.680 align:start position:0%
practice which allows me me to be here
 
04:28:39.670 --> 04:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
before you today however I remain active
 
04:28:41.309 --> 04:28:41.319 align:start position:0%
in a number of professional roles
 
04:28:44.070 --> 04:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
including nhpa leadership I'm the chair
 
04:28:46.469 --> 04:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
of the nhpa Ethics Committee and one of
 
04:28:49.070 --> 04:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
the nhpa liazon to the board of
 
04:28:50.870 --> 04:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
psychologists who attend the public
 
04:28:53.950 --> 04:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
portion of their monthly meetings let me
 
04:28:56.710 --> 04:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
assure you that getting a large group of
 
04:29:00.070 --> 04:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
psychologists to agree on anything is
 
04:29:03.710 --> 04:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
almost impossible it's like H and cats
 
04:29:05.950 --> 04:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
on opposing this consolidation of
 
04:29:08.590 --> 04:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
Licensing boards though guess what we're
 
04:29:11.990 --> 04:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
completely united we were able to gather
 
04:29:14.750 --> 04:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
over a 100 signatures in less than two
 
04:29:18.030 --> 04:29:18.040 align:start position:0%
days plus the signatures of all 17
 
04:29:21.429 --> 04:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
members of the nhpa board of directors
 
04:29:23.469 --> 04:29:23.479 align:start position:0%
all of these signatures are attached to
 
04:29:25.149 --> 04:29:25.159 align:start position:0%
the written testimony that I've
 
04:29:27.269 --> 04:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
submitted to you
 
04:29:30.309 --> 04:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
today we also actually fully support
 
04:29:32.830 --> 04:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
efficiency and productive changes for
 
04:29:36.149 --> 04:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
example last year we supported HB 650 5
 
04:29:37.670 --> 04:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
that streamlined the licensing and
 
04:29:39.990 --> 04:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
renewal procedures additionally through
 
04:29:41.990 --> 04:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
our lion roles to the board of
 
04:29:44.229 --> 04:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
psychology we have continued to
 
04:29:46.550 --> 04:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
volunteer our time to work with both the
 
04:29:49.070 --> 04:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
oplc and the board of psychologists to
 
04:29:50.990 --> 04:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
facilitate the smooth implementation of
 
04:29:51.000 --> 04:29:52.189 align:start position:0%
facilitate the smooth implementation of
these

04:29:52.189 --> 04:29:52.199 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:29:55.750 --> 04:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
changes HB 1408 before you today though
 
04:29:58.389 --> 04:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
is a completely different story this is
 
04:30:02.030 --> 04:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
not a hypothetical situation for us we
 
04:30:05.309 --> 04:30:05.319 align:start position:0%
have already lived this experience those
 
04:30:07.189 --> 04:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
of us who have been licensed for more
 
04:30:10.149 --> 04:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
than 10 years in New Hampshire were
 
04:30:12.030 --> 04:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
originally regulated through the board
 
04:30:14.670 --> 04:30:14.680 align:start position:0%
of mental health practice when I moved
 
04:30:17.149 --> 04:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
here 26 years ago from Ohio I was
 
04:30:18.750 --> 04:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
surprised that it was Consolidated
 
04:30:21.670 --> 04:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
licensing board overseeing so many
 
04:30:24.750 --> 04:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
distinct mental health practices at that
 
04:30:27.750 --> 04:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
time only one other state in the United
 
04:30:30.469 --> 04:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
States had an Omnibus licensing board
 
04:30:30.479 --> 04:30:31.229 align:start position:0%
States had an Omnibus licensing board
for

04:30:31.229 --> 04:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:30:33.109 --> 04:30:33.119 align:start position:0%
psychologists oh well I thought to
 
04:30:34.910 --> 04:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
myself that's just the way it's done
 
04:30:37.910 --> 04:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
here but then the next thing I knew my
 
04:30:39.670 --> 04:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
professional liability insurance
 
04:30:43.149 --> 04:30:43.159 align:start position:0%
premiums doubled from what I was paying
 
04:30:45.070 --> 04:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
to practice in
 
04:30:48.070 --> 04:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
Ohio I'm the same psychologist well
 
04:30:50.229 --> 04:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
trained ethical and with a good
 
04:30:52.830 --> 04:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
professional reputation all I did was
 
04:30:55.950 --> 04:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
move from Ohio to New Hampshire I was
 
04:30:58.510 --> 04:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
soon informed that New Hampshire was one
 
04:31:00.269 --> 04:31:00.279 align:start position:0%
of the most dangerous states to practice
 
04:31:02.149 --> 04:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
psychology because the odds of having a
 
04:31:04.630 --> 04:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
licensing board complaint filed against
 
04:31:06.429 --> 04:31:06.439 align:start position:0%
you were very high no matter how it
 
04:31:10.550 --> 04:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
could do work I was like what so what do
 
04:31:12.149 --> 04:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
competent professionals do in this
 
04:31:15.149 --> 04:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
situation well it turned out that many
 
04:31:17.309 --> 04:31:17.319 align:start position:0%
psychologists simply avoided practicing
 
04:31:20.870 --> 04:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
in in New Hampshire others moved their
 
04:31:23.670 --> 04:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
practices to Vermont Maine um
 
04:31:25.710 --> 04:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts rede Island Connecticut
 
04:31:28.070 --> 04:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
but not New Hampshire those who remained
 
04:31:30.910 --> 04:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire limited the number of
 
04:31:33.630 --> 04:31:33.640 align:start position:0%
complex cases they accepted this meant
 
04:31:35.950 --> 04:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire had severe shortage
 
04:31:38.510 --> 04:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
of psychologists long before covid and
 
04:31:40.030 --> 04:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
many New Hampshire residents with the
 
04:31:42.030 --> 04:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
greatest need for Psychological Services
 
04:31:45.229 --> 04:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
were unable to access access
 
04:31:47.790 --> 04:31:47.800 align:start position:0%
treatment with a lot of hard work the
 
04:31:49.550 --> 04:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Board of psychologists was
 
04:31:51.710 --> 04:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
established on July 1st
 
04:31:54.510 --> 04:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
2013 and as you noted it's been about 10
 
04:31:56.950 --> 04:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
years and it has been working well and
 
04:32:00.469 --> 04:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
it continues to improve we do not want
 
04:32:03.550 --> 04:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
to go backwards we oppose consolidating
 
04:32:05.790 --> 04:32:05.800 align:start position:0%
the licensing boards it's all already
 
04:32:07.830 --> 04:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
been demonstrated that a Consolidated
 
04:32:10.870 --> 04:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
licensing board decreases efficiency
 
04:32:14.189 --> 04:32:14.199 align:start position:0%
decreases consistency and impairs Public
 
04:32:18.030 --> 04:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
Safety as you've already heard HB 1408
 
04:32:20.269 --> 04:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
proposes to create a board of only six
 
04:32:22.469 --> 04:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
professional me members and only one of
 
04:32:24.790 --> 04:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
those will be a psychologist I won't add
 
04:32:27.030 --> 04:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
any more numbers to your minds
 
04:32:30.469 --> 04:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
there there is a saying less is more and
 
04:32:33.469 --> 04:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
absolutely that can be true for example
 
04:32:35.710 --> 04:32:35.720 align:start position:0%
reducing clutter can make more more
 
04:32:37.550 --> 04:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
space and it gives you sense being able
 
04:32:40.790 --> 04:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
to breathe more freely and less
 
04:32:43.149 --> 04:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
testimony for me today I think all of us
 
04:32:45.030 --> 04:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
could agree would be a relief for all of
 
04:32:48.510 --> 04:32:48.520 align:start position:0%
us myself included however in other
 
04:32:51.550 --> 04:32:51.560 align:start position:0%
situations having less simply means
 
04:32:54.950 --> 04:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
deprivation and hardship consolidating
 
04:32:57.790 --> 04:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
the licensing boards creates added
 
04:32:59.750 --> 04:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
hardship for both the psychologist
 
04:33:01.910 --> 04:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
practicing in New Hampshire and the
 
04:33:03.870 --> 04:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire trying to
 
04:33:06.590 --> 04:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
access those services
 
04:33:09.750 --> 04:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't even save money by
 
04:33:13.390 --> 04:33:13.400 align:start position:0%
Statute our licensing fees must cover
 
04:33:16.390 --> 04:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
the operating costs of the board of
 
04:33:19.629 --> 04:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
psychologists so in conclusion we are
 
04:33:23.910 --> 04:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
most sincerely and urgently asking you
 
04:33:27.310 --> 04:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
to allow us to continue doing the work
 
04:33:29.629 --> 04:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
that we love and not put this
 
04:33:32.150 --> 04:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
unnecessary hardship on the Hampshire
 
04:33:34.551 --> 04:33:34.561 align:start position:0%
psychologists nor on the patients and
 
04:33:37.150 --> 04:33:37.160 align:start position:0%
the communities we serve thank you so
 
04:33:37.160 --> 04:33:38.750 align:start position:0%
the communities we serve thank you so
very

04:33:38.750 --> 04:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:33:43.990 --> 04:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
much questions oh sorry no I want to
 
04:33:46.670 --> 04:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
quickly I do I'm here for questions yes
 
04:33:49.310 --> 04:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
represent man py has one thank you madam
 
04:33:51.750 --> 04:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:33:54.230 --> 04:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
um you said you've been practicing in
 
04:33:57.830 --> 04:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for over 10 years Yes
 
04:34:01.029 --> 04:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
actually for Yes actually for 25 years I
 
04:34:03.150 --> 04:34:03.160 align:start position:0%
just closed my practice I think about
 
04:34:06.789 --> 04:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
two years ago follow question question
 
04:34:11.269 --> 04:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
so within that 25e frame have you seen
 
04:34:15.150 --> 04:34:15.160 align:start position:0%
your patient load inrease and the number
 
04:34:18.189 --> 04:34:18.199 align:start position:0%
your Outreach
 
04:34:21.551 --> 04:34:21.561 align:start position:0%
to the difference between your ability
 
04:34:25.949 --> 04:34:25.959 align:start position:0%
to serve more patients under the current
 
04:34:27.670 --> 04:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
structure of the
 
04:34:33.510 --> 04:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
board for psychologist versus before
 
04:34:38.470 --> 04:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
that the understand your question so
 
04:34:41.590 --> 04:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
essentially did I notice when I switched
 
04:34:43.429 --> 04:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
when 10 years ago the board of
 
04:34:45.551 --> 04:34:45.561 align:start position:0%
psychologist was implemented during
 
04:34:50.109 --> 04:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
those 10 years did I notice that there
 
04:34:52.990 --> 04:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
that I was able to practice better and
 
04:34:56.750 --> 04:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
serve more patients absolutely and
 
04:34:59.551 --> 04:34:59.561 align:start position:0%
especially I I have a lot of experience
 
04:35:02.310 --> 04:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
I'm considered to be good at what I do
 
04:35:05.510 --> 04:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
and so I felt more free to take on the
 
04:35:08.670 --> 04:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
complicated cases and the need for
 
04:35:10.910 --> 04:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
mental health services in New Hampshire
 
04:35:13.470 --> 04:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
continues to grow between as my
 
04:35:16.590 --> 04:35:16.600 align:start position:0%
colleague pointed out the um substance
 
04:35:20.029 --> 04:35:20.039 align:start position:0%
abuse crisis and covid has dramatically
 
04:35:22.869 --> 04:35:22.879 align:start position:0%
increased depression anxiety so it's a
 
04:35:24.629 --> 04:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
huge relief to have the board of
 
04:35:27.470 --> 04:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
psychologists at my back and to feel
 
04:35:30.349 --> 04:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
that I could really do what I'm trained
 
04:35:34.189 --> 04:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
to do with less fear of losing my
 
04:35:37.189 --> 04:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
livelihood did that answer your question
 
04:35:38.750 --> 04:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
04:35:41.910 --> 04:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
much representative gold thank you madam
 
04:35:44.551 --> 04:35:44.561 align:start position:0%
chair I just wondered I was curious when
 
04:35:47.390 --> 04:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
the um boards split did you notice a
 
04:35:50.189 --> 04:35:50.199 align:start position:0%
decrease in your insurance
 
04:35:53.551 --> 04:35:53.561 align:start position:0%
fees sadly no the insurance fees didn't
 
04:35:55.269 --> 04:35:55.279 align:start position:0%
go down but the good news is they
 
04:35:56.629 --> 04:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
stopped going
 
04:36:01.029 --> 04:36:01.039 align:start position:0%
up so that was a huge relief also thank
 
04:36:03.670 --> 04:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony thank
 
04:36:08.789 --> 04:36:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:08.799 --> 04:36:18.349 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:36:18.349 --> 04:36:18.359 align:start position:0%

to come and talk with you about our
 
04:36:33.349 --> 04:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
concerns as Citizens and small business

providers um I've handed out a testimony
 
04:36:38.910 --> 04:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
uh it's in front of you it has my name
 
04:36:40.869 --> 04:36:40.879 align:start position:0%
at the top Deborah
 
04:36:44.390 --> 04:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
Warner I'm going to read the big print
 
04:36:47.470 --> 04:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
version so
 
04:36:50.230 --> 04:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
um you you know me I've been before this
 
04:36:53.310 --> 04:36:53.320 align:start position:0%
committee before um over the past 15
 
04:36:56.629 --> 04:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
years I was part of the um Board of
 
04:36:58.869 --> 04:36:58.879 align:start position:0%
mental health practice when it combin
 
04:37:02.189 --> 04:37:02.199 align:start position:0%
was combined and um I was a member of
 
04:37:04.590 --> 04:37:04.600 align:start position:0%
that board and then more recently I was
 
04:37:07.670 --> 04:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
a member of the board of psychologists I
 
04:37:10.029 --> 04:37:10.039 align:start position:0%
am now a regular citizen I'm speaking on
 
04:37:13.150 --> 04:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
my own behalf so um psychology's
 
04:37:16.029 --> 04:37:16.039 align:start position:0%
original board started about 60 years
 
04:37:19.269 --> 04:37:19.279 align:start position:0%
ago or more and then it was doing very
 
04:37:20.910 --> 04:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
well and it was doing so well that when
 
04:37:23.869 --> 04:37:23.879 align:start position:0%
they wanted to bring in um licensing
 
04:37:27.390 --> 04:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
level at for the other professions they
 
04:37:29.910 --> 04:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
um asked the board of psychologists to
 
04:37:31.750 --> 04:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
take them in and expand in that and it
 
04:37:33.709 --> 04:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
was recomposed and you got the board of
 
04:37:36.269 --> 04:37:36.279 align:start position:0%
mental health practice
 
04:37:39.310 --> 04:37:39.320 align:start position:0%
in the next 15 years the board of mental
 
04:37:41.590 --> 04:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
health practice was crippled in design
 
04:37:43.590 --> 04:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
with inadequate professional
 
04:37:45.990 --> 04:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
representation and it struggled to
 
04:37:48.709 --> 04:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
regulate the professions I was there I
 
04:37:51.670 --> 04:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
saw that I know that it's true um it was
 
04:37:54.189 --> 04:37:54.199 align:start position:0%
so incapable in fact that lawsuits
 
04:37:56.590 --> 04:37:56.600 align:start position:0%
flourished in the Supreme Court
 
04:37:59.709 --> 04:37:59.719 align:start position:0%
overturning the board's faulty
 
04:38:02.070 --> 04:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
decisions costing the state and the
 
04:38:06.070 --> 04:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
lenes many resources now we heard today
 
04:38:09.830 --> 04:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
in an earlier um bill that there's a
 
04:38:12.590 --> 04:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
determination of the liability and it
 
04:38:14.910 --> 04:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
was a discussion about the Supreme Court
 
04:38:16.629 --> 04:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
and whether or not they're favorable
 
04:38:18.990 --> 04:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
toward the composition of boards but
 
04:38:20.150 --> 04:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
that was rather a little bit
 
04:38:22.709 --> 04:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
hypothetical since we haven't had such a
 
04:38:24.709 --> 04:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
case in New Hampshire I know we need to
 
04:38:27.349 --> 04:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
be cautious of course but these were
 
04:38:30.150 --> 04:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
real cases there were five that were
 
04:38:32.029 --> 04:38:32.039 align:start position:0%
overturned in the Supreme Court it was
 
04:38:34.269 --> 04:38:34.279 align:start position:0%
not a good thing and it was because the
 
04:38:36.070 --> 04:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
board was
 
04:38:38.390 --> 04:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
underrepresented it was so destructive
 
04:38:40.310 --> 04:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
as you heard from Dr Oliver New
 
04:38:42.230 --> 04:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire quickly became known in those
 
04:38:45.510 --> 04:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
simple 15 years as the most dangerous
 
04:38:47.869 --> 04:38:47.879 align:start position:0%
state in which to practice
 
04:38:51.029 --> 04:38:51.039 align:start position:0%
psychology so professionals avoided New
 
04:38:53.189 --> 04:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and this is not the fault of
 
04:38:55.070 --> 04:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
the professions on the board but the
 
04:38:57.310 --> 04:38:57.320 align:start position:0%
design of the board itself with such
 
04:38:59.750 --> 04:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
minimal representation that it could not
 
04:39:02.310 --> 04:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
appropriately judge the competence of
 
04:39:03.830 --> 04:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
the diverse
 
04:39:05.830 --> 04:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
professions it was like having a
 
04:39:08.429 --> 04:39:08.439 align:start position:0%
professional ball game with a football
 
04:39:12.029 --> 04:39:12.039 align:start position:0%
halfback a Soccer forward a hockey
 
04:39:14.830 --> 04:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
goalie and it was an impossible task
 
04:39:16.910 --> 04:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
even for top
 
04:39:19.230 --> 04:39:19.240 align:start position:0%
players bringing drug and alcohol
 
04:39:23.750 --> 04:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
counselors into this um composite board
 
04:39:26.629 --> 04:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
would be into the same trap would simply
 
04:39:28.949 --> 04:39:28.959 align:start position:0%
multiply the inevitable
 
04:39:31.349 --> 04:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
ruination um for the professions it's
 
04:39:35.390 --> 04:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
extremely and drastically ill advised
 
04:39:38.070 --> 04:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
the psychology board has taken on the
 
04:39:40.150 --> 04:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
school psychologist in the past several
 
04:39:42.868 --> 04:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
years and it was certainly a leap to
 
04:39:46.470 --> 04:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
have to St span those two professions
 
04:39:50.628 --> 04:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
because the the um federal regulations
 
04:39:52.230 --> 04:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
that they were dealing with were
 
04:39:54.390 --> 04:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
somewhat opposite Hippa and furpa are
 
04:39:56.590 --> 04:39:56.600 align:start position:0%
rather opposite to each other and it
 
04:39:59.430 --> 04:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
really turns your decision-making upside
 
04:40:01.310 --> 04:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
down when you're trying to deal with
 
04:40:03.750 --> 04:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
cases and Professional Standards in that
 
04:40:07.670 --> 04:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
regard it is extremely and drastically
 
04:40:10.910 --> 04:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
ill advised advised
 
04:40:14.150 --> 04:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
um the data from the proposed experiment
 
04:40:17.150 --> 04:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
of this bill is evident and proven we
 
04:40:21.470 --> 04:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
already know what happens so under the
 
04:40:24.708 --> 04:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
old Board of mental health practice
 
04:40:26.590 --> 04:40:26.600 align:start position:0%
insurance rates were uprated in fact
 
04:40:28.910 --> 04:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
they have come down in fact I I did
 
04:40:30.150 --> 04:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
change to
 
04:40:32.948 --> 04:40:32.958 align:start position:0%
a most of the profession had had shifted
 
04:40:36.390 --> 04:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
as well by then our shers even supplied
 
04:40:39.708 --> 04:40:39.718 align:start position:0%
testimony to the committee that it was a
 
04:40:42.788 --> 04:40:42.798 align:start position:0%
dangerous state to practice in this
 
04:40:45.948 --> 04:40:45.958 align:start position:0%
committee wisely restored the psychology
 
04:40:48.110 --> 04:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
board that had already been in place for
 
04:40:51.670 --> 04:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
50 years it codified reforms for both
 
04:40:54.110 --> 04:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
boards since then the psychology board
 
04:40:56.590 --> 04:40:56.600 align:start position:0%
has functioned well I can attest to that
 
04:40:59.990 --> 04:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
having been on that the BMP has also
 
04:41:02.990 --> 04:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
grown meanwhile and it functions well
 
04:41:05.150 --> 04:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
and it has thrived
 
04:41:07.270 --> 04:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
the professions deserve well-functioning
 
04:41:09.390 --> 04:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
boards that have
 
04:41:11.990 --> 04:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
today there is no cost savings as you're
 
04:41:15.150 --> 04:41:15.160 align:start position:0%
aware the board fees are
 
04:41:18.430 --> 04:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
125% of the operating costs to run the
 
04:41:21.948 --> 04:41:21.958 align:start position:0%
board we will not save any money it it
 
04:41:24.310 --> 04:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't work that way I think that the
 
04:41:26.708 --> 04:41:26.718 align:start position:0%
point of having these boards and this
 
04:41:28.510 --> 04:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
regulation is to make sure that the
 
04:41:31.350 --> 04:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
public gets the best care possible and
 
04:41:34.310 --> 04:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
that the boards are able to adjudicate
 
04:41:38.110 --> 04:41:38.120 align:start position:0%
and see cases of um discipline in a
 
04:41:39.948 --> 04:41:39.958 align:start position:0%
proper manner that will make sure that
 
04:41:42.990 --> 04:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
there's a quality of care out
 
04:41:47.948 --> 04:41:47.958 align:start position:0%
there this also this proposed joining
 
04:41:50.788 --> 04:41:50.798 align:start position:0%
merger of these boards is destructive to
 
04:41:52.990 --> 04:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire advantage that here we
 
04:41:55.990 --> 04:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
have a great state we have wonderful
 
04:42:00.390 --> 04:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
freedom and we also have the ability to
 
04:42:02.270 --> 04:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
have professionals and small business
 
04:42:05.788 --> 04:42:05.798 align:start position:0%
people work well independent
 
04:42:07.948 --> 04:42:07.958 align:start position:0%
we need to expand and not shrink our
 
04:42:09.390 --> 04:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
pool of
 
04:42:11.830 --> 04:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
providers I ask you to remove sections
 
04:42:13.788 --> 04:42:13.798 align:start position:0%
of the bill that pertain to this merger
 
04:42:15.670 --> 04:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
that's sections 5 through
 
04:42:18.708 --> 04:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
25 besides the DraStic and destructive
 
04:42:20.590 --> 04:42:20.600 align:start position:0%
proposed board design a number of
 
04:42:22.750 --> 04:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
portions in this bill are missing
 
04:42:24.390 --> 04:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
important pieces that are currently in
 
04:42:26.310 --> 04:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
statute and if you look at my bulleted
 
04:42:28.670 --> 04:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
points you can see which ones those are
 
04:42:31.390 --> 04:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
under purpose missing in the purpose of
 
04:42:34.230 --> 04:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
the statute is aspects of quality care
 
04:42:36.510 --> 04:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
and protecting the public those are
 
04:42:38.788 --> 04:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
missing in the purpose of
 
04:42:42.868 --> 04:42:42.878 align:start position:0%
Licensing in uh section
 
04:42:47.310 --> 04:42:47.320 align:start position:0%
a21 um 330a 21 the license is missing
 
04:42:49.868 --> 04:42:49.878 align:start position:0%
examination by the board which would
 
04:42:51.788 --> 04:42:51.798 align:start position:0%
include jurus Prudence exam that was
 
04:42:53.390 --> 04:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
recently developed and other
 
04:42:55.230 --> 04:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
interviewing of candidates who are
 
04:42:58.030 --> 04:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
borderline in their um
 
04:43:00.230 --> 04:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
qualifications due to certain glitches
 
04:43:03.590 --> 04:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
in the system currently it's possible to
 
04:43:05.868 --> 04:43:05.878 align:start position:0%
interview such people people and see
 
04:43:08.270 --> 04:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not they substantially meet
 
04:43:10.030 --> 04:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
the qualifications and should be granted
 
04:43:13.550 --> 04:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
a license that's omitted from this
 
04:43:15.910 --> 04:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
criminal records check fails to include
 
04:43:17.868 --> 04:43:17.878 align:start position:0%
the Board review of candidates who are
 
04:43:21.350 --> 04:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
flagged qualitative review is needed for
 
04:43:23.150 --> 04:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
fairness sometimes somebody can get
 
04:43:25.830 --> 04:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
flagged for something that should not
 
04:43:27.590 --> 04:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
interfere with their ability to get a
 
04:43:29.470 --> 04:43:29.480 align:start position:0%
license and that should be reviewed by
 
04:43:31.590 --> 04:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
the board Who would

04:43:52.390 --> 04:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
developed and this committee did pass
 
04:43:57.510 --> 04:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
that several years ago it removes um 329
 
04:44:00.830 --> 04:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
B17 criminal consequences of practicing

04:44:11.708 --> 04:44:11.718 align:start position:0%
also removes the capacity for the board

04:45:41.430 --> 04:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
2008 in July of 2019 I was appointed to
 
04:45:43.350 --> 04:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
the board of Architects and recently
 
04:45:45.708 --> 04:45:45.718 align:start position:0%
took over the role as the chair ever
 
04:45:47.430 --> 04:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
after having previously served as the
 
04:45:49.990 --> 04:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
vice chair the composition of the board
 
04:45:52.708 --> 04:45:52.718 align:start position:0%
of Architects consists of four licensed
 
04:45:56.230 --> 04:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
professionals and one public member
 
04:45:58.430 --> 04:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
currently the four licensed architect
 
04:46:00.910 --> 04:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
positions are filled and the one public
 
04:46:02.670 --> 04:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
member position is
 
04:46:05.230 --> 04:46:05.240 align:start position:0%
vacant we meet by monthly for about an
 
04:46:07.150 --> 04:46:07.160 align:start position:0%
hour including both our public and
 
04:46:07.160 --> 04:46:08.310 align:start position:0%
hour including both our public and
private

04:46:08.310 --> 04:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
private
 
04:46:10.788 --> 04:46:10.798 align:start position:0%
sessions the primary responsibility of
 
04:46:12.910 --> 04:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
the board is to adjudicate the rules of
 
04:46:15.390 --> 04:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
professional conduct of the profession
 
04:46:17.030 --> 04:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm here today to speak in
 
04:46:19.270 --> 04:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
opposition to the proposed legislation
 
04:46:21.310 --> 04:46:21.320 align:start position:0%
to merge the board of Architects with
 
04:46:23.868 --> 04:46:23.878 align:start position:0%
the board of Landscape
 
04:46:25.788 --> 04:46:25.798 align:start position:0%
Architects we have a tremendous amount
 
04:46:27.670 --> 04:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
of respect for the landscape architect
 
04:46:30.230 --> 04:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
profession and fully support their lure
 
04:46:32.548 --> 04:46:32.558 align:start position:0%
requirements and representation of their
 
04:46:34.590 --> 04:46:34.600 align:start position:0%
profession but the profession of
 
04:46:37.190 --> 04:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
architect and landscape architect are
 
04:46:39.548 --> 04:46:39.558 align:start position:0%
not as similar as the titles May
 
04:46:41.830 --> 04:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
indicate before coming today I read the
 
04:46:44.110 --> 04:46:44.120 align:start position:0%
board descriptions of both boards on the
 
04:46:47.590 --> 04:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
oplc website both list that the boards
 
04:46:50.150 --> 04:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
are responsible to develop and maintain
 
04:46:52.708 --> 04:46:52.718 align:start position:0%
the ethical professional and educational
 
04:46:54.470 --> 04:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
requirements for licensed
 
04:46:56.628 --> 04:46:56.638 align:start position:0%
professionals the distinct difference
 
04:46:58.830 --> 04:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
however is that the board of Architects
 
04:47:01.030 --> 04:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
description goes on to State the
 
04:47:04.910 --> 04:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
following to safeguard the state citizen
 
04:47:07.230 --> 04:47:07.240 align:start position:0%
from construction or building hazards
 
04:47:09.830 --> 04:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
such as fire structural failure and
 
04:47:09.840 --> 04:47:11.350 align:start position:0%
such as fire structural failure and
unsanitary

04:47:11.350 --> 04:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
unsanitary
 
04:47:13.430 --> 04:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
conditions this standard of care is
 
04:47:15.310 --> 04:47:15.320 align:start position:0%
significant in the role that Architects
 
04:47:17.430 --> 04:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
are responsible for providing to New
 
04:47:19.590 --> 04:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens which Landscape
 
04:47:21.470 --> 04:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
Architects are
 
04:47:23.670 --> 04:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
not we strongly feel that if an
 
04:47:25.390 --> 04:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
architect is questioned for not
 
04:47:26.708 --> 04:47:26.718 align:start position:0%
upholding the standards of the
 
04:47:28.750 --> 04:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
profession then they should be judged by
 
04:47:31.430 --> 04:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
a panel of their peers for any
 
04:47:33.310 --> 04:47:33.320 align:start position:0%
profession that deals with Public Safety
 
04:47:35.070 --> 04:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
this should be the
 
04:47:36.990 --> 04:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
expectation our current board
 
04:47:38.670 --> 04:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
composition of five members including
 
04:47:41.788 --> 04:47:41.798 align:start position:0%
four licensed Architects assures that
 
04:47:44.708 --> 04:47:44.718 align:start position:0%
even with a minimum Quorum the majority
 
04:47:47.070 --> 04:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
of those determining a ruling will be
 
04:47:47.080 --> 04:47:48.270 align:start position:0%
of those determining a ruling will be
licensed

04:47:48.270 --> 04:47:48.280 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
04:47:51.350 --> 04:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
Architects this is a fair representation
 
04:47:53.270 --> 04:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
for a profession that is highly
 
04:47:56.548 --> 04:47:56.558 align:start position:0%
regulated and critical to ensure Public
 
04:47:59.390 --> 04:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
Safety should the boards be joined as
 
04:48:02.270 --> 04:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes there would be two
 
04:48:05.350 --> 04:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
architects two landscape Architects and
 
04:48:06.830 --> 04:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
one public
 
04:48:09.070 --> 04:48:09.080 align:start position:0%
member as the landscape architect
 
04:48:11.470 --> 04:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
members are not fully versed in the
 
04:48:13.310 --> 04:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
Professional Care that Architects need
 
04:48:15.590 --> 04:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
to provide they would essentially be
 
04:48:19.190 --> 04:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
public members for matters pertaining to
 
04:48:21.510 --> 04:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
architects now depending on who was able
 
04:48:24.310 --> 04:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
to to attend a given meeting a merged
 
04:48:27.310 --> 04:48:27.320 align:start position:0%
board could reach a quorum and make a
 
04:48:29.788 --> 04:48:29.798 align:start position:0%
decision on the practice of a licensed
 
04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
architect without an architect
 
04:48:37.030 --> 04:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
present that is a dangerous situation
 
04:48:39.190 --> 04:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
and does not serve the people of New
 
04:48:41.670 --> 04:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire furthermore there are
 
04:48:41.680 --> 04:48:43.350 align:start position:0%
Hampshire furthermore there are
currently

04:48:43.350 --> 04:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
currently
 
04:48:45.750 --> 04:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
1,913 licensed architects in the state
 
04:48:49.150 --> 04:48:49.160 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire by comparison there are
 
04:48:52.310 --> 04:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
135 licensed Landscape Architects that
 
04:48:55.390 --> 04:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
is a ratio of 14 to1 which is not an
 
04:48:55.400 --> 04:48:56.708 align:start position:0%
is a ratio of 14 to1 which is not an
equitable

04:48:56.708 --> 04:48:56.718 align:start position:0%
equitable
 
04:49:00.510 --> 04:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
representation uh of the of the proposed
 
04:49:02.548 --> 04:49:02.558 align:start position:0%
makeup of a merged
 
04:49:05.070 --> 04:49:05.080 align:start position:0%
board given the aforementioned standards
 
04:49:07.030 --> 04:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
that Architects are required to provide
 
04:49:08.948 --> 04:49:08.958 align:start position:0%
in support of public health and safety
 
04:49:10.868 --> 04:49:10.878 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to this merger and
 
04:49:12.670 --> 04:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
request that the board of Architects be
 
04:49:15.548 --> 04:49:15.558 align:start position:0%
left to regul regulate this critical
 
04:49:18.670 --> 04:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
profession as currently provided thank
 
04:49:21.868 --> 04:49:21.878 align:start position:0%

04:49:24.110 --> 04:49:24.120 align:start position:0%

Landscape
 
04:49:48.310 --> 04:49:48.320 align:start position:0%
Architects uh while our preferred
 
04:49:52.750 --> 04:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
outcome would be no change to uh to the
 
04:49:55.390 --> 04:49:55.400 align:start position:0%
current situation and to remain as an
 
04:49:57.910 --> 04:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
independent board as a board we're
 
04:50:00.708 --> 04:50:00.718 align:start position:0%
neither for nor against the combination
 
04:50:01.830 --> 04:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
of these
 
04:50:04.948 --> 04:50:04.958 align:start position:0%
boards um as long as both professions
 
04:50:06.548 --> 04:50:06.558 align:start position:0%
are adequately
 
04:50:09.350 --> 04:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
represented uh it is the desire of if it
 
04:50:11.150 --> 04:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
is the desire of the legislature to
 
04:50:13.270 --> 04:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
combine our boards we commit to working
 
04:50:14.990 --> 04:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
with anyone who has concerns about the
 
04:50:17.350 --> 04:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
details of the arrangements to achieve
 
04:50:19.628 --> 04:50:19.638 align:start position:0%
an equitable and workable
 
04:50:21.788 --> 04:50:21.798 align:start position:0%
result uh and with that I would
 
04:50:23.628 --> 04:50:23.638 align:start position:0%
entertain any questions you might have
 
04:50:25.750 --> 04:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
04:50:28.430 --> 04:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
for your testimony are there questions
 
04:50:30.470 --> 04:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative Brown uh thank you madam
 
04:50:32.510 --> 04:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
chair so following up on and thanks for
 
04:50:34.470 --> 04:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question following up on the
 
04:50:34.480 --> 04:50:36.270 align:start position:0%
taking my question following up on the
previous

04:50:36.270 --> 04:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
previous
 
04:50:38.430 --> 04:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
testimony the statement seemed fairly
 
04:50:40.750 --> 04:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
legitimate whether it's your profession
 
04:50:43.910 --> 04:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
or others there could be a circumstance
 
04:50:46.270 --> 04:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
if these boards are combined where no
 
04:50:49.590 --> 04:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
one in a hearing has the expertise in
 
04:50:51.430 --> 04:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
the issue at hand for the person being
 
04:50:53.948 --> 04:50:53.958 align:start position:0%
brought to the board do you see do you
 
04:50:56.190 --> 04:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
agree that that could happen I agree
 
04:50:58.910 --> 04:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
that that could happen okay yes thank
 
04:51:02.750 --> 04:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
you and and also just to that would be
 
04:51:02.760 --> 04:51:05.350 align:start position:0%
you and and also just to that would be
bad

04:51:05.350 --> 04:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
bad
 
04:51:07.830 --> 04:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
I I think that we can rely on the
 
04:51:09.830 --> 04:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
Judgment of the professionals on the
 
04:51:12.590 --> 04:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
board not to let themselves get into
 
04:51:15.788 --> 04:51:15.798 align:start position:0%
that kind of bad situation right so I I
 
04:51:17.910 --> 04:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
at least I hope we'd be able
 
04:51:20.270 --> 04:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
to any other
 
04:51:22.510 --> 04:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:32.760 --> 04:51:34.670 align:start position:0%

good afternoon chairwoman Maguire and

committee members thank you for taking
 
04:51:40.310 --> 04:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
the time and letting giving me the
 
04:51:41.910 --> 04:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak on behalf of the
 
04:51:43.788 --> 04:51:43.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire chapter of the American
 
04:51:45.910 --> 04:51:45.920 align:start position:0%

Hampshire chapter trustee our chapter is
 
04:51:54.110 --> 04:51:54.120 align:start position:0%
currently neutral on House Bill 1408 our
 
04:51:56.230 --> 04:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
profession is not opposed to emerging
 
04:51:58.628 --> 04:51:58.638 align:start position:0%
and combining boards we agree that if
 
04:52:01.470 --> 04:52:01.480 align:start position:0%
regulated under multi multidisciplinary
 
04:52:04.270 --> 04:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
board landscape architecture should be
 
04:52:06.948 --> 04:52:06.958 align:start position:0%
regulated along with an Allied design
 
04:52:08.788 --> 04:52:08.798 align:start position:0%
profession making architecture a

profession making architecture a

Choice as a l as Landscape Architects
 
04:52:14.948 --> 04:52:14.958 align:start position:0%
regularly work with other design
 
04:52:16.670 --> 04:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
professionals it's common to see
 
04:52:18.350 --> 04:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
Landscape Architects regulated with

additionally these technically based
 
04:52:25.350 --> 04:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
professions share the foundation of
 
04:52:28.750 --> 04:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
Education experience and examination as
 
04:52:30.350 --> 04:52:30.360 align:start position:0%
the standard for
 
04:52:32.470 --> 04:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
licensure um jointly regulating
 
04:52:35.270 --> 04:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
Landscape Architects and Architects is
 
04:52:38.110 --> 04:52:38.120 align:start position:0%
fairly common Nationwide in fact 24
 
04:52:40.990 --> 04:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
States nearly have jointly regulate
 
04:52:42.910 --> 04:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
Architects and Landscape Architects
 
04:52:43.948 --> 04:52:43.958 align:start position:0%
under one
 
04:52:47.230 --> 04:52:47.240 align:start position:0%
board we we our chapter recognizes
 
04:52:50.070 --> 04:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
there's a national Trend focusing on
 
04:52:54.310 --> 04:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
licensing efficiency combining boards
 
04:52:57.868 --> 04:52:57.878 align:start position:0%
and sorry restructuring licensing
 
04:53:00.030 --> 04:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
departments regulating professions with
 
04:53:01.868 --> 04:53:01.878 align:start position:0%
similar licensing structures and
 
04:53:03.628 --> 04:53:03.638 align:start position:0%
commonalities in practice is therefore
 
04:53:06.150 --> 04:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
or common when done correctly a
 
04:53:08.548 --> 04:53:08.558 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary board can be an
 
04:53:11.310 --> 04:53:11.320 align:start position:0%
efficient licensing entity benefiting
 
04:53:13.750 --> 04:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
lenses and the citizens of New Hampshire
 
04:53:15.948 --> 04:53:15.958 align:start position:0%
while continuing to protect the public
 
04:53:17.628 --> 04:53:17.638 align:start position:0%
and environments throughout the state
 
04:53:20.150 --> 04:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
again thank you for your time thank you
 
04:53:21.150 --> 04:53:21.160 align:start position:0%
are there
 
04:53:23.350 --> 04:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
04:53:27.470 --> 04:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
BR thank you have you um reviewed the
 
04:53:30.670 --> 04:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
recommended changes to the
 
04:53:34.190 --> 04:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
board on in this Bill yes at the five
 
04:53:37.230 --> 04:53:37.240 align:start position:0%
member board with with two architects
 
04:53:38.590 --> 04:53:38.600 align:start position:0%
and two Landscape Architects and one
 
04:53:42.070 --> 04:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
public member yes um yeah we would be
 
04:53:44.110 --> 04:53:44.120 align:start position:0%
fine with that we're actually neutral on
 
04:53:47.070 --> 04:53:47.080 align:start position:0%
the bill but we would oppose any any
 
04:53:49.750 --> 04:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
makeup that would limit us to one member
 
04:53:51.510 --> 04:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
on up any board
 
04:53:55.230 --> 04:53:55.240 align:start position:0%
makeup thank you and we do understand um
 
04:53:59.590 --> 04:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
the architect's um concerns regarding um
 
04:54:01.310 --> 04:54:01.320 align:start position:0%

testimony in opposition to House Bill
 
04:55:17.110 --> 04:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
1408 um as you've heard it looks to
 
04:55:19.590 --> 04:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
merge the licensure board of Architects
 
04:55:21.350 --> 04:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
with the lure Board of Landscape
 
04:55:23.670 --> 04:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
Architects it also looks to combine
 
04:55:26.548 --> 04:55:26.558 align:start position:0%
experience eligibility and rul making
 
04:55:30.310 --> 04:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
processes of both boards into a single
 
04:55:34.030 --> 04:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
board um while we have as as Adam had
 
04:55:35.708 --> 04:55:35.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned tremendous respect for the
 
04:55:37.390 --> 04:55:37.400 align:start position:0%
board of Landscape Architects and their
 
04:55:40.628 --> 04:55:40.638 align:start position:0%
current lure requirements um we feel
 
04:55:42.110 --> 04:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
that the combination of these two boards
 
04:55:44.390 --> 04:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
would be a detriment to the practice of
 
04:55:47.150 --> 04:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
architecture lure in the
 
04:55:50.990 --> 04:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
state um I remember back in in schooling
 
04:55:53.070 --> 04:55:53.080 align:start position:0%
I had a I had a mentor who was a PhD in
 
04:55:55.230 --> 04:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
architecture and he said there are three
 
04:55:58.628 --> 04:55:58.638 align:start position:0%
professions in our country where um you
 
04:56:01.310 --> 04:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
can actually kill people uh lawyers
 
04:56:04.350 --> 04:56:04.360 align:start position:0%
doctors and Architects um and it brought
 
04:56:06.788 --> 04:56:06.798 align:start position:0%
to light what the responsibility of
 
04:56:10.390 --> 04:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
Architecture is in the state um it's the
 
04:56:12.670 --> 04:56:12.680 align:start position:0%
health life safety and Welfare of of the
 
04:56:15.070 --> 04:56:15.080 align:start position:0%
public in in any setting within a
 
04:56:17.590 --> 04:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
building or or space that an architect
 
04:56:17.600 --> 04:56:18.708 align:start position:0%
building or or space that an architect
has

04:56:18.708 --> 04:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
has
 
04:56:22.030 --> 04:56:22.040 align:start position:0%
designed um because of this large
 
04:56:23.910 --> 04:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility there are strict very
 
04:56:26.070 --> 04:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
strict educational experience and El
 
04:56:28.350 --> 04:56:28.360 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements for lure in the
 
04:56:31.110 --> 04:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
practice of architecture within the
 
04:56:34.070 --> 04:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
state educational requirements are are
 
04:56:36.510 --> 04:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
of Landscape Architects are much less
 
04:56:38.670 --> 04:56:38.680 align:start position:0%
and cover limit limited areas of
 
04:56:40.990 --> 04:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
expertise in comparison to the general
 
04:56:43.310 --> 04:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
practice of architecture in the
 
04:56:47.030 --> 04:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
state um which um the practice of
 
04:56:49.030 --> 04:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
architecture within the state covers the
 
04:56:52.270 --> 04:56:52.280 align:start position:0%
construction of entire buildings spaces
 
04:56:55.070 --> 04:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
um outdoor areas and uh Landscape
 
04:56:58.548 --> 04:56:58.558 align:start position:0%
Architects are limited generally to um
 
04:57:02.230 --> 04:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh site and civil related um areas
 
04:57:03.708 --> 04:57:03.718 align:start position:0%
Architects are also charged with
 
04:57:05.948 --> 04:57:05.958 align:start position:0%
oversight of land landscape architect
 
04:57:08.030 --> 04:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
structural mechanical electrical and
 
04:57:10.110 --> 04:57:10.120 align:start position:0%
Plum plumbing and Fire Protection
 
04:57:13.750 --> 04:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
designs within um the practice of our
 
04:57:15.868 --> 04:57:15.878 align:start position:0%
profession as Architects we're the
 
04:57:17.590 --> 04:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
keeper of all these trades and each of
 
04:57:19.788 --> 04:57:19.798 align:start position:0%
the trades has educational experience
 
04:57:22.628 --> 04:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
limited to their trade only I.E a
 
04:57:24.750 --> 04:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
landscape architect does not manage the
 
04:57:27.590 --> 04:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
design of a plumbing engineer per se but
 
04:57:31.350 --> 04:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh an architect is charged with that
 
04:57:34.150 --> 04:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility similarly AR ARS have the
 
04:57:36.510 --> 04:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
critical obligation to have oversight
 
04:57:40.830 --> 04:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
over all facets of construction as well
 
04:57:43.270 --> 04:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
landcape Architects are not involved in
 
04:57:44.830 --> 04:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
the construction of a building past
 
04:57:46.310 --> 04:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
landscape and site
 
04:57:49.910 --> 04:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
design which is um an an
 
04:57:52.830 --> 04:57:52.840 align:start position:0%
astute Factor Architects are also
 
04:57:55.030 --> 04:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
charged with an in-depth extensive
 
04:57:58.990 --> 04:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the uh entire building code
 
04:58:01.150 --> 04:58:01.160 align:start position:0%
again as a life safety
 
04:58:04.750 --> 04:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
issue travel distances occupancy load
 
04:58:07.190 --> 04:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
exits uh all how to get people out of a
 
04:58:10.708 --> 04:58:10.718 align:start position:0%
building if there's an issue a fire um
 
04:58:13.030 --> 04:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
or a problem with the building uh
 
04:58:14.990 --> 04:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately Landscape Architects do
 
04:58:16.510 --> 04:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
not have this knowledge or experience in
 
04:58:18.350 --> 04:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
these areas of the
 
04:58:21.190 --> 04:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
building design or the building
 
04:58:24.708 --> 04:58:24.718 align:start position:0%
code our as Adam mentioned our office uh
 
04:58:26.910 --> 04:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
adjudicates disciplinary actions when
 
04:58:29.430 --> 04:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
necessary on those not abiding by the
 
04:58:31.270 --> 04:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
laws that keep the public safe within
 
04:58:34.868 --> 04:58:34.878 align:start position:0%
our profession and the The Lure of
 
04:58:37.150 --> 04:58:37.160 align:start position:0%
architecture Landscape Architects are
 
04:58:39.310 --> 04:58:39.320 align:start position:0%
not qualified to speak on the details
 
04:58:41.270 --> 04:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
surrounding these matters due to the
 
04:58:44.470 --> 04:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned lack of core code
 
04:58:47.310 --> 04:58:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:49.670 --> 04:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge generally speaking merging of
 
04:58:51.788 --> 04:58:51.798 align:start position:0%
various boards may offer benefits to
 
04:58:53.548 --> 04:58:53.558 align:start position:0%
each board in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:58:55.750 --> 04:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
depending on the board um but
 
04:58:57.910 --> 04:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately not in this
 
04:59:00.548 --> 04:59:00.558 align:start position:0%
case our board is composed as Adam
 
04:59:03.548 --> 04:59:03.558 align:start position:0%
mentioned four um tenure
 
04:59:05.628 --> 04:59:05.638 align:start position:0%
plus tenured Architects with an open
 
04:59:08.430 --> 04:59:08.440 align:start position:0%
public me member and there is an
 
04:59:11.230 --> 04:59:11.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to not have architectural
 
04:59:13.430 --> 04:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
representation in the current proposed
 
04:59:18.830 --> 04:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:21.590 --> 04:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
dangerous also throughout the state
 
04:59:24.110 --> 04:59:24.120 align:start position:0%
Architects commonly hire Landscape
 
04:59:27.270 --> 04:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
Architects as a sub trade on projects
 
04:59:31.110 --> 04:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
which o opens a huge door to conflict of
 
04:59:33.310 --> 04:59:33.320 align:start position:0%
interest within the proposed merger of
 
04:59:33.320 --> 04:59:34.510 align:start position:0%
interest within the proposed merger of
these

04:59:34.510 --> 04:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:59:38.310 --> 04:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
bills as Adam mentioned there's roughly
 
04:59:41.230 --> 04:59:41.240 align:start position:0%
1900 um practicing Architects within the
 
04:59:43.670 --> 04:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
state and only 135 practicing Landscape
 
04:59:45.750 --> 04:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
Architects so you could understand that
 
04:59:48.430 --> 04:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
many of us as Architects have hired The
 
04:59:50.910 --> 04:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
Limited pool of very talented Landscape
 
04:59:52.590 --> 04:59:52.600 align:start position:0%
Architects within the
 
04:59:56.150 --> 04:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
state for those that we've hired to
 
04:59:58.830 --> 04:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
adjudicate disciplinary action
 
05:00:05.030 --> 05:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:08.670 --> 05:00:08.680 align:start position:0%
um open-ended legal
 
05:00:11.230 --> 05:00:11.240 align:start position:0%
issue as you can see that there's a good
 
05:00:12.708 --> 05:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
deal to consider with this bill in our
 
05:00:14.750 --> 05:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
board request that it is dismissed for
 
05:00:17.390 --> 05:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
the previous reasons it has the
 
05:00:19.350 --> 05:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
potential to dilute the requirements to
 
05:00:21.070 --> 05:00:21.080 align:start position:0%
the practice of architecture within the
 
05:00:23.548 --> 05:00:23.558 align:start position:0%
state which could harm the Public's
 
05:00:26.310 --> 05:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
right to life safety and
 
05:00:29.070 --> 05:00:29.080 align:start position:0%
Welfare it's a liability that the state
 
05:00:31.350 --> 05:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
representation should not and need not
 
05:00:34.310 --> 05:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
take on when people say is concerned our
 
05:00:37.350 --> 05:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
boards work very very well and we'd like
 
05:00:39.470 --> 05:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to continue to do
 
05:00:43.230 --> 05:00:43.240 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank
 
05:00:43.240 --> 05:00:45.350 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank
you

05:00:45.350 --> 05:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:00:47.270 --> 05:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair thank you
 
05:00:48.708 --> 05:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um during your
 
05:00:51.190 --> 05:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
testimony you intimated that you have a
 
05:00:53.430 --> 05:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
concern that um Landscape Architects do
 
05:00:55.910 --> 05:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
not have the knowledge base necessary to
 
05:00:58.070 --> 05:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
um understand the complexities of
 
05:01:00.070 --> 05:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
architecture in general um is the
 
05:01:02.150 --> 05:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
reverse also true or do you feel like
 
05:01:04.788 --> 05:01:04.798 align:start position:0%
architects are qualified to speak on
 
05:01:07.628 --> 05:01:07.638 align:start position:0%
into the topic of landscape architecture
 
05:01:09.230 --> 05:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
we do we are required to have a
 
05:01:12.628 --> 05:01:12.638 align:start position:0%
knowledge base there um it's cursory
 
05:01:14.190 --> 05:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
it's certainly not the knowledge base
 
05:01:16.670 --> 05:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
that they have within their profession
 
05:01:19.990 --> 05:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
um I can't really say with uh
 
05:01:21.788 --> 05:01:21.798 align:start position:0%
definitively if we would have the
 
05:01:23.230 --> 05:01:23.240 align:start position:0%
experience I would think that we can
 
05:01:25.270 --> 05:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
speak to some of the items that might
 
05:01:28.230 --> 05:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
come up during those meetings but uh but
 
05:01:30.548 --> 05:01:30.558 align:start position:0%
the opposite is is more the concern
 
05:01:34.868 --> 05:01:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:37.628 --> 05:01:37.638 align:start position:0%
Schmidt you madam chair so your last
 
05:01:40.150 --> 05:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
name has many spellings could you spell
 
05:01:43.510 --> 05:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
your name or it's uh Michael
 
05:01:52.230 --> 05:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:54.910 --> 05:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
WN okay other
 
05:01:58.190 --> 05:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Yes representa Man
 
05:02:01.590 --> 05:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
py Madam chair um thank you for taking
 
05:02:03.430 --> 05:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:02:05.590 --> 05:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
do you see this kind of combined
 
05:02:10.150 --> 05:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:12.628 --> 05:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
states thank you for your question uh as
 
05:02:15.190 --> 05:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned there are states
 
05:02:17.350 --> 05:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
that do have a combined board uh
 
05:02:20.310 --> 05:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
generally speaking um which addresses
 
05:02:22.310 --> 05:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
the questions previously asked the board
 
05:02:24.910 --> 05:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
is is much larger in order to have
 
05:02:28.590 --> 05:02:28.600 align:start position:0%
Equitable representation but um we're
 
05:02:30.510 --> 05:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
only aware of seven states that have a
 
05:02:34.030 --> 05:02:34.040 align:start position:0%
combined board and we're not aware of
 
05:02:36.030 --> 05:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
particularly a trend in this direction
 
05:02:38.628 --> 05:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
because it does dilute the life safety
 
05:02:40.590 --> 05:02:40.600 align:start position:0%
aspects of the profession of
 
05:02:43.030 --> 05:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
architecture thank
 
05:02:45.548 --> 05:02:45.558 align:start position:0%
you and as an engineer I think your
 
05:02:48.030 --> 05:02:48.040 align:start position:0%
professor omitted at least one
 
05:02:50.708 --> 05:02:50.718 align:start position:0%
profession yeah I'm sure thank you madam
 
05:02:59.548 --> 05:02:59.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:04.470 --> 05:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
Das from the forest land owners
 
05:03:20.628 --> 05:03:20.638 align:start position:0%

05:03:25.030 --> 05:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:28.110 --> 05:03:28.120 align:start position:0%
last good afternoon Madam chairman and
 
05:03:31.310 --> 05:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
members of this esteem committee my name
 
05:03:34.708 --> 05:03:34.718 align:start position:0%
is an Davis I'm a forest land
 
05:03:38.990 --> 05:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
owner uh and my husband and I were the
 
05:03:41.230 --> 05:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire tree farmers of the year
 
05:03:41.240 --> 05:03:43.030 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire tree farmers of the year
in

05:03:43.030 --> 05:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:03:45.708 --> 05:03:45.718 align:start position:0%
2022 uh we work with
 
05:03:48.628 --> 05:03:48.638 align:start position:0%
Foresters in every step of the
 
05:03:52.670 --> 05:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
management of our 500 Acre Wood
 
05:03:56.750 --> 05:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
lot uh I am also a member of the board
 
05:03:56.760 --> 05:03:57.830 align:start position:0%
lot uh I am also a member of the board
of

05:03:57.830 --> 05:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:04:01.110 --> 05:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
Foresters and in that role um I have
 
05:04:04.470 --> 05:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
worked since May May of
 
05:04:07.948 --> 05:04:07.958 align:start position:0%
2015 uh helping to review the
 
05:04:11.350 --> 05:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
applications of Foresters I am currently
 
05:04:15.830 --> 05:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
one of two Forest land owners who work
 
05:04:18.350 --> 05:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
on that uh
 
05:04:20.868 --> 05:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
board there are four
 
05:04:24.708 --> 05:04:24.718 align:start position:0%
Foresters and I believe that as a land
 
05:04:30.030 --> 05:04:30.040 align:start position:0%
owner I bring a perspective to the board
 
05:04:33.190 --> 05:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
from a consumer standpoint and it's a
 
05:04:37.548 --> 05:04:37.558 align:start position:0%
very important one and provides consumer
 
05:04:41.150 --> 05:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
protection because of that I oppose the
 
05:04:45.350 --> 05:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
portion of House Bill 1408 that would
 
05:04:47.590 --> 05:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
eliminate the two landowner
 
05:04:50.708 --> 05:04:50.718 align:start position:0%
Representatives on this board now I'm
 
05:04:53.350 --> 05:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
not looking for more volunteer work I'm
 
05:04:56.868 --> 05:04:56.878 align:start position:0%
pretty involved in my home community and
 
05:05:00.350 --> 05:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh in various and Sury other State uh
 
05:05:03.910 --> 05:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
boards and commissions but I feel very
 
05:05:06.230 --> 05:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
strongly that this is an important
 
05:05:06.240 --> 05:05:07.350 align:start position:0%
strongly that this is an important
Public

05:05:07.350 --> 05:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
Public
 
05:05:10.948 --> 05:05:10.958 align:start position:0%
Service uh the landowner members of this
 
05:05:15.270 --> 05:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
board take the time to carefully review
 
05:05:17.990 --> 05:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
the applications we have the time to do
 
05:05:21.350 --> 05:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
that I don't know whether the Foresters
 
05:05:23.708 --> 05:05:23.718 align:start position:0%
read all the materials that come with
 
05:05:26.910 --> 05:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
applications but the applications
 
05:05:28.868 --> 05:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
require uh
 
05:05:31.548 --> 05:05:31.558 align:start position:0%
significant uh materials including
 
05:05:33.190 --> 05:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
management plans
 
05:05:36.350 --> 05:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes the application Pages uh total
 
05:05:39.628 --> 05:05:39.638 align:start position:0%
more than 100 and it often takes me more
 
05:05:42.750 --> 05:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
than two hours to review one
 
05:05:45.190 --> 05:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
application I think this is an important
 
05:05:48.670 --> 05:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
Public Service uh there are people
 
05:05:51.628 --> 05:05:51.638 align:start position:0%
willing to do this work uh to my
 
05:05:53.510 --> 05:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge the board has never had
 
05:05:55.990 --> 05:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
trouble finding landowner
 
05:05:58.788 --> 05:05:58.798 align:start position:0%
Representatives we work well with the
 
05:06:01.510 --> 05:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
Foresters in fact the board is a
 
05:06:03.910 --> 05:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
pleasure to work with because it's
 
05:06:06.708 --> 05:06:06.718 align:start position:0%
efficient um and we enjoy working with
 
05:06:10.590 --> 05:06:10.600 align:start position:0%
the folks at the oplc they are also very
 
05:06:10.600 --> 05:06:12.310 align:start position:0%
the folks at the oplc they are also very
fine

05:06:12.310 --> 05:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
fine
 
05:06:12.320 --> 05:06:14.350 align:start position:0%
fine
professionals

05:06:14.350 --> 05:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
05:06:18.910 --> 05:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
so I urge you this committee to vote no
 
05:06:22.270 --> 05:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
on this aspect of the bill if anything
 
05:06:25.590 --> 05:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
the board would be better served if
 
05:06:27.868 --> 05:06:27.878 align:start position:0%
there were three land owners because of
 
05:06:31.230 --> 05:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
the perspective that we bring uh to the
 
05:06:34.470 --> 05:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
table than thank you for your time and
 
05:06:37.070 --> 05:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
allowing me to testify and thank you
 
05:06:40.788 --> 05:06:40.798 align:start position:0%

05:06:51.708 --> 05:06:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:54.948 --> 05:06:54.958 align:start position:0%
testimony all right is anyone else wish

05:07:14.030 --> 05:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:15.590 --> 05:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'm sorry I was
 
05:07:18.350 --> 05:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
tardy and getting my pink slip in um
 
05:07:19.708 --> 05:07:19.718 align:start position:0%
Lindsey Courtney executive director
 
05:07:22.350 --> 05:07:22.360 align:start position:0%
office of professional LIC certification
 
05:07:25.430 --> 05:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
the office is not taking a bill on or a
 
05:07:28.430 --> 05:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
position on this bill but I did um want
 
05:07:30.590 --> 05:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
to make myself available to answer any
 
05:07:32.670 --> 05:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have I think the
 
05:07:34.430 --> 05:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
bill is prettyy clear it would propose
 
05:07:36.230 --> 05:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
merger of Architects with Landscape
 
05:07:38.868 --> 05:07:38.878 align:start position:0%
Architects as you may recall last year
 
05:07:41.868 --> 05:07:41.878 align:start position:0%
in hb2 uh the bill proposed to eliminate
 
05:07:44.868 --> 05:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
lure for Landscape Architects there was
 
05:07:46.470 --> 05:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
conversation that happened at the
 
05:07:49.070 --> 05:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
committee level um and at the hearings
 
05:07:52.270 --> 05:07:52.280 align:start position:0%
about potential mergers and essentially
 
05:07:54.510 --> 05:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
I believe that's the result or this bill
 
05:07:56.788 --> 05:07:56.798 align:start position:0%
is the result of those
 
05:07:58.948 --> 05:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
conversations um again we take no
 
05:08:01.708 --> 05:08:01.718 align:start position:0%
petition on that in terms of uh the
 
05:08:03.310 --> 05:08:03.320 align:start position:0%
merger the board of mental health
 
05:08:05.548 --> 05:08:05.558 align:start position:0%
practice psychology Board of Licensing
 
05:08:08.070 --> 05:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
for alcohol and drug use professionals
 
05:08:09.830 --> 05:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
the only comments that I would say is I
 
05:08:12.788 --> 05:08:12.798 align:start position:0%
think that the circumstances that were
 
05:08:15.150 --> 05:08:15.160 align:start position:0%
described prior to
 
05:08:18.030 --> 05:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
2013 was a very different scenario than
 
05:08:21.150 --> 05:08:21.160 align:start position:0%
what you see now um in particular the
 
05:08:24.628 --> 05:08:24.638 align:start position:0%
office didn't exist at all um the boards
 
05:08:27.030 --> 05:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
had their own staff um they operated
 
05:08:27.040 --> 05:08:28.030 align:start position:0%
had their own staff um they operated
completely

05:08:28.030 --> 05:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
completely
 
05:08:30.510 --> 05:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
independently and I really just don't
 
05:08:34.150 --> 05:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
accept uh as a General proposition that
 
05:08:36.750 --> 05:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
these uh groups can't collaborate and
 
05:08:40.150 --> 05:08:40.160 align:start position:0%
get along um and be successful because
 
05:08:42.110 --> 05:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
I've personally witnessed uh
 
05:08:44.350 --> 05:08:44.360 align:start position:0%
Professionals in various disciplines on
 
05:08:46.470 --> 05:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
many different licensing boards be able
 
05:08:47.948 --> 05:08:47.958 align:start position:0%
to collaborate and work together and
 
05:08:50.470 --> 05:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
learn from each other um in the course
 
05:08:55.030 --> 05:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
of uh pursuing um you know occupation
 
05:08:57.628 --> 05:08:57.638 align:start position:0%
regulation that's um appropriate and
 
05:08:59.868 --> 05:08:59.878 align:start position:0%
forward thinking so I I would just keep
 
05:09:02.868 --> 05:09:02.878 align:start position:0%
that in mind that 2013 is not 20
 
05:09:05.788 --> 05:09:05.798 align:start position:0%
24 um with respect to the other changes
 
05:09:07.628 --> 05:09:07.638 align:start position:0%
essentially there were changes that were
 
05:09:11.030 --> 05:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
proposed last year mainly intended to
 
05:09:13.510 --> 05:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
make um changes to the composition of
 
05:09:16.310 --> 05:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
the boards um if you recall we've had a
 
05:09:19.510 --> 05:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
lot of conversation about quum issues in
 
05:09:21.430 --> 05:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
particular public members and I know
 
05:09:22.830 --> 05:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
that representative lakas had put
 
05:09:24.350 --> 05:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
something in your bulletin so if you
 
05:09:26.830 --> 05:09:26.840 align:start position:0%
know anybody um interested and serving
 
05:09:29.788 --> 05:09:29.798 align:start position:0%
that would be great but um essentially
 
05:09:31.310 --> 05:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
what was proposed last year and what's
 
05:09:33.350 --> 05:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
currently proposed is a reduction of the
 
05:09:36.350 --> 05:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
overall size with the goal of reducing
 
05:09:38.310 --> 05:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
the number of public members because
 
05:09:40.830 --> 05:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
that appears to be impacting cor more
 
05:09:42.948 --> 05:09:42.958 align:start position:0%
frequently um with that I'd be happy to
 
05:09:44.628 --> 05:09:44.638 align:start position:0%
answer any questions again I just wanted
 
05:09:45.948 --> 05:09:45.958 align:start position:0%
to make myself
 
05:09:48.470 --> 05:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
available thank you represent Simon and
 
05:09:51.190 --> 05:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
then gold thank you madam chair um just
 
05:09:52.750 --> 05:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
a quick question on the board of
 
05:09:54.910 --> 05:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
Architects is the public member is that
 
05:09:57.510 --> 05:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
there by Statute or is that negotiable
 
05:09:58.990 --> 05:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
they're there by Statute correct by
 
05:10:02.868 --> 05:10:02.878 align:start position:0%
Statute okay thank you gold Shar and
 
05:10:04.430 --> 05:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question it's
 
05:10:08.150 --> 05:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
maybe somewhat related my question is
 
05:10:10.548 --> 05:10:10.558 align:start position:0%
regarding advisory
 
05:10:14.470 --> 05:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
boards if there's a statutory layout of
 
05:10:17.390 --> 05:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
who's required by Statute to be on the
 
05:10:20.230 --> 05:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
board is there anything preventing
 
05:10:22.670 --> 05:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
adding other members is there anything
 
05:10:24.230 --> 05:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
that would stop your office or The
 
05:10:26.910 --> 05:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board from having other people
 
05:10:29.430 --> 05:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
sit with them regularly that are in the
 
05:10:32.548 --> 05:10:32.558 align:start position:0%
field to assist
 
05:10:36.190 --> 05:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
so yes certainly so we uh boards can
 
05:10:38.190 --> 05:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
work and they often do with different
 
05:10:40.390 --> 05:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholders provided it's in public
 
05:10:42.150 --> 05:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
session but once you cross over into
 
05:10:43.948 --> 05:10:43.958 align:start position:0%
matters that are considered confidential
 
05:10:45.750 --> 05:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
obviously you have to exclude everybody
 
05:10:47.750 --> 05:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
who's anybody who's not staff or not on
 
05:10:50.548 --> 05:10:50.558 align:start position:0%
the public body so that would be the um
 
05:10:52.150 --> 05:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
that would be the challenge we we do
 
05:10:55.548 --> 05:10:55.558 align:start position:0%
have a couple of boards um and actually
 
05:10:58.190 --> 05:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
um alcohol and drug use counselors they
 
05:10:59.830 --> 05:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
have this in their statute I think
 
05:11:02.670 --> 05:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
mental health practice does as well
 
05:11:04.910 --> 05:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
um where they have authorized
 
05:11:07.548 --> 05:11:07.558 align:start position:0%
subcommittees um that can perform work
 
05:11:09.430 --> 05:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
and certain boards Board of Nursing has
 
05:11:10.948 --> 05:11:10.958 align:start position:0%
the ability to appoint people to those
 
05:11:12.948 --> 05:11:12.958 align:start position:0%
subcommittees so that is another way
 
05:11:17.548 --> 05:11:17.558 align:start position:0%
that boards have um gathered expertise
 
05:11:20.590 --> 05:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
from other professions um an issue came
 
05:11:24.310 --> 05:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
up during testimony about people opining
 
05:11:26.430 --> 05:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
or passing judgment adjudicating cases
 
05:11:28.310 --> 05:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
to which there's no professional member
 
05:11:30.470 --> 05:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
there and I'll give you an example um
 
05:11:33.390 --> 05:11:33.400 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing the legislature
 
05:11:35.670 --> 05:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
recently added an additional APRN member
 
05:11:37.708 --> 05:11:37.718 align:start position:0%
that has yet to be filled they currently
 
05:11:39.510 --> 05:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
have a 13-member board with only one
 
05:11:42.590 --> 05:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
APRN and they have about 3,500 aprns a
 
05:11:45.430 --> 05:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
lot of their cases concern aprns they as
 
05:11:47.910 --> 05:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
a matter of practice do not adjudicate
 
05:11:50.190 --> 05:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
cases if the APRN member is there
 
05:11:52.270 --> 05:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
because they understand that they would
 
05:11:55.030 --> 05:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
like that person's expertise so I think
 
05:11:57.390 --> 05:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
board's a really good at self-regulating
 
05:11:59.670 --> 05:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
that issue um and I would fully
 
05:12:01.510 --> 05:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
anticipate um that regardless of the
 
05:12:03.390 --> 05:12:03.400 align:start position:0%
compens of the board that all of our
 
05:12:04.788 --> 05:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
professionals on these boards would
 
05:12:06.270 --> 05:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
continue to do
 
05:12:08.788 --> 05:12:08.798 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
05:12:10.628 --> 05:12:10.638 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair
 
05:12:12.150 --> 05:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'm
 
05:12:13.948 --> 05:12:13.958 align:start position:0%
going to go to a section that really
 
05:12:16.830 --> 05:12:16.840 align:start position:0%
hasn't been talked about yet in the bill
 
05:12:16.840 --> 05:12:17.788 align:start position:0%
hasn't been talked about yet in the bill
page

05:12:17.788 --> 05:12:17.798 align:start position:0%
page
 
05:12:24.510 --> 05:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:24.520 --> 05:12:26.430 align:start position:0%
 
pharmacists

05:12:26.430 --> 05:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
pharmacists
 
05:12:30.430 --> 05:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
yes in reducing the number of
 
05:12:32.430 --> 05:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
Pharmacists uh
 
05:12:35.430 --> 05:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
so four practicing members
 
05:12:40.470 --> 05:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
why was it chosen to make two from
 
05:12:43.070 --> 05:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
pharmacists two Pharmacists and two
 
05:12:45.548 --> 05:12:45.558 align:start position:0%
shall be full-time Hospital
 
05:12:48.110 --> 05:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
pharmacists because the ratio of the
 
05:12:49.750 --> 05:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
number of Pharmacists in the state to
 
05:12:50.948 --> 05:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
the number of ratio of Pharmacists who
 
05:12:53.070 --> 05:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
work for hospitals doesn't seem like
 
05:12:53.080 --> 05:12:53.868 align:start position:0%
work for hospitals doesn't seem like
it's

05:12:53.868 --> 05:12:53.878 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:12:58.030 --> 05:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
5050 and why is that at 2 and two yes so
 
05:13:02.830 --> 05:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to the um the intent there
 
05:13:06.310 --> 05:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
I can say that I might make a suggestion
 
05:13:10.510 --> 05:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
that you remove this part of that bill
 
05:13:12.750 --> 05:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
um from remove this part from the bill
 
05:13:15.708 --> 05:13:15.718 align:start position:0%
and the reason is this there were many
 
05:13:17.430 --> 05:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
changes last year to the pharmacy
 
05:13:20.070 --> 05:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
Statute in terms of composition at one
 
05:13:23.230 --> 05:13:23.240 align:start position:0%
point I think in hb2 um hb2 included the
 
05:13:25.030 --> 05:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
language that would change it to seven
 
05:13:28.110 --> 05:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
members and then 409 changed it back to
 
05:13:29.670 --> 05:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
five members and then there may have
 
05:13:33.070 --> 05:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
been it was it was kind of a mess um
 
05:13:34.590 --> 05:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
legally that we had to figure out who
 
05:13:38.470 --> 05:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
was on the board um so the J as settled
 
05:13:40.990 --> 05:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
I may suggest not making any changes
 
05:13:46.070 --> 05:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
there but um there there was a a a
 
05:13:49.590 --> 05:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
consensus among I think hospitals in
 
05:13:51.830 --> 05:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
particular that there needed to be
 
05:13:54.708 --> 05:13:54.718 align:start position:0%
because the practice of Pharmacy in a
 
05:13:56.868 --> 05:13:56.878 align:start position:0%
hospital is different than the practice
 
05:13:59.470 --> 05:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
of Pharmacy in a retail environment that
 
05:14:02.070 --> 05:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
they needed greater representation uh
 
05:14:02.080 --> 05:14:02.948 align:start position:0%
they needed greater representation uh
the

05:14:02.948 --> 05:14:02.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:14:04.990 --> 05:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
conversation regarding adding an
 
05:14:08.708 --> 05:14:08.718 align:start position:0%
additional Hospital pharmacist um
 
05:14:12.030 --> 05:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
centered around uh or was in the context
 
05:14:14.350 --> 05:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
of the board continuing to exist at
 
05:14:16.708 --> 05:14:16.718 align:start position:0%
seven members that probably doesn't
 
05:14:19.230 --> 05:14:19.240 align:start position:0%
answer your question but in a nutshell
 
05:14:20.788 --> 05:14:20.798 align:start position:0%
you may not want to make any changes
 
05:14:24.150 --> 05:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
there because there was this um there
 
05:14:27.310 --> 05:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
were these changes last year followup
 
05:14:29.110 --> 05:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
just one other followup regarding that
 
05:14:31.830 --> 05:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
section because when we talk about
 
05:14:33.868 --> 05:14:33.878 align:start position:0%
boards usually the head of the board's
 
05:14:35.750 --> 05:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
the chair of the board why is this being
 
05:14:38.510 --> 05:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
a president of the board it has always
 
05:14:40.830 --> 05:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
existed that way and certain boards are
 
05:14:42.910 --> 05:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
called are considered commissions and
 
05:14:43.910 --> 05:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
they refer to themselves as
 
05:14:46.070 --> 05:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioners it's just whatever the
 
05:14:49.548 --> 05:14:49.558 align:start position:0%
statute says I think uh medicine has uh
 
05:14:51.390 --> 05:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
a president as
 
05:14:53.470 --> 05:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
well that's the only other one that
 
05:14:54.788 --> 05:14:54.798 align:start position:0%
comes to
 
05:14:54.798 --> 05:14:56.510 align:start position:0%
comes to
mind

05:14:56.510 --> 05:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
mind
 
05:14:58.590 --> 05:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
history because we've always done it
 
05:15:00.390 --> 05:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
that way which is never the right answer
 
05:15:02.590 --> 05:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
but that's that's why and just one of
 
05:15:04.390 --> 05:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
the quick if I may while we're on this
 
05:15:07.830 --> 05:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
page if you go up to line 11 sure Roman
 
05:15:10.190 --> 05:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
numeral seven it says repealed the
 
05:15:11.548 --> 05:15:11.558 align:start position:0%
stricken after
 
05:15:13.788 --> 05:15:13.798 align:start position:0%
seven is that a
 
05:15:17.350 --> 05:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
typo yeah what goes back in there
 
05:15:20.470 --> 05:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
there's nothing there replacing it yeah
 
05:15:23.110 --> 05:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
that would appear I mean just a glancing
 
05:15:25.110 --> 05:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
at it without looking at the current
 
05:15:27.270 --> 05:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
statute I would agree with you it would
 
05:15:28.868 --> 05:15:28.878 align:start position:0%
appear to be a
 
05:15:31.708 --> 05:15:31.718 align:start position:0%
typo because typically you would

which proposes to merge the currently

separate State Board of Podiatry with
 
05:20:20.350 --> 05:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
the State Board of
 
05:20:23.788 --> 05:20:23.798 align:start position:0%
Medicine my name is Dr William mccan and
 
05:20:25.510 --> 05:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
I've been a practicing podiatric
 
05:20:27.230 --> 05:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
physician in New Hampshire for the last
 
05:20:27.240 --> 05:20:28.750 align:start position:0%
physician in New Hampshire for the last

05:20:28.750 --> 05:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
33
 
05:20:31.590 --> 05:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
years I serve as immediate p president
 
05:20:33.868 --> 05:20:33.878 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire podiatric Medical
 
05:20:36.390 --> 05:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
Association and I'm speaking today as a
 
05:20:38.990 --> 05:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
concerned resident of New Hampshire and
 
05:20:40.990 --> 05:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
as a practicing podiatric physician in
 
05:20:42.390 --> 05:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
the granite
 
05:20:45.190 --> 05:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
state I'm in opposition to the proposal
 
05:20:46.628 --> 05:20:46.638 align:start position:0%
relative to merging the board of
 
05:20:49.670 --> 05:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
Podiatry into the Board of
 
05:20:51.990 --> 05:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
Medicine the currently separate Board of
 
05:20:53.948 --> 05:20:53.958 align:start position:0%
Medicine needs a full day every month to
 
05:20:55.708 --> 05:20:55.718 align:start position:0%
manage the concerns and complaints of
 
05:20:57.590 --> 05:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
the lenes under its
 
05:21:00.190 --> 05:21:00.200 align:start position:0%
regulation versus the Board of Podiatry
 
05:21:02.030 --> 05:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
which only requires a halfday meeting
 
05:21:04.470 --> 05:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
every quarter merging the boards will
 
05:21:06.070 --> 05:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
simply increase the workload of the
 
05:21:07.150 --> 05:21:07.160 align:start position:0%
Board of
 
05:21:09.830 --> 05:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
Medicine additionally for those who
 
05:21:12.310 --> 05:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
serve on the board of Podiatry the
 
05:21:15.350 --> 05:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
meeting frequency would increase from
 
05:21:18.510 --> 05:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
four halfday meetings a year to 12
 
05:21:22.390 --> 05:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
meetings that consume at least a full
 
05:21:25.548 --> 05:21:25.558 align:start position:0%
day for a podiatric physician volunteer
 
05:21:27.990 --> 05:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
an essentially unpaid role this is a
 
05:21:29.590 --> 05:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
significant increase in the time
 
05:21:32.350 --> 05:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
required which will be a deterrent for
 
05:21:35.750 --> 05:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
future volunteers who might consider
 
05:21:38.350 --> 05:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
serving caring for patients requires
 
05:21:42.030 --> 05:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
significant focus and energy and such a
 
05:21:43.868 --> 05:21:43.878 align:start position:0%
Time increase would be difficult to
 
05:21:46.270 --> 05:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
manage at
 
05:21:49.750 --> 05:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
best doctors of podiatric medicine also
 
05:21:51.628 --> 05:21:51.638 align:start position:0%

05:21:53.510 --> 05:21:53.520 align:start position:0%

conditions this is the case in our group
 
05:22:37.990 --> 05:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
practice here in conquer and in Meredith
 
05:22:39.788 --> 05:22:39.798 align:start position:0%
where we have many patients who Express

their gratitude for the significant time
 
05:22:43.990 --> 05:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
and attention given to salvage their

again during a podiatric physician's
 
05:22:54.990 --> 05:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
Education and Training there is a
 
05:22:57.628 --> 05:22:57.638 align:start position:0%
significant and early focus on lower
 
05:22:59.788 --> 05:22:59.798 align:start position:0%
extremity care including the structures
 
05:23:02.150 --> 05:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
of the foot and ankle
 
05:23:04.708 --> 05:23:04.718 align:start position:0%
as a result the issues that a board of
 
05:23:06.990 --> 05:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
Podiatry May face are significantly
 
05:23:09.708 --> 05:23:09.718 align:start position:0%
different and more specific from what a
 
05:23:13.390 --> 05:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:16.070 --> 05:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
face a separate Board of Podiatry also
 
05:23:17.910 --> 05:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
ensures that podiatric Physicians are
 
05:23:19.990 --> 05:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
not unduly restricted or disciplined by
 
05:23:22.628 --> 05:23:22.638 align:start position:0%
a Board of Medicine with members who may
 
05:23:24.990 --> 05:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
have outdated views or limited
 
05:23:26.670 --> 05:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
understanding of the specialty of
 
05:23:29.190 --> 05:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
Podiatry this further indicates an
 
05:23:31.430 --> 05:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
elevated need for the board of pediatry
 
05:23:33.350 --> 05:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
to continue to exist in its separate
 
05:23:36.150 --> 05:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
autonomous form and ensure that patients
 
05:23:38.110 --> 05:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
are getting the highest level of foot
 
05:23:41.030 --> 05:23:41.040 align:start position:0%

Mr chairman excuse me doctor so is there
 
05:24:08.990 --> 05:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
a difference between a podiatric
 
05:24:10.990 --> 05:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
physician and a
 
05:24:14.070 --> 05:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
podiatrist no it's one and the
 
05:24:18.030 --> 05:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
same you're welcome represent man py
 
05:24:20.548 --> 05:24:20.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for talk to

thank you Mr chair thank you for talk to
this

05:24:22.110 --> 05:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:24:24.990 --> 05:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
way I'm sorry I know you were looking
 
05:24:28.590 --> 05:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
the other way um my question is as a
 
05:24:33.868 --> 05:24:33.878 align:start position:0%
podiatrist um you do go to the senior
 
05:24:37.470 --> 05:24:37.480 align:start position:0%
centers and also nursing homes and
 
05:24:40.670 --> 05:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
Senior Living Facilities is that not
 
05:24:44.110 --> 05:24:44.120 align:start position:0%
true other than the primary care
 
05:24:48.350 --> 05:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
pH geriatric as well as podiatric both
 
05:24:51.310 --> 05:24:51.320 align:start position:0%
go to these Senior Living
 
05:24:53.750 --> 05:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
places yes that is true and that is
 
05:24:56.708 --> 05:24:56.718 align:start position:0%
correct um it depends on each
 
05:24:59.510 --> 05:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
podiatrist's individual practice some
 
05:25:01.868 --> 05:25:01.878 align:start position:0%
podiatrists are very much office and
 
05:25:06.030 --> 05:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
Hospital based and don't go to uh to uh
 
05:25:08.548 --> 05:25:08.558 align:start position:0%
nursing homes or uh long-term care
 
05:25:11.390 --> 05:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
facilities um although many pediatrist
 
05:25:13.948 --> 05:25:13.958 align:start position:0%
do go to long-term care facilities and
 
05:25:16.310 --> 05:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
nursing homes uh and have combined
 
05:25:18.270 --> 05:25:18.280 align:start position:0%
practices that does that do both and
 
05:25:20.990 --> 05:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
some even specifically just go to
 
05:25:22.510 --> 05:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
nursing home
 
05:25:26.310 --> 05:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
facilities follow up thank you my
 
05:25:29.190 --> 05:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up question is as New Hampshire
 
05:25:31.270 --> 05:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
is aging population
 
05:25:35.270 --> 05:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
and the need for jedric as well as
 
05:25:39.868 --> 05:25:39.878 align:start position:0%
podiatric uh Services needed is
 
05:25:43.390 --> 05:25:43.400 align:start position:0%
increasing would that be impacted by
 
05:25:44.670 --> 05:25:44.680 align:start position:0%
combining the
 
05:25:46.910 --> 05:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
boards would that I'm sorry would what
 
05:25:49.230 --> 05:25:49.240 align:start position:0%
the last thing was would that be would
 
05:25:53.110 --> 05:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
that need increased need be impacted by
 
05:25:57.990 --> 05:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:00.868 --> 05:26:00.878 align:start position:0%
boards you know I I don't think that
 
05:26:03.110 --> 05:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
would however I I probably should
 
05:26:04.868 --> 05:26:04.878 align:start position:0%
research that question a little bit more
 
05:26:06.470 --> 05:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's an excellent question and I'm not
 
05:26:08.230 --> 05:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
exactly sure of the answer to that
 
05:26:10.708 --> 05:26:10.718 align:start position:0%
question um and perhaps some of my
 
05:26:13.310 --> 05:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
colleagues to follow could could even uh
 
05:26:15.070 --> 05:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
expand on that or answer it better than
 
05:26:19.750 --> 05:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
I um but uh I would certainly uh like
 
05:26:21.830 --> 05:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to answer that question
 
05:26:23.548 --> 05:26:23.558 align:start position:0%
after some more research and maybe get
 
05:26:26.270 --> 05:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
some get get your information in order
 
05:26:29.350 --> 05:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
to make sure that I do you can send an
 
05:26:34.230 --> 05:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:37.470 --> 05:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
you any other questions seeing none
 
05:26:39.150 --> 05:26:39.160 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
05:26:41.390 --> 05:26:41.400 align:start position:0%

05:26:59.520 --> 05:27:01.430 align:start position:0%
 
bondar

05:27:01.430 --> 05:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
bondar
 
05:27:04.788 --> 05:27:04.798 align:start position:0%
little back things so pardon me um I'm
 
05:27:07.470 --> 05:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
Dr Billy bondar I'm out of Rochester New
 
05:27:09.670 --> 05:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I've practiced 31
 
05:27:14.150 --> 05:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
years uh over there solo practice and
 
05:27:17.110 --> 05:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
I'm here for uh Bill
 
05:27:20.390 --> 05:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
1285 as an opposing
 
05:27:23.708 --> 05:27:23.718 align:start position:0%
voice um interesting enough I haven't
 
05:27:25.948 --> 05:27:25.958 align:start position:0%
been here for years to speak but my
 
05:27:28.948 --> 05:27:28.958 align:start position:0%
cousin is a senator out in Colorado so
 
05:27:31.470 --> 05:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
she told me to go for it
 
05:27:34.390 --> 05:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
um no sugar coating by me I'm not going
 
05:27:37.628 --> 05:27:37.638 align:start position:0%
to um do that but I just want you to
 
05:27:40.350 --> 05:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
realize that Billy my given name is
 
05:27:43.670 --> 05:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
willing protector so for my peers and my
 
05:27:46.788 --> 05:27:46.798 align:start position:0%
patients I am certainly of that nature
 
05:27:51.430 --> 05:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
I'm also a Leo but I will speak about a
 
05:27:53.948 --> 05:27:53.958 align:start position:0%
little bit about my dad my dad was a um
 
05:27:56.948 --> 05:27:56.958 align:start position:0%
a war to vet Battle of the Bulge North
 
05:28:00.830 --> 05:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
Africa Europe served as a dental surgeon
 
05:28:03.030 --> 05:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
um born and raised out of
 
05:28:07.150 --> 05:28:07.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester um he was a colonel he he
 
05:28:08.670 --> 05:28:08.680 align:start position:0%
took over so many different
 
05:28:10.708 --> 05:28:10.718 align:start position:0%
organizations and and things out in
 
05:28:13.150 --> 05:28:13.160 align:start position:0%
Michigan where I was raised um knew a
 
05:28:16.708 --> 05:28:16.718 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of legislators so growing up
 
05:28:18.990 --> 05:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
in and watching him with this and the VA
 
05:28:22.430 --> 05:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
system I saw what a specialty in health
 
05:28:25.628 --> 05:28:25.638 align:start position:0%
care is about and what you have to do to
 
05:28:30.708 --> 05:28:30.718 align:start position:0%
provide your your group um an entity of
 
05:28:33.470 --> 05:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
of of strong people and and getting what
 
05:28:35.990 --> 05:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
is needed for those particular
 
05:28:36.000 --> 05:28:37.708 align:start position:0%
is needed for those particular
professional

05:28:37.708 --> 05:28:37.718 align:start position:0%
professional
 
05:28:40.830 --> 05:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
caregivers um I chose the other end of
 
05:28:44.628 --> 05:28:44.638 align:start position:0%
the the the body part um Foot and Ankle
 
05:28:49.190 --> 05:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh I got my degree in 89 I uh I like to
 
05:28:54.070 --> 05:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
describe my work as Skin to Bone um from
 
05:28:56.230 --> 05:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
the knee to the tip of the toe for
 
05:28:59.150 --> 05:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
children to Elders I think my oldest was
 
05:29:03.390 --> 05:29:03.400 align:start position:0%
106 um um I see podiatrist as
 
05:29:06.750 --> 05:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
fixers uh we are are there to get dirty
 
05:29:08.708 --> 05:29:08.718 align:start position:0%
we do not have the stethoscope around
 
05:29:11.270 --> 05:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
our neck we have lab coats that are
 
05:29:14.868 --> 05:29:14.878 align:start position:0%
grubby by the end of the day um and with
 
05:29:16.830 --> 05:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
a back problem that bending and helping
 
05:29:18.470 --> 05:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
patients with shoes and all that is just
 
05:29:20.310 --> 05:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
getting ridiculous but there's young
 
05:29:22.670 --> 05:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
people back here
 
05:29:26.390 --> 05:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
um but I want to elaborate how a medical
 
05:29:29.948 --> 05:29:29.958 align:start position:0%
doctor does not remove clothing you you
 
05:29:32.150 --> 05:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
go you you know what I'm talking about
 
05:29:33.868 --> 05:29:33.878 align:start position:0%
the socks and shoes aren't removed your
 
05:29:35.750 --> 05:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
your shirt is not removed there are
 
05:29:38.110 --> 05:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
things on your body that are not
 
05:29:40.788 --> 05:29:40.798 align:start position:0%
examined and the foot and the and the
 
05:29:44.150 --> 05:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
lower leg is one of those that seriously
 
05:29:44.160 --> 05:29:44.990 align:start position:0%
lower leg is one of those that seriously
gets

05:29:44.990 --> 05:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
gets
 
05:29:50.070 --> 05:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
missed um so that's one factor um the
 
05:29:53.750 --> 05:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
other Factor being is I as a a
 
05:29:56.270 --> 05:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
professional get occasionally referrals
 
05:29:59.350 --> 05:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
from other Physicians be it Dermatology
 
05:30:02.910 --> 05:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
orthopedic and medical practitioners and
 
05:30:02.920 --> 05:30:04.070 align:start position:0%
orthopedic and medical practitioners and
I

05:30:04.070 --> 05:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:30:08.230 --> 05:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
get I get I don't want to say I just get
 
05:30:11.910 --> 05:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
upset is I'll say it nicely because you
 
05:30:14.788 --> 05:30:14.798 align:start position:0%
can have someone with a medical
 
05:30:17.430 --> 05:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
degree and supposedly they should have
 
05:30:19.548 --> 05:30:19.558 align:start position:0%
got some foot
 
05:30:22.310 --> 05:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
education but they send you a patient
 
05:30:24.310 --> 05:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
that has been diabetic for numerous
 
05:30:28.548 --> 05:30:28.558 align:start position:0%
numerous years and they have a wound on
 
05:30:31.310 --> 05:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
their foot that does not heal
 
05:30:34.030 --> 05:30:34.040 align:start position:0%
and they have been using you know soak
 
05:30:37.788 --> 05:30:37.798 align:start position:0%
that foot do this do that no no
 
05:30:41.110 --> 05:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
particulars um antibiotics of course
 
05:30:45.548 --> 05:30:45.558 align:start position:0%
because that's what you do um that wound
 
05:30:48.470 --> 05:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
heals but then it opens anyways foot
 
05:30:51.628 --> 05:30:51.638 align:start position:0%
dock gets that patient as a foot dock
 
05:30:54.190 --> 05:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
it's a big puzzle to us or to me I'll
 
05:30:57.190 --> 05:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
speak for myself what is this why is it
 
05:31:01.030 --> 05:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
there and you you take the time to ask
 
05:31:03.270 --> 05:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
questions you listen it it's timec
 
05:31:05.230 --> 05:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
consuming medical docs don't have that
 
05:31:07.470 --> 05:31:07.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity with hospitals and insurance
 
05:31:10.990 --> 05:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
telling you what to do and So eventually
 
05:31:12.548 --> 05:31:12.558 align:start position:0%
that particular patient you know what
 
05:31:16.190 --> 05:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
that was for her it was a wart a veruka
 
05:31:19.910 --> 05:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
we call it a simple viral lesion that
 
05:31:23.868 --> 05:31:23.878 align:start position:0%
had been abused by that particular
 
05:31:25.990 --> 05:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
caregiver um
 
05:31:29.548 --> 05:31:29.558 align:start position:0%
incorrectly attended um I have numerous
 
05:31:32.270 --> 05:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
cases being at children I have I'm I'm
 
05:31:34.230 --> 05:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
really going to go for it
 
05:31:38.310 --> 05:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
here Urgent Care Center child goes to
 
05:31:40.590 --> 05:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
the Urgent Care with an ingrown
 
05:31:42.990 --> 05:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
toenail that particular health care
 
05:31:45.548 --> 05:31:45.558 align:start position:0%
provider says I'm going to take care of
 
05:31:49.190 --> 05:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
you parents are there goes to the
 
05:31:51.110 --> 05:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
computer they can see the person going
 
05:31:53.470 --> 05:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
in there and that's the hey social media
 
05:31:56.030 --> 05:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
and whatever will give you
 
05:31:58.390 --> 05:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
information this person numbed up the
 
05:32:00.990 --> 05:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
child's toe it took a a long long time
 
05:32:02.990 --> 05:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
because they don't do it properly you're
 
05:32:05.390 --> 05:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
you just do too little
 
05:32:07.910 --> 05:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
anyways what happened was they removed
 
05:32:12.390 --> 05:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
the nail plate which is a typical for an
 
05:32:15.230 --> 05:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
ingrown they rotated the nail plate
 
05:32:17.788 --> 05:32:17.798 align:start position:0%
around and place the the end that was
 
05:32:20.470 --> 05:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
exposed to the outside the end of the
 
05:32:24.070 --> 05:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
toe back into the flesh they reattached
 
05:32:26.030 --> 05:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
that nail plate with
 
05:32:29.788 --> 05:32:29.798 align:start position:0%
suture and then said there it's all good
 
05:32:32.230 --> 05:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
that's how it'll stay open for a while
 
05:32:35.230 --> 05:32:35.240 align:start position:0%
so it can heal and then you can go see a
 
05:32:37.150 --> 05:32:37.160 align:start position:0%
podiatrist to get the sutures
 
05:32:37.160 --> 05:32:39.670 align:start position:0%
podiatrist to get the sutures
out

05:32:39.670 --> 05:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:32:42.830 --> 05:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
really uh so that that was one of my
 
05:32:46.030 --> 05:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
worst cases I reported that I did and I
 
05:32:47.708 --> 05:32:47.718 align:start position:0%
got an apology
 
05:32:51.708 --> 05:32:51.718 align:start position:0%
from the particular person and he said I
 
05:32:53.990 --> 05:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
was educated at this particular school
 
05:32:57.788 --> 05:32:57.798 align:start position:0%
to do that in medical school
 
05:33:01.310 --> 05:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
really so yeah toe stuff is our stuff uh
 
05:33:03.350 --> 05:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
some of our podiatrists do really big
 
05:33:05.990 --> 05:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
stuff there stuff uh diabetic shco foot
 
05:33:08.150 --> 05:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
is something that you're maybe your
 
05:33:10.030 --> 05:33:10.040 align:start position:0%
mother or your sister might have it it's
 
05:33:12.548 --> 05:33:12.558 align:start position:0%
a toe a foot that swells up it's it's
 
05:33:15.390 --> 05:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
red it's hot not really too painful but
 
05:33:18.470 --> 05:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
hey it it's not right so Dr so and so
 
05:33:20.868 --> 05:33:20.878 align:start position:0%
says I think you got an infection
 
05:33:23.628 --> 05:33:23.638 align:start position:0%
antibiotics weeks go by still swollen
 
05:33:26.670 --> 05:33:26.680 align:start position:0%
maybe gout the emergency room says in
 
05:33:28.750 --> 05:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
the end it's shco foot where the bones
 
05:33:30.830 --> 05:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
are falling apart
 
05:33:33.070 --> 05:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
okay that person has to be in a walking
 
05:33:35.910 --> 05:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
boot or a wheelchair for almost a year
 
05:33:38.310 --> 05:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
Sometimes some of them lose their foot
 
05:33:41.030 --> 05:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
we know what that is we know how to
 
05:33:43.868 --> 05:33:43.878 align:start position:0%
address this issue so that those hazards
 
05:33:46.548 --> 05:33:46.558 align:start position:0%
and horrible situations for that person
 
05:33:50.310 --> 05:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
and the family shall be
 
05:33:53.590 --> 05:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
minimized um and then I'll I'll end with
 
05:33:56.750 --> 05:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
my own situation I ended up
 
05:33:58.708 --> 05:33:58.718 align:start position:0%
personally um I had a friend going
 
05:34:00.390 --> 05:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
through pancreatic cancer which you
 
05:34:02.590 --> 05:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
probably know is very short term and you
 
05:34:05.310 --> 05:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
want to be with that person and anyways
 
05:34:07.590 --> 05:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
I had a lesion on the back of my right
 
05:34:10.190 --> 05:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
calf um I should have gone to one of my
 
05:34:13.230 --> 05:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
peers but I'm a very Polkka doted person
 
05:34:15.230 --> 05:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
meaning I have a lot of moles I went to
 
05:34:17.310 --> 05:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
my Derm as I had for
 
05:34:21.868 --> 05:34:21.878 align:start position:0%
years and she said well watch
 
05:34:25.110 --> 05:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
it I was in my head to help my friend
 
05:34:28.230 --> 05:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
Jess I was flying to and fro from
 
05:34:30.510 --> 05:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
Seattle and I said okay okay I catch you
 
05:34:32.830 --> 05:34:32.840 align:start position:0%
in six months 6 months was 12 months I
 
05:34:37.830 --> 05:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
went back she was retired the next Derm
 
05:34:41.948 --> 05:34:41.958 align:start position:0%
looked at it and said oh hm well
 
05:34:44.830 --> 05:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
maybe I said just take a piece I had
 
05:34:48.230 --> 05:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
noticed changes it was a melanoma I lost
 
05:34:50.070 --> 05:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
this much of My
 
05:34:52.948 --> 05:34:52.958 align:start position:0%
Flesh I've had three of those in my
 
05:34:55.670 --> 05:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
wonderful lifespan so
 
05:35:00.190 --> 05:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
far not there different body parts um we
 
05:35:02.708 --> 05:35:02.718 align:start position:0%
as foot docks We Roll those pant legs up
 
05:35:04.788 --> 05:35:04.798 align:start position:0%
and we look for these lesions and we
 
05:35:07.030 --> 05:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
find these cancers so that someone else
 
05:35:10.390 --> 05:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to go through as much
 
05:35:13.788 --> 05:35:13.798 align:start position:0%
physical despair or potential loss of
 
05:35:17.470 --> 05:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
life we find that stuff and it's
 
05:35:21.628 --> 05:35:21.638 align:start position:0%
amazing and very rewarding and and and I
 
05:35:23.830 --> 05:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
don't believe the medical doctors even
 
05:35:26.990 --> 05:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
look at your legs or your back anymore I
 
05:35:30.030 --> 05:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
know that mine does not so so if if they
 
05:35:32.830 --> 05:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
refer to Derm do they look at the legs
 
05:35:35.390 --> 05:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
no I hear that people come to my office
 
05:35:37.230 --> 05:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
saying yeah I get a Derm visit all the
 
05:35:39.470 --> 05:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
time but they never look at the legs we
 
05:35:40.990 --> 05:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
are the Specialists we know what we're
 
05:35:44.070 --> 05:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
doing I'd like to make certain that this
 
05:35:48.548 --> 05:35:48.558 align:start position:0%
board is its own Unity it it's important
 
05:35:50.350 --> 05:35:50.360 align:start position:0%
for the public and it's important for
 
05:35:53.190 --> 05:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
for us as a profession because we know
 
05:35:55.990 --> 05:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
how to do the work and we know the
 
05:35:58.868 --> 05:35:58.878 align:start position:0%
regulatory legal parameters that issues
 
05:36:01.230 --> 05:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
regarding foot and ankle we've done it
 
05:36:03.788 --> 05:36:03.798 align:start position:0%
for the past for for decades and we can
 
05:36:06.150 --> 05:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
do it for the future the education in
 
05:36:08.628 --> 05:36:08.638 align:start position:0%
the medical system for the medical docs
 
05:36:10.548 --> 05:36:10.558 align:start position:0%
it's it's not there for podiatric it
 
05:36:13.830 --> 05:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
should be I wish it was maybe that's my
 
05:36:17.230 --> 05:36:17.240 align:start position:0%
retirement goal but um thank you for
 
05:36:19.350 --> 05:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
letting me speak thank you for your
 
05:36:21.590 --> 05:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
testimony any
 
05:36:23.868 --> 05:36:23.878 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
05:36:25.868 --> 05:36:25.878 align:start position:0%
much um just looking at the number of
 
05:36:27.470 --> 05:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
cards that I have in front of me on this
 
05:36:30.470 --> 05:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
issue uh as you come up to testify um if
 
05:36:33.070 --> 05:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
you can try to emphasize uh how you feel
 
05:36:35.470 --> 05:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
like the changing of the the board's
 
05:36:38.788 --> 05:36:38.798 align:start position:0%
construction would uh would affect the
 
05:36:40.830 --> 05:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
practice that would that would be best
 
05:36:42.628 --> 05:36:42.638 align:start position:0%
um we understand that there's obviously
 
05:36:45.230 --> 05:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
differences between podiatrist and
 
05:36:47.788 --> 05:36:47.798 align:start position:0%
medical profession at large so um if you
 
05:36:49.110 --> 05:36:49.120 align:start position:0%
could emphasize that stuff that would be
 
05:36:58.270 --> 05:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:00.270 --> 05:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
Kelly thank you
 
05:37:03.150 --> 05:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
I also have a a copy here of my
 
05:37:07.470 --> 05:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
testimony uh just have one copy um but
 
05:37:10.030 --> 05:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
it is primarily indicated with what I'll
 
05:37:12.708 --> 05:37:12.718 align:start position:0%
be reading before you guys
 
05:37:15.110 --> 05:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
today good afternoon my name is Dr
 
05:37:17.150 --> 05:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
Michael Kelly and I'm a practicing
 
05:37:19.990 --> 05:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
podiatric surgeon in Nash New Hampshire
 
05:37:22.510 --> 05:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
at St Joseph hospital and I'm a member
 
05:37:24.708 --> 05:37:24.718 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire podiatric Medical
 
05:37:27.310 --> 05:37:27.320 align:start position:0%
Association I stand before you today to
 
05:37:30.910 --> 05:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose house bill 1285 which
 
05:37:32.708 --> 05:37:32.718 align:start position:0%
proposes a merger of the board of
 
05:37:35.590 --> 05:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
Podiatry with the Board of Medicine I
 
05:37:38.310 --> 05:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
firmly believe that this merger poses a
 
05:37:41.070 --> 05:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
serious threat to Public Safety
 
05:37:42.990 --> 05:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
increases the burden on Health Care
 
05:37:45.670 --> 05:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
Professionals and disregards the unique
 
05:37:48.590 --> 05:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
role that podiatric Physicians play in
 
05:37:50.948 --> 05:37:50.958 align:start position:0%
our health care System the claim that
 
05:37:53.310 --> 05:37:53.320 align:start position:0%
merging the boards will result in cost
 
05:37:55.708 --> 05:37:55.718 align:start position:0%
savings and reduced administrative
 
05:37:58.590 --> 05:37:58.600 align:start position:0%
insufficiencies is a misconception the
 
05:38:00.548 --> 05:38:00.558 align:start position:0%
workload disparity between the Board of
 
05:38:03.310 --> 05:38:03.320 align:start position:0%
Medicine and the board of Podiatry is
 
05:38:05.948 --> 05:38:05.958 align:start position:0%
substantial while the former requires a
 
05:38:09.070 --> 05:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
full day every month the latter only
 
05:38:12.670 --> 05:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
necessitates a half day meeting every
 
05:38:15.070 --> 05:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
quarter merging the boards when
 
05:38:17.190 --> 05:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
inevitability burden the Board of
 
05:38:20.030 --> 05:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
Medicine leading to increased
 
05:38:22.548 --> 05:38:22.558 align:start position:0%
efficiencies rather than cost
 
05:38:24.830 --> 05:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
savings the proposed increased in
 
05:38:26.708 --> 05:38:26.718 align:start position:0%
meeting frequency for the board of
 
05:38:29.708 --> 05:38:29.718 align:start position:0%
Podiatry members from four day four half
 
05:38:32.990 --> 05:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
days meetings to 12 full day meetings is
 
05:38:35.390 --> 05:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
not only a significant time commitment
 
05:38:38.788 --> 05:38:38.798 align:start position:0%
but also a potential deterent for future
 
05:38:41.270 --> 05:38:41.280 align:start position:0%

05:42:11.070 --> 05:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:13.230 --> 05:42:13.240 align:start position:0%
well good afternoon I don't have any
 
05:42:16.788 --> 05:42:16.798 align:start position:0%
copies but my Post-its will be available
 
05:42:20.830 --> 05:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
afterwards um I have to change
 
05:42:24.390 --> 05:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
glasses uh somewhat prepared um one
 
05:42:27.150 --> 05:42:27.160 align:start position:0%
thing well I'm Dave bis I'm a podiatrist
 
05:42:28.830 --> 05:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm originally from Chicago I've been
 
05:42:32.030 --> 05:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
here since since uh 2002 uh private
 
05:42:34.788 --> 05:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
practice right now up by Airport
 
05:42:38.468 --> 05:42:38.478 align:start position:0%
Road um one thing I'd like to just make
 
05:42:41.070 --> 05:42:41.080 align:start position:0%
clear I don't know if everyone knows but
 
05:42:42.990 --> 05:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
um podiatrists have their own degree we
 
05:42:44.708 --> 05:42:44.718 align:start position:0%
go to a separate school I believe right
 
05:42:46.990 --> 05:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
now there's 10 uh different pediatry
 
05:42:49.628 --> 05:42:49.638 align:start position:0%
schools and who knows how many MD
 
05:42:52.670 --> 05:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
schools we have similar training through
 
05:42:55.670 --> 05:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
most of schooling um and then we diverge
 
05:42:56.990 --> 05:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
in the third and fourth years where we
 
05:43:00.750 --> 05:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
do um our clinical times different with
 
05:43:03.070 --> 05:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
different emphasis of course being lower
 
05:43:06.390 --> 05:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
extremity so we have um depending on the
 
05:43:08.910 --> 05:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
training program uh maybe a lot maybe a
 
05:43:10.350 --> 05:43:10.360 align:start position:0%
little uh
 
05:43:14.190 --> 05:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
interaction with MDS on a regular basis
 
05:43:17.350 --> 05:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
um and I think uh part of what that
 
05:43:21.230 --> 05:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
speaks to is the familiarity between a
 
05:43:24.510 --> 05:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
lot of say an MD or a do and podiatrists
 
05:43:27.548 --> 05:43:27.558 align:start position:0%
we have uh I'm what you'd call I think a
 
05:43:30.390 --> 05:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
a regular community pediatrist I perform
 
05:43:32.750 --> 05:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of different services for
 
05:43:36.110 --> 05:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
people uh such as in day-to-day practice
 
05:43:39.150 --> 05:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
I do everything I cut toenails I trim
 
05:43:41.868 --> 05:43:41.878 align:start position:0%
calluses I take care of ulcers as
 
05:43:44.390 --> 05:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned we do wound care I do a lot of
 
05:43:48.030 --> 05:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
different minor in office procedures and
 
05:43:52.430 --> 05:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh hospital-based uh surgery I mold for
 
05:43:55.070 --> 05:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
and have made in dispensed leg and foot
 
05:43:58.708 --> 05:43:58.718 align:start position:0%
braces uh podiatrists perform uh in
 
05:44:01.350 --> 05:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
office Diagnostics ultrasounds and
 
05:44:03.430 --> 05:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
x-rays and we interpret them ourselves
 
05:44:05.030 --> 05:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
kind of like a dentist uh we don't have
 
05:44:06.150 --> 05:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
to have them
 
05:44:09.430 --> 05:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
overread and um some of that
 
05:44:11.670 --> 05:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
requires uh even the simple things such
 
05:44:13.750 --> 05:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
as trimming callous and uh cutting Nails
 
05:44:15.548 --> 05:44:15.558 align:start position:0%
requires um sort of our own set of
 
05:44:19.910 --> 05:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
instruments and a way to prepare them uh
 
05:44:21.590 --> 05:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
basically sterilize them keep them clean
 
05:44:24.030 --> 05:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
how we how we take care of them uh what
 
05:44:27.310 --> 05:44:27.320 align:start position:0%
we do on a day-to-day basis
 
05:44:30.590 --> 05:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
um it's not that familiar with what a
 
05:44:33.990 --> 05:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
lot of other doctors um perceive of us
 
05:44:35.990 --> 05:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
basically there is um a large difference
 
05:44:38.910 --> 05:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
in what we do what we can do and the
 
05:44:41.910 --> 05:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
familiarity with a lot of MDS uh with
 
05:44:46.990 --> 05:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
that um and so it's it's my opinion that
 
05:44:48.708 --> 05:44:48.718 align:start position:0%
the practice of podiatric medicine
 
05:44:52.468 --> 05:44:52.478 align:start position:0%
requires its own board um to evaluate
 
05:44:54.670 --> 05:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
complaints and look after the safety
 
05:44:58.190 --> 05:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
concerns of patients uh and the public
 
05:45:01.750 --> 05:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
um was on the board of pediatry for five
 
05:45:05.868 --> 05:45:05.878 align:start position:0%
years I guess it ended uh six years ago
 
05:45:07.788 --> 05:45:07.798 align:start position:0%
um and with the complaints and things
 
05:45:11.150 --> 05:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
that came through um I can just tell
 
05:45:14.628 --> 05:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
that the the way that we perceive things
 
05:45:17.150 --> 05:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
um and it's just it's a little bit
 
05:45:19.150 --> 05:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
different we perform we're allopathic
 
05:45:24.190 --> 05:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
Physicians just like um an MD is um but
 
05:45:26.548 --> 05:45:26.558 align:start position:0%
the way we approach patients uh and
 
05:45:29.510 --> 05:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
especially the breadth of treatments
 
05:45:32.830 --> 05:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
available uh performing routine care
 
05:45:37.070 --> 05:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
such as Nails minor in-office procedures
 
05:45:37.080 --> 05:45:38.750 align:start position:0%
such as Nails minor in-office procedures
hospital-based

05:45:38.750 --> 05:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
hospital-based
 
05:45:41.830 --> 05:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
surgery and the Diagnostics it's just
 
05:45:45.230 --> 05:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's wide ranging and it's a bit
 
05:45:47.830 --> 05:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
more wide ranging than I think most
 
05:45:50.150 --> 05:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
Medical Specialties
 
05:45:53.430 --> 05:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
are and it's just my opinion that it
 
05:45:56.190 --> 05:45:56.200 align:start position:0%
requires its own board to look after
 
05:45:56.200 --> 05:45:57.788 align:start position:0%
requires its own board to look after
those

05:45:57.788 --> 05:45:57.798 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:45:57.798 --> 05:45:59.628 align:start position:0%
those
things

05:45:59.628 --> 05:45:59.638 align:start position:0%
things

05:47:41.948 --> 05:47:41.958 align:start position:0%
Medical Association wishes to express
 
05:47:44.390 --> 05:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
its strong and unequivocal opposition to
 
05:47:47.230 --> 05:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
this proposal while we commend uh
 
05:47:49.468 --> 05:47:49.478 align:start position:0%
chairwoman Maguire for her efforts to
 
05:47:51.628 --> 05:47:51.638 align:start position:0%
identify opportunities and improve

administrative efficiency and lower
 
05:47:56.030 --> 05:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
costs uh we do not believe that this
 
05:47:58.750 --> 05:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
change will accomplish that goal the
 
05:47:59.788 --> 05:47:59.798 align:start position:0%
Board of
 
05:48:02.750 --> 05:48:02.760 align:start position:0%

physician assistants under its Authority
 
05:48:09.788 --> 05:48:09.798 align:start position:0%
and takes a full day of meetings every
 
05:48:12.390 --> 05:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
month to manage administrative uh
 
05:48:14.708 --> 05:48:14.718 align:start position:0%
processes concerns and complaints for
 
05:48:14.718 --> 05:48:15.708 align:start position:0%
processes concerns and complaints for
those

05:48:15.708 --> 05:48:15.718 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:48:19.670 --> 05:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
professionals to this point from 2020 to
 
05:48:23.190 --> 05:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
2023 the Board of Medicine has held uh
 
05:48:25.548 --> 05:48:25.558 align:start position:0%
disciplinary hearings and made decisions
 
05:48:28.948 --> 05:48:28.958 align:start position:0%
on 14 individuals per year on average
 
05:48:31.350 --> 05:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
average uh in contrast the board of
 
05:48:34.310 --> 05:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
Podiatry meets every quarter for a half
 
05:48:36.830 --> 05:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
day and has taken disciplinary action
 
05:48:38.788 --> 05:48:38.798 align:start position:0%
against one podiatric physician in the
 
05:48:40.350 --> 05:48:40.360 align:start position:0%
past seven
 
05:48:42.948 --> 05:48:42.958 align:start position:0%
years uh adding oversight and regulation
 
05:48:44.708 --> 05:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
of podiatric Physicians to the Board of
 
05:48:46.788 --> 05:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
Medicine will not lessen the amount of
 
05:48:49.750 --> 05:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
time needed to process and function
 
05:48:52.590 --> 05:48:52.600 align:start position:0%
effectively additionally for the
 
05:48:54.468 --> 05:48:54.478 align:start position:0%
essentially unpaid volunteers who serve
 
05:48:56.948 --> 05:48:56.958 align:start position:0%
in these roles uh this would be a
 
05:48:59.270 --> 05:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
significant increase in time required to
 
05:49:01.948 --> 05:49:01.958 align:start position:0%
participate and be a deterrent to Future
 
05:49:01.958 --> 05:49:03.590 align:start position:0%
participate and be a deterrent to Future
members

05:49:03.590 --> 05:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
members
 
05:49:06.230 --> 05:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
serving furthermore the inefficiencies
 
05:49:08.628 --> 05:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
may be compounded by having allopathic
 
05:49:11.430 --> 05:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
and osteopathic Specialties evaluating
 
05:49:14.070 --> 05:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
podiatric Physicians with which they
 
05:49:15.750 --> 05:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
have no practical
 
05:49:19.390 --> 05:49:19.400 align:start position:0%
familiarity uh podiatrists MDS and dos
 
05:49:21.430 --> 05:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
share some of the same underlying
 
05:49:24.110 --> 05:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
training education uh four years of
 
05:49:25.990 --> 05:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
undergraduate education four years of
 
05:49:28.070 --> 05:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
medical education and three years or at
 
05:49:30.590 --> 05:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
least three years of residency however
 
05:49:32.910 --> 05:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
podiatrists receive a significantly more
 
05:49:35.628 --> 05:49:35.638 align:start position:0%
focused uh education on lower extremity
 
05:49:38.548 --> 05:49:38.558 align:start position:0%
care with emphasis of the Foot and Ankle
 
05:49:40.430 --> 05:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
a separate Board of Podiatry helps to
 
05:49:42.590 --> 05:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
signal to the public that podiatric
 
05:49:44.468 --> 05:49:44.478 align:start position:0%
Physicians practicing in the state of
 
05:49:47.350 --> 05:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are appropriately and
 
05:49:50.110 --> 05:49:50.120 align:start position:0%
efficiently evaluated for licensing and
 
05:49:50.120 --> 05:49:51.070 align:start position:0%
efficiently evaluated for licensing and
are

05:49:51.070 --> 05:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:49:53.350 --> 05:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
monitored this leads New Hampshire
 
05:49:55.110 --> 05:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
podiatric Medical Association to its
 
05:49:57.190 --> 05:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
secondary and arguably more important
 
05:49:59.708 --> 05:49:59.718 align:start position:0%

Medical Association does not believe
 
05:50:08.910 --> 05:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
that merging the board of Podiatry with
 
05:50:10.230 --> 05:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine will serve
 
05:50:12.468 --> 05:50:12.478 align:start position:0%
patients in New Hampshire the ongoing
 
05:50:14.548 --> 05:50:14.558 align:start position:0%

ongoing registration of podiatric
 
05:50:22.190 --> 05:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
Physicians it goes beyond the advocacy
 
05:50:24.510 --> 05:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
of the podiatric profession it goes
 
05:50:26.628 --> 05:50:26.638 align:start position:0%

incompetent uh podiatric practice at the
 
05:50:56.350 --> 05:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
heart of how it safeguards the public is
 
05:50:59.310 --> 05:50:59.320 align:start position:0%
by directly reviewing the ongoing Contin
 
05:51:01.390 --> 05:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
uh continuing medical education

small sample of licensed Physicians to

auton autonomous Board of Podiatry keeps

Medical Association stresses that New
 
05:51:21.230 --> 05:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would be in the minority of
 
05:51:23.948 --> 05:51:23.958 align:start position:0%
Professional Licensing boards structure
 
05:51:25.510 --> 05:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
if it were to adopt the proposed
 
05:51:26.990 --> 05:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to consolidate the boards
 
05:51:30.230 --> 05:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
under the Board of Medicine
 
05:51:31.948 --> 05:51:31.958 align:start position:0%
um more than two-thirds of the states
 
05:51:34.390 --> 05:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
maintain a separate Board of Licensing
 
05:51:36.990 --> 05:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
and regulation for podiatric Physicians
 
05:51:39.030 --> 05:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
because these states recognize that it
 
05:51:41.750 --> 05:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
serves Public Health interests to do so
 
05:51:43.708 --> 05:51:43.718 align:start position:0%
in the New England region alone Maine
 
05:51:45.590 --> 05:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Rhode Island Connecticut
 
05:51:48.430 --> 05:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
and New York are all separate boards

adopting this amendment and ending New
 
05:51:53.230 --> 05:51:53.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's uh Board of Podiatry
 
05:51:55.390 --> 05:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
autonomy by consolidating the boards it
 
05:51:56.948 --> 05:51:56.958 align:start position:0%
would be a disservice to the patients in
 
05:51:59.750 --> 05:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire once again on behalf of

Association and the state's expert foot
 
05:52:06.110 --> 05:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
in ankle care uh and Physicians we thank
 
05:52:07.430 --> 05:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to provide
 
05:52:10.190 --> 05:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
feedback on the proposed Bill thank you
 
05:52:11.510 --> 05:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
for your testimony will you take
 
05:52:13.910 --> 05:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
questions sure any questions represent
 
05:52:17.150 --> 05:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
manager P thank you Ma Mr chair thank
 
05:52:19.708 --> 05:52:19.718 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question the question
 
05:52:22.948 --> 05:52:22.958 align:start position:0%
I asked to your previous colleague who
 
05:52:27.230 --> 05:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
um there's the need in as the state
 
05:52:30.390 --> 05:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
population aging population increase is
 
05:52:31.948 --> 05:52:31.958 align:start position:0%
there a need
 
05:52:37.150 --> 05:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
in increased need for podiatrist because
 
05:52:40.150 --> 05:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
that exclusive that population needs
 
05:52:43.670 --> 05:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
more of that care sure there could be a
 
05:52:46.910 --> 05:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
increase need for pitous um I think
 
05:52:49.430 --> 05:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
that's what you're getting at yes
 
05:52:53.708 --> 05:52:53.718 align:start position:0%
yep to clarify um since you're the board
 
05:52:57.430 --> 05:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
president right now or chair for uh I'm
 
05:53:01.628 --> 05:53:01.638 align:start position:0%
not the board of di um Dr surri is here
 
05:53:04.670 --> 05:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
yes um were you asking the same question
 
05:53:06.270 --> 05:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
as you had previously asked about how
 
05:53:09.670 --> 05:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
would this affect the correct um I
 
05:53:13.468 --> 05:53:13.478 align:start position:0%
believe if you're making the argument of
 
05:53:15.350 --> 05:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
an increased need for pediatry in the
 
05:53:17.948 --> 05:53:17.958 align:start position:0%
state I think it would be affected by if
 
05:53:19.150 --> 05:53:19.160 align:start position:0%
if you're merging the two boards
 
05:53:20.750 --> 05:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
together it potentially could take
 
05:53:23.030 --> 05:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
longer to have if you're needing new
 
05:53:25.468 --> 05:53:25.478 align:start position:0%
pediatrist in the state that process of
 
05:53:28.190 --> 05:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
getting new podiatrist license could be
 
05:53:30.430 --> 05:53:30.440 align:start position:0%
become longer if you roll these two
 
05:53:30.440 --> 05:53:32.150 align:start position:0%
become longer if you roll these two
boards

05:53:32.150 --> 05:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
boards
 
05:53:35.830 --> 05:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
together so any other questions saying
 
05:53:39.390 --> 05:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:41.150 --> 05:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
testimony sorry I probably won't get
 
05:53:42.310 --> 05:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
this last name right I can't quite read
 
05:53:57.070 --> 05:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:57.080 --> 05:54:03.990 align:start position:0%
 
samre

05:54:03.990 --> 05:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:05.468 --> 05:54:05.478 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving me the opportunity
 
05:54:09.708 --> 05:54:09.718 align:start position:0%
to speak about HB 1285 I am Dr Jennifer
 
05:54:11.270 --> 05:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
saror and I've have been practicing in
 
05:54:14.430 --> 05:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for 22 years while I
 
05:54:16.548 --> 05:54:16.558 align:start position:0%
currently serve on the board of Podiatry
 
05:54:18.990 --> 05:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
as the chair I must state that I am not
 
05:54:20.628 --> 05:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
providing the position of the board at
 
05:54:23.270 --> 05:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
this time the board was unable to meet
 
05:54:25.270 --> 05:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
in a timely manner to provide a formal
 
05:54:28.948 --> 05:54:28.958 align:start position:0%
opinion on HB 1285 so I am here as a
 
05:54:31.390 --> 05:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
citizen and a practicing podiatrist and
 
05:54:34.628 --> 05:54:34.638 align:start position:0%
I am in opposition to hb1
 
05:54:36.628 --> 05:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
1285 I'm sure this bill is
 
05:54:40.548 --> 05:54:40.558 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned and I'm sure um it's
 
05:54:42.510 --> 05:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
trying to streamline operations and
 
05:54:42.520 --> 05:54:43.788 align:start position:0%
trying to streamline operations and
costs

05:54:43.788 --> 05:54:43.798 align:start position:0%
costs
 
05:54:45.948 --> 05:54:45.958 align:start position:0%
But like everyone else that has
 
05:54:49.590 --> 05:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
testified before me I think they um have
 
05:54:52.708 --> 05:54:52.718 align:start position:0%
stated it pretty well it it has serious
 
05:54:55.708 --> 05:54:55.718 align:start position:0%
consequences from potentially limiting
 
05:54:58.788 --> 05:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
licenses um taking a long time to get
 
05:55:02.868 --> 05:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
podiatrist licensed um maybe not holding
 
05:55:04.788 --> 05:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
them as accountable as they should be
 
05:55:07.510 --> 05:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
because the rules of the Podiatry board
 
05:55:10.110 --> 05:55:10.120 align:start position:0%
are not known to the Board of Medicine
 
05:55:12.110 --> 05:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm not even sure how those two are
 
05:55:14.468 --> 05:55:14.478 align:start position:0%
going to be combined we have separate
 
05:55:16.468 --> 05:55:16.478 align:start position:0%
exams that we take that are different
 
05:55:18.830 --> 05:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
from medicine MDS
 
05:55:23.948 --> 05:55:23.958 align:start position:0%
dos um the rules are extensive I'm sure
 
05:55:25.868 --> 05:55:25.878 align:start position:0%
on the board of medicine and as well as
 
05:55:29.070 --> 05:55:29.080 align:start position:0%
on the board of Podiatry so Podiatry is
 
05:55:30.510 --> 05:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
definitely a specialized field you've
 
05:55:32.670 --> 05:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
heard from others today on what that is
 
05:55:35.990 --> 05:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go into that um I think
 
05:55:37.590 --> 05:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
the merging of the two boards would
 
05:55:39.430 --> 05:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
result in a loss of focus on the
 
05:55:41.150 --> 05:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
specific needs and issues facing the
 
05:55:42.990 --> 05:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
podiatrists in the communities of New
 
05:55:46.070 --> 05:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we Face unique challenges and
 
05:55:48.030 --> 05:55:48.040 align:start position:0%
we have concerns that are distinct from
 
05:55:49.750 --> 05:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
the other Medical
 
05:55:52.868 --> 05:55:52.878 align:start position:0%
Specialties um and I think we really
 
05:55:55.590 --> 05:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
need a dedicated board for Podiatry I
 
05:55:58.590 --> 05:55:58.600 align:start position:0%
was opposed to this merger previously
 
05:56:01.708 --> 05:56:01.718 align:start position:0%
um and I'm opposed to it again and um I
 
05:56:06.468 --> 05:56:06.478 align:start position:0%
think you're going to see um that it's
 
05:56:08.548 --> 05:56:08.558 align:start position:0%
going to be impossible to merge the two
 
05:56:12.910 --> 05:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
boards and consistently have
 
05:56:15.350 --> 05:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
um people being able to get their
 
05:56:18.230 --> 05:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
license being held accountable for any
 
05:56:21.708 --> 05:56:21.718 align:start position:0%
kind of discipline and then um just
 
05:56:25.788 --> 05:56:25.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:28.270 --> 05:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
process and I really urge you you to
 
05:56:32.110 --> 05:56:32.120 align:start position:0%
really reconsider this bill and not
 
05:56:35.590 --> 05:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
merge the two boards together I also
 
05:56:40.468 --> 05:56:40.478 align:start position:0%
worry about restriction of trade um with
 
05:56:42.468 --> 05:56:42.478 align:start position:0%
the merger of the two boards and I worry
 
05:56:45.830 --> 05:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
about lawsuits coming up
 
05:56:48.270 --> 05:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
um the boards don't have
 
05:56:51.110 --> 05:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
immunity they can still be sued and if
 
05:56:53.110 --> 05:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
you have someone disciplining without
 
05:56:56.030 --> 05:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
the same license without the same
 
05:56:58.430 --> 05:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
initials behind their name I just worry
 
05:57:02.190 --> 05:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
that that opens up trouble so again I
 
05:57:04.548 --> 05:57:04.558 align:start position:0%
hope for you to reconsider this proposal
 
05:57:07.670 --> 05:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
on this bill and I appreciate you
 
05:57:10.628 --> 05:57:10.638 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak and I appreciate
 
05:57:12.948 --> 05:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
everything that you do for the citizens
 
05:57:17.110 --> 05:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire thank you thank you any
 
05:57:19.030 --> 05:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you so much
 
05:57:21.750 --> 05:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:23.750 --> 05:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
testimony question of the community does
 
05:57:25.190 --> 05:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions for the
 
05:57:25.200 --> 05:57:26.788 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions for the
governor's

05:57:26.788 --> 05:57:26.798 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
05:57:26.798 --> 05:57:30.868 align:start position:0%
governor's
office

05:57:30.868 --> 05:57:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:34.390 --> 05:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
yeah D you're off the
 
05:57:37.948 --> 05:57:37.958 align:start position:0%
hook I'll call uh director Courtney
 
05:57:45.430 --> 05:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:47.750 --> 05:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
hook thank you Mr chair members of the
 
05:57:49.468 --> 05:57:49.478 align:start position:0%
committee lindsy Courtney executive
 
05:57:51.510 --> 05:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
director I think the first thing that I
 
05:57:53.868 --> 05:57:53.878 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify is that this bill and
 
05:57:55.910 --> 05:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
the bill that you're about to hear was
 
05:57:58.310 --> 05:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
not made at the request of the office of
 
05:58:00.070 --> 05:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
professional ice insur and
 
05:58:02.590 --> 05:58:02.600 align:start position:0%
certification um as always we provide
 
05:58:04.910 --> 05:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
technical assistance when requested but
 
05:58:06.830 --> 05:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
as you know this um these were
 
05:58:08.750 --> 05:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
initiatives that were contained in House
 
05:58:10.070 --> 05:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 of last year and so we're
 
05:58:12.590 --> 05:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
essentially carry over until this year
 
05:58:15.708 --> 05:58:15.718 align:start position:0%
um so in any event um I really just
 
05:58:17.868 --> 05:58:17.878 align:start position:0%
wanted to make myself available again to
 
05:58:19.868 --> 05:58:19.878 align:start position:0%
answer questions but I would note a few
 
05:58:22.150 --> 05:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
things um based on the testimony the
 
05:58:23.590 --> 05:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
first is that the Board of Medicine
 
05:58:26.310 --> 05:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
currently has um actually there are
 
05:58:28.510 --> 05:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
three different degrees that member or
 
05:58:30.390 --> 05:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
that the regulated professionals have
 
05:58:33.030 --> 05:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
there's the MD the do and then of course
 
05:58:36.030 --> 05:58:36.040 align:start position:0%
the physician assistant in some states
 
05:58:38.350 --> 05:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
um Vermont is one of them there are
 
05:58:40.030 --> 05:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
different boards that regulate whether
 
05:58:43.310 --> 05:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
you have a a a do or an MD our state has
 
05:58:45.390 --> 05:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
a a composite board and so I think
 
05:58:47.070 --> 05:58:47.080 align:start position:0%
there's a history there of the Board of
 
05:58:50.030 --> 05:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
Medicine being able to regulate multiple
 
05:58:50.040 --> 05:58:50.910 align:start position:0%
Medicine being able to regulate multiple
different

05:58:50.910 --> 05:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:58:53.190 --> 05:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
disciplines um in an efficient orderly
 
05:58:54.868 --> 05:58:54.878 align:start position:0%
fashion but also in a collaborative
 
05:58:57.390 --> 05:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
fashion they're um they you know they
 
05:58:59.868 --> 05:58:59.878 align:start position:0%
meet regularly they uh collaborate with
 
05:59:01.310 --> 05:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
each other to make sure that they have
 
05:59:02.628 --> 05:59:02.638 align:start position:0%
the requisite
 
05:59:04.868 --> 05:59:04.878 align:start position:0%
expertise and when you think about who's
 
05:59:06.350 --> 05:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
on the board of medicine and the
 
05:59:08.670 --> 05:59:08.680 align:start position:0%
Specialties that comprise uh the
 
05:59:11.390 --> 05:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
regulated Community um you've got
 
05:59:14.548 --> 05:59:14.558 align:start position:0%
Orthopedics you've got OBGYNs you've got
 
05:59:16.788 --> 05:59:16.798 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologists Radiologists there are
 
05:59:18.390 --> 05:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
a number of Specialties that are
 
05:59:21.468 --> 05:59:21.478 align:start position:0%
regulated by this one board so I I think
 
05:59:23.390 --> 05:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
that regardless and again the office is
 
05:59:24.948 --> 05:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
not taking a position but if the
 
05:59:26.948 --> 05:59:26.958 align:start position:0%
legislature chooses to go forward with
 
05:59:30.070 --> 05:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
this um composite approach I feel very
 
05:59:31.590 --> 05:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
confident that there's no doubt the
 
05:59:33.590 --> 05:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine would be able to be
 
05:59:36.430 --> 05:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
effective a couple of the um the
 
05:59:38.628 --> 05:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
comments that we heard in the in the in
 
05:59:40.590 --> 05:59:40.600 align:start position:0%
the stories about podiatric medicine and
 
05:59:43.030 --> 05:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
the the concerns specifically about uh
 
05:59:45.670 --> 05:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
Physicians or MDS Doo's treating um
 
05:59:47.468 --> 05:59:47.478 align:start position:0%
ailments uh that are probably better
 
05:59:49.990 --> 05:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
referred to podiatrists actually led me
 
05:59:51.670 --> 05:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
to think that maybe the Board of
 
05:59:53.510 --> 05:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
Medicine could benefit from having a
 
05:59:58.030 --> 05:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
podiatrist on um its board and that if
 
06:00:00.628 --> 06:00:00.638 align:start position:0%
under the circumstances presented by one
 
06:00:02.990 --> 06:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
of the individuals testified today had
 
06:00:04.830 --> 06:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
been brought to the Board of Medicine
 
06:00:06.510 --> 06:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
that board wouldn't have the expertise
 
06:00:08.110 --> 06:00:08.120 align:start position:0%
needed to be able to determine whether
 
06:00:10.510 --> 06:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
or not that person was acting recklessly
 
06:00:12.548 --> 06:00:12.558 align:start position:0%
in providing that care and that's
 
06:00:13.990 --> 06:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
something that maybe the committee would
 
06:00:15.750 --> 06:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
like to consider again I'm not taking a
 
06:00:17.548 --> 06:00:17.558 align:start position:0%
position but it was just something that
 
06:00:20.788 --> 06:00:20.798 align:start position:0%
I I noted um given the concerns that
 
06:00:23.670 --> 06:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
were raised um finally there was a
 
06:00:25.430 --> 06:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
comment about immunity I want to be
 
06:00:27.910 --> 06:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
clear that boards do have immunity it's
 
06:00:31.110 --> 06:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
under RSA 999d that's immunity under
 
06:00:33.750 --> 06:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
state law for certain circumstances
 
06:00:35.948 --> 06:00:35.958 align:start position:0%
essentially can't act recklessly but
 
06:00:37.468 --> 06:00:37.478 align:start position:0%
then there's immunity as it relates to
 
06:00:39.390 --> 06:00:39.400 align:start position:0%
antitrust under federal law and that was
 
06:00:40.628 --> 06:00:40.638 align:start position:0%
the immunity issues that I was
 
06:00:43.628 --> 06:00:43.638 align:start position:0%
discussing previously so um there is
 
06:00:46.390 --> 06:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
immunity enjoyed by board members um but
 
06:00:48.030 --> 06:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
there are parameters in order for you to
 
06:00:49.628 --> 06:00:49.638 align:start position:0%
qualify but I just wanted to correct
 
06:00:52.150 --> 06:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
that record I'd be Happ to answer any
 
06:00:53.990 --> 06:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have
 
06:00:57.830 --> 06:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative leus thank you um so some
 
06:00:59.628 --> 06:00:59.638 align:start position:0%
questions that are all kind of the
 
06:01:01.868 --> 06:01:01.878 align:start position:0%
similar we've had before as to potential
 
06:01:05.110 --> 06:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
issues with the board so um you know is
 
06:01:06.670 --> 06:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
there a concern with the board of
 
06:01:08.830 --> 06:01:08.840 align:start position:0%
Podiatry with the number of people
 
06:01:11.230 --> 06:01:11.240 align:start position:0%
licensed around antitrust I mean I
 
06:01:12.708 --> 06:01:12.718 align:start position:0%
assume if it's a small number that's a
 
06:01:15.628 --> 06:01:15.638 align:start position:0%
bigger concern so that's one so the
 
06:01:18.708 --> 06:01:18.718 align:start position:0%
board of Podiatry has about a 100 lenes
 
06:01:21.590 --> 06:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
and so as we we talked earlier I think
 
06:01:23.948 --> 06:01:23.958 align:start position:0%
there's always a higher risk when you
 
06:01:26.750 --> 06:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
have fewer licenses regulated by active
 
06:01:28.270 --> 06:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
Market particip ANS there's certainly
 
06:01:31.548 --> 06:01:31.558 align:start position:0%
always a a higher risk there followup
 
06:01:34.670 --> 06:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
followup similarly um you know how often
 
06:01:36.468 --> 06:01:36.478 align:start position:0%
are there complaints I we heard there
 
06:01:39.430 --> 06:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
was one action taken but you know how
 
06:01:41.708 --> 06:01:41.718 align:start position:0%
often are there complaints you don't
 
06:01:43.590 --> 06:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
receive that many complaints thankfully
 
06:01:45.548 --> 06:01:45.558 align:start position:0%
they did have some continuing education
 
06:01:48.510 --> 06:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
issues last year um that were dealt with
 
06:01:50.110 --> 06:01:50.120 align:start position:0%
with public hearings but they don't
 
06:01:52.868 --> 06:01:52.878 align:start position:0%
receive that many complaints and I and I
 
06:01:56.590 --> 06:01:56.600 align:start position:0%
would agree that um that certainly that
 
06:02:00.788 --> 06:02:00.798 align:start position:0%
if if the s were to be merged the um the
 
06:02:02.948 --> 06:02:02.958 align:start position:0%
podiatrist members on the Board of
 
06:02:06.310 --> 06:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
Medicine would uh certainly have to meet
 
06:02:09.390 --> 06:02:09.400 align:start position:0%
more frequently and probably longer um
 
06:02:11.190 --> 06:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
because that that board Board of
 
06:02:14.510 --> 06:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
Medicine has many more complaints follow
 
06:02:16.830 --> 06:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
up follow up have there been any issues
 
06:02:19.150 --> 06:02:19.160 align:start position:0%
with Quorum the meeting any of that sort
 
06:02:20.830 --> 06:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
of usual thing we've heard before on
 
06:02:23.230 --> 06:02:23.240 align:start position:0%
other boards um I can get the number to
 
06:02:24.590 --> 06:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
you off the top of my head I don't think
 
06:02:26.390 --> 06:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
they have a quum issue although I will
 
06:02:28.070 --> 06:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
say they meet quarterly you know and
 
06:02:30.030 --> 06:02:30.040 align:start position:0%
part of the challenges uh just from an
 
06:02:31.468 --> 06:02:31.478 align:start position:0%
operation standpoint again I'm not
 
06:02:34.230 --> 06:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
taking a position is that when boards
 
06:02:36.590 --> 06:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
don't meet regularly
 
06:02:40.830 --> 06:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
um from an administrative standpoint um
 
06:02:42.590 --> 06:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
because they're not doing it as
 
06:02:45.310 --> 06:02:45.320 align:start position:0%
frequently and there are there is a
 
06:02:47.430 --> 06:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
potential need for greater resources
 
06:02:50.948 --> 06:02:50.958 align:start position:0%
more training that sort of thing um it's
 
06:02:53.590 --> 06:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
the same thing for boards that rarely
 
06:02:55.270 --> 06:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
have any disciplinary actions so the
 
06:02:57.310 --> 06:02:57.320 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing for example as a dis
 
06:03:00.230 --> 06:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
plary hearing every meeting they know
 
06:03:01.788 --> 06:03:01.798 align:start position:0%
what to do they know the script they
 
06:03:03.510 --> 06:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
know the dos and the don'ts they know
 
06:03:04.628 --> 06:03:04.638 align:start position:0%
the legal
 
06:03:07.110 --> 06:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
parameters um but if you have a a
 
06:03:11.030 --> 06:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
different board let's say Board of um
 
06:03:13.350 --> 06:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
reflexology they never have those cases
 
06:03:14.310 --> 06:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
you know there would be a little bit
 
06:03:16.670 --> 06:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
more handholding there but that that
 
06:03:18.190 --> 06:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that it can't be done and
 
06:03:19.590 --> 06:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
we're of course happy to support the
 
06:03:21.830 --> 06:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
boards whatever the makeup is based on
 
06:03:25.390 --> 06:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
what the legislative intent is last
 
06:03:27.830 --> 06:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
followup um this relates to how often
 
06:03:29.868 --> 06:03:29.878 align:start position:0%
they they were uh they meet I mean does
 
06:03:31.830 --> 06:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
the board have to meet to approve new
 
06:03:34.230 --> 06:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
applications because that gets into I
 
06:03:35.708 --> 06:03:35.718 align:start position:0%
mean there was some testimony that there
 
06:03:37.230 --> 06:03:37.240 align:start position:0%
might be concerns that it might take
 
06:03:39.350 --> 06:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
longer if they were mer merged with
 
06:03:40.270 --> 06:03:40.280 align:start position:0%
medicine but if they're meeting
 
06:03:41.948 --> 06:03:41.958 align:start position:0%
quarterly I would think it might
 
06:03:43.430 --> 06:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
actually be more timely if they're
 
06:03:46.548 --> 06:03:46.558 align:start position:0%
merged is there anything to that so I
 
06:03:49.110 --> 06:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
think that t that was the case um
 
06:03:51.750 --> 06:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
previously but the this body uh made
 
06:03:54.590 --> 06:03:54.600 align:start position:0%
some changes with 655 in House fille 2
 
06:03:58.270 --> 06:03:58.280 align:start position:0%
and in 409 last year so we are currently
 
06:04:00.510 --> 06:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
reviewing applications so that's that's
 
06:04:03.750 --> 06:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
no longer an issue um I would say there
 
06:04:05.708 --> 06:04:05.718 align:start position:0%
are a lot of concerns regarding scope of
 
06:04:09.230 --> 06:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
practice and I hear those concerns and
 
06:04:11.030 --> 06:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
um I think that's something that this
 
06:04:13.430 --> 06:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
body should very much consider I would
 
06:04:16.110 --> 06:04:16.120 align:start position:0%
say typically the legislature and the
 
06:04:19.310 --> 06:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
statutes govern scope of practice um
 
06:04:21.590 --> 06:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
they don't essentially delegate it to
 
06:04:23.350 --> 06:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
the boards to determine their own scope
 
06:04:26.110 --> 06:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
of practice and our statutory structure
 
06:04:28.868 --> 06:04:28.878 align:start position:0%
is kind of interesting in the sense that
 
06:04:31.708 --> 06:04:31.718 align:start position:0%
um everything is deemed to be you know
 
06:04:33.350 --> 06:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
Healthcare is deemed to be the practice
 
06:04:36.030 --> 06:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
of medicine unless it's carved out and
 
06:04:38.070 --> 06:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
there's an exemption and all of the
 
06:04:39.788 --> 06:04:39.798 align:start position:0%
other practice acts are essentially
 
06:04:42.390 --> 06:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
considered such exemptions and so the
 
06:04:45.030 --> 06:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
people like uh Podiatry have to operate
 
06:04:47.510 --> 06:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
within that framework um medicine is
 
06:04:49.670 --> 06:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
considered the catchall so you might
 
06:04:51.910 --> 06:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
argue that by merging the two there's
 
06:04:54.230 --> 06:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
there's kind of Greater flexibility with
 
06:04:57.110 --> 06:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
respect to that scope legally thank
 
06:05:01.190 --> 06:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:06.230 --> 06:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
grto thank you thank you um director
 
06:05:06.240 --> 06:05:08.270 align:start position:0%
grto thank you thank you um director
Courtney

06:05:08.270 --> 06:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
Courtney
 
06:05:11.468 --> 06:05:11.478 align:start position:0%
um I'm concerned about the board and the
 
06:05:14.230 --> 06:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
board number so right now the Board of
 
06:05:16.830 --> 06:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
Medicine consists of 11 members is that
 
06:05:19.948 --> 06:05:19.958 align:start position:0%
right yes followup and so you want to
 
06:05:22.750 --> 06:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
merge another practice into it and
 
06:05:25.468 --> 06:05:25.478 align:start position:0%
you're reducing the number by
 
06:05:28.830 --> 06:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
four be clear I do not want anything I'm
 
06:05:31.430 --> 06:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
not taking a position I say well someone
 
06:05:34.150 --> 06:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
wrote this okay so whoever wrote this
 
06:05:36.788 --> 06:05:36.798 align:start position:0%
okay what is proposed correct is a
 
06:05:39.948 --> 06:05:39.958 align:start position:0%
reduction of the board yes so to me this
 
06:05:42.270 --> 06:05:42.280 align:start position:0%
is where I have a
 
06:05:46.430 --> 06:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
problem dead so this is I'm just telling
 
06:05:48.830 --> 06:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
people that this is not acceptable if
 
06:05:51.948 --> 06:05:51.958 align:start position:0%
you're if you're adding a practice to a
 
06:05:55.510 --> 06:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
field you don't shrink the number you
 
06:05:57.230 --> 06:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
you make room for them to have a
 
06:05:59.430 --> 06:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
discussion and you don't Lop off the
 
06:06:01.750 --> 06:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
other people because you want this magic
 
06:06:03.390 --> 06:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
number to seven where I don't know where
 
06:06:05.548 --> 06:06:05.558 align:start position:0%
the number came from and if if you if
 
06:06:08.310 --> 06:06:08.320 align:start position:0%
you sense my frustration I apologize I
 
06:06:10.868 --> 06:06:10.878 align:start position:0%
don't mean to give it to you but maybe
 
06:06:13.110 --> 06:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
you know six hours of this or five hours
 
06:06:16.628 --> 06:06:16.638 align:start position:0%
if this is enough for anyone and um I do
 
06:06:19.390 --> 06:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
think that this is this is a big a big
 
06:06:21.270 --> 06:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
issue in this
 
06:06:23.788 --> 06:06:23.798 align:start position:0%
bill I I appreciate that and I don't
 
06:06:25.468 --> 06:06:25.478 align:start position:0%
take your frustration direct at me I
 
06:06:27.150 --> 06:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
what I what I would suggest is that
 
06:06:28.788 --> 06:06:28.798 align:start position:0%
there are two issues there that are
 
06:06:32.030 --> 06:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
presented one is as a policy matter do
 
06:06:34.230 --> 06:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
you want to merge the two and if so what
 
06:06:36.548 --> 06:06:36.558 align:start position:0%
should the composition look like I think
 
06:06:39.190 --> 06:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
the composition was largely driven by
 
06:06:41.510 --> 06:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
again the concerns regarding public
 
06:06:44.310 --> 06:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
members um and being able to retain and
 
06:06:46.548 --> 06:06:46.558 align:start position:0%
attract public members but I think those
 
06:06:48.110 --> 06:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
are two different issues and I think you
 
06:06:49.270 --> 06:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
don't even need to get to the
 
06:06:51.510 --> 06:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
composition question if you decide that
 
06:06:54.990 --> 06:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
you want to keep uh the status
 
06:06:57.868 --> 06:06:57.878 align:start position:0%
quo thank you um
 
06:06:59.548 --> 06:06:59.558 align:start position:0%
I've got one before that uh just as a
 
06:07:01.590 --> 06:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
reminder to the committee members uh
 
06:07:03.990 --> 06:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
that the we're asking questions during
 
06:07:05.590 --> 06:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
public hearings we have an opportunity
 
06:07:08.070 --> 06:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
to debate the topic with ourselves uh at
 
06:07:11.230 --> 06:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
the executive meeting so um make sure
 
06:07:13.110 --> 06:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
that we're keeping it in that Bane um
 
06:07:15.150 --> 06:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
representative manager P thank you Mr
 
06:07:19.230 --> 06:07:19.240 align:start position:0%
chair thank you director Courtney um my
 
06:07:21.670 --> 06:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
concern is I don't know if you can
 
06:07:24.548 --> 06:07:24.558 align:start position:0%
answer but my concern is as the demand
 
06:07:26.948 --> 06:07:26.958 align:start position:0%
is increasing for this profession
 
06:07:30.350 --> 06:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
instead of making it
 
06:07:34.468 --> 06:07:34.478 align:start position:0%
more um how do I put it making it more
 
06:07:36.868 --> 06:07:36.878 align:start position:0%
easy and streamline the process if
 
06:07:39.670 --> 06:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
you're constructing and overloading and
 
06:07:42.110 --> 06:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
putting it together combining it
 
06:07:45.230 --> 06:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
together it defeats the purpose of
 
06:07:48.468 --> 06:07:48.478 align:start position:0%
attracting new Workforce and addressing
 
06:07:53.150 --> 06:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
the increase in the need for that
 
06:07:56.390 --> 06:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
profession so I I don't think that the
 
06:07:58.070 --> 06:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
propos changes are going to have any
 
06:08:00.510 --> 06:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
impact on Workforce whatsoever I think
 
06:08:02.788 --> 06:08:02.798 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's purely how the state
 
06:08:07.590 --> 06:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
wants to govern um or facilitate
 
06:08:09.830 --> 06:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
regulatory uh oversight of these
 
06:08:12.190 --> 06:08:12.200 align:start position:0%
particular professions one thing to keep
 
06:08:14.190 --> 06:08:14.200 align:start position:0%
in mind is that you know uh the
 
06:08:16.390 --> 06:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
legislature made some big changes last
 
06:08:18.750 --> 06:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
year in the sense that it allowed the
 
06:08:21.030 --> 06:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
office to license applicants in between
 
06:08:22.468 --> 06:08:22.478 align:start position:0%
meetings now the Board of Medicine had
 
06:08:24.990 --> 06:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
already been doing that um I don't think
 
06:08:27.670 --> 06:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
Podiatry had been doing that although I
 
06:08:30.310 --> 06:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
I could stand corrected on that but and
 
06:08:33.708 --> 06:08:33.718 align:start position:0%
so really the purpose of the board is to
 
06:08:35.468 --> 06:08:35.478 align:start position:0%
promote and facilitate
 
06:08:38.868 --> 06:08:38.878 align:start position:0%
regulation um and regulation is really
 
06:08:42.190 --> 06:08:42.200 align:start position:0%
just just that it's um how do I get a
 
06:08:45.628 --> 06:08:45.638 align:start position:0%
license it's ethical requirements how do
 
06:08:48.670 --> 06:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
I maintain my license how do I maintain
 
06:08:51.510 --> 06:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
competency and then if something happens
 
06:08:54.788 --> 06:08:54.798 align:start position:0%
what does that look like so access to
 
06:08:56.830 --> 06:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
care issues are certainly important and
 
06:08:59.310 --> 06:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
impacted by lure but it's not at the
 
06:09:02.270 --> 06:09:02.280 align:start position:0%
center of what what what is the issue
 
06:09:04.270 --> 06:09:04.280 align:start position:0%
with respect to our regulations
 
06:09:06.468 --> 06:09:06.478 align:start position:0%
certainly if you put too many burdens in
 
06:09:07.910 --> 06:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
getting a license that could impact
 
06:09:10.030 --> 06:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
access to healthcare but I don't think
 
06:09:13.350 --> 06:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
that that is an issue that's that's um
 
06:09:16.990 --> 06:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:19.670 --> 06:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
changes representative
 
06:09:22.030 --> 06:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
gold Mr chair and thank you for taking
 
06:09:22.040 --> 06:09:22.948 align:start position:0%
gold Mr chair and thank you for taking
my

06:09:22.948 --> 06:09:22.958 align:start position:0%
my
 
06:09:25.430 --> 06:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
question so this gets back to what I
 
06:09:27.030 --> 06:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
asked you earlier and I'm still trying
 
06:09:31.270 --> 06:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
to get my head around um the number of
 
06:09:33.788 --> 06:09:33.798 align:start position:0%
people on the board and and who makes
 
06:09:36.070 --> 06:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
the appointments to the board and how
 
06:09:39.190 --> 06:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
much like can the statue say we're going
 
06:09:40.948 --> 06:09:40.958 align:start position:0%
to be taking this to committee so I'm
 
06:09:43.510 --> 06:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
trying to get from you now what we could
 
06:09:47.788 --> 06:09:47.798 align:start position:0%
look at in committee so um like a range
 
06:09:53.110 --> 06:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
of s to 11 or something
 
06:09:56.830 --> 06:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
like can we look at a range and do you
 
06:10:00.070 --> 06:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
as or does the director does opl appoint
 
06:10:01.868 --> 06:10:01.878 align:start position:0%
the the people on the
 
06:10:05.150 --> 06:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
board um or is it the governor's office
 
06:10:08.030 --> 06:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
so most boards in these boards are uh
 
06:10:11.510 --> 06:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
Governor nominated and GNC appointed uh
 
06:10:13.110 --> 06:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
The Advisory boards have historically
 
06:10:14.670 --> 06:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
been appointed by the director I'm not
 
06:10:18.110 --> 06:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
sure why that is I think um originally
 
06:10:19.590 --> 06:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
several of our advisory boards were
 
06:10:20.830 --> 06:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
attached to the Department of Health and
 
06:10:22.670 --> 06:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
Human Services and it was always like
 
06:10:26.590 --> 06:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
that so um that's just how it is that
 
06:10:27.430 --> 06:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
certainly you can make some
 
06:10:30.030 --> 06:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
modifications there um I'd have to
 
06:10:32.590 --> 06:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
consider that because uh board members
 
06:10:35.670 --> 06:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
are public officials and in order for us
 
06:10:37.628 --> 06:10:37.638 align:start position:0%
to understand what a quorum is there
 
06:10:39.788 --> 06:10:39.798 align:start position:0%
needs to be a certain number and
 
06:10:43.030 --> 06:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
together they comprise a public body um
 
06:10:44.510 --> 06:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
so I'll give some thought to that prior
 
06:10:46.670 --> 06:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
to the next uh to the subcommittee
 
06:10:48.750 --> 06:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
meeting but I would say you probably
 
06:10:50.868 --> 06:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
need need to set forth in statute how
 
06:10:53.750 --> 06:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
many people serve on that board follow
 
06:10:56.670 --> 06:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
up and so just to be clear I'm not
 
06:10:59.390 --> 06:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
suggesting that it flipflop around
 
06:11:01.628 --> 06:11:01.638 align:start position:0%
certainly all the time I'm suggesting if
 
06:11:04.788 --> 06:11:04.798 align:start position:0%
the statute gives the appointer some
 
06:11:06.868 --> 06:11:06.878 align:start position:0%
flexibility for the board to be able to
 
06:11:09.548 --> 06:11:09.558 align:start position:0%
say we're finding that this number is
 
06:11:12.670 --> 06:11:12.680 align:start position:0%
too little let's increase it to you know
 
06:11:15.030 --> 06:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
so it's just giving Authority within a
 
06:11:18.788 --> 06:11:18.798 align:start position:0%
preset margin for for policy or
 
06:11:21.590 --> 06:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
procedure to set that that's the nature
 
06:11:23.468 --> 06:11:23.478 align:start position:0%
of my question does that make sense yes
 
06:11:24.708 --> 06:11:24.718 align:start position:0%
and I'll give that some thought and
 
06:11:27.468 --> 06:11:27.478 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll look at it legally and come
 
06:11:30.070 --> 06:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
come back to the subcommittee on
 
06:11:32.110 --> 06:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
that any further
 
06:11:34.110 --> 06:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your time thank
 
06:11:34.120 --> 06:11:34.948 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your time thank

06:11:45.150 --> 06:11:45.160 align:start position:0%
1285 just uh when you're done if you
 
06:11:47.708 --> 06:11:47.718 align:start position:0%
could fill out a pink card and send it
 
06:11:49.910 --> 06:11:49.920 align:start position:0%

just state your name for the committee
 
06:12:05.990 --> 06:12:06.000 align:start position:0%

okay thank you uh my name is Dr Natasha
 
06:12:19.150 --> 06:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
bazasi I'm a practicing podiatrist out
 
06:12:21.390 --> 06:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
of Portsmouth I've been in the state for
 
06:12:24.390 --> 06:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh about 12 years now um I'm not going
 
06:12:26.110 --> 06:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
to rehash everything that everyone else
 
06:12:27.788 --> 06:12:27.798 align:start position:0%
has already said um but I just want to
 
06:12:29.510 --> 06:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
touch on a couple things that I don't
 
06:12:32.548 --> 06:12:32.558 align:start position:0%
think were mentioned um I do appreciate
 
06:12:35.430 --> 06:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
your concern with one Podiatry member if
 
06:12:37.190 --> 06:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
the boards were merged I do not think
 
06:12:40.868 --> 06:12:40.878 align:start position:0%
that is a big enough voice um but we
 
06:12:42.590 --> 06:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
have a unique degree we have three
 
06:12:43.990 --> 06:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
different letters after our name that
 
06:12:46.430 --> 06:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
aren't MD and do our training is unique
 
06:12:49.670 --> 06:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
to us just like a dentist a chiropractor
 
06:12:51.548 --> 06:12:51.558 align:start position:0%
and an optometry all of which New
 
06:12:53.390 --> 06:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has their own
 
06:12:55.910 --> 06:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
boards if you're thinking about board
 
06:12:57.628 --> 06:12:57.638 align:start position:0%
merging the board of Podiatry and
 
06:12:59.670 --> 06:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
Medicine why not throw every Medical
 
06:13:01.670 --> 06:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
Board under it we are
 
06:13:04.468 --> 06:13:04.478 align:start position:0%
unique just like those other Specialties
 
06:13:07.430 --> 06:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
and we deserve to be heard and judged
 
06:13:11.150 --> 06:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
licensed by our peers not someone with a
 
06:13:13.548 --> 06:13:13.558 align:start position:0%
different training path than what we
 
06:13:15.910 --> 06:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
have had and I don't think that's been
 
06:13:20.628 --> 06:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
made overly clear um I oppose this bill
 
06:13:22.548 --> 06:13:22.558 align:start position:0%
and I would I appreciate you taking the
 
06:13:24.150 --> 06:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
time to hear me thank you thank you for

Maguire marac District
 
06:14:48.830 --> 06:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
27 I'm introducing House Bill
 
06:14:51.670 --> 06:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
1286 which is another item that was
 
06:14:54.070 --> 06:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
pulled from House Bill
 
06:14:57.430 --> 06:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
2 and it would merge the board of land
 
06:15:00.830 --> 06:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
surveyors with the Board of Professional
 
06:15:00.840 --> 06:15:03.150 align:start position:0%
surveyors with the Board of Professional
Engineers

06:15:03.150 --> 06:15:03.160 align:start position:0%
Engineers
 
06:15:05.868 --> 06:15:05.878 align:start position:0%
uh I'll say the same things that I could
 
06:15:09.190 --> 06:15:09.200 align:start position:0%
say about the previous Bill the only
 
06:15:12.070 --> 06:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
other valid point is that the board of
 
06:15:15.190 --> 06:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
land surveyors and the of the land
 
06:15:18.468 --> 06:15:18.478 align:start position:0%
surveyors and the Professional Engineers
 
06:15:20.350 --> 06:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
are actually members of the same
 
06:15:23.110 --> 06:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
Professional Organization that runs
 
06:15:26.190 --> 06:15:26.200 align:start position:0%
their qualification tests which I was
 
06:15:29.628 --> 06:15:29.638 align:start position:0%
surprised to see and they work they uh
 
06:15:34.110 --> 06:15:34.120 align:start position:0%
work together frequently and
 
06:15:36.948 --> 06:15:36.958 align:start position:0%

06:15:48.750 --> 06:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
Joseph uh no you're good sorry I cannot
 
06:15:51.590 --> 06:15:51.600 align:start position:0%

06:15:51.600 --> 06:15:55.110 align:start position:0%
read the last name Joseph Wick wicker
thank

06:15:55.110 --> 06:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:55.120 --> 06:16:00.990 align:start position:0%
 
you

06:16:00.990 --> 06:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:03.230 --> 06:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
so H good afternoon um my name is Joe
 
06:16:06.270 --> 06:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
wicker I'm a licensed land surveyor I
 
06:16:08.628 --> 06:16:08.638 align:start position:0%
have uh been self-employed for about 35
 
06:16:11.430 --> 06:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
years and I run a small uh five person
 
06:16:14.430 --> 06:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
firm out of Manchester I'm currently the
 
06:16:16.910 --> 06:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
chair of the board of lure for land
 
06:16:19.670 --> 06:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
surveyors uh and I've been on the board
 
06:16:19.680 --> 06:16:20.868 align:start position:0%
surveyors uh and I've been on the board
since

06:16:20.868 --> 06:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
since
 
06:16:23.830 --> 06:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
2015 I'm also I've been a three-year
 
06:16:27.350 --> 06:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
member of the um professional surveyors
 
06:16:30.190 --> 06:16:30.200 align:start position:0%
exam committee for the National Council
 
06:16:32.510 --> 06:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
of examiners for engineers and surveyors
 
06:16:32.520 --> 06:16:33.868 align:start position:0%
of examiners for engineers and surveyors
or

06:16:33.868 --> 06:16:33.878 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:16:36.868 --> 06:16:36.878 align:start position:0%
NCS uh I termed off that in 23 and I'm
 
06:16:39.468 --> 06:16:39.478 align:start position:0%
currently a member of the surveying and
 
06:16:42.830 --> 06:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
mapping Sciences task force for uh NCW
 
06:16:47.190 --> 06:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
so on behalf of um our board myself and
 
06:16:49.190 --> 06:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
our and the board are opposed to uh
 
06:16:51.868 --> 06:16:51.878 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1286 which proposes to merge
 
06:16:54.190 --> 06:16:54.200 align:start position:0%
our board and with the board of
 
06:16:57.910 --> 06:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
Engineers so uh representative Maguire
 
06:17:00.430 --> 06:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
had mentioned we're part of the same
 
06:17:03.310 --> 06:17:03.320 align:start position:0%
National Organization which is what NCS
 
06:17:04.590 --> 06:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
is so
 
06:17:08.708 --> 06:17:08.718 align:start position:0%
NCS um they oversee and prepare the
 
06:17:15.430 --> 06:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
national exams and um you know uh we we
 
06:17:17.310 --> 06:17:17.320 align:start position:0%
we kind of work through their
 
06:17:20.150 --> 06:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
organization to help us uh run our state
 
06:17:22.948 --> 06:17:22.958 align:start position:0%
Ser our state exam programs but even
 
06:17:25.270 --> 06:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
they treat every we're similar but we're
 
06:17:27.788 --> 06:17:27.798 align:start position:0%
different so the the associations and
 
06:17:30.628 --> 06:17:30.638 align:start position:0%
the issues are we're an Associated
 
06:17:32.750 --> 06:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
profession but we're not Engineers
 
06:17:35.868 --> 06:17:35.878 align:start position:0%
they're not surveyors and um our
 
06:17:37.868 --> 06:17:37.878 align:start position:0%
concerns our items our discipline
 
06:17:39.190 --> 06:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
they're all different because they have
 
06:17:42.110 --> 06:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
different items so I you know this came
 
06:17:43.990 --> 06:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
up last year and we heard different
 
06:17:46.030 --> 06:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
reasons why the bill was popping up one
 
06:17:48.548 --> 06:17:48.558 align:start position:0%
of them was uh licensing boards were an
 
06:17:50.270 --> 06:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
obstacle to people wanting to work in
 
06:17:52.468 --> 06:17:52.478 align:start position:0%
the State uh because of Market issues
 
06:17:55.708 --> 06:17:55.718 align:start position:0%
right people on the board would try to
 
06:17:58.070 --> 06:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
um obstruct people from uh from getting
 
06:18:00.868 --> 06:18:00.878 align:start position:0%
a license for competition reasons so
 
06:18:02.750 --> 06:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
most of us in our Fields have
 
06:18:04.990 --> 06:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
significant backlogs the majority of us
 
06:18:06.670 --> 06:18:06.680 align:start position:0%
are turning work away because we don't
 
06:18:09.788 --> 06:18:09.798 align:start position:0%
have the staff to do that work
 
06:18:12.788 --> 06:18:12.798 align:start position:0%
um so I don't really understand that
 
06:18:15.070 --> 06:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
thought process uh if we had more
 
06:18:16.670 --> 06:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
employees that were licensed we could
 
06:18:19.670 --> 06:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
take on more work right both boards and
 
06:18:21.590 --> 06:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
certainly our board tries to ensure that
 
06:18:23.590 --> 06:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
applicants and the uh people in the
 
06:18:25.910 --> 06:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
profession adhere to the approved rules
 
06:18:27.948 --> 06:18:27.958 align:start position:0%
our rules have existed for many years I
 
06:18:29.030 --> 06:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
don't think there have been any
 
06:18:31.430 --> 06:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
significant changes in the last 15 or 20
 
06:18:33.990 --> 06:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
years so I really don't understand this
 
06:18:38.310 --> 06:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
sudden uh push to to merge boards um and
 
06:18:40.670 --> 06:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
and sort of change what we have right
 
06:18:42.548 --> 06:18:42.558 align:start position:0%
the board members all of us who serve
 
06:18:45.150 --> 06:18:45.160 align:start position:0%
were volunteers many of us have have
 
06:18:47.350 --> 06:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
mentored multiple people on their path
 
06:18:49.910 --> 06:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
to lure help to set up their careers
 
06:18:51.430 --> 06:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
just like was done to us and we're
 
06:18:53.990 --> 06:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
trying to pay it forward I've also heard
 
06:18:57.030 --> 06:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
that the boards are too slow and that uh
 
06:18:59.190 --> 06:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
without the without the boards that
 
06:19:02.150 --> 06:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
things could be handled by uh staff and
 
06:19:03.670 --> 06:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
could be done more efficiently and
 
06:19:06.590 --> 06:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
faster which would be uh better for the
 
06:19:09.230 --> 06:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
public so in our case we meet four to
 
06:19:11.628 --> 06:19:11.638 align:start position:0%
six times a year but we're we're very
 
06:19:13.948 --> 06:19:13.958 align:start position:0%
aware of our our time deadline so if we
 
06:19:16.830 --> 06:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
have a case that needs a 30-day response
 
06:19:18.468 --> 06:19:18.478 align:start position:0%
or whatever our next meeting would get
 
06:19:20.670 --> 06:19:20.680 align:start position:0%
scheduled such that we comply with that
 
06:19:23.708 --> 06:19:23.718 align:start position:0%
response um you
 
06:19:26.110 --> 06:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
know last year I believe there there was
 
06:19:28.750 --> 06:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
a bill passed that puts the Authority
 
06:19:31.590 --> 06:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
for licensing and discipline into oplc
 
06:19:34.390 --> 06:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
hands and you know we're we're working
 
06:19:37.708 --> 06:19:37.718 align:start position:0%
through that but there is a value to the
 
06:19:39.750 --> 06:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
boards the boards are the ones that have
 
06:19:42.110 --> 06:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
the experience and can oversee an
 
06:19:44.750 --> 06:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
applicants uh application packet and
 
06:19:47.350 --> 06:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that the what it qualifies for
 
06:19:49.150 --> 06:19:49.160 align:start position:0%
surveying we have no education
 
06:19:51.468 --> 06:19:51.478 align:start position:0%
requirement right education was deemed
 
06:19:54.788 --> 06:19:54.798 align:start position:0%
as an obstacle to licensure so therefore
 
06:19:56.830 --> 06:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
we have a path of experience it has to
 
06:19:58.948 --> 06:19:58.958 align:start position:0%
be Progressive experience for six years
 
06:20:00.590 --> 06:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
and you have to be able to maintain and
 
06:20:03.750 --> 06:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
show that you move forward somebody that
 
06:20:05.430 --> 06:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't know the profession isn't going
 
06:20:07.310 --> 06:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
to be able to look at a resume and say
 
06:20:09.628 --> 06:20:09.638 align:start position:0%
12 years here at this position is
 
06:20:12.830 --> 06:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
considered responsible charge versus not
 
06:20:14.830 --> 06:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
right if you're in a larger State such
 
06:20:17.430 --> 06:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
as California they actually have
 
06:20:19.150 --> 06:20:19.160 align:start position:0%
Professional Engineers and licensed
 
06:20:21.350 --> 06:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
surveyors on their as the administrators
 
06:20:23.948 --> 06:20:23.958 align:start position:0%
of their boards we don't unfortunately
 
06:20:25.310 --> 06:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
or fortunately however you want to look
 
06:20:27.230 --> 06:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
at it we don't have the population to
 
06:20:29.948 --> 06:20:29.958 align:start position:0%
justify that but that's one of the
 
06:20:31.750 --> 06:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
reasons why I believe the subject matter
 
06:20:33.910 --> 06:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
experts have an important role and I
 
06:20:36.590 --> 06:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
believe this bill would weaken that role
 
06:20:39.270 --> 06:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
we also had heard last year that um
 
06:20:41.788 --> 06:20:41.798 align:start position:0%
there were complaints about the boards
 
06:20:43.390 --> 06:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
and the boards were unreasonable I've
 
06:20:44.910 --> 06:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
been a member of our board for
 
06:20:46.750 --> 06:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
approximately eight and a half years I
 
06:20:48.670 --> 06:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
think in that time I'm aware of one
 
06:20:51.230 --> 06:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
complaint it was an email to A A
 
06:20:53.110 --> 06:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
legislator that said uh from an
 
06:20:54.948 --> 06:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
applicant who had failed the state exam
 
06:20:57.750 --> 06:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
twice who felt that the state exam was
 
06:21:01.548 --> 06:21:01.558 align:start position:0%
intentionally too difficult um but what
 
06:21:03.830 --> 06:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
it fails to mention is our pass rate is
 
06:21:06.750 --> 06:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
probably been stable for six or seven
 
06:21:10.750 --> 06:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
years at least and there have been a
 
06:21:12.510 --> 06:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
many other applicants that have taken
 
06:21:14.548 --> 06:21:14.558 align:start position:0%
the exam and pass so it certainly wasn't
 
06:21:16.670 --> 06:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
a one-off and that other than that
 
06:21:19.430 --> 06:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
that's the only complaint I'm aware of
 
06:21:21.270 --> 06:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
another item I think we heard was The
 
06:21:23.270 --> 06:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
Proposal is consistent with the majority
 
06:21:24.430 --> 06:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
of the other
 
06:21:27.948 --> 06:21:27.958 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions um in through NCW or in
 
06:21:31.708 --> 06:21:31.718 align:start position:0%
Nationwide so I believe uh the
 
06:21:34.830 --> 06:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
representative for NCW will be Prov uh
 
06:21:36.510 --> 06:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
providing written testimony and it'll
 
06:21:39.510 --> 06:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
give a breakdown of the various boards
 
06:21:42.948 --> 06:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
so 39% of their boards I think there's
 
06:21:47.708 --> 06:21:47.718 align:start position:0%
69 boards total are joint boards 36% are
 
06:21:50.310 --> 06:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
separate Boards out of that 36% there's
 
06:21:51.948 --> 06:21:51.958 align:start position:0%
17 and a half that are separate
 
06:21:54.030 --> 06:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
engineers and 18 and a half separate
 
06:21:56.310 --> 06:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
surveys and approx
 
06:21:58.788 --> 06:21:58.798 align:start position:0%
25% uh include boards that are
 
06:22:00.868 --> 06:22:00.878 align:start position:0%
constituted of surveyors Engineers
 
06:22:02.990 --> 06:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
Architects and others right so there's
 
06:22:06.110 --> 06:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
not one thread that's all that covers
 
06:22:08.750 --> 06:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
everything but in addition you know what
 
06:22:10.750 --> 06:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
what I think that those numbers don't
 
06:22:13.548 --> 06:22:13.558 align:start position:0%
show is once constituted generally they
 
06:22:15.430 --> 06:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
don't change so usually if you're stood
 
06:22:17.350 --> 06:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
up as a joint board you stay as a joint
 
06:22:19.868 --> 06:22:19.878 align:start position:0%
board if you're stood up as a individual
 
06:22:22.030 --> 06:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
board you stay as an individual board
 
06:22:24.670 --> 06:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of back and forth I
 
06:22:27.270 --> 06:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
think the last one I can recall that um
 
06:22:30.350 --> 06:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
I think Texas about two three years ago
 
06:22:32.150 --> 06:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
eliminated all their boards and then
 
06:22:34.948 --> 06:22:34.958 align:start position:0%
stood up a joint board a year later and
 
06:22:36.270 --> 06:22:36.280 align:start position:0%
depending on who you speak to the
 
06:22:38.270 --> 06:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
results of that are mixed good bad it
 
06:22:40.110 --> 06:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
all depends on perspective but I haven't
 
06:22:43.310 --> 06:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
heard an overwhelming response say that
 
06:22:45.670 --> 06:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's the perfect thing to do from a
 
06:22:47.830 --> 06:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
national level as we sit New Hampshire
 
06:22:50.548 --> 06:22:50.558 align:start position:0%
has two Vats out of a possible 69 if the
 
06:22:54.150 --> 06:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
boards emerg that impact gets reduced to
 
06:22:56.110 --> 06:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
one out of 68
 
06:22:58.270 --> 06:22:58.280 align:start position:0%
so what I would say is respectfully that
 
06:23:00.468 --> 06:23:00.478 align:start position:0%
I don't see any benefit to merg in these
 
06:23:02.590 --> 06:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
these boards The public's not going to
 
06:23:03.868 --> 06:23:03.878 align:start position:0%
see any difference they're going to have
 
06:23:05.788 --> 06:23:05.798 align:start position:0%
to go through the same process so
 
06:23:07.910 --> 06:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
nothing changes for them for the
 
06:23:09.628 --> 06:23:09.638 align:start position:0%
volunteer board members we're going to
 
06:23:11.948 --> 06:23:11.958 align:start position:0%
have more meetings and longer meetings
 
06:23:14.230 --> 06:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
in our case you know we meet four to six
 
06:23:16.590 --> 06:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
times a year the engineers would meet
 
06:23:18.270 --> 06:23:18.280 align:start position:0%
monthly so we're probably going to go to
 
06:23:20.230 --> 06:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
a monthly schedule you're going to take
 
06:23:21.948 --> 06:23:21.958 align:start position:0%
what was done in two meetings put it
 
06:23:24.430 --> 06:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
into one meeting so the number of hours
 
06:23:26.868 --> 06:23:26.878 align:start position:0%
of that meeting are going to go longer
 
06:23:29.150 --> 06:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
right we're all volunteers you're all
 
06:23:31.270 --> 06:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to do is is make it harder
 
06:23:33.750 --> 06:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
to get good volunteers to become a board
 
06:23:36.590 --> 06:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
member which I don't think should be the
 
06:23:39.708 --> 06:23:39.718 align:start position:0%
goal of legislation right and then you
 
06:23:42.510 --> 06:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
know the other thing is in our case we
 
06:23:45.110 --> 06:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
because we offer a state specific survey
 
06:23:48.430 --> 06:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
exam twice a year our members go through
 
06:23:50.150 --> 06:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
and grade the exam so we have four
 
06:23:52.310 --> 06:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
people grading the exams that would be
 
06:23:54.270 --> 06:23:54.280 align:start position:0%
reduced depending on how the new board
 
06:23:57.150 --> 06:23:57.160 align:start position:0%
or the merge board would be constituted
 
06:23:59.230 --> 06:23:59.240 align:start position:0%
but you'd have less right one of the
 
06:24:01.510 --> 06:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
proposals last year was two Engineers
 
06:24:03.590 --> 06:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
two public uh two Engineers two
 
06:24:06.070 --> 06:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
surveyors one public so now you're going
 
06:24:08.070 --> 06:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
to have two surveyors grading all the
 
06:24:09.750 --> 06:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
exams because the engineers aren't going
 
06:24:12.230 --> 06:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
to necessarily be able to do that and in
 
06:24:13.708 --> 06:24:13.718 align:start position:0%
addition you're going to have those same
 
06:24:16.390 --> 06:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
two two members are going to now have to
 
06:24:18.670 --> 06:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
make the decision about an applicant's
 
06:24:21.230 --> 06:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
experience or discipline or whatever and
 
06:24:24.350 --> 06:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
the way uh should there be a discipline
 
06:24:26.190 --> 06:24:26.200 align:start position:0%
investigation one of the things we
 
06:24:28.350 --> 06:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
normally do is one member recuses
 
06:24:29.788 --> 06:24:29.798 align:start position:0%
themselves and then the other members
 
06:24:31.670 --> 06:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
kind of go through it and look at the
 
06:24:34.110 --> 06:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
results of the investigation and help
 
06:24:35.990 --> 06:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
weigh in on that so if we only have two
 
06:24:38.510 --> 06:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
members one member recuses himself we're
 
06:24:40.510 --> 06:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
you have one member basically making the
 
06:24:43.030 --> 06:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
decision I think having the larger
 
06:24:47.468 --> 06:24:47.478 align:start position:0%
talent pool is going to be better for uh
 
06:24:49.150 --> 06:24:49.160 align:start position:0%
both the applicants and the public the
 
06:24:51.628 --> 06:24:51.638 align:start position:0%
decision would be better you know there
 
06:24:54.270 --> 06:24:54.280 align:start position:0%
could be some minor savings
 
06:24:57.030 --> 06:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
on from the staff point of view because
 
06:24:58.230 --> 06:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to cover a few
 
06:25:00.350 --> 06:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
less meetings but like I mentioned
 
06:25:01.830 --> 06:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
previously the meetings are going to be
 
06:25:04.150 --> 06:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
longer so I don't know if there's any
 
06:25:06.390 --> 06:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
significant change in that right most of
 
06:25:08.390 --> 06:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
the renewals and things we do anymore
 
06:25:11.070 --> 06:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
are done online I don't think that gets
 
06:25:15.788 --> 06:25:15.798 align:start position:0%
changed at all you know and even if even
 
06:25:17.628 --> 06:25:17.638 align:start position:0%
if there was a small increase by
 
06:25:19.670 --> 06:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
maintaining what we currently have so I
 
06:25:20.990 --> 06:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
I have a hard time saying it's an
 
06:25:23.310 --> 06:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
increase but I guess we could argue it's
 
06:25:26.590 --> 06:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
it's not a savings right you know I know
 
06:25:29.030 --> 06:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
for our you know for our profession the
 
06:25:30.868 --> 06:25:30.878 align:start position:0%
certificate of authorization which is
 
06:25:32.910 --> 06:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
the fee we pay annually to for the
 
06:25:35.270 --> 06:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
privilege of practicing in the state you
 
06:25:37.910 --> 06:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
know increased and I think those you
 
06:25:39.548 --> 06:25:39.558 align:start position:0%
know that that increased fee would
 
06:25:39.558 --> 06:25:40.628 align:start position:0%
know that that increased fee would
certainly

06:25:40.628 --> 06:25:40.638 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
06:25:43.788 --> 06:25:43.798 align:start position:0%
cover the cost of maintaining this uh
 
06:25:47.230 --> 06:25:47.240 align:start position:0%
the services that we currently have
 
06:25:50.230 --> 06:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
um you know I have not heard from anyone
 
06:25:53.150 --> 06:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
in our professions that says that they
 
06:25:54.750 --> 06:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
think this is a good idea so I think
 
06:25:58.548 --> 06:25:58.558 align:start position:0%
this is a you know it was a a proposal
 
06:26:00.708 --> 06:26:00.718 align:start position:0%
that probably was well intended but I
 
06:26:01.990 --> 06:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
don't know if there was a lot of
 
06:26:03.788 --> 06:26:03.798 align:start position:0%
discussion with the people in the
 
06:26:05.990 --> 06:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
profession to do it you know if the
 
06:26:07.548 --> 06:26:07.558 align:start position:0%
intent of this is to improve the
 
06:26:09.190 --> 06:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
business climate in the state and reduce
 
06:26:12.030 --> 06:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
the obstacle to lure I don't think this
 
06:26:13.548 --> 06:26:13.558 align:start position:0%
is the answer you know New Hampshire has
 
06:26:16.708 --> 06:26:16.718 align:start position:0%
a 400 person legislature because people
 
06:26:18.548 --> 06:26:18.558 align:start position:0%
would have the ability to know their
 
06:26:20.070 --> 06:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative and talk to them it's the
 
06:26:21.708 --> 06:26:21.718 align:start position:0%
same thing with the board if I go to a
 
06:26:24.190 --> 06:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
meeting or conference we're constantly
 
06:26:25.750 --> 06:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
pulled aside and if if it's not a
 
06:26:27.430 --> 06:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
confidential issue somebody will say
 
06:26:29.590 --> 06:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
why'd you do this why how and things
 
06:26:32.190 --> 06:26:32.200 align:start position:0%
like that merging these boards is going
 
06:26:33.868 --> 06:26:33.878 align:start position:0%
to reduce that
 
06:26:37.548 --> 06:26:37.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity um you know and we do you
 
06:26:40.510 --> 06:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
know we shag calls from the public we
 
06:26:42.468 --> 06:26:42.478 align:start position:0%
I've had in the last four or five months
 
06:26:44.310 --> 06:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
we've had calls
 
06:26:46.990 --> 06:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
regarding uh an inability renew a
 
06:26:49.590 --> 06:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
license under retired status lack of
 
06:26:52.468 --> 06:26:52.478 align:start position:0%
response from being CED the mandatory CE
 
06:26:55.628 --> 06:26:55.638 align:start position:0%
broker program cost to get a certificate
 
06:26:57.750 --> 06:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
um printed that used to be provided for
 
06:27:00.110 --> 06:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
free right the boards aren't really
 
06:27:02.628 --> 06:27:02.638 align:start position:0%
going to have input or can solve those
 
06:27:04.788 --> 06:27:04.798 align:start position:0%
problems but at least we can we can
 
06:27:06.350 --> 06:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
speak to the members in a way that
 
06:27:07.910 --> 06:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to understand and say hey
 
06:27:09.628 --> 06:27:09.638 align:start position:0%
this is what's going on you have to do
 
06:27:10.990 --> 06:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
this this and that and I do believe
 
06:27:16.070 --> 06:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
there's a value to that um you know I do
 
06:27:20.190 --> 06:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
think that you know prior to this last
 
06:27:23.390 --> 06:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
year or so we had um our board
 
06:27:26.628 --> 06:27:26.638 align:start position:0%
administrators were had longtime tenure
 
06:27:28.590 --> 06:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
in the board they had good institutional
 
06:27:31.110 --> 06:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
knowledge and that's getting harder to
 
06:27:32.830 --> 06:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
to have I mean currently I think we're
 
06:27:36.150 --> 06:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
on our third or fourth administrator in
 
06:27:39.468 --> 06:27:39.478 align:start position:0%
last six uh last six or eight months so
 
06:27:41.110 --> 06:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
now we're talking the institutional
 
06:27:42.510 --> 06:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge is coming from the board
 
06:27:45.708 --> 06:27:45.718 align:start position:0%
members as opposed to staff um and so my
 
06:27:48.390 --> 06:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
closing words be fairly simple you know
 
06:27:49.708 --> 06:27:49.718 align:start position:0%
if it's not broke I don't think you
 
06:27:52.750 --> 06:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
should fix it and I'm not really sure
 
06:27:54.750 --> 06:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
that this is broke so thank you for your
 
06:27:54.760 --> 06:27:56.468 align:start position:0%
that this is broke so thank you for your
time

06:27:56.468 --> 06:27:56.478 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:27:57.708 --> 06:27:57.718 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
06:27:57.718 --> 06:28:02.660 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
any

06:28:02.660 --> 06:28:02.670 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:02.670 --> 06:28:04.430 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

06:28:04.430 --> 06:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
06:28:07.830 --> 06:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank well done thank you so
 
06:28:20.190 --> 06:28:20.200 align:start position:0%

exam uh subcommittee where we um spent
 
06:29:06.350 --> 06:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
countless hours um going through our
 
06:29:10.628 --> 06:29:10.638 align:start position:0%
database um in um verifying each and
 
06:29:13.270 --> 06:29:13.280 align:start position:0%

06:29:27.548 --> 06:29:27.558 align:start position:0%
the state of the board they don't have
 
06:29:32.868 --> 06:29:32.878 align:start position:0%
much to uh to sue um reasons to sue
 
06:29:37.750 --> 06:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
um we've also taken our statutory um
 
06:29:41.468 --> 06:29:41.478 align:start position:0%
guidance where the exam has been
 
06:29:44.270 --> 06:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
revamped to test for what we feel is
 
06:29:44.280 --> 06:29:45.310 align:start position:0%
revamped to test for what we feel is
minimum

06:29:45.310 --> 06:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
06:29:48.708 --> 06:29:48.718 align:start position:0%
competency um all of the Master Level
 
06:29:50.948 --> 06:29:50.958 align:start position:0%
questions that were on the exam the
 
06:29:53.510 --> 06:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
gotcha questions are gone those were not
 
06:29:55.628 --> 06:29:55.638 align:start position:0%
fair um
 
06:29:57.708 --> 06:29:57.718 align:start position:0%
I had a few of those when I took my uh
 
06:29:59.510 --> 06:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
exam back in
 
06:30:03.510 --> 06:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
87 um they're again they're gone we're
 
06:30:07.070 --> 06:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
trying to test for entrylevel minimum
 
06:30:09.150 --> 06:30:09.160 align:start position:0%
competency and most of my fellow
 
06:30:11.750 --> 06:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
surveyors that have H staff that just
 
06:30:14.548 --> 06:30:14.558 align:start position:0%
received their licenses they don't let
 
06:30:19.190 --> 06:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
that new um LS stamp plans for a year
 
06:30:21.150 --> 06:30:21.160 align:start position:0%
because they're still green they've
 
06:30:22.750 --> 06:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
passed their exam that doesn't mean
 
06:30:26.270 --> 06:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
they're uh they're in that position to
 
06:30:31.750 --> 06:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh be on their own yet um and very
 
06:30:34.990 --> 06:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
important point is that if we have a
 
06:30:37.990 --> 06:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
joint board with two members engineering
 
06:30:39.350 --> 06:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
two members of
 
06:30:44.190 --> 06:30:44.200 align:start position:0%
surveyors um we've lost that internal
 
06:30:49.230 --> 06:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
database of knowledge for local state um
 
06:30:51.990 --> 06:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
boundary law that's what we regulate and
 
06:30:54.270 --> 06:30:54.280 align:start position:0%
that's very important if any of you have
 
06:30:56.230 --> 06:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
ever built a house you want to know
 
06:30:57.910 --> 06:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
where your setback lines are and where
 
06:31:00.070 --> 06:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
can you put your million dollar house
 
06:31:02.270 --> 06:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
and all of your life savings into you
 
06:31:04.110 --> 06:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
want to hire a licensed Lancer bear you
 
06:31:06.350 --> 06:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
don't want them uh just someone off the
 
06:31:09.670 --> 06:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
street that's not um that's not licensed
 
06:31:13.708 --> 06:31:13.718 align:start position:0%
um I would not be uh suited to sit in
 
06:31:16.270 --> 06:31:16.280 align:start position:0%
Judgment of an electrical engineer a
 
06:31:18.350 --> 06:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
mechanical engineer a civil engineer I'm
 
06:31:20.948 --> 06:31:20.958 align:start position:0%
a licens Lance ofir and I think that
 
06:31:23.750 --> 06:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
they'll speak to that um on the reverse
 
06:31:26.628 --> 06:31:26.638 align:start position:0%
of that um
 
06:31:30.230 --> 06:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
um if we don't have the four members on
 
06:31:32.388 --> 06:31:32.398 align:start position:0%
the board of surveyors there is a
 
06:31:36.190 --> 06:31:36.200 align:start position:0%
potential for harm to the general public
 
06:31:38.310 --> 06:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
harm to the individual servers that may
 
06:31:41.510 --> 06:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
have a complaint filed against them um
 
06:31:44.548 --> 06:31:44.558 align:start position:0%
and the uh profession as a
 
06:31:44.558 --> 06:31:47.830 align:start position:0%
and the uh profession as a
whole

06:31:47.830 --> 06:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:50.510 --> 06:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
um that's it if you if you have any
 
06:31:53.430 --> 06:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
questions I do my best to answer them
 
06:31:54.510 --> 06:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony any
 
06:31:56.670 --> 06:31:56.680 align:start position:0%
question questions representative Greta
 
06:31:59.350 --> 06:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you are land surveyors the work
 
06:32:01.468 --> 06:32:01.478 align:start position:0%
that they do are they also do are they
 
06:32:03.468 --> 06:32:03.478 align:start position:0%
also hired by municipalities and
 
06:32:05.350 --> 06:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
planning boards and zoning boards and do
 
06:32:08.510 --> 06:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
they not have to submit their their um
 
06:32:10.910 --> 06:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
findings to their to those
 
06:32:14.388 --> 06:32:14.398 align:start position:0%

thank you so much uh Mark condo demat
 
06:33:31.190 --> 06:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
traki um I'm representing the New
 
06:33:32.868 --> 06:33:32.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire land surveyors Association I
 
06:33:35.468 --> 06:33:35.478 align:start position:0%
am the government Affairs director um
 
06:33:38.190 --> 06:33:38.200 align:start position:0%
and I have the uh great privilege of
 
06:33:40.270 --> 06:33:40.280 align:start position:0%
being licensed as both a land surveyor
 
06:33:43.070 --> 06:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
and a professional engineer so I can uh
 
06:33:45.708 --> 06:33:45.718 align:start position:0%
see from both perspectives you know how
 
06:33:48.230 --> 06:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
this bill will uh will impact the
 
06:33:51.070 --> 06:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
profession and you know I uh I agree
 
06:33:54.270 --> 06:33:54.280 align:start position:0%
with what um both Joe and Mike said I'm
 
06:33:55.868 --> 06:33:55.878 align:start position:0%
not going to spend too much time
 
06:33:59.030 --> 06:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
reiterating the um testimony because we
 
06:34:01.590 --> 06:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
believe in efficiency and um limiting
 
06:34:05.590 --> 06:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
redundancies so that being said um from
 
06:34:08.190 --> 06:34:08.200 align:start position:0%
from my perspective obviously the needs
 
06:34:09.910 --> 06:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
of each
 
06:34:14.190 --> 06:34:14.200 align:start position:0%
leny is different and unique um and
 
06:34:16.548 --> 06:34:16.558 align:start position:0%
there are needs that Engineers require
 
06:34:18.510 --> 06:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
that uh you know surveying and surveying
 
06:34:22.230 --> 06:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
boards cannot provide and vice versa um
 
06:34:25.070 --> 06:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
you know to to combine the two uh now
 
06:34:26.990 --> 06:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
and in the fashion that it has been
 
06:34:29.948 --> 06:34:29.958 align:start position:0%
proposed uh we don't believe is going to
 
06:34:32.150 --> 06:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
increase any efficiencies we don't
 
06:34:34.948 --> 06:34:34.958 align:start position:0%
believe it's going to limit redundancies
 
06:34:36.990 --> 06:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
and and really you know as you've heard
 
06:34:39.910 --> 06:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
from the two previous uh gentlemen that
 
06:34:41.868 --> 06:34:41.878 align:start position:0%
testified it very well may have the
 
06:34:45.510 --> 06:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
opposite effect um you know our job as
 
06:34:48.910 --> 06:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
lies we are tasked with protecting the
 
06:34:51.708 --> 06:34:51.718 align:start position:0%
health safety and Welfare of the public
 
06:34:52.830 --> 06:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
um you know when you look at the
 
06:34:55.150 --> 06:34:55.160 align:start position:0%
importance of professional engine ing
 
06:34:57.468 --> 06:34:57.478 align:start position:0%
you know every day it impacts your lives
 
06:34:59.110 --> 06:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's the water you drink or the
 
06:35:02.070 --> 06:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
roads you drive on or the light switches
 
06:35:06.310 --> 06:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
you flip Etc uh an engineer has their
 
06:35:08.910 --> 06:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
hand in that and when you think about
 
06:35:10.628 --> 06:35:10.638 align:start position:0%
some of the largest Investments you will
 
06:35:13.110 --> 06:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
ever make in your lifetime such as your
 
06:35:16.310 --> 06:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
own personal home um land surveyors have
 
06:35:20.270 --> 06:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
a great impact in that so obviously
 
06:35:22.430 --> 06:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
protecting the public and protecting the
 
06:35:24.628 --> 06:35:24.638 align:start position:0%
Health and Welfare and safety of our
 
06:35:26.910 --> 06:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
community is of the utmost importance
 
06:35:30.830 --> 06:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
for us um the two professions are unique
 
06:35:32.708 --> 06:35:32.718 align:start position:0%
in the sense that you know New Hampshire
 
06:35:36.388 --> 06:35:36.398 align:start position:0%
is a colonial state and there are uh
 
06:35:38.750 --> 06:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
unique land use laws in New Hampshire
 
06:35:41.310 --> 06:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
that set us apart from engineering and
 
06:35:44.628 --> 06:35:44.638 align:start position:0%
from other states and uh you know we are
 
06:35:47.510 --> 06:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
not part of the US Survey System um
 
06:35:49.468 --> 06:35:49.478 align:start position:0%
because of you know our Colonial ties
 
06:35:51.190 --> 06:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
and Heritage
 
06:35:53.708 --> 06:35:53.718 align:start position:0%
so the the other thing to keep in mind
 
06:35:55.708 --> 06:35:55.718 align:start position:0%
is that as the two board members
 
06:35:59.990 --> 06:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
testified um being a member of a board
 
06:36:03.030 --> 06:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
is is a great honor and privilege uh you
 
06:36:05.070 --> 06:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
know but it's also a lot of work I mean
 
06:36:08.070 --> 06:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a lot of work and they do a
 
06:36:12.030 --> 06:36:12.040 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff and to now reduce the
 
06:36:14.750 --> 06:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
number of uh individuals that are going
 
06:36:16.990 --> 06:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
to be you know overseeing and reviewing
 
06:36:19.948 --> 06:36:19.958 align:start position:0%
and helping and processing and and
 
06:36:22.708 --> 06:36:22.718 align:start position:0%
working in all of those different facets
 
06:36:25.548 --> 06:36:25.558 align:start position:0%
of what they do um really essentially
 
06:36:27.670 --> 06:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
doubling you know their workload
 
06:36:30.990 --> 06:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
potentially you know it it makes it a
 
06:36:34.110 --> 06:36:34.120 align:start position:0%
lot more work and a lot less desirable
 
06:36:35.830 --> 06:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
to want to represent you know your
 
06:36:38.548 --> 06:36:38.558 align:start position:0%
community and volunteer your time and
 
06:36:40.670 --> 06:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
you know offer your services and your
 
06:36:42.708 --> 06:36:42.718 align:start position:0%
expertise and your profession you know
 
06:36:45.270 --> 06:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
for the greater good of our community so
 
06:36:47.788 --> 06:36:47.798 align:start position:0%
uh with that being said anybody has any
 
06:36:49.910 --> 06:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
questions I'd be happy to answer thank
 
06:36:51.708 --> 06:36:51.718 align:start position:0%
you any
 
06:36:54.868 --> 06:36:54.878 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative man py
 
06:36:57.150 --> 06:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
06:36:59.708 --> 06:36:59.718 align:start position:0%
question uh you sit in a very unique
 
06:37:02.708 --> 06:37:02.718 align:start position:0%
position of from both sides and you
 
06:37:04.708 --> 06:37:04.718 align:start position:0%
touched upon the fact
 
06:37:09.990 --> 06:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
that the workforce growth or need in the
 
06:37:12.510 --> 06:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
communities you know the increasing
 
06:37:17.788 --> 06:37:17.798 align:start position:0%
housing need and other needs so this
 
06:37:20.590 --> 06:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
would impact can you elaborate a little
 
06:37:23.190 --> 06:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
more how it would impact by combining
 
06:37:24.990 --> 06:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
the two boards How would would it
 
06:37:27.548 --> 06:37:27.558 align:start position:0%
negatively impact the public receiving
 
06:37:30.830 --> 06:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
the asking for service so from from my
 
06:37:33.670 --> 06:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
perspective as a consumer of you know
 
06:37:36.030 --> 06:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
the the the license um I I can tell you
 
06:37:37.868 --> 06:37:37.878 align:start position:0%
that there are times where I will reach
 
06:37:40.270 --> 06:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
out to board members with questions with
 
06:37:43.830 --> 06:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
clarifications um with concerns uh I
 
06:37:45.910 --> 06:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
definitely think that this will slow
 
06:37:48.670 --> 06:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
that process down which will again slow
 
06:37:51.270 --> 06:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
my ability to respond to questions and
 
06:37:54.190 --> 06:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
concerns from the public down which then
 
06:37:56.628 --> 06:37:56.638 align:start position:0%
you know creates that Log Jam which then
 
06:37:59.990 --> 06:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
only compounds as you go further out so
 
06:38:01.670 --> 06:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
I I definitely think that that there
 
06:38:04.430 --> 06:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
will be that effect the fact that you
 
06:38:07.430 --> 06:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
know as Mr wicker stated you know he is
 
06:38:09.230 --> 06:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
underst staffed um my company is
 
06:38:11.868 --> 06:38:11.878 align:start position:0%
understaffed you can ask many people in
 
06:38:13.230 --> 06:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
many different Industries and they will
 
06:38:14.788 --> 06:38:14.798 align:start position:0%
say the same thing that that they are
 
06:38:17.388 --> 06:38:17.398 align:start position:0%
underst staffed and then that wait time
 
06:38:20.708 --> 06:38:20.718 align:start position:0%
only then compounds that ability to
 
06:38:23.670 --> 06:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
serve uh you know you've gone to say a
 
06:38:25.350 --> 06:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
restaurant and they've said I'm sorry
 
06:38:26.990 --> 06:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
we're short weight staff and you'll have
 
06:38:29.270 --> 06:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
to wait now for that service it's
 
06:38:31.388 --> 06:38:31.398 align:start position:0%
similar um in the engineering and
 
06:38:33.670 --> 06:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
surveying business where you know if you
 
06:38:35.350 --> 06:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
are underst staffed and you now have to
 
06:38:36.868 --> 06:38:36.878 align:start position:0%
tell somebody that they have to then
 
06:38:38.430 --> 06:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
wait for that service you are now
 
06:38:41.190 --> 06:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
delaying potentially large financial
 
06:38:44.230 --> 06:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
investments um that may never
 
06:38:46.868 --> 06:38:46.878 align:start position:0%
materialize as a result of that and you
 
06:38:46.878 --> 06:38:47.830 align:start position:0%
materialize as a result of that and you
know

06:38:47.830 --> 06:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:38:50.750 --> 06:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
by creating that potential inefficiency
 
06:38:53.230 --> 06:38:53.240 align:start position:0%
you know you you're impacting real
 
06:38:55.230 --> 06:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
people's lives with you know their
 
06:39:02.388 --> 06:39:02.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:05.788 --> 06:39:05.798 align:start position:0%
um representative goalie thank you Mr
 
06:39:07.030 --> 06:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking the
 
06:39:08.548 --> 06:39:08.558 align:start position:0%
question I just want to follow up on
 
06:39:08.558 --> 06:39:09.830 align:start position:0%
question I just want to follow up on
that

06:39:09.830 --> 06:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:39:12.110 --> 06:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
so your
 
06:39:14.948 --> 06:39:14.958 align:start position:0%
statement you're saying that merging
 
06:39:17.628 --> 06:39:17.638 align:start position:0%
these two boards potentially may not
 
06:39:20.830 --> 06:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
promote the efficiency that it says it
 
06:39:23.510 --> 06:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
does here in the language of the
 
06:39:23.520 --> 06:39:24.590 align:start position:0%
does here in the language of the
legislation

06:39:24.590 --> 06:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:39:28.708 --> 06:39:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:30.670 --> 06:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
you enough further questions thank you
 
06:39:32.430 --> 06:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank
 
06:39:43.628 --> 06:39:43.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:46.510 --> 06:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
cochos uh thank you Mr chair members of
 
06:39:48.708 --> 06:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Alex kouis I'm
 
06:39:51.310 --> 06:39:51.320 align:start position:0%
here in my capacity as the executive
 
06:39:53.350 --> 06:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
director of AC New Hampshire which
 
06:39:55.388 --> 06:39:55.398 align:start position:0%
stands for American Council of
 
06:39:57.070 --> 06:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
engineering companies I'm not an
 
06:39:59.388 --> 06:39:59.398 align:start position:0%
engineer and I don't claim to represent
 
06:40:02.030 --> 06:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
every engineer in the state but we do
 
06:40:03.350 --> 06:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
have a lot of employees in our
 
06:40:06.070 --> 06:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
membership over 1500 we also have 70
 
06:40:08.110 --> 06:40:08.120 align:start position:0%
member companies that employ those
 
06:40:11.110 --> 06:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
individuals we are opposed to this bill
 
06:40:12.788 --> 06:40:12.798 align:start position:0%
because we believe it's a solution in
 
06:40:14.868 --> 06:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
search of a problem we also believe it
 
06:40:18.670 --> 06:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
is premature to pass a bill like this
 
06:40:21.310 --> 06:40:21.320 align:start position:0%
based on the bills that you passed last
 
06:40:23.110 --> 06:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
session that have been signed into law
 
06:40:24.548 --> 06:40:24.558 align:start position:0%
that haven't really even had a chance to
 
06:40:26.910 --> 06:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
be fully implemented yet just to give
 
06:40:28.990 --> 06:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
you some background information
 
06:40:33.350 --> 06:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
according to the 2023 oplc annual report
 
06:40:35.868 --> 06:40:35.878 align:start position:0%
there are almost 6,500 licensed
 
06:40:37.788 --> 06:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
engineers in in the state of New
 
06:40:40.150 --> 06:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in that same report you will
 
06:40:42.510 --> 06:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
learn that the PE board had revenue of
 
06:40:52.830 --> 06:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:55.708 --> 06:40:55.718 align:start position:0%
537,500 brought before the PE board and
 
06:40:57.708 --> 06:40:57.718 align:start position:0%
there were zero cases meaning there were
 
06:40:57.718 --> 06:40:59.388 align:start position:0%
there were zero cases meaning there were
no

06:40:59.388 --> 06:40:59.398 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:41:01.548 --> 06:41:01.558 align:start position:0%
prosecutions according to the oplc
 
06:41:05.030 --> 06:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
website the PE board met nine times last
 
06:41:07.750 --> 06:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
year if you go back to 2022 they met
 
06:41:07.760 --> 06:41:08.628 align:start position:0%
year if you go back to 2022 they met
eight

06:41:08.628 --> 06:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
eight
 
06:41:13.310 --> 06:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
times so just in summary 6,500 licenses
 
06:41:16.708 --> 06:41:16.718 align:start position:0%
in the state they generate a small
 
06:41:19.190 --> 06:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
Surplus with their budget revenue is
 
06:41:21.788 --> 06:41:21.798 align:start position:0%
higher than expenses they had three
 
06:41:24.430 --> 06:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
complaints last year
 
06:41:24.440 --> 06:41:26.948 align:start position:0%
complaints last year
no

06:41:26.948 --> 06:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:30.468 --> 06:41:30.478 align:start position:0%
prosecutions they met nine
 
06:41:33.590 --> 06:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
times so this would lead I think anyone
 
06:41:34.910 --> 06:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
to believe that this is a pretty
 
06:41:37.628 --> 06:41:37.638 align:start position:0%
well-managed board so I don't understand
 
06:41:40.750 --> 06:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:43.190 --> 06:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
here great thank you so much well I have
 
06:41:45.868 --> 06:41:45.878 align:start position:0%
a couple other things but but I but I
 
06:41:49.230 --> 06:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
will I would ask you to again what is
 
06:41:52.270 --> 06:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
the problem we're trying to solve I I I
 
06:41:54.468 --> 06:41:54.478 align:start position:0%
can't figure it out uh
 
06:41:55.948 --> 06:41:55.958 align:start position:0%
I I won't go I think the gentleman who
 
06:41:57.468 --> 06:41:57.478 align:start position:0%
spoke first went through a lot of the
 
06:41:59.350 --> 06:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
reasons that have been floating around
 
06:42:02.628 --> 06:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
this building about why this bill's here
 
06:42:04.590 --> 06:42:04.600 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going to just cut all that out I
 
06:42:07.110 --> 06:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
do want to just bring bring it back to
 
06:42:08.548 --> 06:42:08.558 align:start position:0%
last session and and the director of the
 
06:42:11.670 --> 06:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
oplc said it you passed House Bill 655
 
06:42:14.510 --> 06:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
six months ago I I think we need to let
 
06:42:16.868 --> 06:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
that bill actually get implemented the
 
06:42:20.110 --> 06:42:20.120 align:start position:0%
the PE board is one of the more Hands-On
 
06:42:22.190 --> 06:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
boards they are as you heard they're
 
06:42:24.190 --> 06:42:24.200 align:start position:0%
reviewing the applications they're
 
06:42:26.150 --> 06:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
reviewing the the resumés how much of
 
06:42:28.388 --> 06:42:28.398 align:start position:0%
that responsibility is the oplc going to
 
06:42:29.910 --> 06:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
take on I don't think we have the answer
 
06:42:32.270 --> 06:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
to that yet so before we start passing
 
06:42:35.468 --> 06:42:35.478 align:start position:0%
bills to consolidate boards let's figure
 
06:42:37.070 --> 06:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
out what we passed six months ago and
 
06:42:38.628 --> 06:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
see how that's actually working before
 
06:42:41.388 --> 06:42:41.398 align:start position:0%
we start ripping things up uh you you
 
06:42:44.350 --> 06:42:44.360 align:start position:0%
also had the the bill on the endorsement
 
06:42:46.628 --> 06:42:46.638 align:start position:0%
substantially similar license what's
 
06:42:48.230 --> 06:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
going to happen with that we we don't we
 
06:42:50.708 --> 06:42:50.718 align:start position:0%
have no idea so there's a lot of angst
 
06:42:52.110 --> 06:42:52.120 align:start position:0%
you know it's someone who works for a
 
06:42:54.350 --> 06:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
lobbying firm that has a lot of people
 
06:42:55.868 --> 06:42:55.878 align:start position:0%
who are licensed professionally there's
 
06:42:57.830 --> 06:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of angst in the community about
 
06:42:59.430 --> 06:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
what is going to happen this session
 
06:43:02.350 --> 06:43:02.360 align:start position:0%
with with professional lenser so I I
 
06:43:05.270 --> 06:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
would just ask you to keep that in mind
 
06:43:06.590 --> 06:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
the other thing I want to point out
 
06:43:09.070 --> 06:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
again not to say that these other
 
06:43:12.350 --> 06:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
smaller boards aren't as important as as
 
06:43:14.548 --> 06:43:14.558 align:start position:0%
6,500 lenses with Engineers but if you
 
06:43:16.830 --> 06:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
look at geologists there's 500
 
06:43:18.990 --> 06:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
geologists who were licensed in the
 
06:43:21.628 --> 06:43:21.638 align:start position:0%
state you know under this bill they
 
06:43:23.310 --> 06:43:23.320 align:start position:0%
would have their own separate board for
 
06:43:25.750 --> 06:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
GE ologists under this bill as you heard
 
06:43:29.468 --> 06:43:29.478 align:start position:0%
there'd be two pees for 6,500 licenses
 
06:43:31.708 --> 06:43:31.718 align:start position:0%
you have chemical Engineers mechanical
 
06:43:33.910 --> 06:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
engineers civil engineers environmental
 
06:43:35.708 --> 06:43:35.718 align:start position:0%
Engineers geotechnical Engineers all
 
06:43:38.190 --> 06:43:38.200 align:start position:0%
these different disciplines that that
 
06:43:39.510 --> 06:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be
 
06:43:42.070 --> 06:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
represented so again I would just ask
 
06:43:43.830 --> 06:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
you to really take a hard look at this
 
06:43:46.110 --> 06:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
bill and say why why are we here what is
 
06:43:49.070 --> 06:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
it I I haven't heard any compelling
 
06:43:50.868 --> 06:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
reason why we should take something
 
06:43:53.270 --> 06:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's worked well for decades no one's
 
06:43:56.510 --> 06:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
complaining about it why are we here I I
 
06:43:58.388 --> 06:43:58.398 align:start position:0%
can't figure it out um so I would ask
 
06:43:59.590 --> 06:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
you to
 
06:44:03.150 --> 06:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
really kill this bill and and let's uh
 
06:44:05.548 --> 06:44:05.558 align:start position:0%
let's go

home thank you very much I'll say okay
 
06:44:10.670 --> 06:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
great I'm done now any
 
06:44:12.590 --> 06:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
06:44:14.750 --> 06:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
testimony appreciate it sorry sorry for
 
06:44:16.628 --> 06:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
the levity but it's it's been a long day
 
06:44:22.070 --> 06:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:35.868 --> 06:44:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:38.110 --> 06:44:38.120 align:start position:0%
hello um my name is Dave Gil I'm
 
06:44:40.468 --> 06:44:40.478 align:start position:0%
actually representing the Board of
 
06:44:43.910 --> 06:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
Professional Engineers here uh thank you
 
06:44:45.270 --> 06:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
chairman for taking this time in
 
06:44:47.868 --> 06:44:47.878 align:start position:0%
committee for listening to us the board
 
06:44:50.868 --> 06:44:50.878 align:start position:0%
of Engineers is not in favor of this
 
06:44:54.150 --> 06:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
bill strongly um as with House Bill 2
 
06:44:56.590 --> 06:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
um that failed we are still against this
 
06:45:00.270 --> 06:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
also and not to rehash everything that
 
06:45:03.070 --> 06:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
the profession uh life the AR Architects
 
06:45:06.510 --> 06:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
the landscaper no the land land
 
06:45:08.030 --> 06:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
surveyors I know it's land something I'm
 
06:45:10.388 --> 06:45:10.398 align:start position:0%
an engineer so I know it's again we're
 
06:45:13.310 --> 06:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
so different you know but one thing that
 
06:45:15.868 --> 06:45:15.878 align:start position:0%
was mentioned is we share the same group
 
06:45:15.878 --> 06:45:16.830 align:start position:0%
was mentioned is we share the same group
The

06:45:16.830 --> 06:45:16.840 align:start position:0%
The
 
06:45:20.708 --> 06:45:20.718 align:start position:0%
ncees which is true they are holding our
 
06:45:22.910 --> 06:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
testing they do all that work but when
 
06:45:26.628 --> 06:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
we meet as a group we go to one area and
 
06:45:29.030 --> 06:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
the surveyors go to a whole another area
 
06:45:32.230 --> 06:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
um it is just a kind of a an umbrella
 
06:45:34.548 --> 06:45:34.558 align:start position:0%
that monitors our exams keeps the scores
 
06:45:38.430 --> 06:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
does some of the paperwork for us we
 
06:45:40.430 --> 06:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
again our meetings are held separately
 
06:45:41.830 --> 06:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
separate areas we are completely
 
06:45:44.468 --> 06:45:44.478 align:start position:0%
separated the idea of the workload we
 
06:45:48.430 --> 06:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
are all volunteers um having you know
 
06:45:51.708 --> 06:45:51.718 align:start position:0%
we're averaging you know almost 40
 
06:45:53.670 --> 06:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
applications a month and we're getting
 
06:45:55.708 --> 06:45:55.718 align:start position:0%
through them all with all of us
 
06:45:57.388 --> 06:45:57.398 align:start position:0%
splitting them all up now if we were to
 
06:45:59.310 --> 06:45:59.320 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden lose two more Engineers
 
06:46:02.150 --> 06:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
on the board now we're looking at even
 
06:46:04.510 --> 06:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
more time to review these
 
06:46:07.310 --> 06:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
applications uh it is a volunteer and
 
06:46:08.948 --> 06:46:08.958 align:start position:0%
I'm proud to be a volunteer I'm proud to
 
06:46:10.788 --> 06:46:10.798 align:start position:0%
be on the board um it's something that
 
06:46:12.830 --> 06:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
I've kind of wanted to do to give back
 
06:46:15.070 --> 06:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
to my community um I've always been a
 
06:46:17.150 --> 06:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
volunteer in the state and volunteering
 
06:46:19.190 --> 06:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
for the board is just as
 
06:46:23.590 --> 06:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
important um let's see here um our board
 
06:46:26.110 --> 06:46:26.120 align:start position:0%
does meet on a monthly basis we have
 
06:46:28.270 --> 06:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
never had an issue with a quorum we've
 
06:46:30.788 --> 06:46:30.798 align:start position:0%
always had our quorums uh when it comes
 
06:46:33.070 --> 06:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
to other specialized items that might
 
06:46:36.590 --> 06:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
pop up we are all notified and we work
 
06:46:38.270 --> 06:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
our hardest to get back together another
 
06:46:40.030 --> 06:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
quorum to deal with the issue as it
 
06:46:42.750 --> 06:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
happens we have never had complaints
 
06:46:45.230 --> 06:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
against us as a board U we've always
 
06:46:49.190 --> 06:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
been very responsive very active um
 
06:46:50.708 --> 06:46:50.718 align:start position:0%
we're not the ones holding up a lot of
 
06:46:54.230 --> 06:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
the stuff again I don't want to go over
 
06:46:55.948 --> 06:46:55.958 align:start position:0%
a lot of the same stuff um you know the
 
06:46:57.910 --> 06:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
survey Engineers were different
 
06:47:01.510 --> 06:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
different societies board um it's it's
 
06:47:03.548 --> 06:47:03.558 align:start position:0%
we're just very much against this bill
 
06:47:07.388 --> 06:47:07.398 align:start position:0%
um it's not serving the purpose that we
 
06:47:09.910 --> 06:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
assume is as it was said in House Bill
 
06:47:13.150 --> 06:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:16.430 --> 06:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
down thank you for your testimony any
 
06:47:19.548 --> 06:47:19.558 align:start position:0%
questions see thank you for your
 
06:47:21.990 --> 06:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
time djus does anybody have any
 
06:47:25.830 --> 06:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:28.910 --> 06:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:31.910 --> 06:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
again director Courtney anybody have any
 
06:47:33.750 --> 06:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
questions yes we do sorry you never get
 
06:47:38.670 --> 06:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:41.030 --> 06:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
hook thank you all l z Courtney
 
06:47:43.468 --> 06:47:43.478 align:start position:0%
executive director oplc and again just
 
06:47:45.430 --> 06:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
want to clarify this was not put in at
 
06:47:47.830 --> 06:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
the request of the office happy to take
 
06:47:49.868 --> 06:47:49.878 align:start position:0%
any questions I would say that there's
 
06:47:52.590 --> 06:47:52.600 align:start position:0%
been a lot of changes legislatively with
 
06:47:55.190 --> 06:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
respect to six 55 409 what was House
 
06:47:58.030 --> 06:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 if you look at the overall bills
 
06:47:59.990 --> 06:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
package last year that was the
 
06:48:03.750 --> 06:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
initiative from the governor's office um
 
06:48:05.948 --> 06:48:05.958 align:start position:0%
it proposed some massive shifts a couple
 
06:48:07.910 --> 06:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
of things obviously switching the
 
06:48:09.350 --> 06:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
investigative function over to the
 
06:48:11.910 --> 06:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
office in order to promote um a clear
 
06:48:13.948 --> 06:48:13.958 align:start position:0%
delineation of responsibilities so you
 
06:48:14.948 --> 06:48:14.958 align:start position:0%
don't have the same people doing the
 
06:48:17.270 --> 06:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
investigations as the adjudications
 
06:48:19.750 --> 06:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
shifts The Lure over to the oplc and I
 
06:48:21.310 --> 06:48:21.320 align:start position:0%
think what's clear is that there has to
 
06:48:23.468 --> 06:48:23.478 align:start position:0%
be objective standards and and we're
 
06:48:25.350 --> 06:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
still working through some of the issues
 
06:48:26.590 --> 06:48:26.600 align:start position:0%
with respect to boards that have
 
06:48:28.628 --> 06:48:28.638 align:start position:0%
subjective standards in their licensing
 
06:48:31.310 --> 06:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
process but then after that you know
 
06:48:33.910 --> 06:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
essentially the question was okay the
 
06:48:35.948 --> 06:48:35.958 align:start position:0%
board's um primary function is with
 
06:48:38.190 --> 06:48:38.200 align:start position:0%
respect to rulemaking regulation and
 
06:48:38.200 --> 06:48:39.868 align:start position:0%
respect to rulemaking regulation and
adjudicating

06:48:39.868 --> 06:48:39.878 align:start position:0%
adjudicating
 
06:48:43.868 --> 06:48:43.878 align:start position:0%
cases um there were a lot of proposals
 
06:48:46.868 --> 06:48:46.878 align:start position:0%
to merge various boards with the
 
06:48:47.990 --> 06:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
understanding that boards would no
 
06:48:49.670 --> 06:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
longer be meeting monthly in order to
 
06:48:49.680 --> 06:48:50.750 align:start position:0%
longer be meeting monthly in order to
review

06:48:50.750 --> 06:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
review
 
06:48:53.830 --> 06:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
applications so these bills are or this
 
06:48:56.590 --> 06:48:56.600 align:start position:0%
bill is essentially just from last year
 
06:48:58.510 --> 06:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
and proposes to merge land surveyors
 
06:48:58.520 --> 06:48:59.430 align:start position:0%
and proposes to merge land surveyors
with

06:48:59.430 --> 06:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:49:02.190 --> 06:49:02.200 align:start position:0%
Engineers um and you've heard from all
 
06:49:05.070 --> 06:49:05.080 align:start position:0%
folks as to their thoughts as to as to
 
06:49:08.030 --> 06:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
whether that should be the case um but
 
06:49:10.310 --> 06:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
we're not taking a position I'm happy to
 
06:49:11.990 --> 06:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
answer questions about how we would
 
06:49:14.628 --> 06:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
operationalize that change thank you
 
06:49:16.510 --> 06:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
representative leus you uh so these are
 
06:49:19.270 --> 06:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
going to be similar to the prior uh bill
 
06:49:22.708 --> 06:49:22.718 align:start position:0%
so and with regard to the Lance survey
 
06:49:24.350 --> 06:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
board not the engineers I mean how many
 
06:49:26.150 --> 06:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
lenes are there are there an trust
 
06:49:29.350 --> 06:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
concerns that's first so off the top of
 
06:49:31.270 --> 06:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
my head I do not know how many land
 
06:49:33.510 --> 06:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
surveyors there are um you heard about
 
06:49:36.548 --> 06:49:36.558 align:start position:0%
how many land um Engineers there are um
 
06:49:38.190 --> 06:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
we don't currently have any concerns
 
06:49:40.030 --> 06:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
regarding antitrust and I will say that
 
06:49:41.788 --> 06:49:41.798 align:start position:0%
the board mergers
 
06:49:44.110 --> 06:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
that I can't speak for the governor's
 
06:49:45.868 --> 06:49:45.878 align:start position:0%
office but the board merges were were
 
06:49:48.910 --> 06:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
not contemplated as as a remedy to
 
06:49:52.510 --> 06:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
antitrust issues that's uh essentially
 
06:49:53.830 --> 06:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
it was
 
06:49:56.190 --> 06:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
these are boards that historically like
 
06:49:57.990 --> 06:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
every board used to meet monthly to
 
06:49:59.628 --> 06:49:59.638 align:start position:0%
review applications they're not going to
 
06:50:02.190 --> 06:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
be doing this anymore so is there a need
 
06:50:04.868 --> 06:50:04.878 align:start position:0%
to have that monthly meeting or can we
 
06:50:07.270 --> 06:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
essentially consolidate those efforts
 
06:50:08.750 --> 06:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
that was essentially the gist As I
 
06:50:10.948 --> 06:50:10.958 align:start position:0%
understood it so it wasn't um the
 
06:50:13.788 --> 06:50:13.798 align:start position:0%
mergers were not proposed to to deal
 
06:50:15.830 --> 06:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
with State supervision
 
06:50:18.590 --> 06:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
issues follow up um actually kind of
 
06:50:20.350 --> 06:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
maybe answer the question I think we
 
06:50:23.070 --> 06:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
heard certainly from the engineers I'm
 
06:50:24.708 --> 06:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
may recall from the land survey is that
 
06:50:27.150 --> 06:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
they're reviewing applications is that
 
06:50:29.750 --> 06:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
the past process and has changed or will
 
06:50:32.388 --> 06:50:32.398 align:start position:0%
changed or so my understanding with
 
06:50:35.150 --> 06:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
their oh Bethany would you like
 
06:50:38.110 --> 06:50:38.120 align:start position:0%
to I apologize uh Bethany katr division
 
06:50:40.190 --> 06:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
director of Licensing um I was just
 
06:50:42.350 --> 06:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
clarifying that with our staff so they
 
06:50:44.788 --> 06:50:44.798 align:start position:0%
currently are reviewing when someone is
 
06:50:46.310 --> 06:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
going to take the professional
 
06:50:48.830 --> 06:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
engineering exam there was a process
 
06:50:50.788 --> 06:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
there's multi-level steps to be
 
06:50:52.788 --> 06:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
professional engineer but the approval
 
06:50:55.830 --> 06:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
or denial process for the lure is still
 
06:50:57.430 --> 06:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
held with the
 
06:51:00.430 --> 06:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
office followup followup y thank you for
 
06:51:02.750 --> 06:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
that um so I mean any other concerns
 
06:51:05.548 --> 06:51:05.558 align:start position:0%
there's the typical ones uh uh it sounds
 
06:51:07.310 --> 06:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
like there's not but you know Quorum
 
06:51:10.548 --> 06:51:10.558 align:start position:0%
board meeting um anything else that
 
06:51:13.190 --> 06:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
would raise concerns about in particular
 
06:51:14.628 --> 06:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
I would think what I suspect is the
 
06:51:17.030 --> 06:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
smaller board the no we don't have any
 
06:51:19.270 --> 06:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
concerns and we're happy to support them
 
06:51:20.910 --> 06:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
administratively I think what I would
 
06:51:23.110 --> 06:51:23.120 align:start position:0%
just offer is this again and take taking
 
06:51:27.670 --> 06:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
a position is that the goal of um a
 
06:51:30.230 --> 06:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
board is not to represent the profession
 
06:51:31.628 --> 06:51:31.638 align:start position:0%
and I think we've heard that a few times
 
06:51:35.230 --> 06:51:35.240 align:start position:0%
today the goal is to protect the public
 
06:51:38.590 --> 06:51:38.600 align:start position:0%
and um earlier you heard me explain how
 
06:51:39.910 --> 06:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
there are different models in different
 
06:51:42.590 --> 06:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
states one of the models is completely
 
06:51:45.468 --> 06:51:45.478 align:start position:0%
public member majority that is a model
 
06:51:47.788 --> 06:51:47.798 align:start position:0%
that some states use it's intended to
 
06:51:49.868 --> 06:51:49.878 align:start position:0%
provide State oversight but we in New
 
06:51:51.310 --> 06:51:51.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have a state board of
 
06:51:54.670 --> 06:51:54.680 align:start position:0%
education that is is comprised entirely
 
06:51:59.310 --> 06:51:59.320 align:start position:0%
of public members so so I just want to
 
06:52:02.468 --> 06:52:02.478 align:start position:0%
um so I don't support the notion that we
 
06:52:05.150 --> 06:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
need representation of the profession I
 
06:52:06.910 --> 06:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
think we need expertise of the
 
06:52:09.070 --> 06:52:09.080 align:start position:0%
profession to understand how it's
 
06:52:10.948 --> 06:52:10.958 align:start position:0%
regulated but I think it's up to the
 
06:52:12.990 --> 06:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
legislature to determine you know what's
 
06:52:15.270 --> 06:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
the best composition in order to do that
 
06:52:18.548 --> 06:52:18.558 align:start position:0%
yet not taking a position but um that I
 
06:52:20.590 --> 06:52:20.600 align:start position:0%
just wanted to correct or make that
 
06:52:23.670 --> 06:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
point okay thank you so representative
 
06:52:27.350 --> 06:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
man no we're good representative goalie
 
06:52:30.750 --> 06:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
thank you I just have to follow up on
 
06:52:33.628 --> 06:52:33.638 align:start position:0%
that so has
 
06:52:37.548 --> 06:52:37.558 align:start position:0%
there been any concern at all
 
06:52:42.070 --> 06:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
about these boards made up of
 
06:52:44.430 --> 06:52:44.440 align:start position:0%
professionals doing something not in the
 
06:52:47.468 --> 06:52:47.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:49.868 --> 06:52:49.878 align:start position:0%
Safety no I don't have any specific
 
06:52:55.628 --> 06:52:55.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:58.430 --> 06:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
no just want to make sure we're I'm
 
06:53:01.270 --> 06:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
clear on that because it was not clear
 
06:53:03.150 --> 06:53:03.160 align:start position:0%
whether having boys made up
 
06:53:05.190 --> 06:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
professionals was truly in the Public's
 
06:53:06.990 --> 06:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
best interest as to the way you had
 
06:53:09.230 --> 06:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
worded it so I want to make sure we're
 
06:53:12.708 --> 06:53:12.718 align:start position:0%
not we're okay with having these folks
 
06:53:14.628 --> 06:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
on the boards the way they're set up yes
 
06:53:16.230 --> 06:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely I'm sorry I wasn't clear all
 
06:53:17.670 --> 06:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
I was saying is I heard today that
 
06:53:19.350 --> 06:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
essentially merging the two wouldn't
 
06:53:21.230 --> 06:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
allow us to represent our professions
 
06:53:23.190 --> 06:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
and that's not the purpose of a regular
 
06:53:24.628 --> 06:53:24.638 align:start position:0%
board the purpose is to protect the
 
06:53:27.510 --> 06:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
public so if you change the makeup you
 
06:53:29.868 --> 06:53:29.878 align:start position:0%
know put them together change however I
 
06:53:31.468 --> 06:53:31.478 align:start position:0%
mean the whole goal is to protect the
 
06:53:35.788 --> 06:53:35.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:37.868 --> 06:53:37.878 align:start position:0%
competency any
 
06:53:40.270 --> 06:53:40.280 align:start position:0%
else thank you very much thanks for your
 
06:53:43.070 --> 06:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
time Mr chair if I may I do have one
 
06:53:44.990 --> 06:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
quick question for the governor's office
 
06:53:51.670 --> 06:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:51.680 --> 06:53:56.270 align:start position:0%
 
up

06:53:56.270 --> 06:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:57.628 --> 06:53:57.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon just for the record D
 
06:53:59.388 --> 06:53:59.398 align:start position:0%
jurus representing the governor's office
 
06:54:01.030 --> 06:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you me and representative Brown
 
06:54:03.548 --> 06:54:03.558 align:start position:0%
had has same concerns on the language on
 
06:54:06.708 --> 06:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
page two line 15 and once again we go
 
06:54:10.430 --> 06:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
back to statements in legislation and
 
06:54:13.670 --> 06:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
says to promote efficiency and economy
 
06:54:15.548 --> 06:54:15.558 align:start position:0%
eliminate redundancies and lure
 
06:54:18.868 --> 06:54:18.878 align:start position:0%
requirements that just doesn't read
 
06:54:20.990 --> 06:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
appropriately to me I mean the wording
 
06:54:24.270 --> 06:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
of promote efficient deficiency in
 
06:54:24.280 --> 06:54:26.750 align:start position:0%
of promote efficient deficiency in
economy

06:54:26.750 --> 06:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
economy
 
06:54:30.110 --> 06:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
and it was also asked to members of the
 
06:54:32.270 --> 06:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
board as to whether or not this is truly
 
06:54:33.708 --> 06:54:33.718 align:start position:0%
efficient putting these two boards
 
06:54:35.990 --> 06:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
together so I'm just concerned we're
 
06:54:40.388 --> 06:54:40.398 align:start position:0%
putting once again language into
 
06:54:46.190 --> 06:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:49.548 --> 06:54:49.558 align:start position:0%
there I'm I did not draft the
 
06:54:51.708 --> 06:54:51.718 align:start position:0%
legislation I I would defer to your
 
06:54:53.670 --> 06:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
expertise on stat construction as
 
06:54:57.430 --> 06:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
members of this committee and um so now
 
06:54:59.070 --> 06:54:59.080 align:start position:0%
not speaking on behalf of the governor's
 
06:55:02.030 --> 06:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
office uh I I would be happy to take a
 
06:55:04.150 --> 06:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
purpose statement directly out if uh if
 
06:55:06.270 --> 06:55:06.280 align:start position:0%
the committee so
 
06:55:09.430 --> 06:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
wished yes representative Brown okay
 
06:55:11.190 --> 06:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and you made the
 
06:55:12.868 --> 06:55:12.878 align:start position:0%
mistake we coming
 
06:55:16.030 --> 06:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
up I'm not sure I had a
 
06:55:19.788 --> 06:55:19.798 align:start position:0%
choice so for couple three hours here
 
06:55:21.590 --> 06:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
I've been sitting
 
06:55:21.600 --> 06:55:23.350 align:start position:0%
I've been sitting
here

06:55:23.350 --> 06:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:55:26.110 --> 06:55:26.120 align:start position:0%
thinking as as one of the testifiers
 
06:55:29.190 --> 06:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
said why why are we here why are we here
 
06:55:31.350 --> 06:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
and and there's a lot of conversations
 
06:55:32.670 --> 06:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
about what happened last year which I
 
06:55:34.548 --> 06:55:34.558 align:start position:0%
wasn't on this committee then so I'm a
 
06:55:37.868 --> 06:55:37.878 align:start position:0%
little bit naive on that but um does the
 
06:55:40.548 --> 06:55:40.558 align:start position:0%
governor's office have any any specific
 
06:55:40.558 --> 06:55:41.788 align:start position:0%
governor's office have any any specific
data

06:55:41.788 --> 06:55:41.798 align:start position:0%
data
 
06:55:44.670 --> 06:55:44.680 align:start position:0%
on um some of the the the issues we've
 
06:55:47.590 --> 06:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
talked about lack of Quorum or or
 
06:55:49.230 --> 06:55:49.240 align:start position:0%
meetings not being held frequently
 
06:55:51.788 --> 06:55:51.798 align:start position:0%
enough or any of those issues that have
 
06:55:53.350 --> 06:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
sort of been thrown around quite a bit
 
06:55:55.350 --> 06:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
in the last days do you have does the
 
06:55:56.990 --> 06:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
the government office have any data on
 
06:55:59.910 --> 06:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
that that we could see so to to sort of
 
06:56:03.590 --> 06:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
bolster up that position certainly so uh
 
06:56:05.990 --> 06:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
right now I the only thing I would have
 
06:56:07.628 --> 06:56:07.638 align:start position:0%
to share is anecdotal I'd be happy to
 
06:56:09.830 --> 06:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
find some data for you I guess I guess
 
06:56:12.070 --> 06:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
what I will say on on that point of why
 
06:56:15.868 --> 06:56:15.878 align:start position:0%
are we here what is going on um as you
 
06:56:17.270 --> 06:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
know right I mean if we're thinking
 
06:56:20.788 --> 06:56:20.798 align:start position:0%
Civics 101 you all make the laws that we
 
06:56:23.708 --> 06:56:23.718 align:start position:0%
have to execute in the executive branch
 
06:56:26.628 --> 06:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
and um I think many of you know in last
 
06:56:29.110 --> 06:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
year my my role as a director of
 
06:56:31.230 --> 06:56:31.240 align:start position:0%
appointments all of the nominations for
 
06:56:32.750 --> 06:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
all of these boards comes through my
 
06:56:34.190 --> 06:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
desk it's a single person in the
 
06:56:36.110 --> 06:56:36.120 align:start position:0%
governor's office and it's not just
 
06:56:37.590 --> 06:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
licensing boards right any person that
 
06:56:39.230 --> 06:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
govern names to anything comes through
 
06:56:41.270 --> 06:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
this office and it's it's a lean mean
 
06:56:43.590 --> 06:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
fighting machine um as we are in New
 
06:56:45.788 --> 06:56:45.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but I I think i' I've had a
 
06:56:47.990 --> 06:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
lot of experience firsthand on how to
 
06:56:51.230 --> 06:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
execute the the law as it is and and our
 
06:56:53.948 --> 06:56:53.958 align:start position:0%
only mechanism for doing that is to
 
06:56:56.868 --> 06:56:56.878 align:start position:0%
approach you and say what do you think
 
06:56:58.670 --> 06:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
could could we pass this idea around
 
06:57:00.430 --> 06:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
could you even if you know we have
 
06:57:02.230 --> 06:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
legislators that say I'll put it in I'm
 
06:57:03.788 --> 06:57:03.798 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to work really hard but
 
06:57:05.708 --> 06:57:05.718 align:start position:0%
we'll see what the committee thinks
 
06:57:07.070 --> 06:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes they take it and they run with
 
06:57:08.788 --> 06:57:08.798 align:start position:0%
it I think representative lakas has said
 
06:57:10.430 --> 06:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
right sometimes he's dug really into
 
06:57:12.548 --> 06:57:12.558 align:start position:0%
something that that he was passionate
 
06:57:15.030 --> 06:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
about so we we can't change the law
 
06:57:17.110 --> 06:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
right we just have to execute it and so
 
06:57:18.628 --> 06:57:18.638 align:start position:0%
some of it is to look from that
 
06:57:21.388 --> 06:57:21.398 align:start position:0%
perspective of just the board
 
06:57:23.628 --> 06:57:23.638 align:start position:0%
Construction who is appointed where what
 
06:57:25.628 --> 06:57:25.638 align:start position:0%
those members look like there there have
 
06:57:27.388 --> 06:57:27.398 align:start position:0%
been challenges that we have found in
 
06:57:29.750 --> 06:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
executing the law that you've given us
 
06:57:31.628 --> 06:57:31.638 align:start position:0%
and and so what we have just said is
 
06:57:34.030 --> 06:57:34.040 align:start position:0%
what do you think again again the
 
06:57:36.230 --> 06:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
governor's only vote is a veto right he
 
06:57:39.708 --> 06:57:39.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't get a vote on the floor um but
 
06:57:41.510 --> 06:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't have a mechanism for
 
06:57:43.750 --> 06:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
him to actually introduce bills we just
 
06:57:45.230 --> 06:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
defer to your Authority and say hey
 
06:57:47.150 --> 06:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
we're having some challenges ex like
 
06:57:50.910 --> 06:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
executing this we're doing our best um
 
06:57:53.030 --> 06:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
but what what do we think about that so
 
06:57:55.708 --> 06:57:55.718 align:start position:0%
I I think that's that that's a big piece
 
06:57:59.548 --> 06:57:59.558 align:start position:0%
of it and um as I mentioned before we I
 
06:58:01.670 --> 06:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
mean our office the office of
 
06:58:03.270 --> 06:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
06:58:05.110 --> 06:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
and any other executive department that
 
06:58:07.548 --> 06:58:07.558 align:start position:0%
comes before you is I mean acknowledges
 
06:58:09.310 --> 06:58:09.320 align:start position:0%
your Authority they they just do what
 
06:58:11.430 --> 06:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
you you tell them to do in the law to
 
06:58:12.788 --> 06:58:12.798 align:start position:0%
the best of our
 
06:58:14.868 --> 06:58:14.878 align:start position:0%
ability that's a thank you that's a
 
06:58:17.190 --> 06:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
Frank answer I appreciate that thank you
 
06:58:19.310 --> 06:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
yes representative leas that just broke
 
06:58:20.910 --> 06:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
brought up a a hopefully brief question
 
06:58:23.190 --> 06:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
that is so about uh how many
 
06:58:24.750 --> 06:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
appointments a year and how many
 
06:58:26.990 --> 06:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
positions does the governors actually
 
06:58:31.788 --> 06:58:31.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:36.868 --> 06:58:36.878 align:start position:0%
appoint thousands thousands uh it it it
 
06:58:38.750 --> 06:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
and I again uh at the risk of being
 
06:58:41.430 --> 06:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
extremely Frank at uh you know 4:05 in
 
06:58:44.590 --> 06:58:44.600 align:start position:0%
the afternoon uh there are a number that
 
06:58:46.310 --> 06:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
we get to licensing boards are
 
06:58:49.070 --> 06:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
prioritized because of their outsized
 
06:58:52.670 --> 06:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
impact right an advisory um board not in
 
06:58:54.590 --> 06:58:54.600 align:start position:0%
licensing specifically but in other
 
06:58:56.590 --> 06:58:56.600 align:start position:0%
areas of the law might come to a lower
 
06:58:59.230 --> 06:58:59.240 align:start position:0%
priority um just due to the you know the
 
06:59:00.868 --> 06:59:00.878 align:start position:0%
nature to conduct business or the effect
 
06:59:05.750 --> 06:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
on on constituents um but there's a lot
 
06:59:06.990 --> 06:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
that that we don't get to there's
 
06:59:08.350 --> 06:59:08.360 align:start position:0%
there's so much more that we could be
 
06:59:10.990 --> 06:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
doing I mean it it is an expansive
 
06:59:12.350 --> 06:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
number thank you I was just trying to
 
06:59:15.110 --> 06:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
get a feel for the magnitude quite large
 
06:59:18.430 --> 06:59:18.440 align:start position:0%
and could be much larger yes thank you
 
06:59:21.150 --> 06:59:21.160 align:start position:0%
any further questions seeing none thank
 
06:59:23.670 --> 06:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
you so much
 
06:59:25.510 --> 06:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
once again did anybody else want to
 
06:59:29.310 --> 06:59:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:36.230 --> 06:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:39.590 --> 06:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
yet how do I keep doing that I'm sorry
 
06:59:41.350 --> 06:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
it's been one of those days I guess
 
06:59:46.468 --> 06:59:46.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:49.750 --> 06:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
it MERS of the comme turn that
 
06:59:52.430 --> 06:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
on my name is Chris Maly I been a
 
06:59:54.468 --> 06:59:54.478 align:start position:0%
professional engineer since
 
06:59:58.750 --> 06:59:58.760 align:start position:0%
1999 um I'm here as a private C private
 
07:00:01.548 --> 07:00:01.558 align:start position:0%
uh Citizen and professional uh with some
 
07:00:04.708 --> 07:00:04.718 align:start position:0%
serious concerns on the merger of the
 
07:00:08.190 --> 07:00:08.200 align:start position:0%
board as well as the uh in the bill
 
07:00:11.468 --> 07:00:11.478 align:start position:0%
itself The Avenues for lure and the
 
07:00:13.628 --> 07:00:13.638 align:start position:0%
requirements for the last n and a half
 
07:00:16.628 --> 07:00:16.638 align:start position:0%
years I currently serve um on the PE
 
07:00:19.510 --> 07:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
board I am the chair and I have been for
 
07:00:21.830 --> 07:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
the last three years I've got one more
 
07:00:23.030 --> 07:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
year in my
 
07:00:25.468 --> 07:00:25.478 align:start position:0%
term there's a reason we have a five
 
07:00:28.150 --> 07:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
member board for our professionals with
 
07:00:31.110 --> 07:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
different backgrounds uh myself I am
 
07:00:34.070 --> 07:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
civil with structural we have
 
07:00:36.910 --> 07:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
environmental we have water Wastewater
 
07:00:40.270 --> 07:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
and we have fire
 
07:00:40.280 --> 07:00:41.830 align:start position:0%
and we have fire
and

07:00:41.830 --> 07:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:00:44.030 --> 07:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
chemical as just some of that because we
 
07:00:45.830 --> 07:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
have to have a majority we have a number
 
07:00:49.030 --> 07:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
of different applicants come in we are
 
07:00:51.548 --> 07:00:51.558 align:start position:0%
very busy with the five with the four
 
07:00:54.868 --> 07:00:54.878 align:start position:0%
pees and the one uh outside member
 
07:00:56.990 --> 07:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
that's there typically they're someone
 
07:00:58.910 --> 07:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
that has a legal background and the new
 
07:01:00.468 --> 07:01:00.478 align:start position:0%
board member that just joined us
 
07:01:01.750 --> 07:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
actually has a code enforcement
 
07:01:04.150 --> 07:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
background which is very helpful as well
 
07:01:05.590 --> 07:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh should complaints arise which they
 
07:01:08.510 --> 07:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
often do um I know there was mentioned
 
07:01:10.350 --> 07:01:10.360 align:start position:0%
there was only three complaints there's
 
07:01:11.510 --> 07:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
a lot more than that there was three
 
07:01:13.310 --> 07:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
complaints that were may have had
 
07:01:15.110 --> 07:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
something to do with a lot of them are
 
07:01:18.190 --> 07:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
just dismissed um or they're they're put
 
07:01:19.948 --> 07:01:19.958 align:start position:0%
off to a civil matter uh and doesn't
 
07:01:21.430 --> 07:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
involve the board or nor do we have
 
07:01:21.440 --> 07:01:23.388 align:start position:0%
involve the board or nor do we have
jurisdiction

07:01:23.388 --> 07:01:23.398 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
07:01:25.590 --> 07:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
I am concerned about Dr merging the
 
07:01:28.030 --> 07:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
board to two uh engineers and two land
 
07:01:31.270 --> 07:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
surveyors uh being involved with NCS uh
 
07:01:33.670 --> 07:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
nationally as a
 
07:01:35.788 --> 07:01:35.798 align:start position:0%
representative they are distinctly
 
07:01:38.868 --> 07:01:38.878 align:start position:0%
different and I I heard it mentioned
 
07:01:41.388 --> 07:01:41.398 align:start position:0%
earlier that to have someone from the
 
07:01:43.670 --> 07:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
general public they can simply look at a
 
07:01:45.750 --> 07:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
menu of qualifications and be able to
 
07:01:47.948 --> 07:01:47.958 align:start position:0%
check a box without having the
 
07:01:50.548 --> 07:01:50.558 align:start position:0%
experience in the field being a licensed
 
07:01:52.868 --> 07:01:52.878 align:start position:0%
professional in my mind I don't think
 
07:01:54.350 --> 07:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
any of you would want to drive over that
 
07:01:56.628 --> 07:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
bridge of that person that was licensed
 
07:01:58.788 --> 07:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
by someone that was in the administ as
 
07:02:01.310 --> 07:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
an administrator just looking at a box
 
07:02:02.948 --> 07:02:02.958 align:start position:0%
and they think that it meets those
 
07:02:05.990 --> 07:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
requirements some of the lure the as I
 
07:02:08.070 --> 07:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier some of the steps for
 
07:02:09.830 --> 07:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
a licensure that are in this new bill
 
07:02:11.070 --> 07:02:11.080 align:start position:0%
are different from what they are
 
07:02:13.430 --> 07:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
currently for what you have to have for
 
07:02:15.910 --> 07:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
education for specific experience and
 
07:02:17.788 --> 07:02:17.798 align:start position:0%
the discipline that you want to PR
 
07:02:20.230 --> 07:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
practice and ethical standards some of
 
07:02:22.750 --> 07:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
that in this is if I'm reading it
 
07:02:25.070 --> 07:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
correctly which I hope I'm not uh
 
07:02:26.868 --> 07:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
someone that has 16 years experience and
 
07:02:29.310 --> 07:02:29.320 align:start position:0%
say they've practiced civil engineering
 
07:02:32.030 --> 07:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
can go to the board and say I want to
 
07:02:34.990 --> 07:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
have be licensed there's a lot of steps
 
07:02:36.548 --> 07:02:36.558 align:start position:0%
that go into becoming a professional
 
07:02:38.868 --> 07:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
engineer I been honored to serve and
 
07:02:40.270 --> 07:02:40.280 align:start position:0%
continue to be honored to serve the
 
07:02:43.110 --> 07:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
state um on the PE board is something we
 
07:02:45.750 --> 07:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
all take extraordinarily serious because
 
07:02:48.590 --> 07:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
we recognize that we are here as Lindsay
 
07:02:50.270 --> 07:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned to protect the health welfare
 
07:02:52.590 --> 07:02:52.600 align:start position:0%
and safety of those in New Hampshire
 
07:02:54.070 --> 07:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
um certainly that use the roads and
 
07:02:55.830 --> 07:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
everything else to do that someone so
 
07:02:57.430 --> 07:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
elely touched on that Engineers are
 
07:02:59.868 --> 07:02:59.878 align:start position:0%
involved with so I'm certainly opposed
 
07:03:03.388 --> 07:03:03.398 align:start position:0%
to this um and I do hope that when the
 
07:03:06.270 --> 07:03:06.280 align:start position:0%
time comes or if this goes forward I I I
 
07:03:08.230 --> 07:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
kind of chuckle because I do think it is
 
07:03:11.070 --> 07:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
an ill-advised solution looking for a
 
07:03:13.350 --> 07:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
problem that really doesn't exist I've
 
07:03:14.708 --> 07:03:14.718 align:start position:0%
been on the board for nine and a half
 
07:03:16.708 --> 07:03:16.718 align:start position:0%
years we have never had a complaint
 
07:03:18.788 --> 07:03:18.798 align:start position:0%
about being inefficient and processing
 
07:03:21.070 --> 07:03:21.080 align:start position:0%
people through we take great pride in
 
07:03:23.468 --> 07:03:23.478 align:start position:0%
doing that we all work very very hard to
 
07:03:26.030 --> 07:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that someone is not held up
 
07:03:28.830 --> 07:03:28.840 align:start position:0%
certainly for no reason at all that's
 
07:03:30.150 --> 07:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
all I have thank you for hearing me
 
07:03:31.468 --> 07:03:31.478 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any
 
07:03:34.910 --> 07:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none anybody else wish
 
07:03:49.150 --> 07:03:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:52.510 --> 07:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
1286 Michael dolberg again for the Bo of
 
07:03:56.430 --> 07:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
sures um we take our charge to protect
 
07:03:59.310 --> 07:03:59.320 align:start position:0%
the general public very seriously um so
 
07:04:01.708 --> 07:04:01.718 align:start position:0%
when a complaint comes into the board we
 
07:04:04.990 --> 07:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
look at that um that complaint in that
 
07:04:11.548 --> 07:04:11.558 align:start position:0%
light um and recently um and this is not
 
07:04:13.830 --> 07:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
a slam on the opl staff on on the
 
07:04:16.948 --> 07:04:16.958 align:start position:0%
licensing side but the the intricate
 
07:04:22.310 --> 07:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
details of an applicant um the the
 
07:04:24.548 --> 07:04:24.558 align:start position:0%
portfolios they submit and the paperwork
 
07:04:27.788 --> 07:04:27.798 align:start position:0%
they submit is uh sometimes very lengthy
 
07:04:27.798 --> 07:04:28.910 align:start position:0%
they submit is uh sometimes very lengthy
and

07:04:28.910 --> 07:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:04:33.868 --> 07:04:33.878 align:start position:0%
voluminous and um recently we've had two
 
07:04:37.388 --> 07:04:37.398 align:start position:0%
applicants uh that were okayed by uh
 
07:04:39.468 --> 07:04:39.478 align:start position:0%
staff to sit for the professional
 
07:04:43.030 --> 07:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
licensing exam they did not have the
 
07:04:45.230 --> 07:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
qualifications they did not have their
 
07:04:47.830 --> 07:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
initial um fundamentals of surveying
 
07:04:50.868 --> 07:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
exam um passed from the ncees they did
 
07:04:52.788 --> 07:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
not have it
 
07:04:56.270 --> 07:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
um we as as the professional surveyors
 
07:04:58.868 --> 07:04:58.878 align:start position:0%
on the board we look at all that first
 
07:05:00.910 --> 07:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
to see their qualifications to look at
 
07:05:04.150 --> 07:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
their experience um if someone sends us
 
07:05:05.788 --> 07:05:05.798 align:start position:0%
a package that they've spent the last
 
07:05:08.510 --> 07:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
eight years doing construction layout uh
 
07:05:10.910 --> 07:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
good for them that's the we need that
 
07:05:12.708 --> 07:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't qualify you to make
 
07:05:16.628 --> 07:05:16.638 align:start position:0%
boundary decisions um as a lance of air
 
07:05:19.990 --> 07:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
and that's that's the Crux of the the
 
07:05:23.230 --> 07:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
law is is is is boundaries rights of way
 
07:05:27.150 --> 07:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
easements that um are critical to the
 
07:05:31.270 --> 07:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
state railroads uh power companies um
 
07:05:34.830 --> 07:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
you know that that that law as Mr Caro
 
07:05:36.788 --> 07:05:36.798 align:start position:0%
de traki spoke to earlier the colonial
 
07:05:41.110 --> 07:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
states law um is incredibly um intricate
 
07:05:43.628 --> 07:05:43.638 align:start position:0%
and detailed in every single state that
 
07:05:47.350 --> 07:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
touches us they're all different Vermont
 
07:05:50.590 --> 07:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
um their laws are based on
 
07:05:50.600 --> 07:05:53.310 align:start position:0%
um their laws are based on
um

07:05:53.310 --> 07:05:53.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:05:55.830 --> 07:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
on all the lawsuits that um that
 
07:05:59.110 --> 07:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
occurred back in the 16 and 1700s and U
 
07:06:01.388 --> 07:06:01.398 align:start position:0%
main everything's cified New Hampshire
 
07:06:03.070 --> 07:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
is a little bit above both but mainly
 
07:06:06.110 --> 07:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
just precedent um in Massachusetts a lot
 
07:06:08.788 --> 07:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
of it's
 
07:06:14.230 --> 07:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
um um in the statutes but the the the to
 
07:06:16.670 --> 07:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
to look at someone's
 
07:06:21.750 --> 07:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
qualifications from a sheer um office St
 
07:06:23.230 --> 07:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
Point saying yeah well they've got six
 
07:06:26.150 --> 07:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
years they can they do this um that's
 
07:06:28.030 --> 07:06:28.040 align:start position:0%
that's not how we work that's not how it
 
07:06:31.468 --> 07:06:31.478 align:start position:0%
works and to hand that off and and and
 
07:06:33.590 --> 07:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
water that down by having only two
 
07:06:35.830 --> 07:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
surveyors look at it and have staff take
 
07:06:41.430 --> 07:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
that over um that does injustice to um
 
07:06:43.750 --> 07:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
the state you're going to let people
 
07:06:47.070 --> 07:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
through um that aren't
 
07:06:49.990 --> 07:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
qualified even if they can pass the exam
 
07:06:52.310 --> 07:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
some people are not qualified who
 
07:06:55.468 --> 07:06:55.478 align:start position:0%
experience to to for that exam we have
 
07:06:58.388 --> 07:06:58.398 align:start position:0%
specific requirements for responsible
 
07:07:02.070 --> 07:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
charge and um if that is not met we know
 
07:07:04.150 --> 07:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
as a board that they are not qualified
 
07:07:07.230 --> 07:07:07.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:10.708 --> 07:07:10.718 align:start position:0%
