thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh good morning for the
 
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 align:start position:0%
record my name is Mike winsat I Serv as
 
00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
director of the waste management
 
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
division for the New Hampshire
 
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services I'm
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
joined this morning by Leah McKenna who
 
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
is the administrator of our Solid Waste
 
00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
Management Bureau and we're pleased to
 
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh be before you this morning to give
 
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
you a brief update of uh where we're at
 
00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
in our Solid Waste rulemaking process
 
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
particularly with respect to chapter 800
 
00:06:57.309 --> 00:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
uh regarding landfill
 
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
requirements um so at as you indicated
 
00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:03.639 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um you know as we discussed uh
 
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 align:start position:0%
at our last meeting on December 5th uh
 
00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
Dees sent out a draft of of chapter 800
 
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:11.720 align:start position:0%
for informal comment on October 18th of
 
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
last year um and then we took comment
 
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
into November and we received a lot of
 
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
feedback during that that 3-we comment
 
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
period and we made adjustments to the
 
00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:23.879 align:start position:0%
draft based on comments that we received
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
um a few of those there's a number of
 
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
those but a few of those just to to
 
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
highlight there was some language
 
00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
regarding um citing and monitoring Wells
 
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
and we received some input from the
 
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
public on that and we made some
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
adjustments with respect to that to make
 
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
it explicitly clear that they were based
 
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
on the needs uh to adequately monitor
 
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
the landfill and and the associated
 
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure around the landfill um we
 
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:49.479 align:start position:0%
uh also U made an adjustment that made
 
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
it clear that no
 
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
online that landfills could not unline
 
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
landfills could not be used um even for
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition debris that
 
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
if a CN landfill specific landfill were
 
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
cited it would need to have a liner and
 
00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:06.199 align:start position:0%
then uh we also added some quality
 
00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
assurance and quality control
 
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
requirements with regard to
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
geosynthetics because the previous rule
 
00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:14.199 align:start position:0%
made reference to geomembranes which is
 
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
only one class of geosynthetics so we
 
00:08:18.189 --> 00:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
made it clear that there needed to be
 
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
specific QA and QC um monitoring
 
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
requirements with respect to uh all
 
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
geosynthetics that are used in in
 
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.230 align:start position:0%
geosynthetics that are used in in
landfill

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
construction uh so uh with that we we
 
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
did meet with the waste management
 
00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
council at their monthly meeting on
 
00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:35.039 align:start position:0%
January 18th and we presented this set
 
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
of rules to them uh we had a very robust
 
00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
session where we we we filled it a
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
number of questions um from counselors
 
00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
and uh we uh we did did our best to
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
answer their questions um I I will note
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
too that in this interim period we've
 
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
also been approached once that draft was
 
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
released to the public we've been
 
00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
approached by um a number of members of
 
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
the regulated community and have met
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
with them at their request to address
 
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
their concerns and comments and some of
 
00:09:03.949 --> 00:09:03.959 align:start position:0%
those concerns and comments that we
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
heard surprised us a little um they were
 
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
relative to sighting requirements and
 
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
the impact of those um on facility
 
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
expansion and facility sighting um and
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
about the the practicability of those
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
and and what that might do to the
 
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
universe of sites that maybe could be
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
used to to site a landfill or or to or
 
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
to expand an existing landfill um there
 
00:09:25.949 --> 00:09:25.959 align:start position:0%
were concerns expressed significant
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
concerns expressed about the
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
constructibility of some of the uh
 
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
design and construction changes that we
 
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
were proposing and and whether they were
 
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
even just feasible to construct or or
 
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
even advisable and whether they provided
 
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
a measure of uh of a
 
00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
um added protection that was worth the
 
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
risk of of actually having difficulty
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
constructing them in the field um there
 
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
were also some concerns expressed um
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
about both short and long-term Financial
 
00:09:58.990 --> 00:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
impact of some of the provisions some of
 
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
which which were were U proposed were
 
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
suggested to be very significant on a
 
00:10:07.069 --> 00:10:07.079 align:start position:0%
level that would um threaten uh the
 
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
operation or or at least at the very
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
least the the affordability of tipping
 
00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
fees that might be associated with
 
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
landfilling and so we've been listening
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
to those um and we continue to review
 
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:20.200 align:start position:0%
that we um there some of those are
 
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
aligned with what we heard at the
 
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
council at the waste management Council
 
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
a number of them are and so we uh
 
00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
anticipate that we're going to be
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
modifying the draft um to try to address
 
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
some of those concerns and what we've
 
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
suggested is that the waste Council
 
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
which is scheduled to have its next
 
00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:39.399 align:start position:0%
monthly meeting on February 15th that we
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
would come before the council at that
 
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959 align:start position:0%
meeting to um not do a full sort of
 
00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:46.639 align:start position:0%
proposal or presentation on the whole
 
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
rules but maybe to focus and talk about
 
00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:51.079 align:start position:0%
changes that we made since the 18th of
 
00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:53.240 align:start position:0%
January so we expect that'll be an
 
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
important um uh you know time with the
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
council and then following that in order
 
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:01.240 align:start position:0%
to stay on schedule we anticipate that
 
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
we would uh then be filing the initial
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
proposal for the rules which of course
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
kicks off the formal rulemaking process
 
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
um by the end of February to keep us on
 
00:11:13.949 --> 00:11:13.959 align:start position:0%
schedule for um going through that
 
00:11:16.829 --> 00:11:16.839 align:start position:0%
process to get to a final proposal
 
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
before July 1 um and I I would remind
 
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
everyone that again all of this is sort
 
00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
of extracurricular if you will it's no
 
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
less important because the result of
 
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
that but none of this process other than
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
us going before the council is
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily required but I think it's
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
been a very important process we're
 
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
really glad that we have engaged the
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
public um on this as we as we worked on
 
00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:42.519 align:start position:0%
these very important rules and um once
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
we file our initial proposal then of
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
course uh the the formal process which
 
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
is set out in the law uh will be that we
 
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
will um schedule a public hearing for
 
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
those rules and then typically that
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
would be followed by uh three or four
 
00:11:59.269 --> 00:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
week public comment period so so folks
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
will have an opportunity to provide oral
 
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
comments or submit and written testimony
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
at the public hearing and then there'll
 
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
be an opportunity for further written
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
comments to be submitted during that
 
00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:10.279 align:start position:0%
comment period and then once that is all
 
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
received we would review all that um
 
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
make any changes that we thought were
 
00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
appropriate based on the comments
 
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
received and then proceed to a final
 
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
proposal probably around May or early
 
00:12:23.069 --> 00:12:23.079 align:start position:0%
June so that's a nutshell of where we're
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
at um with respect to this Ru making and
 
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
we're happy to entertain questions that
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
just the what what's been the flavor of
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
the comments you've gotten back in terms
 
00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:40.629 align:start position:0%
the comments you've gotten back in terms
of

00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:12:43.389 --> 00:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
uh who is who is responding is it mostly
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
corporate is it private citizens is it
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
noos nonprofits um well who's who's been
 
00:12:51.629 --> 00:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
engaged sure in in the early going you
 
00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
know during these you know going all the
 
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
way back to March we you know we've had
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
a listening session in March and then
 
00:12:59.110 --> 00:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
another one in August with a follow by a
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
common period and then this one in
 
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
October into November that's been a
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
broad mix of both um the regulated
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
Community the and the public at large
 
00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
and and legislators um but since we
 
00:13:15.069 --> 00:13:15.079 align:start position:0%
propos since we file U presented our our
 
00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
draft proposal to the Council on January
 
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
18th most of the feedback we've been
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
hearing has come from the regulated
 
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
Community which you know obviously is in
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
a position to look at these and really
 
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
understand specifically with with those
 
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
in hand understand how they might impact
 
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
their facility or their plans to expand
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
their facility and um and and put that
 
00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
in the context of the existing facility
 
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:40.120 align:start position:0%
to see how it might change their
 
00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:42.519 align:start position:0%
operations their plans for the future or
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
their costs for operating so we've been
 
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
hearing from those folks primarily since
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
January 18th okay representative Murray
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair um thanks for
 
00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question when you say
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
regulatory committee are you talking
 
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
state federal are you talking a mixture
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
of both oh no I'm sorry when i' say the
 
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
regulatory the regulated Community I not
 
00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:04.839 align:start position:0%
regulatory but regulated Community those
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's the industry that's the the
 
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
landfill operators the the waste
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
management companies
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
sure representative
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
Jana thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
both for being here and thank you for
 
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question and and it's related
 
00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
to this kind of you know thinking about
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
how the draft changes and the different
 
00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:26.759 align:start position:0%
iterations and trying to understand why
 
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
uh changes are are made and and i' admit
 
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
I get a little nervous when I get this
 
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
sense that the regulated Community is
 
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
has what seems to be kind of privileged
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
access to shaping that process or at
 
00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:45.079 align:start position:0%
least has more weight in the development
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
of those policies than uh people who are
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
affected in the community who aren't reg
 
00:14:53.389 --> 00:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
you know part of these regulated
 
00:14:55.749 --> 00:14:55.759 align:start position:0%
entities but so one of the things I'm
 
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
hoping is eventually when the next draft
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
kind of comes through if there's a way
 
00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately we could have some type of
 
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
tracked changes or if we could have some
 
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
type of detailed discussion about what
 
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
has changed and why and and one example
 
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
I'll give which I wanted to ask about
 
00:15:16.269 --> 00:15:16.279 align:start position:0%
this morning has to do with changes
 
00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
between the October draft and the the
 
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
January draft regarding the hydraulic
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
conductivity um so that I see that there
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
has been a new
 
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh the H insertion of a reference to
 
00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
hydraulic conductivity in
 
00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:37.720 align:start position:0%
804 believe it's
 
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
80402 if I have that correct uh yeah
 
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
80402 C I think um and that's new right
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
and that that refers specifically to
 
00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
undisturbed in sit2 sites right so
 
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
you're talking about what the conditions
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
have to be um of the site before any
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
preparation work is done so I appreciate
 
00:15:58.309 --> 00:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
that something has been inserted there
 
00:15:59.309 --> 00:15:59.319 align:start position:0%
even though though I have a question
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
about that I see between the October
 
00:16:07.389 --> 00:16:07.399 align:start position:0%
draft and the January draft in section
 
00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
80503 the the existing rules right now
 
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
have a hydraulic conductivity rate of
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
one time 10
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
the4th the October draft enhanced that
 
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
protection to 1 time 10
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
theg5 the most recent draft changed that
 
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
back to 1 time 10 fourth and this is
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
where my concern about the regulated
 
00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
community and their ability to shape the
 
00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:34.839 align:start position:0%
process comes in so we had a
 
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:37.160 align:start position:0%
strengthening of 10
 
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
times of that hydraulic conductivity
 
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
rate in
 
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
805 right after the the site has been
 
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
prepared and then it was taken back to
 
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
to 1 time 10 the4 so could you share
 
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
with us kind of how that process
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
happened because it seemed to me that we
 
00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
were moving in a more protective
 
00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
Direction 1 time 10 the 5th is main
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
standard as I understand it and then
 
00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:03.959 align:start position:0%
between October and January where there
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
has been discussions as you said with
 
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
kind of regulated groups it has now been
 
00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
taken back to 1 time 10 to the4 it's a
 
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
weakening by 10 times so could you kind
 
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
of talk us through um you know what kind
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
of input that you got that led you to
 
00:17:20.669 --> 00:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
decide that it wasn't worth
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
strengthening the
 
00:17:24.909 --> 00:17:24.919 align:start position:0%
standard sure so I I think this is a
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
complex area that still we're still
 
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
hearing a lot about this and um I think
 
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of it goes to the issue of the
 
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
heterogeneity of the geology in New
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's a concern you know the
 
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
regulated Community is um they're
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
regulated so they read rules very
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
carefully and they they understand that
 
00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:42.799 align:start position:0%
they're going to be held to those rules
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
so they they they tend to kind of look
 
00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
at it and say okay in the worst case
 
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
scenario how could this upset my my
 
00:17:51.789 --> 00:17:51.799 align:start position:0%
situation my facility and they've looked
 
00:17:53.789 --> 00:17:53.799 align:start position:0%
at their existing facilities and express
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
concerns that you know maybe the the
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
overarching soil quality if you look at
 
00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
it on a macro scale would meet that
 
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
standard but they know that there may be
 
00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
places within the formation where if
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
they drill a well in one location and do
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
a hydraulic conductivity test it's not
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
going to meet that standard and so
 
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:14.440 align:start position:0%
they've expressed concerns about that
 
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
and we're we're struggling with that
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
right now we're trying to look at that
 
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
um and figure out how to write the rule
 
00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
and how to essentially what I would say
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
is what we're trying to do our goal all
 
00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
along here has been to develop rules
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
that are protective of human health in
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
the environment
 
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
um while ensuring that facilities you
 
00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
know can that that can provide adequate
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
needed and affordable Waste Management
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
Services and capacity for the state's
 
00:18:40.149 --> 00:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
waste can actually be cited constructed
 
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
and operated right and that's a delicate
 
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
balance right because if we you know it
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
would be easy to say well the soils have
 
00:18:47.789 --> 00:18:47.799 align:start position:0%
to all be
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
clay but then the reality is we don't
 
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
have places like that and if we did they
 
00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:53.240 align:start position:0%
might not be geotechnically suitable to
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
site and and construct a landfill or we
 
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
could say we're not going to worry about
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
it and then you'd have something
 
00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
something that's maybe cited on you know
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
a very permeable material with a lot of
 
00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:04.360 align:start position:0%
cobbles and void spaces that would move
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
contaminants very quickly so we have to
 
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
figure out where in the middle of that
 
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
um gives us the level of protection that
 
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
we really want and desire while also not
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
eliminating all the sites or creating a
 
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
situation where the way we write the
 
00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:19.799 align:start position:0%
rule makes it really uncertain about
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
whether a facility can demonstrate that
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%
compliance with the rule so this is an
 
00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:26.039 align:start position:0%
area that still is in in play here I
 
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
think um and and we're working on um I I
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
will tell you the industry read these
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
rules and felt like we were trying to
 
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
put them out of business and then the
 
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
public or or other members who are
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
concerned more about the protective side
 
00:19:39.789 --> 00:19:39.799 align:start position:0%
look at it and say well the agency's
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
just meeting with the a with the
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
regulated community and going to give
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
them whatever they want so we're in the
 
00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:46.919 align:start position:0%
middle of that and what we're trying to
 
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
do is make sure what I just said to you
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
is really what we're trying to do I've
 
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
told that to the industry because they
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
looked at these rules and said well
 
00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
you're just trying to eliminate all of
 
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
our facilities because what they said is
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
that none of the facilities we're
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
operating right now would ever be cited
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
if these rules were in place and if
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
these rules were in place um none of our
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
facilities would be able to be expanded
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
so we took that seriously because we
 
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
have an overarching role here to make
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
sure we you know the statute tells us
 
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
we're to implement a solid waste
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
management program that provides for um
 
00:20:21.549 --> 00:20:21.559 align:start position:0%
safe and adequate capacity to manage
 
00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
waste in the state so we're just trying
 
00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
to balance all that and candidly that's
 
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
a really difficult thing right now in
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
these areas about the subgrade and and
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
the Institue soils conductivity we're
 
00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:33.919 align:start position:0%
really still those that's very much
 
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
something we're still working on but
 
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
that's what has brought us to that right
 
00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:38.440 align:start position:0%
that to be honest with you that was a
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
surprise we did not think we were going
 
00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:42.919 align:start position:0%
to hear that um and so we're evaluating
 
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
that information and and trying to
 
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:47.320 align:start position:0%
figure out what is a way to craft this
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
rule so that it we really do provide
 
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
that level of protection that we that we
 
00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
don't have facilities cited on really
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
inappropriate sites that are too
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
conductive but also leave enough
 
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
availability of sites in the state to
 
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
future uh so at some point could we get
 
00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
uh some information regarding I mean is
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
it true that none of our
 
00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
landfills would be able to meet that
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
requirement of 10 to the neg5 and you
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
know what evidence has there been
 
00:21:29.549 --> 00:21:29.559 align:start position:0%
presented that's what I'm wondering is
 
00:21:31.269 --> 00:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
is like how do we know that that's true
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
I understand that they told you that but
 
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
how do we and I understand that you were
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
doing your due diligence I'm not
 
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
questioning that but I'm wondering kind
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
of how we know that is our hydrogeology
 
00:21:41.269 --> 00:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
so vastly different for example from
 
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
Maine that they can site at 10 to the
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
neg5 and we can't and also do all of our
 
00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
landfills currently would they all fail
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
10 to the negative fth yeah I I mean
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
we're we have a lot of information about
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
these facilities and as we learn these
 
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
concerns we we're looking back through
 
00:21:59.269 --> 00:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
our records to understand that um I I
 
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
will say I don't really want to debate
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
Maine because I I I don't know enough
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
about their rules necessarily to do that
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
effectively and there they're a sister
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
State and I don't want to speak but I
 
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
would seriously doubt that the landfill
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
SED and operate in Maine right now meet
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
at 10 the minus standard I think that's
 
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
very unlikely all right thank you thank
 
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:27.149 --> 00:22:27.159 align:start position:0%
chair so I just wanted to go back to um
 
00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:30.799 align:start position:0%
what you were saying about meeting with
 
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
um I don't know stakeholders or whatever
 
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:35.240 align:start position:0%
during this time the public comment is
 
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
not open
 
00:22:39.789 --> 00:22:39.799 align:start position:0%
correct right we um we we have not
 
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
sought out any of these meetings members
 
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
of the regulated Community have
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
requested to meet with us to express
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
their concerns and as we do with any
 
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
member who does any member of the public
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
that does that we've we've we've granted
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
them a meeting and we've talked to them
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919 align:start position:0%
um but these are like xparte meetings
 
00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
where in a sense an industry while
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
you're working on rules could I mean I'd
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
like to know exactly who you've had
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
these meetings
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
with like a list of everybody that's
 
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
come and had meetings with you when
 
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
we're underneath writing rules and these
 
00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:18.799 align:start position:0%
rules can affect these industries so to
 
00:23:20.909 --> 00:23:20.919 align:start position:0%
me just to go back piggyback on our
 
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
representative gerana I don't understand
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
how we have something that's protective
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
and then we dial it back this is not the
 
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
only section in here from October um to
 
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
January where you've weakened things so
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
the October 23 draft for example um it
 
00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
had in here a 24 year old federal law
 
00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
that was that you guys were lered to um
 
00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
it was line F on page six at the bottom
 
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
now it's completely removed you
 
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
completely remove new Ms wlfs subject to
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
the requirements of section 503 of the
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
wendle 8 H Ford Aviation investment D
 
00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
reform it's completely gone and it says
 
00:24:06.029 --> 00:24:06.039 align:start position:0%
here shall not be cited within six miles
 
00:24:08.669 --> 00:24:08.679 align:start position:0%
of certain smaller public airports da d
 
00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:11.320 align:start position:0%
d so that's federal law that's now been
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
taken out like I don't understand why
 
00:24:16.269 --> 00:24:16.279 align:start position:0%
would why we're we're dialing things
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
back and then you tell us that you're
 
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:20.039 align:start position:0%
having expart meetings when there's no
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
public comment okay yeah so there's a
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
lot to unpack there so the first issue
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
about the aviation and I don't remember
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
exactly how it worked but that is still
 
00:24:30.389 --> 00:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
in place there's when we write rules
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
there are ways that certain provisions
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
of existing state law or state rules or
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
federal law or rules are invoked and I
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
can assure you that still applies um
 
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:41.240 align:start position:0%
it's just what the fact that it may have
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
been taken out of a section or
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
referenced in a different way doesn't
 
00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
mean that we're not observing that so
 
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
and if you want details on that I'm not
 
00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:49.720 align:start position:0%
prepared to give them to you right now
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
but I can I can get those for you um
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
with respect to meetings that we've had
 
00:24:59.470 --> 00:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
um that that is is any member of the
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
public who wishes to meet with us about
 
00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:04.039 align:start position:0%
the rules can request a meeting and
 
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
these folks have done that uh to answer
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
your question uh The Operators owners
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
and operators of three landfill
 
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
facilities have requested to meet with
 
00:25:15.149 --> 00:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
us the turnkey facility that's operated
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
by Waste Management the betham facility
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
that's operated by cassella and the
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
anders gagen Valley Regional Refuge
 
00:25:24.669 --> 00:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
disposal District facility mon carbury
 
00:25:27.149 --> 00:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
in Success New Hampshire all of those
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
members of reg Community um have
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
requested to meet with us and have
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
expressed concerns about a number of the
 
00:25:36.389 --> 00:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
provisions of the rules and I will say
 
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
that um you know over the years as we we
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
we regulate a lot of different we have a
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
lot of different regulated communities
 
00:25:46.269 --> 00:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
and when we do rules we do talk with
 
00:25:48.029 --> 00:25:48.039 align:start position:0%
them and we need to because I can assure
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
you if we didn't talk with them um about
 
00:25:53.669 --> 00:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
the rules we would make huge mistakes in
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
our Ru making and there are examples of
 
00:25:58.389 --> 00:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
that and um when we don't speak with
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
them and we plow ahead with something we
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
think is absolutely fine and appropriate
 
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
we often learn it has unintended
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
consequences or impacts that we could
 
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
not foresee and um so it's both
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate and helpful for us to speak
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
with the regulated Community when we
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
were working on rules particularly rule
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
sets that are as complex as these rules
 
00:26:20.909 --> 00:26:20.919 align:start position:0%
and have you know there's a lot of
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
moving parts to how these rules are
 
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
implemented and even with we have
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
excellent Engineers who were do such
 
00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:27.919 align:start position:0%
great work and whove worked really hard
 
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
on these rules but they're not in a
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
position to anticipate every impact of
 
00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
every rule that they propose and that's
 
00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
why we need to hear from the regulated
 
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
Community about
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
that so to to be clear have you denied a
 
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
meeting with anyone else that has come
 
00:26:47.389 --> 00:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
to of course no we would we would never
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
do that so you you
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
have met with everyone that asked for a
 
00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
meeting anyone who's asked to meet with
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
us about the rules we've granted them a
 
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins thank
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for taking my question
 
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
so your job is a difficult one as you
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
say you're kind of in the middle and our
 
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
job I think as I understand it is clear
 
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:19.240 align:start position:0%
that we have to represent the public we
 
00:27:22.269 --> 00:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
recognize that we want industry in our
 
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
state um we want the needs of the public
 
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
to be met by the industry that provide
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
that but I'm not a scientist so I can't
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
um debate the conductivity of the soil
 
00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
with you but I do recognize that we're
 
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
getting an application for a new
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
landfill that hasn't been done in I
 
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
don't know 30 years long
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.549 align:start position:0%
 
industry

00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:55.559 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
has not Millions but a billion dollars
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
to put behind the advocacy that they're
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
making and so from my point of view I
 
00:28:12.269 --> 00:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
want to be sure that as I represent the
 
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
citizens that we're giving the kind of
 
00:28:18.269 --> 00:28:18.279 align:start position:0%
advocacy that they
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
expect and that the industry which has
 
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
those Hired Guns if you
 
00:28:28.669 --> 00:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
will to come before you and make their
 
00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:31.880 align:start position:0%
case don't outweigh the protection of
 
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
the public that I'm supposed to be
 
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:38.200 align:start position:0%
serving so so that's my dilemma and I
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
think what representative ger
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
highlighted is the kind of thing that
 
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
makes me nervous if we're going
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
backwards in protection then I don't
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
feel like we're doing our job or I'm
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
doing my job so you know we need
 
00:29:01.389 --> 00:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
this independent entity this um person
 
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
who's not a consultant for the industry
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
to weigh in on these
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
hydrological numbers so that I can we
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
can have the confidence as we represent
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
the public that the other there
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be another side I mean we
 
00:29:22.669 --> 00:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
should all be on the same side but that
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
again since protection I believe in
 
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
representing the public is my goal
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
that we have the kind of information
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
that we can then have that fair
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
conversation about the 10 times
 
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
backwards for protection um so that's
 
00:29:42.269 --> 00:29:42.279 align:start position:0%
what concerns me and I don't have an
 
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
answer to it but I do think that I would
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
be more confident if we had that
 
00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:50.200 align:start position:0%
independent entity that was not
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
Consulting for the
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
industry and maybe meet with that person
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
and have that conversation
 
00:30:00.269 --> 00:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
although not a scientist I think I could
 
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
you know keep up fairly well because
 
00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.350 align:start position:0%
you know keep up fairly well because
they

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
represent the new information that we
 
00:30:11.789 --> 00:30:11.799 align:start position:0%
have we know so much more now and I want
 
00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:14.039 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that
 
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
knowledge is into the ru making by those
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
that don't have a vested
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.590 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
represent Jamal thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
so I one of the questions I have as I
 
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned before I I appreciate I like
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
the fact that you've you've uh put in
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
specific hydraulic conductivity uh of
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
the undisturbed site so that seems to me
 
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
a really sensible and and I think good
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
protective measure in addition to then
 
00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
uh a more a stricter conductivity
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
requirement when it comes to the site
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
once it's been developed so could you
 
00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:00.799 align:start position:0%
talk talk a little bit about how you
 
00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:04.919 align:start position:0%
determine what that uh what that
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
Criterion is for the
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
undisturbed site uh just because this is
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
a new part of the rules and you can
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but it's not in
 
00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:16.360 align:start position:0%
that that's that Criterion is not in
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
current rules so it is new if I'm not
 
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
mistaken but could you talk to me about
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
how it's determined what say the
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
undisturbed Criterion is um
 
00:31:30.509 --> 00:31:30.519 align:start position:0%
yeah how that's arrived at sure I mean I
 
00:31:32.509 --> 00:31:32.519 align:start position:0%
think it's a balancing act in the sense
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
that um you know ideally to be as
 
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
protective as possible we want the least
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
conductive soils um but then and so we
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
would go to presumably somewhere where
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
the soils were the least conductive but
 
00:31:48.269 --> 00:31:48.279 align:start position:0%
still geotechnically capable of
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
supporting a landfill um that's probably
 
00:31:53.629 --> 00:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
at a place where we wouldn't have sites
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
that would meet those criteria so we
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
arrived in our in our proposal
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
at um 10us 3 um that in in very broad
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
terms if you go to a hydrogeology
 
00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:06.559 align:start position:0%
textbook that represents sort of the
 
00:32:08.909 --> 00:32:08.919 align:start position:0%
average hydraulic cond conductivity of a
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
fine sand all right which clearly would
 
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
be geot technically stable but would
 
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
also you know not be as conductive as a
 
00:32:17.789 --> 00:32:17.799 align:start position:0%
coarse sand or a sand with or a material
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
with much larger um Aggregates in it um
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
so what what we are hearing is that that
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
while that may be indeed the conditions
 
00:32:29.549 --> 00:32:29.559 align:start position:0%
we have under portions of a lot of our
 
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
landfills it's by no means uniform it's
 
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
not there in that condition everywhere
 
00:32:37.149 --> 00:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
you look under the landfill everywhere
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
in the formation and so the concerns
 
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
that had been expressed had been well
 
00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
you know we're not sure we can meet that
 
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
and and what happens if we go in and we
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
do 10 borings and one of the borings all
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
nine of them meet the standard but one
 
00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:51.559 align:start position:0%
of them doesn't meet the standard it's
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
more it's it's it's a it's more like a
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
coarse sand and and does that mean that
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
the whole s is off and that's what we're
 
00:32:59.710 --> 00:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
hearing from folks who are concerned
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
about the proposed rule so we're as I
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
said that's something we're still
 
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
considering we're trying to sort out um
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
how we can craft that rule to ensure
 
00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
that we still bias the system towards
 
00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
very you know less less conductive soils
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
um while not eliminating so much uh of
 
00:33:20.909 --> 00:33:20.919 align:start position:0%
Avail potential available land and one
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
of the candid problems here is that the
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
Practical aspects of citing a landfill
 
00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
are that typically they tend to get
 
00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
cited in um in in the past um in Old
 
00:33:33.789 --> 00:33:33.799 align:start position:0%
played out Gravel Pit areas so you've
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
got areas and there are a lot of reasons
 
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
for that one is that um it takes a lot
 
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
of aggregate to build and operate a
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
landfill so every day that a landfill is
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
operating there's daily cover that's
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
needed there's construction that's going
 
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
on in the cell so having gra sand and
 
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
gravel deposits nearby are helpful for
 
00:33:52.669 --> 00:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
you know operating a landfill making it
 
00:33:54.629 --> 00:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
practicable otherwise you've got massive
 
00:33:57.149 --> 00:33:57.159 align:start position:0%
amounts of truck traffic hauling in
 
00:33:59.470 --> 00:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
aggregate from elsewhere whereas most
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
landfill operators you most landfills we
 
00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
have that operation is happening on the
 
00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:07.480 align:start position:0%
site so that's a practical consideration
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
um the other issue is that um in these
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
old played out pits typically maybe more
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
coar materials have been mined and there
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
are finer materials beneath them that
 
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
that were either not economically um uh
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
you know attractive to mine um and and
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
so the the pit stops operating
 
00:34:29.869 --> 00:34:29.879 align:start position:0%
or you know obviously when you know in
 
00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:31.879 align:start position:0%
the worst case scenario a pit gets mined
 
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
down to the groundwater table right and
 
00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:36.599 align:start position:0%
then they stop then um so so there are a
 
00:34:39.149 --> 00:34:39.159 align:start position:0%
lot of practical reasons why landfills
 
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
are cited um in those kinds of settings
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
um but those have you know uh
 
00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
considerations too they may well be
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
located near surface waters they may be
 
00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
located near more porest materials so
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
it's really a balancing act of trying to
 
00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:56.919 align:start position:0%
figure out what are these appropriate
 
00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
sites and also idea is if you're going
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
to site a landfill it can't be on a two
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
Acre Site right it's got to be a fairly
 
00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
big site we're in a you know our state
 
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
has seen development over the years so
 
00:35:10.589 --> 00:35:10.599 align:start position:0%
there are fewer and fewer large Parcels
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
of land that might be good candidates
 
00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:13.710 align:start position:0%
of land that might be good candidates
for

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:13.720 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
landfill construction sighting or or
 
00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
expansion so there's all that that gets
 
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
that gets factored in there so it's a
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
difficult dance to try to figure out how
 
00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
do we make sure that any expansions or
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
new sightings of landfills are cited on
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
relatively low conductivity soils while
 
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
still making available some portfolio of
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
sites that could be used for that into
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
the future because we we look at that
 
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
and understand that landfilling although
 
00:35:43.829 --> 00:35:43.839 align:start position:0%
we'd like to see it be a less prominent
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
role in our overall integrated system of
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
solid waste management for a number of
 
00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
waste it's likely to still be the
 
00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
technology that's used for decades ahead
 
00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
and we need to make sure that we're not
 
00:35:57.790 --> 00:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
creating a rule structure or a real
 
00:35:59.710 --> 00:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
Paradigm that makes it impossible to
 
00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.990 align:start position:0%
Paradigm that makes it impossible to
cite

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
cite
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
those thank you thank you Mr chair um
 
00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:05.560 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question so if I'm
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
hearing you correctly what you are
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
hearing from the regulated Community is
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
a concern potentially about a single
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
potential data point among a group that
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
may or may not be uh considered a
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
statistical outlier in a group of other
 
00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
data is that what I'm understanding that
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
that was part of their expressed
 
00:36:26.079 --> 00:36:33.550 align:start position:0%
that was part of their expressed
concerns

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
chair I think something that was said is
 
00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
sticking in my craw and that is I think
 
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
the applicant should have to
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
prove when they say they couldn't site a
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
landfill with that rule I would like to
 
00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:56.200 align:start position:0%
see the evidence I would think this
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
committee should see the evidence in
 
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
print that they can prove that with the
 
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
numbers that we had previously that a
 
00:37:10.349 --> 00:37:10.359 align:start position:0%
landfill could not be
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
cited thank
 
00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.150 align:start position:0%
cited thank
you

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:37:19.309 --> 00:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
so that makes sense to me and um but I
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to to clarify something that I so
 
00:37:26.349 --> 00:37:26.359 align:start position:0%
we started with one number I think it
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
was 10 to minus three and then we went
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
to 10 into minus5 but we started with 10
 
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
to minus three in the old rules is
 
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
that can you explain how we got to 10 to
 
00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.150 align:start position:0%
that can you explain how we got to 10 to
minus

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
minus
 
00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
three I ask J Jamie Colby is um a
 
00:37:44.109 --> 00:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
student of chomping at the bit there to
 
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely put me back in my place my
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
talk thank
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
you good morning for the record my name
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
is Jamie kby I'm supervisor of
 
00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
engineering permitting in the solid
 
00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
waste management Bureau at Dees um with
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
regards to the hydraulic conductivity
 
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
just be cautious there's a little bit of
 
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
confl it sounds to me like we're
 
00:38:11.109 --> 00:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
conflating the sighting requirements
 
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
with the design requirements 804 is
 
00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
about landfill sighting and that's where
 
00:38:18.309 --> 00:38:18.319 align:start position:0%
you see the 10 the minus 3 805 is about
 
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:20.680 align:start position:0%
landfill design and that's where you see
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
the 10 Theus 4 or 10 Theus 5 so the 10
 
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
Theus 4 or the 10us 5 would be material
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
that they bring in to build a a stable
 
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
Foundation layer on top of the insitu
 
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
soils the 10 the minus three is what's
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
there naturally um what is in situ when
 
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
you go to choose a site great so I just
 
00:38:46.589 --> 00:38:46.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
that talking to someone that actually
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
knows is
 
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
helpful thank
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
you that is there yes represent a
 
00:38:56.079 --> 00:38:57.750 align:start position:0%
you that is there yes represent a
potential

00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
so just a couple statements first 80% uh
 
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
86% of the state's underlay is Clay so I
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
just wanted that to be clear based upon
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
some other comments that was talked
 
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
about but Mount carbury right now as I
 
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
know passes actually every test in any
 
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
draft of the rules that are for Main and
 
00:39:20.109 --> 00:39:20.119 align:start position:0%
10 to the minus 3
 
00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
criteria for the natural site actually
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
is a hundred times weaker than Maine
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
currently so I think that's really
 
00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
important since we're taking more than
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
50% of aate trash why do we want to be
 
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
the state that is weaker that has less
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
restrictions I don't than all of the
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
other surrounding ones when we would
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
like to not be 50% of out of state trash
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
here and I want to go back to um I would
 
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:52.280 align:start position:0%
like like a tracked version of all of
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
the private meetings that have taken
 
00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:55.960 align:start position:0%
place while this is while this whole
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
process is has been going on so um that
 
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
the you know in the essence of
 
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
transparency that the agency puts that
 
00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
out all of the private meetings we
 
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
haven't had a landfill application in 30
 
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
years and we're working on rules and if
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
we're writing rules that could help
 
00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:14.839 align:start position:0%
someone that wants to build a landfill
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
ridiculous representive Jam thank you Mr
 
00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:32.079 align:start position:0%
chairman uh and so to come back and I
 
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate the clarification thank you
 
00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:36.079 align:start position:0%
very much about get I as a totally you
 
00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
know not a scientist and that's an un
 
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
gross understatement trying to
 
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
understand uh the process thinking about
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
the undisturbed site so this is the site
 
00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
as you find it right and then the
 
00:40:50.589 --> 00:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
prepared or engineered site and and in
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
the current draft 1 time 10 the3rd for
 
00:40:57.069 --> 00:40:57.079 align:start position:0%
the undisturbed site as you find it
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
right and 1 time 104 for the engineered
 
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
site right and there's again the October
 
00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
draft had that at 10 to the neg 5th and
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
it's been brought back so my question
 
00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:11.079 align:start position:0%
also has to do
 
00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
with and this is a genuine question
 
00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
based on lack of understanding of a lot
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
of these things why we wouldn't want the
 
00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
the natural site to to be say 10 to the
 
00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.270 align:start position:0%
the natural site to to be say 10 to the
ne4th

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
ne4th
 
00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:25.400 align:start position:0%
because it would seem to me that we're
 
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
talking about these landfills which we
 
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
have to have and we have to site
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
properly that we should only be looking
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
for the safest sites in the state to do
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
that so this idea that it's going to be
 
00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
10 to the neg3 but we're going to bring
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
it up through Engineering also kind of
 
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
raises questions to me about what
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
happens if we have leaks or if we have
 
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
malfunctions uh there's some type of
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
malfunction in in the engineering work
 
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
that's done but if we're talking about
 
00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
the the sites where we're going to put a
 
00:41:56.309 --> 00:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
landfill it would seem to me that almost
 
00:41:59.309 --> 00:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
by definition we should be looking for
 
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
the very
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
safest uh places in the state to do that
 
00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
based on what is currently there so I'm
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
a little bit confused about why we would
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
even have this kind of process where
 
00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
we're saying well the conditions can
 
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
don't have to be ideal on the natural
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
site but we'll kind of engineer it up to
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
a point where we think it's safe it
 
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that the site itself
 
00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.630 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that the site itself
should

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
already meet those conditions and then
 
00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:29.079 align:start position:0%
you provide engineering that that
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
provides the extra levels of safety that
 
00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
that we need to have so I don't know if
 
00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
anyone can kind of talk me through that
 
00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
I mean why would we why would we do that
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
instead of just demanding that the site
 
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
as it
 
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
stands meets the standards we want it to
 
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
meet well the sighting criteria are
 
00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
essentially that that you need to meet
 
00:42:51.069 --> 00:42:51.079 align:start position:0%
whatever they may be in the end you need
 
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
to meet those sighting criteria and I I
 
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
think as we've discussed here this
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
morning um
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
in a perfect world we just say it has to
 
00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
be the tightest soils on the planet and
 
00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:01.720 align:start position:0%
that's the only place you can build a
 
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
landfill but in practicality that would
 
00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:07.480 align:start position:0%
eliminate all the sites so our job is to
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
figure out you know what what
 
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
provides efficient and effective level
 
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
of protection from from the standpoint
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
of sighting criteria that still leaves
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
some land available for development of
 
00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
landfills and that's not an easy thing
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
but that's essentially what we're
 
00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
struggling with right now I
 
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
um let me representative Murray one
 
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
second sure represent
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
Murray I'll yield to the member because
 
00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
my question might not be a thank you
 
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
very much I I would just suggest that
 
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not talking about finding the
 
00:43:44.109 --> 00:43:44.119 align:start position:0%
most ideal circumstances uh conditions
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
on the planet but I am saying that we
 
00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
should be only citing these in the most
 
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
ideal conditions that exist in the
 
00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
state we would agree with
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
that okay represent Marine thank you Mr
 
00:43:59.069 --> 00:43:59.079 align:start position:0%
chair um and while we're at it I guess
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
in in speaking to the potential uh
 
00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
desire to see track changes within the
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
document as well I think that I that's
 
00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:07.880 align:start position:0%
another yes from me um between the
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
proposed one in October and January a
 
00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
question I did have was um some while
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
back we had did have a discussion in one
 
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
of the 800 sections about uh
 
00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
notification in the event of a failure
 
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
or a leak and there was a discussion
 
00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
around who gets notified and when um and
 
00:44:26.109 --> 00:44:26.119 align:start position:0%
I think most of the discussion if I
 
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
remember correctly was around uh the
 
00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
actual um it was onsite notification the
 
00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
emergency system and I was we we had
 
00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
asked a question several meetings ago
 
00:44:40.589 --> 00:44:40.599 align:start position:0%
about whether or not there is a
 
00:44:43.549 --> 00:44:43.559 align:start position:0%
coordinated uh Municipal communication
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
in the event of a failure or a leak or
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
any anything like that and I just wanted
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
to follow up with you all as to where
 
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
that had
 
00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
gone where that goes I'm sure discussion
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
do remember that were we talking about
 
00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
scada at the time I think so yeah um I
 
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
know that we took it I'm sorry leam
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
McKenna um administrator of the Sol was
 
00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
management Bureau I know that we took
 
00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:11.720 align:start position:0%
that down and I have to say I don't
 
00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
remember where it's gone but it doesn't
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
mean that it's gone forever I know I
 
00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:16.839 align:start position:0%
have it here um so I think what we're
 
00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:19.240 align:start position:0%
going to go is is look back to make sure
 
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
that we were um addressing the concerns
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
of making sure that uh a larger audience
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
was notified was that that was that was
 
00:45:28.349 --> 00:45:28.359 align:start position:0%
a gist okay got it that was my request
 
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
and I just I like I said in looking
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
through them I just did not see that so
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
if it's there great if not so many
 
00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
moving Parts I'm gonna I'm gonna I'll
 
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
I'll make a note again just to make sure
 
00:45:40.589 --> 00:45:40.599 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
you yeah Miss McKenzie if you could just
 
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
prenza so I'd like to understand what
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
the easiest way is to because you know I
 
00:46:00.549 --> 00:46:00.559 align:start position:0%
have this document um all marked up with
 
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
you know comparing from October to
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
present to what we have and in questions
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
and um you know some of these things we
 
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
want to go back to what it was in
 
00:46:13.589 --> 00:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
October so what is the best way for this
 
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
committee here to provide that
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
information um like there's some things
 
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
that you know some word changes that
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
were significant for example on page
 
00:46:27.309 --> 00:46:27.319 align:start position:0%
three it says here um undisturbed inside
 
00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
soils beneath the footprint so if
 
00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
leak the footprint is completely moot by
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
definition so and of course you know
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
there can be spills that are outside the
 
00:46:41.309 --> 00:46:41.319 align:start position:0%
footprint any time so there's just some
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
things that were maybe I don't know why
 
00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
they were changed but that just don't
 
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
make sense and we want to go back to how
 
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
they were so how do we how do we make
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
that happen same thing with this
 
00:46:56.549 --> 00:46:56.559 align:start position:0%
discussion of 10 to the3 to the four
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
five whatever how do we how do we put
 
00:47:02.589 --> 00:47:02.599 align:start position:0%
our resources together and provide to
 
00:47:04.589 --> 00:47:04.599 align:start position:0%
you where we would like things to go
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
back to how they were and give other
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
suggestions what's the best way to work
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
together on this well and I think you
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
know obviously the committee is is
 
00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
autonomous and makes its own decisions
 
00:47:15.309 --> 00:47:15.319 align:start position:0%
the committee as a whole or individual
 
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
members of the committee are certainly
 
00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:20.200 align:start position:0%
at Liberty and invited to provide um
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
ideally in order to make sure that we
 
00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
really understand your comment and and
 
00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
and can try to address it written
 
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
comments or written notes about that and
 
00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:30.520 align:start position:0%
that's something that you know it we
 
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
we've got a which I think is great an
 
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
ongoing dialogue with this subcommittee
 
00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:36.280 align:start position:0%
which you know which we'll continue to
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
have at it at the committee's pleasure
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
um and you know I think maybe
 
00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:42.839 align:start position:0%
practically speaking based on what I
 
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
talked about earlier where we do intend
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
to go back to the waste management
 
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
Council um at their February 15th
 
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
meeting um we will likely have uh you
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
know completed a lot of our work and
 
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
made some decisions about changing that
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
extent we want to make changes that we
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
would make you know we could plan to
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
come back to this subcommittee and and
 
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
give an update on that after that
 
00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
happens if that's helpful um and then of
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
course you know again that that would
 
00:48:11.309 --> 00:48:11.319 align:start position:0%
just mean that um we'd still be in the
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
process of getting an initial proposal
 
00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:15.400 align:start position:0%
filed so the formal rulemaking process
 
00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
you know either if it's right after the
 
00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
15th may not have even started yet or
 
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:21.640 align:start position:0%
you know we in order to stay on schedule
 
00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:23.720 align:start position:0%
here I think we will be filing our
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
initial Proposal with the officer
 
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
legislative Services um by uh the end of
 
00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
February that's our schedule right now
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
but certainly any any the committee as a
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
whole if it chose or any committee
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
members certainly at Liberty and invited
 
00:48:39.069 --> 00:48:39.079 align:start position:0%
and encouraged to provide their written
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
comments to the agency and would you
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
recommend that before you filed or after
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
you filed early and often s
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
wmb rules that's going to be the the the
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
main pipeline right to get to um you
 
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
know the rule writers to have all those
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
things gathered in writing that would be
 
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:07.079 align:start position:0%
the most helpful so thank you for asking
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
the question yeah I'll have that we'll
 
00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
work together and get that to you right
 
00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
away okay um any other questions
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
followup so I got a couple of takeaways
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
on this um first of
 
00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
all uh if you could
 
00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
provide um through myself to the
 
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
committee the track change
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
that the difference between the first
 
00:49:37.549 --> 00:49:37.559 align:start position:0%
one and the second you know what the
 
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
changes have
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
been uh since the I mean prior to the 18
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
January um and then prior to the next
 
00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
meeting if you could give us that what
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
changes have been made so so just so I'm
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
clear so it's it's $2 documents then
 
00:49:58.990 --> 00:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a track changes document of
 
00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
what was changed from the what we put
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
out in October 18th for comment to what
 
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
we filed correct um with the waste
 
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
management Council on the 18th yeah um
 
00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:13.030 align:start position:0%
management Council on the 18th yeah um
and

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
then prospectively ATT track changes
 
00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:18.559 align:start position:0%
from what we filed on the 18th to what
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
we would present to the counc is that
 
00:50:23.549 --> 00:50:23.559 align:start position:0%
feasible on the 15th I I'm getting I'm
 
00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
getting a cross-eyed look so what's
 
00:50:25.119 --> 00:50:26.349 align:start position:0%
getting a cross-eyed look so what's
feasible

00:50:26.349 --> 00:50:26.359 align:start position:0%
feasible
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
I think so but I'm not sure I'm not
 
00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
positive that we would have the October
 
00:50:32.789 --> 00:50:32.799 align:start position:0%
to January 18th I'm certain we would
 
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
have it Forward we're gonna have to look
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
honestly let give us a moment and from
 
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
committee members is that if they take a
 
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
look and give us what they can give us
 
00:50:44.829 --> 00:50:44.839 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:50:46.789 --> 00:50:46.799 align:start position:0%
reasonable yeah and going forward I
 
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
think it should always be that way if we
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
have to try CH okay uh and the second
 
00:50:54.789 --> 00:50:54.799 align:start position:0%
thing is the request for a list of
 
00:50:54.799 --> 00:50:56.789 align:start position:0%
thing is the request for a list of
meetings

00:50:56.789 --> 00:50:56.799 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:00.200 align:start position:0%
um who who you know who we met with and
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
date and then I will look for a meeting
 
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
sometime between 15 February and the 1
 
00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
of March does that make sense committee
 
00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:17.480 align:start position:0%
members does that make
 
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
sense okay um and
 
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
then you know how it is when you get old
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
well I guess you don't know how it is
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
when you get old the so cobwebs Dustin
 
00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
off when I was
 
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
a sophomore at West Point I took a class
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
called garbage that's what we call it I
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
I also took sewers I took but anyway
 
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
garbage was a waste management I was
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
environmental engineer major um who
 
00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:49.240 align:start position:0%
would ever thought that 45 years later
 
00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
I'd be sitting in a committee talking
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
about garbage um but the the cobwebs
 
00:51:59.309 --> 00:51:59.319 align:start position:0%
dusted off this morning were that
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh we didn't in that class and there
 
00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
were like eight of us we didn't
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
understand until we actually went to a
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
waste facility and so what I would
 
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
propose is that we set up a a discussion
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
at a waste treatment
 
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
facility and we could figure out the
 
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
details on that but then you know to to
 
00:52:26.109 --> 00:52:26.119 align:start position:0%
meet there and
 
00:52:27.789 --> 00:52:27.799 align:start position:0%
go come on in lady if you can just sit
 
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
and back that's fine
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
um I think we would get a much better
 
00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
understanding of the process and the
 
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
system yes ma'am thank you Mr chair um I
 
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
think I am the only person who has tour
 
00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
a Waste Management Facility so I would
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
be open to the members I think I yes it
 
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
was in a different lifetime but yes I I
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
think it would be insightful um for
 
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
those folks if they have not is there
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
any OB objecting to that uh
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative Davis you you good Penza
 
00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:02.510 align:start position:0%
representative Davis you you good Penza
I've

00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
I've
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
already okay a great idea all right okay
 
00:53:08.349 --> 00:53:08.359 align:start position:0%
so I I'll look at setting that up and
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
then we'll if you guys can meet us there
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
and just sort of get into the more
 
00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
concrete understand of what we're
 
00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:16.670 align:start position:0%
concrete understand of what we're
talking

00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
talking
 
00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
about we'd certainly be happy to to are
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
you suggesting that there also would be
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
a meeting of the committee I I guess it
 
00:53:25.789 --> 00:53:25.799 align:start position:0%
is a meeting if you're there but but um
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
or or just an actual tour of the
 
00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
facility I think just a tour of the
 
00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
facility just to deepen our
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
understanding of what physically is
 
00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
going on sure on the ground I I think
 
00:53:35.309 --> 00:53:35.319 align:start position:0%
that's a terrific idea and we'd be more
 
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
than happy to participate if the
 
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
committee would like us to okay and from
 
00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
a timing perspective I was thinking
 
00:53:42.349 --> 00:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
after the next committee meeting
 
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
sometime in March okay great do that
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
does that make sense to everyone yeah is
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
that Dragon Mr chair it would be noticed
 
00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
still as a meeting even though it's a
 
00:53:55.789 --> 00:53:55.799 align:start position:0%
meeting of the sub tour because have to
 
00:53:58.430 --> 00:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
it right oh absolutely yeah gotcha we
 
00:53:59.789 --> 00:53:59.799 align:start position:0%
just need to figure out the details and
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
get on a
 
00:54:04.349 --> 00:54:04.359 align:start position:0%
counter okay and and just to uh be clear
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
is that a meeting that this committee
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
will organize or are you asking the
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
agency to organize that no I think we
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
can organize it but I would ask that a
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
representative from from your office be
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
there absolutely to um you know to
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
participate sure happy to do that okay
 
00:54:24.589 --> 00:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr I have to say in
 
00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
another life time I worked at one of
 
00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
these facilities
 
00:54:31.309 --> 00:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
so I mean and that was you know before
 
00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
even these rules were written so it was
 
00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:35.480 align:start position:0%
a while ago uh but the other thing that
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
that I would like if possible for for a
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
future discussion is uh what and I'm not
 
00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:45.160 align:start position:0%
sure you know what you can provide in
 
00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
this regard but again some sense of you
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
know what percentage of the
 
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
state can or would be excluded by the
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
the stricter rules rules I mean we were
 
00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
602 and uh I'm trying to remember the
 
00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:01.960 align:start position:0%
other one
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
56 thank you uh somebody gave us a map
 
00:55:07.789 --> 00:55:07.799 align:start position:0%
and you know it was I think it was the
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
the US Geological Survey right and we
 
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
talked about how that's not it was a
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
place to kind of be begin a discussion
 
00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
roughly but any event if it's possible
 
00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
because this is one of the concerns
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
you've heard a lot of US Express is that
 
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh you know we understand I certainly
 
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
understand the need to meet with the
 
00:55:25.789 --> 00:55:25.799 align:start position:0%
people who operate these businesses but
 
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
I also want to have some kind of meat on
 
00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:32.839 align:start position:0%
the bones I I I want to see evidence
 
00:55:34.829 --> 00:55:34.839 align:start position:0%
that this claim that they're not going
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
to be able to site a landfill anywhere
 
00:55:41.029 --> 00:55:41.039 align:start position:0%
in the state is valid uh if it is it is
 
00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:43.480 align:start position:0%
but there has to be data if we're going
 
00:55:46.789 --> 00:55:46.799 align:start position:0%
to take that claim at face value so any
 
00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
information that we could get regarding
 
00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
you know what percentage of the state at
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
least roughly would be excluded by the
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:00.680 align:start position:0%
draft we'll do what we can to try to
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
answer that question I mean the state is
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
not mapped at a granularity that allows
 
00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
us that makes that easy to do it's uh
 
00:56:10.589 --> 00:56:10.599 align:start position:0%
when you I mean if that were the case
 
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
then then folks would you know have a
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
whole list of sites they knew they could
 
00:56:16.109 --> 00:56:16.119 align:start position:0%
site a landfill and the reality is you
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
don't really know whether you can site a
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
landfill somewhere until you go to that
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
site and you do some hydrogeological
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
testing in in in place in the field so I
 
00:56:27.069 --> 00:56:27.079 align:start position:0%
I will we'll do our best to see what we
 
00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:28.799 align:start position:0%
can provide for that but I I want to
 
00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
manage expectations on that because I
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
think that's going to be a tall order
 
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
understandable but I you know they're
 
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
making these claims I'm assume based on
 
00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
something so I understand that we don't
 
00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
have that data
 
00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
but I'm assuming that their claim is
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
based on some
 
00:56:47.789 --> 00:56:47.799 align:start position:0%
data so I I would appreciate that yeah
 
00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair yes ma'am may I it's
 
00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
the applicants and the industries
 
00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility to provide that data we
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
don't have to do it you don't have to do
 
00:57:02.829 --> 00:57:02.839 align:start position:0%
it they should do it and do it to our
 
00:57:05.109 --> 00:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
satisfaction because they're making the
 
00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:07.839 align:start position:0%
claim seems simple to
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
me thank
 
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you and representative
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
Penza and I'll put this in the document
 
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
that we're GNA provide but I think I'm
 
00:57:20.589 --> 00:57:20.599 align:start position:0%
just going to read this right from here
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
so based upon um um what representative
 
00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
paskins just sent so the applicant shall
 
00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
hire an independent Hydro geologist this
 
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
came from uh hp56 right at the
 
00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
applicant's expense to estimate based
 
00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:37.960 align:start position:0%
upon adequate and and representative
 
00:57:39.549 --> 00:57:39.559 align:start position:0%
on-site field testing the seepage
 
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
velocity of groundwater in both uh
 
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
surface surficial geological deposits
 
00:57:48.069 --> 00:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
and in Bedrock the maximum seepage
 
00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:49.880 align:start position:0%
velocity shall be the highest rate
 
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
estimated for any test site in disposal
 
00:57:55.789 --> 00:57:55.799 align:start position:0%
area the applicant shall hire an
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
independent Hydro Hy
 
00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologist at the applicant's
 
00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
expense that's that's what that really
 
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
needs to be in these rules here okay but
 
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
that's different than surveying the
 
00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
entire State of New Hampshire to know
 
00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
exactly what's below each square foot
 
00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's for a very specific
 
00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
defined site that's not the entire State
 
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
so understand that's what it says I
 
00:58:26.829 --> 00:58:26.839 align:start position:0%
agree with it but it's not contextual to
 
00:58:29.549 --> 00:58:29.559 align:start position:0%
what representative J was asking it's
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
not the same thing I understand okay um
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
so we got our do outs are there any
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
challenges and please as you go through
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
um working with us to get this
 
00:58:44.029 --> 00:58:44.039 align:start position:0%
information appreciate open lines of
 
00:58:44.039 --> 00:58:45.670 align:start position:0%
information appreciate open lines of
communication

00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
communication
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you thank you all right
 
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh subject to any other questions this

our engineering and permitting section
 
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
in the solid waste management Bureau and
 
01:07:30.910 --> 01:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
Jamie oor who uh is a hydrogeologist in
 
01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
our haard waste remediation Bureau who
 
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
focuses on um landfill monitoring and um
 
01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
uh groundwater release detection and
 
01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
groundwater management permits for
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
landfills and I just really wanted to

to present about New Hampshire's
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
landfill monitoring requirements for the
 
01:08:18.789 --> 01:08:18.799 align:start position:0%
record my name is Jamie kby and I am
 
01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the engineering and
 
01:08:22.189 --> 01:08:22.199 align:start position:0%

01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
management Bureau at Dees
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
for a quick orientation most of us are
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
aware that there are six operating
 
01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
Municipal Solid Waste landfills or MSW
 
01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:34.600 align:start position:0%
landfills in New Hampshire in addition
 
01:08:36.430 --> 01:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
there's one operating single lined
 
01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
colash landfill and two unline landfills
 
01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
that accept construction demolition
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
debris and bulky waste this slide shows
 
01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
the six Active mssw landfills kind of
 
01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
spread around the
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
state there are also more than 200
 
01:08:52.669 --> 01:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
clothes some of which are lined but most
 
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
of which are unlined
 
01:08:57.870 --> 01:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
effectively almost every municipality
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
has a
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
landfill line landfills and many of the
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
online landfills have not one but two
 
01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
permits a solid waste permit and a
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
groundwater permit I'm going to spend a
 
01:09:12.510 --> 01:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
few minutes talking about landfill
 
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
monitoring required under the solid
 
01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
waste permit and then my colleague Jamie
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
oor will discuss the monitoring
 
01:09:19.749 --> 01:09:19.759 align:start position:0%
requirements under a landfill's
 
01:09:19.759 --> 01:09:21.990 align:start position:0%
requirements under a landfill's
groundwater

01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
groundwater
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
permit as a quick refresher when we
 
01:09:27.070 --> 01:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
discuss whether a line a landfill is
 
01:09:29.070 --> 01:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
lined or unlined we're talking about the
 
01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
design of the landfill some landfills
 
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
have no liners that is there are unlined
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
landfills some landfills have a single
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
liner for example one geomembrane or
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
engineered plastic sheet along with
 
01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
other materials that sit between the
 
01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
waste and above the ground
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
surface a double Line Landfill has two
 
01:09:52.749 --> 01:09:52.759 align:start position:0%
of these geomembrane Lin liners with
 
01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
other materials as shown in the
 
01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
simplified sketch on the slide in a
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
double lined landfill the space between
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
each liner is typically referred to as a
 
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
lee8 collection system or layer the lee8
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
collection system at a landfill is
 
01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
monitored in multiple ways first there
 
01:10:13.950 --> 01:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
is the physical element regarding the
 
01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
quantities of leech eight the amount of
 
01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
leech eight standing on the primary
 
01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
liner is typically measured and recorded
 
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
daily the quantity of leech a collected
 
01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
and trans reported offsite is measured
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
and recorded daily and lee8 flow rates
 
01:10:31.149 --> 01:10:31.159 align:start position:0%
in the secondary collection system are
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
measured and recorded at least once per
 
01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
week then there are the analytical
 
01:10:39.229 --> 01:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
characteristics of leech eight lee8 from
 
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
the primary collection system is
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
analyzed three times per year for
 
01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
contaminant concentrations and leate
 
01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
from the secondary collection system is
 
01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
analyzed once per year for contaminant
 
01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
concentrations the data collected from
 
01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
from the lee8 systems helps us look for
 
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
issues with the Integrity of the liner
 
01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
systems for example elevated flows in
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
the secondary leic collection system May
 
01:11:08.669 --> 01:11:08.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
liner let's follow the leap for a
 
01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
moment recall that when a liquid passes
 
01:11:18.189 --> 01:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
through a landfill's waste Mass it
 
01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
leeches or extracts chemicals or
 
01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
constituents from waste as these waste
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
break down
 
01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
along with pasas these can include
 
01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
organic compounds heavy metals chlorides
 
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
and nitrates leachate is a liquid
 
01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
including any suspended components in
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
the liquid which is contacted or passed
 
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
through solid waste in short leate is
 
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
the byproduct of the landfilling
 
01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
process as such the concentrations of
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
contaminants in leate are based on what
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
types and amounts of waste are placed in
 
01:11:54.189 --> 01:11:54.199 align:start position:0%
a landfill and while the analytical
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
characteristics of leech a are tested
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
there are no standards against which to
 
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
compare the results of the leech a tests
 
01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
the first point at which lee8
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
characteristics might be compared to a
 
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
standard is that a lee8 receiving
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
facility that is a wastewater treatment
 
01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
plant wastewater treatment plant
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
operators ensure that the Wastewater
 
01:12:19.629 --> 01:12:19.639 align:start position:0%
entering the facility in this case lee8
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
can be properly managed in accordance
 
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
with the design limitations of the plant
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
and be treated to meet the plant's
 
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
discharge permit limits if the
 
01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
concentrations of contaminants in lee8
 
01:12:32.629 --> 01:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
exceed the treatment plants acceptance
 
01:12:34.990 --> 01:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
criteria the responsibility falls back
 
01:12:36.669 --> 01:12:36.679 align:start position:0%
on the landfill permit to find a
 
01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant that can
 
01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
accept the leachate or to treat the
 
01:12:43.229 --> 01:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
leech eight at the landfill before
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
facility now let's head back to the
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
landfill for a minute it's important to
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
note that there are other ways of in
 
01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
which we monitor landfills for example
 
01:12:59.149 --> 01:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
gas probes are located around a landfill
 
01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
in the soil similar to groundwater
 
01:13:03.390 --> 01:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
monitoring Wells these probes are
 
01:13:06.189 --> 01:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
checked quarterly for landfill gas if
 
01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
landfill gas is migrating through the
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
ground and into these probes this might
 
01:13:12.189 --> 01:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
indicate a problem with the landfill's
 
01:13:14.229 --> 01:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
gas collection system or with the
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
landfill's liner
 
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
system and after a landfill is closed
 
01:13:21.669 --> 01:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
these monitoring programs continue
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
leachate flow rates analytical
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
characteristics and quantities continue
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
to be measured and recorded monitoring
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
is still performed to check for landfill
 
01:13:32.110 --> 01:13:32.120 align:start position:0%
gas migration and the landfill undergo
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
semiannual inspections to check the
 
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
Integrity of the capping system and
 
01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:38.679 align:start position:0%
other components of the landfill
 
01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
system I think it's important to pause
 
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
here for a moment to consider recall
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
that landfills are engineered waste
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
containment systems they are designed by
 
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
and construction is overseen by licensed
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
Professional Engineers and at least
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
least once per year if not more often
 
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
the monitoring data is reviewed by
 
01:14:00.030 --> 01:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
licensed professionals including de's
 
01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
licensed professionals when issues or
 
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
irregularities come up in the monitoring
 
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
data these qualified licensed
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
professionals review and discuss and
 
01:14:12.669 --> 01:14:12.679 align:start position:0%
work to identify and resolve the issue
 
01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to actually stop
 
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
here and turn it over to my colleague
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
Jamie oor who is himself a licensed
 
01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
professional geologist and who will be
 
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:31.470 --> 01:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Jamie for the record my name
 
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
is James oor I'm a supervisor of the
 
01:14:35.550 --> 01:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
groundwater permitting and Remediation
 
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
subsection and the Hazardous Waste
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
remediation Bureau within the waste
 
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
management division obviously our group
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
has the responsibility of overseeing
 
01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
groundwater permitting at landfills as
 
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
my colleague discussed there are two
 
01:14:49.870 --> 01:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
basic landfill construction types in New
 
01:14:52.629 --> 01:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lined and unlined with each of
 
01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
those comes specific groundwater
 
01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
monitoring permit that is associated
 
01:14:59.229 --> 01:14:59.239 align:start position:0%
with it online landfills will have
 
01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
groundwater management permits
 
01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
associated with them those are landfills
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
without a liner beneath the waist lined
 
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
landfills active and closed would have
 
01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
groundwater release detection permits
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
associated with them now there are some
 
01:15:15.149 --> 01:15:15.159 align:start position:0%
facilities in the state that have both
 
01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
permits combined into one in fact three
 
01:15:19.629 --> 01:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
out of the operating six landfills in
 
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have both combined
 
01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
groundwater release detection and ground

01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
permits there are a lot of commonalities
 
01:15:31.229 --> 01:15:31.239 align:start position:0%
between the two permit types each permit

01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
groundwater remediation as outlined
 
01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
within the permit structure they'll
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
specify performance standards for those
 
01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
remedies and describe procedures for
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
performing site investigations and
 
01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
implementing any necessary corrective
 
01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
actions just for reference uh these
 
01:15:55.390 --> 01:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
permits aren't necessarily exclusive to
 
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
landfills in fact there have been
 
01:15:59.390 --> 01:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
thousands of sites administered by Dees
 
01:16:01.149 --> 01:16:01.159 align:start position:0%

specifics groundwater management permits
 
01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
will designate groundwater management
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
zones areas where contaminate
 
01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:17.840 align:start position:0%

01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
and as such are required to be monitored
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
regularly a groundwater management
 
01:16:29.550 --> 01:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
permit controls the use of groundwater
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
within a groundwater management Zone if
 
01:16:33.070 --> 01:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
there happens to be a water supply
 
01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
within that zone it would be regular
 
01:16:38.189 --> 01:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
regularly monitored to assure compliance
 
01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
with State
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
regulation the permit will also require
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
the implementation of measures to
 
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
restore groundwater quality within the
 
01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
groundwater management zone so that it
 
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
meets the criteria of EnV
 
01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:52.719 align:start position:0%

standard ards or
 
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
aqs it will also require the evaluation
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
of the effectiveness of any remedial
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
measures taken to restore that groundw
 
01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:04.480 align:start position:0%

described groundwater release detection
 
01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:37.800 align:start position:0%

what's called assessment monitoring

I'm sorry I forgot to advance that slide
 
01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
for release detection have to forgive
 
01:18:32.590 --> 01:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
me so back to some more
 
01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
commonalities um each groundwater permit
 
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
type will require monitoring for
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
compliance at various locations around
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
the landfill that'll include monitoring
 
01:18:43.470 --> 01:18:43.480 align:start position:0%
Wells that are specifically designed and
 
01:18:46.270 --> 01:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
located to monitor the facilities at at
 
01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
at around the landfill base if you will
 
01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me it also in include monitoring
 
01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
of water supply if they happen to be
 
01:18:55.790 --> 01:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
available groundwater
 
01:18:58.590 --> 01:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
seeps as well as surface water any
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
locations that might help inform the

conceptual site model the conceptual
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
site model is our basic understanding of
 
01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
the site how it relates to the the
 
01:19:09.709 --> 01:19:09.719 align:start position:0%
physical uh physical location around it
 
01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
it's geohydrology as
 
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
well the permit will have analytical
 
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
requirements for samples collected from
 
01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
these monitering points samples are
 
01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
required to be analyzed by certified
 
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
Laboratories the landfills are required
 
01:19:25.149 --> 01:19:25.159 align:start position:0%
to analyze for what are called landfill
 
01:19:27.709 --> 01:19:27.719 align:start position:0%
leate indicator parameters as my
 
01:19:30.149 --> 01:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
colleague discussed the liquid derived
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
from waste is considered leachate and it
 
01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
contains the breakdown components of the
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
waste so a broad spectrum of various
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
contaminants and compounds are available
 
01:19:43.149 --> 01:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
to be monitored for we call them
 
01:19:45.910 --> 01:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
landfill lee8 indicator parameters they
 
01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
can include compounds such as chloride
 
01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:49.550 align:start position:0%
can include compounds such as chloride
nitrate

01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
nitrate
 
01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:52.400 align:start position:0%

pce and
 
01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
tce recently we have been requiring
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
monitoring of contaminants of emerging
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
concern those items such as 14 dioxane
 
01:20:10.270 --> 01:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
and pasas or per and polyfloral
 
01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
substances pfoa and pfos these are
 
01:20:15.629 --> 01:20:15.639 align:start position:0%
compounds that have been in commercial
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
and Industrial use for over 50 to 60
 
01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps 70 years however until recently
 
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
we didn't know about them we didn't have
 
01:20:25.390 --> 01:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
the analytical ability to analyze for
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
them at low enough concentrations or
 
01:20:29.149 --> 01:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
perhaps we didn't have the awareness of
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
their toxical impacts additional
 
01:20:33.310 --> 01:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
requirements to monitor for these
 
01:20:35.790 --> 01:20:35.800 align:start position:0%
emerging contaminants have been added to
 
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
our groundwater permits within the last
 
01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.910 align:start position:0%
our groundwater permits within the last
seven

01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
seven
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
years for reference until recently a
 
01:20:44.910 --> 01:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
majority of the concentrations for
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
contaminants were measured in the parts
 
01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
per billion
 
01:20:51.390 --> 01:20:51.400 align:start position:0%
range now with these added contaminants
 
01:20:52.669 --> 01:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
of emerging concern we are measuring
 
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
meur in for concentrations in the parts
 
01:20:57.229 --> 01:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
per trillion range so a thousand times
 
01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
less just for reference from a spatial
 
01:21:01.709 --> 01:21:01.719 align:start position:0%
component and get your mind around it a
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
little bit a part per billion would be
 
01:21:05.870 --> 01:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
equal to one drop of ink in a 10,000
 
01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
gallon swimming pool so a good siiz
 
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
backyard swimming pool one part per
 
01:21:12.030 --> 01:21:12.040 align:start position:0%
trillion would be the equivalent of a
 
01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
drop within 20 olympic size swimming
 
01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
pools which are over 600,000 gallons so
 
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:20.719 align:start position:0%
an enormous difference between those
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
two the permits also require a require a
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
basic monitoring frequency how often the
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
site and locations and specific Wells
 
01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
are monitored for how often they monitor
 
01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
for the compound compounds we discussed
 
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
previously uh for a for a point of
 
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
reference the active Municipal Solid
 
01:21:40.189 --> 01:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
Waste landfills in New Hampshire are
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
sampled at least two if not three times
 
01:21:44.750 --> 01:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
a year they can also be sampled Beyond
 
01:21:48.229 --> 01:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
those as needed um within the release
 
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
detection monitoring rules you can have
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
accelerated monitoring like I discussed
 
01:21:51.639 --> 01:21:54.070 align:start position:0%

previously

01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
previously
 
01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
there are two basic submittal types
 
01:21:57.669 --> 01:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
within per groundw permits you have data
 
01:21:59.229 --> 01:21:59.239 align:start position:0%
transmittals that are essentially just
 
01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
that a submittal of the data with a
 
01:22:02.430 --> 01:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
little added extra couple of extra
 
01:22:05.229 --> 01:22:05.239 align:start position:0%
pieces they are due to be submitted to
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
us within 45 days of the sampling event
 
01:22:11.669 --> 01:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
there are also periodic summary reports
 
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
which are required by permit summary
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
reports provide an overview of the work
 
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
performed since the last time a summary
 
01:22:19.709 --> 01:22:19.719 align:start position:0%
report was submitted it would include a
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
description of the type and frequency of
 
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
monitoring and the activities associated
 
01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
with them and provide any updates to the
 
01:22:29.550 --> 01:22:29.560 align:start position:0%
conceptual site model it'll also include
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%

Historic data and in support of the
 
01:22:44.229 --> 01:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
conclusions and recommendations that the
 
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
consultant may have updated groundw flow
 
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
maps and any analytical results that
 
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
hadn't been previous submitted
 
01:22:51.669 --> 01:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
previously submitted would be included
 
01:22:53.709 --> 01:22:53.719 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
summary reports are required to be dated
 
01:22:57.870 --> 01:22:57.880 align:start position:0%

01:23:06.030 --> 01:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
Engineers also
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
included in sumary reports is the um
 
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me is a schedule for submitting
 
01:23:15.550 --> 01:23:15.560 align:start position:0%
those summary reports uh for instance
 
01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
active Municipal Solid Waste landfills
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
will sum will submit summary reports
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
annually an older online landfill that
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
maybe is monitored at a less frequent
 
01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
rate maybe maybe submits a summmer
 
01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:27.719 align:start position:0%
report every other year or maybe every
 
01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
third year depending on that conceptual
 
01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
site model we
 
01:23:34.189 --> 01:23:34.199 align:start position:0%
discussed as a point of reference when
 
01:23:36.430 --> 01:23:36.440 align:start position:0%
these submittal are transmitted to Dees
 
01:23:38.629 --> 01:23:38.639 align:start position:0%
they're reviewed by Dees staff that are
 
01:23:40.990 --> 01:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
assigned to these projects they are also
 
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
licensed professionals Dees responses to
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
any of these Subs would also be reviewed
 
01:23:48.430 --> 01:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
by at least one if not two more licensed
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
professional geologists or Professional
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
Engineers now lastly uh in relation to
 
01:23:58.390 --> 01:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
groundwater permits each permit type are
 
01:24:01.149 --> 01:24:01.159 align:start position:0%
in in effect for a 5-year period and are
 
01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
subject to Renewal if the permit expires
 
01:24:06.270 --> 01:24:06.280 align:start position:0%
prior to Renewal the permit continues to
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
be fully responsible for those
 
01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
conditions outlined within the permit
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
including monitoring reporting and any
 
01:24:13.149 --> 01:24:13.159 align:start position:0%
corrective actions that might be
 
01:24:13.159 --> 01:24:14.830 align:start position:0%
corrective actions that might be
outlined

01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
outlined
 
01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
within renewals for groundwater permits
 
01:24:19.390 --> 01:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
will also include many of the same
 
01:24:21.310 --> 01:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
elements of a summary report just
 
01:24:23.790 --> 01:24:23.800 align:start position:0%
expanded out over 5year period of time
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
and in comparison to Historic results
 
01:24:28.149 --> 01:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
those renewals are also prepared by
 
01:24:28.159 --> 01:24:30.110 align:start position:0%
those renewals are also prepared by
licensed

01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
professionals one common question we get
 
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
in regards to how long groundwater is
 
01:24:37.790 --> 01:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
being one common question we get is how
 
01:24:39.870 --> 01:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
long groundwater will be required to be
 
01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
sampled and monitored at
 
01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
landfills for landfills groundwater
 
01:24:46.189 --> 01:24:46.199 align:start position:0%
quality monitoring is required until the
 
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
waste mass is no longer a potential
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
source of contamination so there are
 
01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
essentially two ways for that to happen
 
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
happen one would be the landfill would
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
be dug up removed and disposed of
 
01:24:59.229 --> 01:24:59.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere else it actually has happened
 
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
um historically uh 20 years ago there
 
01:25:02.669 --> 01:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
were several landfills that were dug up
 
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
removed and disposed of Elsewhere has
 
01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
not happened recently um majority of the
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
municipal majority of the landfills in
 
01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are municipally owned and
 
01:25:12.669 --> 01:25:12.679 align:start position:0%
obviously they're not going to have the
 
01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
money to throw around for something like
 
01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
that the other Avenue for groundwater to
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
be ceased groundwater monitoring to be
 
01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
ceased at a landfill would be for the
 
01:25:24.910 --> 01:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
Pere to undertake an investigation to
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
show that the waste within the landfill
 
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
has completely broken down now that has
 
01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
not happened and reason being as we know
 
01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
it takes quite a while for Waste to
 
01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
break down sometimes hundreds if not
 
01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
thousands of years if you look at any of
 
01:25:40.629 --> 01:25:40.639 align:start position:0%
the science journals and see how long it
 
01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
takes plastic to break down it it takes
 
01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
an exceptionally long time so
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
essentially unless someone digs up a
 
01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
landfill and removes it groundwater
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
monitoring will exist at landf fills in
 
01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:52.910 align:start position:0%
monitoring will exist at landf fills in
perpetuity

01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
perpetuity
 
01:25:57.629 --> 01:25:57.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:00.149 --> 01:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
time wanted to thank you uh for the
 
01:26:01.629 --> 01:26:01.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity my apologies for not
 
01:26:03.149 --> 01:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
advancing slides I probably should have
 
01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
thrown the the laptop at my compatriot
 
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
here as I was speaking we can get you
 
01:26:09.510 --> 01:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
copies of these um obviously uh if
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
needed uh we are available for questions
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:18.430 --> 01:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much I appreciate
 
01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.709 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much I appreciate
that

01:26:19.709 --> 01:26:19.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:23.790 --> 01:26:23.800 align:start position:0%
um I I'm interested to know
 
01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me you talked about corrective
 
01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:27.750 align:start position:0%
excuse me you talked about corrective
action

01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
plans how many corrective action plans
 
01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
does the department have active
 
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
now and do those plans have any kind of
 
01:26:41.189 --> 01:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
deadlines associated with
 
01:26:43.830 --> 01:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
them that's a very good question um
 
01:26:46.350 --> 01:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
corrective action plans will come and go
 
01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
over time we have had historically some
 
01:26:51.390 --> 01:26:51.400 align:start position:0%
very significant corrective action plans
 
01:26:53.109 --> 01:26:53.119 align:start position:0%
um we have at at least one that I'm
 
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
aware of at one of the six landfills um
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
we've had some others that have
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
um perhaps just finished within the last
 
01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
couple years uh corrective action plan
 
01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
could be something small scale related
 
01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:09.400 align:start position:0%
to uh minor operational issue uh or it
 
01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:11.480 align:start position:0%
could be something larger scale that
 
01:27:13.709 --> 01:27:13.719 align:start position:0%
will incorporate both the monitoring
 
01:27:15.109 --> 01:27:15.119 align:start position:0%
that is undertaken as part of the
 
01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
groundwater permits but also will have
 
01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
relationship to the solid waste
 
01:27:21.310 --> 01:27:21.320 align:start position:0%
management bureau's execution uh at
 
01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
landfills as well well groundwater very
 
01:27:25.629 --> 01:27:25.639 align:start position:0%
much could be the first indicator of an
 
01:27:28.709 --> 01:27:28.719 align:start position:0%
issue at a site and so the assessment
 
01:27:30.990 --> 01:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
monitoring can help point to the issue
 
01:27:33.669 --> 01:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
if there is one if there is found out to
 
01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
be an issue by monitoring those landfill
 
01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
lee8 indicator parameters that broad
 
01:27:42.990 --> 01:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
swath um we may be able to point to uh
 
01:27:45.229 --> 01:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
the issue directly or we might have to
 
01:27:47.470 --> 01:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
cause and force more investigation of
 
01:27:49.390 --> 01:27:49.400 align:start position:0%
that through the corrective action plan
 
01:27:52.669 --> 01:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
process um sometimes it's very obvious
 
01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:54.280 align:start position:0%
as to what the issue is sometimes it
 
01:27:56.109 --> 01:27:56.119 align:start position:0%
takes a little bit of uh in-depth
 
01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
investigation and um we're lucky that we
 
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
work so closely with a solid waste
 
01:28:02.669 --> 01:28:02.679 align:start position:0%
management Bureau in that we sometimes
 
01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
are able to say hey we think we have an
 
01:28:07.629 --> 01:28:07.639 align:start position:0%
issue do you know anything so um but at
 
01:28:08.830 --> 01:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
this time I believe we only have one
 
01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:10.719 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan in
 
01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
place and and for when you're doing
 
01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:17.719 align:start position:0%
monitoring on these various
 
01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
sites who's actually doing the
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
monitoring is some of it being done
 
01:28:24.910 --> 01:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
third party uh some of it being done by
 
01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
the department some of it being done by
 
01:28:30.350 --> 01:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
the landfill operator who who's doing
 
01:28:31.990 --> 01:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
the monitoring that's an excellent
 
01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
question thank you U the monitoring
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
itself is being conducted by the
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
licensed professional that is hired by
 
01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
the perite so the perite is typically
 
01:28:44.709 --> 01:28:44.719 align:start position:0%
the landowner the landfill operator uh
 
01:28:47.070 --> 01:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
the licensed professional will do the
 
01:28:49.109 --> 01:28:49.119 align:start position:0%
monitoring and the sampling submit those
 
01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
results to us as part of those submittal
 
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
that I discussed we review those uh and
 
01:28:56.590 --> 01:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
consider their comments and
 
01:28:59.189 --> 01:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
recommendations um sampling is
 
01:29:03.070 --> 01:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
prescribed at a certain uh certain rate
 
01:29:06.669 --> 01:29:06.679 align:start position:0%
uh as I discussed um we typically don't
 
01:29:09.870 --> 01:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
do sampling of our own um as far as uh
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
General monitoring is concerned we do
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
have the ability at times uh if there is
 
01:29:16.510 --> 01:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
a a landfill that doesn't have a
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
responsibility responsible party
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
associated with it or a Pere associated
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:28.189 --> 01:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
um perhaps passed away if you will and
 
01:29:30.030 --> 01:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
so we have had the ability at times to
 
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
send out the MTB sampling team to be
 
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
able to look at Residential Water
 
01:29:35.669 --> 01:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
Supplies that might be a risk nearby but
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
it's a very rare situation that we have
 
01:29:40.629 --> 01:29:40.639 align:start position:0%
to do do do you as a department
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
recommend who
 
01:29:47.470 --> 01:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
the the parties are that are going to do
 
01:29:51.629 --> 01:29:51.639 align:start position:0%
you recommend to the um landfill owner
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
who would he use to do the testing or do
 
01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
you just let them pick whoever uh no we
 
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
we would essentially let them pick
 
01:30:03.950 --> 01:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
whomever um we do get questions from
 
01:30:06.910 --> 01:30:06.920 align:start position:0%
time to time as to you know uh maybe if
 
01:30:09.310 --> 01:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
it's a small online landfill run owned
 
01:30:11.149 --> 01:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
by a municipality and and they're trying
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
to look to change who might be doing
 
01:30:16.510 --> 01:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
their work for them they may ask us and
 
01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
we can recommend a long list of
 
01:30:20.910 --> 01:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
qualified Consultants but each of them
 
01:30:22.990 --> 01:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
need to be at least the folks who are
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
submitting those reports to us need to
 
01:30:27.070 --> 01:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
be licensed professional geologists or
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
Professional Engineers so we wouldn't
 
01:30:31.229 --> 01:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
specifically say who you should and
 
01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't use
 
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
no representative Murray thank you madam
 
01:30:38.470 --> 01:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
chair and just uh for clarification and
 
01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
followup those um individuals must be
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
licensed with the state of New Hampshire
 
01:30:44.350 --> 01:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
correct yes you are correct they need to
 
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
be New Hampshire licensed professional
 
01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:53.629 --> 01:30:53.639 align:start position:0%
Engineers represent dsy
 
01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
oh sfus first sorry I didn't see her um
 
01:30:59.390 --> 01:30:59.400 align:start position:0%
yes good morning um I would for the
 
01:31:02.109 --> 01:31:02.119 align:start position:0%
record like to have a copy of the slides
 
01:31:07.709 --> 01:31:07.719 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if you could speak to
 
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
um the condition of the C landfill I
 
01:31:13.790 --> 01:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
know it's kind of probably blindsiding
 
01:31:16.629 --> 01:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
you but this committee some five or six
 
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
years ago found the kok landfill to be
 
01:31:22.830 --> 01:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
an imminent Hazard as that legislation
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
went on it was killed but um there was a
 
01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:28.719 align:start position:0%
significant cancer cluster around the
 
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
COK landfill and I was just wondering if
 
01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
you could speak about
 
01:31:36.830 --> 01:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure if maybe the director
 
01:31:39.310 --> 01:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
can speak to the C landfill as it uh
 
01:31:43.149 --> 01:31:43.159 align:start position:0%
falls under a different program than
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
ours right for the record Mike wiat hire
 
01:31:49.149 --> 01:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
Dees thank you representative for that
 
01:31:51.870 --> 01:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
question so yes the the coka landfill is
 
01:31:54.189 --> 01:31:54.199 align:start position:0%
a um super fund npl site that we do
 
01:31:56.669 --> 01:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
manage under our federal sites program
 
01:31:58.709 --> 01:31:58.719 align:start position:0%
and actually very recently um at the end
 
01:32:01.109 --> 01:32:01.119 align:start position:0%
of this calendar past calendar year we
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
issued a report um that addresses those
 
01:32:05.109 --> 01:32:05.119 align:start position:0%
questions and and basically gives an
 
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
update to the work that's been going on
 
01:32:09.229 --> 01:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
to evaluate drinking water quality in
 
01:32:11.790 --> 01:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
the area and groundwater quality impacts
 
01:32:13.709 --> 01:32:13.719 align:start position:0%
of the facility so I would direct you to
 
01:32:16.189 --> 01:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
that and following this meeting um when
 
01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
I get back to the office I'll make sure
 
01:32:19.709 --> 01:32:19.719 align:start position:0%
that we send you a copy of that with
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
electronic copy of that represent Duty
 
01:32:26.030 --> 01:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:32:29.149 --> 01:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
um when we're talking about leate what
 
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
kind of quantities are we talking about
 
01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
and when you talk about a system for
 
01:32:37.870 --> 01:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
collecting it is it collected in pipes
 
01:32:40.990 --> 01:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
that were designed into the landfill um
 
01:32:43.470 --> 01:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
how does that whole system
 
01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
work thank you representative for the
 
01:32:47.629 --> 01:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
question um quantities I don't honestly
 
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
recall off top my head uh at a landfill
 
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
it can vary by year depends a lot on
 
01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
rainfall um and different factors you
 
01:32:57.870 --> 01:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
know it could be somewhere between two
 
01:32:59.790 --> 01:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
million gallons a year and five million
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
gallons a year depending on sizes that's
 
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
that's all ballpark um with regards to
 
01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
the lee8 management systems yes they do
 
01:33:10.830 --> 01:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
involve a lot of piping um so in the
 
01:33:13.470 --> 01:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
landfill liner system themselves there's
 
01:33:16.149 --> 01:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
a combination of piping and free
 
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
draining sand and some geosynthetic
 
01:33:22.149 --> 01:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
layers that encourage the flow of of the
 
01:33:24.149 --> 01:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
lee8 through the system so that it can
 
01:33:26.109 --> 01:33:26.119 align:start position:0%
be collected everything slopes down to a
 
01:33:29.430 --> 01:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
collection sump and then it's um pumped
 
01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
out of the bottom of the landfill up
 
01:33:34.229 --> 01:33:34.239 align:start position:0%
pipes to the ground surface where it
 
01:33:36.910 --> 01:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
enters additional piping systems and
 
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
then it moves into a tank storage system
 
01:33:43.229 --> 01:33:43.239 align:start position:0%
um or it could move more directly into
 
01:33:45.390 --> 01:33:45.400 align:start position:0%
pipes so in that go to a wastewater
 
01:33:47.669 --> 01:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
treatment facility half the landfills
 
01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
are directly piped to a wastewater
 
01:33:51.550 --> 01:33:51.560 align:start position:0%
treatment facility half of the six the
 
01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:53.560 align:start position:0%
the other half of the six have to truck
 
01:33:56.270 --> 01:33:56.280 align:start position:0%
um the leech eight if I remember it's
 
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
roughly that
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
split um so and those systems are
 
01:34:01.390 --> 01:34:01.400 align:start position:0%
designed they are required to be
 
01:34:03.229 --> 01:34:03.239 align:start position:0%
designed to be chemically compatible
 
01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
with leech 8 um try and get as much
 
01:34:07.070 --> 01:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
longevity as we can out of those
 
01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
engineered Lee collection and
 
01:34:08.719 --> 01:34:10.830 align:start position:0%
engineered Lee collection and
containment

01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
containment
 
01:34:13.950 --> 01:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
systems followup represent Murray uh
 
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um so while we're
 
01:34:18.109 --> 01:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
on the subject of uh lee8 uh I think you
 
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
showed a slide of of the lee8 the truck
 
01:34:22.669 --> 01:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
and then it going to a treatment
 
01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
facility but we also noted that there
 
01:34:27.550 --> 01:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
are some entities that have treatment on
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
site correct and then it gets treated on
 
01:34:32.229 --> 01:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
site and
 
01:34:35.229 --> 01:34:35.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps goes elsewhere afterward it does
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
it then go somewhere else on on the
 
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
track but to that point I guess I'm
 
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
asking is in the design
 
01:34:44.669 --> 01:34:44.679 align:start position:0%
criteria is that up to the individual um
 
01:34:47.070 --> 01:34:47.080 align:start position:0%
entity to decide whether or not they're
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
putting that sort of reverse osmosis
 
01:34:52.109 --> 01:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
system or leate treatment system on on
 
01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
site thank you for the question it's a
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
good question so there is one landfill
 
01:34:58.510 --> 01:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
in the state that has elected to treat
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
onsite their leech a and what what
 
01:35:02.910 --> 01:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
happens at their plant this is very
 
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
generalized um their on-site treatment
 
01:35:06.910 --> 01:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
plant the leech a comes in it it goes
 
01:35:09.390 --> 01:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
through a processing system part of it
 
01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
is piped to a wastewater treatment
 
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
facility nearby the other portion of it
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
is trucked to different wastewater
 
01:35:19.229 --> 01:35:19.239 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities so theirs is
 
01:35:21.109 --> 01:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
actually a split system in that in that
 
01:35:21.119 --> 01:35:22.510 align:start position:0%
actually a split system in that in that
manner

01:35:22.510 --> 01:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
manner
 
01:35:26.189 --> 01:35:26.199 align:start position:0%
um and in terms of those plants what's
 
01:35:28.590 --> 01:35:28.600 align:start position:0%
designed how they choose to treat that's
 
01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
that's the Peres Choice what they're
 
01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
trying to do is they're trying to meet
 
01:35:34.030 --> 01:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
the acceptance criteria for a wastewater
 
01:35:36.990 --> 01:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
treatment receiving
 
01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
facility representative Bixby yes thank
 
01:35:43.790 --> 01:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so
 
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
um what is so the lee8 goes to a
 
01:35:49.950 --> 01:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant except in the
 
01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
case of Rochester where it's
 
01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
pre-treated and then it goes to one but
 
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh what is the fate of the contaminants
 
01:35:57.990 --> 01:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:36:00.430 --> 01:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
leachate uh at the wastewater treatment
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
plant does it end up in biosolids is
 
01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
there a way to uh keep them ex um
 
01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
separated from the
 
01:36:11.310 --> 01:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
biosolids so I'm going to confess that's
 
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
not my area of expertise I'm not a
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
Wastewater expert um as a general matter
 
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
the the stream is mingled in with the
 
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
other Wastewater stream so leeche gets
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
mixed in with all the other waste Waters
 
01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
that come into the plant um and so it's
 
01:36:30.550 --> 01:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
not necessarily separately managed or
 
01:36:32.430 --> 01:36:32.440 align:start position:0%
processed at that plant so the
 
01:36:35.709 --> 01:36:35.719 align:start position:0%
contaminants would you
 
01:36:38.430 --> 01:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
know not my expertise some would be
 
01:36:41.109 --> 01:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
broken down into constituent Parts some
 
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
would end up in the biosolids or the
 
01:36:45.629 --> 01:36:45.639 align:start position:0%
sledges some might end up in the
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
discharge um at a lower level so
 
01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
so that if you know if you need need
 
01:36:53.229 --> 01:36:53.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up information we'd have to reach
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
out to the appropriate people at Dees
 
01:36:58.229 --> 01:36:58.239 align:start position:0%
for that on Wastewater plants just I
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
want to ask a question following that
 
01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:37:05.149 --> 01:37:05.159 align:start position:0%
in since you're you are monitoring the
 
01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
Lee hates and and what the the
 
01:37:10.590 --> 01:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
composition of the
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
leeat are you noticing any Trends um
 
01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
from site to site or site
 
01:37:21.510 --> 01:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
specific um are the different compounds
 
01:37:24.270 --> 01:37:24.280 align:start position:0%
certain compounds rising and others
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
going down um do you
 
01:37:33.550 --> 01:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
lee8 there can be Trends in the lee8
 
01:37:41.550 --> 01:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
um contaminant concentrations chemical
 
01:37:43.870 --> 01:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
constituents uh but
 
01:37:47.229 --> 01:37:47.239 align:start position:0%
we don't have that data compiled in a
 
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
fashion that trends like that that's
 
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
something that we're evaluating for
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
propos R change so that Trend analysis
 
01:37:56.830 --> 01:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have a lot compiled on trending
 
01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
one thing that we will see for example
 
01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
um goes back to what if there's an issue
 
01:38:04.750 --> 01:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
with the liner systems you know if
 
01:38:06.510 --> 01:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of dilution it means we
 
01:38:08.189 --> 01:38:08.199 align:start position:0%
might have a storm water problem storm
 
01:38:10.669 --> 01:38:10.679 align:start position:0%
water's getting into leech a system so
 
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
so there is we do keep an eye on what
 
01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
the concentrations are but we don't have
 
01:38:17.390 --> 01:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
it actually trended out like in a plot
 
01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:18.109 align:start position:0%
it actually trended out like in a plot
right

01:38:18.109 --> 01:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:38:22.189 --> 01:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
now so with and also as you're
 
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
monitoring the
 
01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
leeet what happens when you see some
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
exceedances for thresholds that you have
 
01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
for certain um certain contaminants in
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
there what do you do you have to do
 
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
anything different with that so there
 
01:38:40.109 --> 01:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
aren't again it goes back to that idea
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
that leech a is is simply a byproduct of
 
01:38:45.229 --> 01:38:45.239 align:start position:0%
the waste uh landfilling process so
 
01:38:46.990 --> 01:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
there's not a standard to compare it to
 
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
so there wouldn't be an exceedence of
 
01:38:52.270 --> 01:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
any particular standard
 
01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
um in in that context um you know the
 
01:38:58.830 --> 01:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
the landfill permites keep an eye on the
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
waste that they choose to dispose of in
 
01:39:02.669 --> 01:39:02.679 align:start position:0%
the landfill because they know it can
 
01:39:05.310 --> 01:39:05.320 align:start position:0%
have an effect on their leee quality and
 
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
then that could cause them difficulty
 
01:39:08.830 --> 01:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
successfully finding a wastewater
 
01:39:12.109 --> 01:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
treatment plant to take the material um
 
01:39:14.589 --> 01:39:14.599 align:start position:0%
but there's not a specific there's not a
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
standard to compare it
 
01:39:20.189 --> 01:39:20.199 align:start position:0%
against okay uh representative Bixby
 
01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so is a leech is the volume of the
 
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
leachate um largely um due to liquids
 
01:39:31.109 --> 01:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
that are in the disposed trash or is it
 
01:39:35.390 --> 01:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
due to uh a combination of that and
 
01:39:37.629 --> 01:39:37.639 align:start position:0%
precipitation yeah you know I don't have
 
01:39:39.709 --> 01:39:39.719 align:start position:0%
a specific breakdown regarding what
 
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
amount comes out of the waste itself and
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
what amounts from precipitation landfill
 
01:39:47.390 --> 01:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
permites are required to um operate the
 
01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
landfill in a manner that controls to
 
01:39:50.589 --> 01:39:50.599 align:start position:0%
the greatest extent practicable the
 
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
generation of leech eight so they are
 
01:39:54.830 --> 01:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
striving they cover the waist at the end
 
01:39:58.189 --> 01:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
of each operating day they they um put
 
01:39:59.790 --> 01:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
on interim cover in areas they're not
 
01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
going to work in for a while so they are
 
01:40:03.709 --> 01:40:03.719 align:start position:0%
trying to minim minimize the generation
 
01:40:06.070 --> 01:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
of leech a to the extent they can but I
 
01:40:08.470 --> 01:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
don't have a specific breakdown on how
 
01:40:10.229 --> 01:40:10.239 align:start position:0%
much is out of the waste itself and how
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
much might be from
 
01:40:16.189 --> 01:40:16.199 align:start position:0%
precipitation represent saitis and then
 
01:40:20.070 --> 01:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
represent Murray um I was just wondering
 
01:40:21.950 --> 01:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
um about the of
 
01:40:26.629 --> 01:40:26.639 align:start position:0%
biosolids um in um in relation to the
 
01:40:31.310 --> 01:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
forever chemicals pest um because I'm
 
01:40:33.990 --> 01:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that how much is going to
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
be put on agricultur land and so I was
 
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could share anything
 
01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:45.550 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could share anything
about

01:40:45.550 --> 01:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:47.950 --> 01:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
that um I appreciate the question
 
01:40:50.229 --> 01:40:50.239 align:start position:0%
representative the fate of biosolids is
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
really um um with our Wastewater program
 
01:40:54.910 --> 01:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
they deal with land application of
 
01:40:58.510 --> 01:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
biosolid agricultural use um under the
 
01:41:00.629 --> 01:41:00.639 align:start position:0%
under the regulations under the law
 
01:41:02.510 --> 01:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
biosolids or sledges from wastewater
 
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
treatment plants only become Solid Waste
 
01:41:06.669 --> 01:41:06.679 align:start position:0%
when they are disposed of at a solid
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
waste facility so if a landfill receives
 
01:41:12.189 --> 01:41:12.199 align:start position:0%
sludge it's a solid waste it gets
 
01:41:15.030 --> 01:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
disposed in the landfill um but sludges
 
01:41:17.629 --> 01:41:17.639 align:start position:0%
or biosolids that go to places other
 
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
than landfills or other than disposal
 
01:41:21.629 --> 01:41:21.639 align:start position:0%
would be something man managed by our
 
01:41:21.639 --> 01:41:23.270 align:start position:0%
would be something man managed by our
Wastewater

01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
Wastewater
 
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
program representive Murray thank you
 
01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair and I and I apologize for
 
01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:29.560 align:start position:0%
going back a little bit to leate but I
 
01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
did want to clarify one one thing if you
 
01:41:34.589 --> 01:41:34.599 align:start position:0%
could for me um it's my understanding
 
01:41:36.629 --> 01:41:36.639 align:start position:0%
that leate can be both in liquid form
 
01:41:39.229 --> 01:41:39.239 align:start position:0%
and solid form and like a l cake of some
 
01:41:43.870 --> 01:41:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:46.830 --> 01:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
that I hadn't quite heard that um it
 
01:41:48.910 --> 01:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
might be that some of the treatment
 
01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
processes you end up kind of if you're
 
01:41:52.510 --> 01:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
talking about a leech a cake it's
 
01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
probably more like a like a sludge is is
 
01:41:56.229 --> 01:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
what I'm leaning towards are solids that
 
01:41:58.830 --> 01:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
are pulled out of the lee8 um as it's
 
01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
treated I'm not overly familiar with
 
01:42:04.350 --> 01:42:04.360 align:start position:0%
with what you're talking about um but I
 
01:42:06.990 --> 01:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
would speculate that's kind of the the
 
01:42:08.229 --> 01:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
situation is when they go through
 
01:42:10.669 --> 01:42:10.679 align:start position:0%
certain treatment processes if they pull
 
01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
out those suspended solids that might
 
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
create a
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
cake represent
 
01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
Duty thank you madam chair so let me
 
01:42:23.550 --> 01:42:23.560 align:start position:0%
understand we have what three or four um
 
01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
privately owned landfills I think maybe
 
01:42:27.550 --> 01:42:27.560 align:start position:0%
the there's two landfills that are owned
 
01:42:30.830 --> 01:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
by municipalities maybe Nash Lebanon I
 
01:42:34.350 --> 01:42:34.360 align:start position:0%
think that's pretty close and it doesn't
 
01:42:36.030 --> 01:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
really matter but and and so if you're a
 
01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
private landfill
 
01:42:40.430 --> 01:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
50% in the state of New Hampshire comes
 
01:42:43.229 --> 01:42:43.239 align:start position:0%
from outof State uh it's it's outof
 
01:42:47.109 --> 01:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
state waste um and so this can contain p
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
and all all other kinds of um uh
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
waste products this goes into the
 
01:43:00.030 --> 01:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
lee8 and then a wastewater treatment
 
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
facility that is paid for by um
 
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayers kind of picks up the tab to
 
01:43:10.669 --> 01:43:10.679 align:start position:0%
take this water and I can't I mean and
 
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
and is it processed to the point that is
 
01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
pure enough to then I'm thinking about
 
01:43:17.870 --> 01:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
nashan going back in to the miramac
 
01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
river um I'm I'm just a little
 
01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
concerned and confused about um how
 
01:43:30.109 --> 01:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
clean this is you know when it gets to
 
01:43:33.589 --> 01:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
the um to the Wastewater facility and if
 
01:43:35.870 --> 01:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
if there's p in it and we know pasas is
 
01:43:38.709 --> 01:43:38.719 align:start position:0%
the forever chemical then the Wastewater
 
01:43:40.830 --> 01:43:40.840 align:start position:0%
system is not going to be able to treat
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
it then it's going to go into the
 
01:43:45.270 --> 01:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
miramac river I'm a little confused
 
01:43:48.109 --> 01:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
about that can you explain that to me
 
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
sure I can thank you representative I
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
can try and elaborate a little little
 
01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
bit um so there actually there are three
 
01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
public landfills or or sort of uh Mount
 
01:43:59.430 --> 01:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
carbury by the solid waste District NASA
 
01:44:01.750 --> 01:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
and Lebanon are the three public if you
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
will and then three private uh oh no
 
01:44:06.510 --> 01:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
there are four public sorry Conway is
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
also got a a public landfill so there
 
01:44:10.550 --> 01:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
are only two private landfills in New
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire privately owned um with
 
01:44:13.679 --> 01:44:16.189 align:start position:0%
Hampshire privately owned um with
regards

01:44:16.189 --> 01:44:16.199 align:start position:0%
regards
 
01:44:23.149 --> 01:44:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:25.589 --> 01:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
they have to manage what they receive as
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
waste streams I'm sure they charge a fee
 
01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
um per gallon it wouldn't surprise me at
 
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
all um I presume that's what happens
 
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
unless it's a municipal landfill and
 
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
then I'm sure they have some internal
 
01:44:39.189 --> 01:44:39.199 align:start position:0%
budgeting um so it's my understanding
 
01:44:41.070 --> 01:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
that they would you know private
 
01:44:42.669 --> 01:44:42.679 align:start position:0%
landfills would certainly pay for
 
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
disposal of leee just like we all pay
 
01:44:48.790 --> 01:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
for disposal our trash um and the waste
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
water treatment plant they have now
 
01:44:52.270 --> 01:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the Clean Water Act
 
01:44:54.350 --> 01:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
and their discharge permits into the
 
01:44:56.189 --> 01:44:56.199 align:start position:0%
river so they have to meet certain
 
01:44:59.629 --> 01:44:59.639 align:start position:0%
standards again not my expertise um but
 
01:45:01.750 --> 01:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to understand
 
01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
that and part of why I brought it up in
 
01:45:04.629 --> 01:45:04.639 align:start position:0%
the presentation it's important to
 
01:45:06.669 --> 01:45:06.679 align:start position:0%
understand that leeche goes to treatment
 
01:45:08.750 --> 01:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
plants it's treated at those plants and
 
01:45:11.709 --> 01:45:11.719 align:start position:0%
it has to meet a discharge limit out of
 
01:45:14.350 --> 01:45:14.360 align:start position:0%
those plants um those
 
01:45:17.629 --> 01:45:17.639 align:start position:0%
facilities so that's a Clean Water Act
 
01:45:20.550 --> 01:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
that's a different permit required um
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
and we've moved away from landfills at
 
01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:23.430 align:start position:0%
and we've moved away from landfills at
that

01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:29.910 --> 01:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:33.390 --> 01:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
Penza so could we get a um information
 
01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
from the agency of where um public
 
01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
private where all that lee8 is going so
 
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
when it leaves a landfill where where
 
01:45:45.229 --> 01:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
where it's being treated can we get that
 
01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
information uh I think we can yes they
 
01:45:49.870 --> 01:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
are supposed to report to us we can um
 
01:45:53.070 --> 01:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
pull up some reports and identify where
 
01:45:54.910 --> 01:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
exactly they're
 
01:45:58.189 --> 01:45:58.199 align:start position:0%
shipping so basically you guys said that
 
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
you you're not tracking any of the leech
 
01:46:00.239 --> 01:46:01.510 align:start position:0%
you you're not tracking any of the leech
a

01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
correct you said you don't have any data
 
01:46:06.510 --> 01:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
over Trends or
 
01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
time we have the data um but we have not
 
01:46:15.510 --> 01:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
compiled a recent Trend analysis on um
 
01:46:18.350 --> 01:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
the quality of the lee8 like for example
 
01:46:20.229 --> 01:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
using the lee8 indicator parameters we
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
have actually plotted it up um recently
 
01:46:27.629 --> 01:46:27.639 align:start position:0%
so what about have you trended uh
 
01:46:30.430 --> 01:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
volume periodically we will check volume
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
Trends um we've done some of that again
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
it's not hasn't been updated within the
 
01:46:40.669 --> 01:46:40.679 align:start position:0%
last six months to a year so if I asked
 
01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
for 10 years of leech eight from every
 
01:46:45.310 --> 01:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
one of the landfills you wouldn't have
 
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
that data we have the data but it's not
 
01:46:50.910 --> 01:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily compiled into like an Excel
 
01:46:52.709 --> 01:46:52.719 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet the data exists in the
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
record for each facility um and that can
 
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
be reviewed either through one stop or
 
01:47:00.790 --> 01:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
um make a a right to no file review
 
01:47:03.310 --> 01:47:03.320 align:start position:0%
request and we can provide that okay so
 
01:47:05.709 --> 01:47:05.719 align:start position:0%
my last question has to do with the
 
01:47:07.950 --> 01:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
monitoring wells in the groundwater
 
01:47:12.270 --> 01:47:12.280 align:start position:0%
quality so are those in a trend so let's
 
01:47:15.070 --> 01:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
say if we just look at one of the a one
 
01:47:17.149 --> 01:47:17.159 align:start position:0%
landfill so let's say what we going to
 
01:47:18.990 --> 01:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
talk about Rochester I'm in Rochester so
 
01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
do we have um every bit of information
 
01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
in a trend for as long as that um
 
01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
landfill has been in existence when
 
01:47:30.510 --> 01:47:30.520 align:start position:0%
something you know tested hot or
 
01:47:32.510 --> 01:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
whatever do we have all of that all of
 
01:47:34.350 --> 01:47:34.360 align:start position:0%
that data is included within the summary
 
01:47:36.790 --> 01:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
reports and the and the permit renewal
 
01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh submitt that we they that are
 
01:47:41.149 --> 01:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
submitted by the facilities uh certain
 
01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
compounds that are of concern or uh that
 
01:47:45.910 --> 01:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
are being tracked closely will have
 
01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
Trend analysis data associated with them
 
01:47:51.310 --> 01:47:51.320 align:start position:0%
specifically for the turn key facility
 
01:47:53.310 --> 01:47:53.320 align:start position:0%
um a majority a majority of the
 
01:47:55.310 --> 01:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
compounds the landfill le8 indicator
 
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
parameters that we discussed are plotted
 
01:47:59.589 --> 01:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
tracked and trended within those sumary
 
01:47:59.599 --> 01:48:00.790 align:start position:0%
tracked and trended within those sumary
reports

01:48:00.790 --> 01:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
reports
 
01:48:04.669 --> 01:48:04.679 align:start position:0%
yes okay um representative ger thank you
 
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
question uh if I remember correctly uh
 
01:48:12.149 --> 01:48:12.159 align:start position:0%
in one of the slides you were talking
 
01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
about you said that typically the
 
01:48:17.870 --> 01:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
landfill sites are are tested twice a
 
01:48:19.470 --> 01:48:19.480 align:start position:0%
year but they can be tested more
 
01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
requests yeah so each facility in each
 
01:48:29.189 --> 01:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
uh landfill has a permit that's specific
 
01:48:32.430 --> 01:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
to that location and and the frequencies
 
01:48:34.629 --> 01:48:34.639 align:start position:0%
sometimes are tailored off of our
 
01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
understanding of a site for example an
 
01:48:38.189 --> 01:48:38.199 align:start position:0%
unline landfill might have been
 
01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
monitored for the last 20 or 30 years we
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
have a tremendous amount of data that
 
01:48:46.229 --> 01:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
might uh point in a certain direction of
 
01:48:47.950 --> 01:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
saying well if we sample in the spring
 
01:48:49.750 --> 01:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
we'll have the highest concentrations of
 
01:48:52.470 --> 01:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
some kind of of compounds now for active
 
01:48:54.550 --> 01:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
landfills we're going to be monitoring
 
01:48:56.390 --> 01:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
them and have them required to be
 
01:48:58.750 --> 01:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
monitored on a more frequent basis to
 
01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
confirm that the uh containment systems
 
01:49:04.030 --> 01:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
are working uh majority of our active
 
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
landfills are monitored and sampled
 
01:49:09.310 --> 01:49:09.320 align:start position:0%
three times a year um we can accelerate
 
01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:12.639 align:start position:0%
and require sampling um on an intern
 
01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
basis in between them if there is some
 
01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
exceedence of a background condition um
 
01:49:19.510 --> 01:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
a compound ends up being higher
 
01:49:21.470 --> 01:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
concentration we could ask for
 
01:49:23.470 --> 01:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
confirmation um we can require
 
01:49:25.629 --> 01:49:25.639 align:start position:0%
assessment monitoring to make sure that
 
01:49:27.790 --> 01:49:27.800 align:start position:0%
there isn't something going on at the at
 
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
the facility in the leee management
 
01:49:31.589 --> 01:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
system that's compromised in some way so
 
01:49:35.350 --> 01:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
yes follow followup sure thank you and
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering about what conditions
 
01:49:40.510 --> 01:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
have to exist or you kind of compel you
 
01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
to ask for uh model for testing outside
 
01:49:47.830 --> 01:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
of you know the the the the terms and
 
01:49:49.229 --> 01:49:49.239 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about I think a lot of us
 
01:49:52.229 --> 01:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
are thinking about concern about uh the
 
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
levels of Pas for example in the AMC and
 
01:49:56.830 --> 01:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
concerns about you know is that because
 
01:49:58.510 --> 01:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
of an underlying site that's been there
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
for a long time is that perhaps related
 
01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
to uh a problem with with the landfill
 
01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
so uh again under what conditions do you
 
01:50:10.430 --> 01:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
decide that it it's important to ask for
 
01:50:13.750 --> 01:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
an accelerated testing uh
 
01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
scheme with the release detection World
 
01:50:19.229 --> 01:50:19.239 align:start position:0%
um and those permits it simply could be
 
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
an exceedence of background condition on
 
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
a onetime one shot one shot piece um if
 
01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
if we see something like that in a
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
release detection permit and there is an
 
01:50:32.750 --> 01:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
exceedance of uh some compound let's say
 
01:50:36.109 --> 01:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
a past compound um actually not past
 
01:50:37.669 --> 01:50:37.679 align:start position:0%
that's not something we have a long
 
01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
enough history of we may be asking for
 
01:50:41.830 --> 01:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
that anyway um if we had some kind of
 
01:50:43.470 --> 01:50:43.480 align:start position:0%
Benzene compound that was detected for
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
the first time in a long time in a while
 
01:50:46.950 --> 01:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
we would say let's let's have you go out
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
and and monitor that and confirm that
 
01:50:50.189 --> 01:50:50.199 align:start position:0%
detection is that not something some
 
01:50:52.030 --> 01:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
kind of Remnant or laboratory
 
01:50:54.109 --> 01:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
contamination of some kind if it is
 
01:50:56.350 --> 01:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
confirmed and we see some kind of upward
 
01:50:58.390 --> 01:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
Trend we'd end up in that accelerated
 
01:51:00.669 --> 01:51:00.679 align:start position:0%
assessment monitoring phase but we'd
 
01:51:02.669 --> 01:51:02.679 align:start position:0%
also be looking at that longer wider
 
01:51:04.629 --> 01:51:04.639 align:start position:0%
swath of landfill Le indicator
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
parameters to see if there are other
 
01:51:08.629 --> 01:51:08.639 align:start position:0%
compounds that are also on an upward
 
01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
trend of some kind landfill Li isn't
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
going to contain just one compound so
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
when we look at that we depend on that
 
01:51:20.069 --> 01:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
larger swath now in instances of half of
 
01:51:22.790 --> 01:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
our Municipal uh Solid Waste landfills
 
01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
there are online landfills associated
 
01:51:26.910 --> 01:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
with them they bring in their own set of
 
01:51:29.189 --> 01:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
contamination issues and add a baseline
 
01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
or noise if you will to the data that we
 
01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
see so in that case we look at those
 
01:51:36.430 --> 01:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
individual Wells and their individual
 
01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
histories related to those landfill e
 
01:51:40.669 --> 01:51:40.679 align:start position:0%
indicator parameters and look again at
 
01:51:42.430 --> 01:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
those Trends do we see multiple things
 
01:51:44.750 --> 01:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
going upward when they've been steady or
 
01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
declining previously and in those cases
 
01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
we would ask for and perhaps require
 
01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
some kind of assessment monitoring or on
 
01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
the other side because it's a dual type
 
01:51:55.950 --> 01:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
permit at this location we could ask for
 
01:51:57.430 --> 01:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
some kind of supplemental site
 
01:51:59.189 --> 01:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
investigation some kind of more
 
01:52:02.229 --> 01:52:02.239 align:start position:0%
intrusive investigation to see okay
 
01:52:03.629 --> 01:52:03.639 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
01:52:05.950 --> 01:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
here thank you thank you
 
01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
repr yes so uh there's a list of uh
 
01:52:14.229 --> 01:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
compounds that you test lee8 for that um
 
01:52:18.149 --> 01:52:18.159 align:start position:0%
ranging from well vola organic compounds
 
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
to Bast Etc uh and but uh that can't be
 
01:52:26.109 --> 01:52:26.119 align:start position:0%
an exhaustive list of everything that's
 
01:52:30.109 --> 01:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
in the lee8 so how do you track those do
 
01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
you do do you have any method for
 
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
tracking the UN unidentified compounds
 
01:52:38.990 --> 01:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:41.629 --> 01:52:41.639 align:start position:0%
leite in in regards to analytic
 
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
components there aren't a lot of
 
01:52:46.910 --> 01:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
analytical tests that we receive that
 
01:52:49.950 --> 01:52:49.960 align:start position:0%
would have unidentified compounds that
 
01:52:51.790 --> 01:52:51.800 align:start position:0%
was something that tentatively
 
01:52:53.709 --> 01:52:53.719 align:start position:0%
tentatively tentative tentatively
 
01:52:56.109 --> 01:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
tentatively excuse me tentatively
 
01:52:58.430 --> 01:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
identified compounds was something that
 
01:52:59.790 --> 01:52:59.800 align:start position:0%
we used to use a lot when we were
 
01:53:01.470 --> 01:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
looking at petroleum sites because you'd
 
01:53:04.149 --> 01:53:04.159 align:start position:0%
have this large large swath of petroleum
 
01:53:05.910 --> 01:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
compounds that might be looked at and
 
01:53:07.550 --> 01:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
then there's all this kind of mush at
 
01:53:08.669 --> 01:53:08.679 align:start position:0%
the end that we really don't know what
 
01:53:12.109 --> 01:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
it is if in the if in a landfill case we
 
01:53:15.629 --> 01:53:15.639 align:start position:0%
were to see some issues like that um I'm
 
01:53:16.870 --> 01:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
not sure we'd actually see it in the
 
01:53:19.350 --> 01:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
laboratory anymore however um we would
 
01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
require additional sampling an expanded
 
01:53:24.310 --> 01:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
list of some kind uh for for example
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
pasas we regulate four pasas compounds
 
01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
in the state right now pfoa
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
pfos pfhxs PF and
 
01:53:38.350 --> 01:53:38.360 align:start position:0%
pfna and so some some sites will only
 
01:53:40.149 --> 01:53:40.159 align:start position:0%
send us the results for those four
 
01:53:42.830 --> 01:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
compounds some other sites will send us
 
01:53:46.189 --> 01:53:46.199 align:start position:0%
the much a much longer list and
 
01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
so that expanded list is is kind of a
 
01:53:49.199 --> 01:53:50.430 align:start position:0%
so that expanded list is is kind of a
request

01:53:50.430 --> 01:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:53:52.589 --> 01:53:52.599 align:start position:0%
uh more so because the ambient
 
01:53:54.030 --> 01:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
groundwater quality standards are set
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
for a certain set of
 
01:53:59.830 --> 01:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
compounds I have a question before you
 
01:54:03.790 --> 01:54:03.800 align:start position:0%
so on the dees website there's a um
 
01:54:06.750 --> 01:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
application there that you can visually
 
01:54:09.229 --> 01:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
see where there are places that are
 
01:54:11.550 --> 01:54:11.560 align:start position:0%
being monitored they are indicated by
 
01:54:14.669 --> 01:54:14.679 align:start position:0%
green dots and yellow dots and red dots
 
01:54:16.990 --> 01:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
okay um and I don't know if everybody's
 
01:54:20.550 --> 01:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
familiar with with this tool or not
 
01:54:24.270 --> 01:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
but what what constitutes first of all
 
01:54:27.790 --> 01:54:27.800 align:start position:0%
how often is that updated and secondly
 
01:54:31.830 --> 01:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
um what constitutes movement from one
 
01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
color to the next are you you you're
 
01:54:38.030 --> 01:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
looking at just specific compounds or an
 
01:54:41.310 --> 01:54:41.320 align:start position:0%
overall measurement or any one
 
01:54:44.910 --> 01:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
particular exceedence H how does that
 
01:54:47.470 --> 01:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
can you explain that to me I think the
 
01:54:49.709 --> 01:54:49.719 align:start position:0%
map you're referring to is our past
 
01:54:51.390 --> 01:54:51.400 align:start position:0%
mapper that we've had out in the public
 
01:54:55.069 --> 01:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
for several years that's
 
01:54:58.189 --> 01:54:58.199 align:start position:0%
um that's populated on a volunteer basis
 
01:55:01.229 --> 01:55:01.239 align:start position:0%
or as requested by Dees not all it's not
 
01:55:02.669 --> 01:55:02.679 align:start position:0%
a requirement of our submittals
 
01:55:05.069 --> 01:55:05.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunately at this time um a lot of
 
01:55:07.390 --> 01:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
the data we've been actually I've been
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
very impressed in looking at what we've
 
01:55:11.950 --> 01:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
been able to get from landfills um on
 
01:55:14.669 --> 01:55:14.679 align:start position:0%
this as requested basis as I said most
 
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
of the sites most of the landfills in
 
01:55:18.229 --> 01:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are municipally owned and
 
01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
Consultants will charge a little bit
 
01:55:21.310 --> 01:55:21.320 align:start position:0%
more to say oh yeah we'll update that
 
01:55:24.109 --> 01:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
the dees for you so there's a tremendous
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
amount of information there U many of
 
01:55:27.990 --> 01:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
it's landfills a lot of it is also other
 
01:55:29.910 --> 01:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
sites as well but I would caution that
 
01:55:32.550 --> 01:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
that's not everything that we may have
 
01:55:35.629 --> 01:55:35.639 align:start position:0%
on P now in regards to the color coding
 
01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
components um it is p as a whole as I
 
01:55:40.990 --> 01:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
understand it there is a legend that you
 
01:55:43.830 --> 01:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
can pull down off to the side um that
 
01:55:45.830 --> 01:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
can tell you exactly what the standards
 
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
are I I have to confess I can't remember
 
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
what the numbers are I know at one point
 
01:55:52.589 --> 01:55:52.599 align:start position:0%
they were in comparison to our current
 
01:55:54.990 --> 01:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
aqs but I think they might also have
 
01:55:58.390 --> 01:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
some component of the former uh MCL of
 
01:56:01.069 --> 01:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
70 uh back when we first started
 
01:56:03.510 --> 01:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
discovering pasas in 20 well discovering
 
01:56:06.750 --> 01:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
it in New Hampshire in 2017 2018 um in
 
01:56:09.470 --> 01:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
regards to how often it's updated I
 
01:56:11.589 --> 01:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
believe it's updated as data comes in
 
01:56:16.189 --> 01:56:16.199 align:start position:0%
for a while it was being done um on a
 
01:56:18.910 --> 01:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
somewhat regular schedule but I'm I'm
 
01:56:21.189 --> 01:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
not familiar enough to know how much or
 
01:56:22.470 --> 01:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
how quickly it was done if it was done
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
on a monthly basis or a quarterly basis
 
01:56:28.030 --> 01:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
and what does the department do um when
 
01:56:30.310 --> 01:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
there's a red dot on there I mean is
 
01:56:34.270 --> 01:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
there is there some something that the
 
01:56:37.589 --> 01:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
uh landowner the landfill owner has to
 
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
comply with in order to show that
 
01:56:42.550 --> 01:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
they're trying to make that red dot go
 
01:56:46.830 --> 01:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
back to yellow or green so that so the
 
01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
the Red Dot is the backend things of
 
01:56:51.109 --> 01:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
what you see with the data the Red Dot
 
01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
for us would signify data that's come in
 
01:56:54.550 --> 01:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
through the summer reports of data
 
01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
transmittals there might be some kind of
 
01:56:58.430 --> 01:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
action item re related to those
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
locations they may just be locations
 
01:57:02.229 --> 01:57:02.239 align:start position:0%
that are exceptionally close to a
 
01:57:04.629 --> 01:57:04.639 align:start position:0%
landfill where it's a known exceedance
 
01:57:06.390 --> 01:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
where some corrective action plan might
 
01:57:08.990 --> 01:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
be undertaken occasionally we'll have a
 
01:57:10.990 --> 01:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
uh we'll have exceedances at a a
 
01:57:12.990 --> 01:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
boundary well so I mentioned groundwater
 
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
management zones previously groundwater
 
01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
management zone is intended to be the
 
01:57:20.310 --> 01:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
full area that ground is contaminate
 
01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
above the ambient groundwater quality
 
01:57:24.350 --> 01:57:24.360 align:start position:0%
standard with the Advent of things like
 
01:57:26.990 --> 01:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
past and lower standards for arsenic and
 
01:57:28.830 --> 01:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
manganes some of these groundwater
 
01:57:30.430 --> 01:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
management zones have had to grow
 
01:57:32.350 --> 01:57:32.360 align:start position:0%
additional investigations been required
 
01:57:34.709 --> 01:57:34.719 align:start position:0%
into them because some well at the very
 
01:57:36.709 --> 01:57:36.719 align:start position:0%
very downg gradient point of it a
 
01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
compliance well if you will might be
 
01:57:40.950 --> 01:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
showing exceedances of something that
 
01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
either wasn't tested for before because
 
01:57:44.790 --> 01:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
we didn't have the ability or the
 
01:57:46.990 --> 01:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
standard might have changed so in those
 
01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
cases Dees will direct the permit e and
 
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
their consultant as a consequence to
 
01:57:54.750 --> 01:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps do uh some kind of additional
 
01:57:56.990 --> 01:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
investigation our primary and first
 
01:57:58.390 --> 01:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
concern is to make sure that people are
 
01:58:00.910 --> 01:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
drinking clean water and so one of the
 
01:58:02.350 --> 01:58:02.360 align:start position:0%
first steps we'll do when we're looking
 
01:58:04.910 --> 01:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
at expanding or investing in a gmz
 
01:58:06.149 --> 01:58:06.159 align:start position:0%
compliance issue is are there any
 
01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
drinking water supplies near mine and if
 
01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
so um the Consultants will request to
 
01:58:13.109 --> 01:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
have to be able to sample those drinking
 
01:58:16.669 --> 01:58:16.679 align:start position:0%
water supply locations um most folks are
 
01:58:18.510 --> 01:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
pretty uh pretty accommodating some are
 
01:58:20.510 --> 01:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
not um they don't want to have their
 
01:58:22.950 --> 01:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
sample uh their water sampled but in
 
01:58:24.910 --> 01:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
many cases they do and so there'll be
 
01:58:27.669 --> 01:58:27.679 align:start position:0%
some additional um data that may come
 
01:58:30.510 --> 01:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
from that so we can assure that also uh
 
01:58:31.589 --> 01:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
there might be additional site
 
01:58:33.350 --> 01:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
investigation and additional monitoring
 
01:58:36.109 --> 01:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
Wells to make sure um we have that full
 
01:58:38.350 --> 01:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
compliance area mapped now when we look
 
01:58:40.870 --> 01:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
at some of this data as well we might be
 
01:58:42.990 --> 01:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
able to reach out to our our Associates
 
01:58:44.510 --> 01:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
in the solid waste management Bureau and
 
01:58:46.669 --> 01:58:46.679 align:start position:0%
say hey we have these detections is
 
01:58:48.149 --> 01:58:48.159 align:start position:0%
something changed at the landfill's
 
01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
operation if it's a closed landfill
 
01:58:52.109 --> 01:58:52.119 align:start position:0%
maybe they have some kind of issue with
 
01:58:54.310 --> 01:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
their cap or storm water maintenance if
 
01:58:55.870 --> 01:58:55.880 align:start position:0%
it's an active landfill if we think
 
01:58:57.709 --> 01:58:57.719 align:start position:0%
about release detection and maybe some
 
01:59:00.030 --> 01:59:00.040 align:start position:0%
kind of leech a management issue so we
 
01:59:01.550 --> 01:59:01.560 align:start position:0%
communicate back and forth rather
 
01:59:03.990 --> 01:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
extensively okay thank you uh
 
01:59:05.950 --> 01:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
01:59:07.870 --> 01:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
chair um thanks for taking my question
 
01:59:10.510 --> 01:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
um so just to clarify uh you indicated I
 
01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
think what uh uh the chair was speaking
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
about was the map around drinking water
 
01:59:17.790 --> 01:59:17.800 align:start position:0%
sample testing across the state um and
 
01:59:19.870 --> 01:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
just so that I'm clear your stating that
 
01:59:23.750 --> 01:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
you believe the um there are data there
 
01:59:27.030 --> 01:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
um that still exhibit um the 70 MCL but
 
01:59:29.790 --> 01:59:29.800 align:start position:0%
we are well past that as a state is that
 
01:59:31.069 --> 01:59:31.079 align:start position:0%
what I heard you saying we're somewhere
 
01:59:34.470 --> 01:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
in the 15 yes yes I it's the color
 
01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
coding I can't recall off the top of my
 
01:59:37.950 --> 01:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
head if we had more time I could pull it
 
01:59:39.550 --> 01:59:39.560 align:start position:0%
up on my laptop and we could play around
 
01:59:41.990 --> 01:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
and look at dots um but I can get back
 
01:59:44.589 --> 01:59:44.599 align:start position:0%
to you on that and I can walk walk you
 
01:59:46.510 --> 01:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
through exactly how to pull that up when
 
01:59:48.510 --> 01:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the data on those pages
 
01:59:50.910 --> 01:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and then follow up if I may uh
 
01:59:52.390 --> 01:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
quickly because we're running out of
 
01:59:54.629 --> 01:59:54.639 align:start position:0%
time yep and then I think to uh
 
01:59:56.270 --> 01:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
representative bixby's point I think the
 
01:59:58.149 --> 01:59:58.159 align:start position:0%
question that I had was just um
 
02:00:00.870 --> 02:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
regarding unidentified pases yet we know
 
02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
that that is changing so to his point
 
02:00:08.790 --> 02:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
unidentified um contaminants could they
 
02:00:11.149 --> 02:00:11.159 align:start position:0%
possibly include things like pases that
 
02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
are not reported on or required to be
 
02:00:13.280 --> 02:00:14.229 align:start position:0%
are not reported on or required to be
reported

02:00:14.229 --> 02:00:14.239 align:start position:0%
reported
 
02:00:18.709 --> 02:00:18.719 align:start position:0%
on uh yes yes I mean when we think about
 
02:00:20.430 --> 02:00:20.440 align:start position:0%
what we were sampling for it landfills
 
02:00:24.109 --> 02:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
before 2016 when pasas came on board P
 
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
was there we just didn't have the
 
02:00:26.990 --> 02:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
ability to analyze for it it's been in
 
02:00:29.870 --> 02:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
the waste mass and waste streams for 50
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
60 70 years that's why we see it at
 
02:00:33.990 --> 02:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
these online landfills we just didn't
 
02:00:36.709 --> 02:00:36.719 align:start position:0%
have the ability to to see it uh based
 
02:00:40.189 --> 02:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
on technology okay um one last quick
 
02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
question or well I could two just two
 
02:00:45.350 --> 02:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
last questions uh representative Howard
 
02:00:47.550 --> 02:00:47.560 align:start position:0%
and then representative Penza thank you
 
02:00:49.310 --> 02:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thanks for answering the
 
02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
question I heard you say a couple of
 
02:00:52.390 --> 02:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
times that there were no standards and
 
02:00:53.910 --> 02:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
no comparable standards but you talk
 
02:00:56.390 --> 02:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
about exceedances doeses that mean that
 
02:01:01.229 --> 02:01:01.239 align:start position:0%
um that the each each land landfill site
 
02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
is on its own comparison or
 
02:01:06.790 --> 02:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
or no that's thank you representative
 
02:01:07.950 --> 02:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
for the question thank you for asking
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
for clarification because I was thinking
 
02:01:11.390 --> 02:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
about that remember we're talking about
 
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
two different permits so under the solid
 
02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
waste permit there is no standard that
 
02:01:20.229 --> 02:01:20.239 align:start position:0%
you compare lee8 against so byproduct of
 
02:01:22.109 --> 02:01:22.119 align:start position:0%
the landfilling process it's a liquid
 
02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
that comes out of the waste system when
 
02:01:26.790 --> 02:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
we talk about exceedences what Jamie's
 
02:01:28.589 --> 02:01:28.599 align:start position:0%
talking about is relative to the
 
02:01:31.069 --> 02:01:31.079 align:start position:0%
groundwater permit if lee8 shows up in
 
02:01:33.470 --> 02:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
the groundwater you can have exceedances
 
02:01:36.910 --> 02:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
of certain groundwater quality standards
 
02:01:39.310 --> 02:01:39.320 align:start position:0%
so that's an important distinction the
 
02:01:40.390 --> 02:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
two different
 
02:01:44.149 --> 02:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
permits does that help okay thank you
 
02:01:44.159 --> 02:01:45.790 align:start position:0%
permits does that help okay thank you
representative

02:01:45.790 --> 02:01:45.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:01:48.709 --> 02:01:48.719 align:start position:0%
Penza So based upon all of this and our
 
02:01:50.069 --> 02:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
committee has received a lot of
 
02:01:52.109 --> 02:01:52.119 align:start position:0%
information of course in regards with
 
02:01:54.629 --> 02:01:54.639 align:start position:0%
the landfill in Bethlehem I'd like to
 
02:01:56.990 --> 02:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
understand um specifically what is the
 
02:02:00.790 --> 02:02:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem for the North Country
 
02:02:05.470 --> 02:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services lfi NCS yes yes
 
02:02:08.030 --> 02:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
from a groundwater perspective correct
 
02:02:11.550 --> 02:02:11.560 align:start position:0%
okay um the NCS landfill has a joint
 
02:02:13.709 --> 02:02:13.719 align:start position:0%
permit both release detection and
 
02:02:16.229 --> 02:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
groundwater management permit it has an
 
02:02:18.430 --> 02:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
unline had an online landfill associated
 
02:02:20.430 --> 02:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
with it that was removed in the
 
02:02:23.270 --> 02:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
1990s at that time it was removed and
 
02:02:25.189 --> 02:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
replaced and placed into the existing
 
02:02:28.910 --> 02:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
Line Landfill sections uh the area uh in
 
02:02:30.750 --> 02:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
which the landfill existed is in within
 
02:02:33.069 --> 02:02:33.079 align:start position:0%
a groundwater management zone so there
 
02:02:35.910 --> 02:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
are known exceedances of ambient grer
 
02:02:38.629 --> 02:02:38.639 align:start position:0%
quality standards at that location at
 
02:02:40.350 --> 02:02:40.360 align:start position:0%
the time the landfill was removed there
 
02:02:42.390 --> 02:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
were very high numbers of and
 
02:02:44.030 --> 02:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
concentrations of those compounds we
 
02:02:47.390 --> 02:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
were looking for at those times um and
 
02:02:50.030 --> 02:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
as as the landfill was REM moved and
 
02:02:52.910 --> 02:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
during the 20 years since or plus uh
 
02:02:55.790 --> 02:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
those concentrations have moved moved
 
02:02:59.910 --> 02:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
downward and improved immensely um
 
02:03:02.109 --> 02:03:02.119 align:start position:0%
residual contamination at the at the
 
02:03:05.109 --> 02:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
site has continued to be uh there also
 
02:03:06.910 --> 02:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
within the groundwater but also within
 
02:03:09.589 --> 02:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
soils and interstitial spaces that are
 
02:03:13.229 --> 02:03:13.239 align:start position:0%
unable to be uh removed if you will and
 
02:03:16.390 --> 02:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
as such um there are some residual
 
02:03:19.229 --> 02:03:19.239 align:start position:0%
impacts that remain the residual imp PS
 
02:03:21.950 --> 02:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
we see today are largely pasas and low
 
02:03:24.350 --> 02:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
lower numbers of 14 dioxane in some
 
02:03:28.069 --> 02:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
cases numbers in which in in in
 
02:03:30.229 --> 02:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
reference to 14 oxane specifically are
 
02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
below the standard that were in place uh
 
02:03:35.629 --> 02:03:35.639 align:start position:0%
back in 2016 I believe we went from
 
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
three to
 
02:03:40.629 --> 02:03:40.639 align:start position:0%
32 um pfas obviously wasn't monitored
 
02:03:45.390 --> 02:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
for until U 2016 2017 at the location we
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
see past numbers there some of them are
 
02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
in exceedence of hqs standards in which
 
02:03:51.910 --> 02:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
that's the area in which we are
 
02:03:53.830 --> 02:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
comparing to for the groundwater
 
02:03:57.229 --> 02:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
management Zone those numbers are are
 
02:04:00.069 --> 02:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
are significant however when we monitor
 
02:04:01.470 --> 02:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
out and we look at the monitoring that's
 
02:04:03.229 --> 02:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
being done at the compliant sections of
 
02:04:05.229 --> 02:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
the groundwater management Zone uh the
 
02:04:07.149 --> 02:04:07.159 align:start position:0%
concentrations drop off to below
 
02:04:09.069 --> 02:04:09.079 align:start position:0%
standards so at this time it's
 
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
maintaining compliance now there is an
 
02:04:13.109 --> 02:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
expanded site investigation that is
 
02:04:15.709 --> 02:04:15.719 align:start position:0%
being required in the area in which that
 
02:04:17.549 --> 02:04:17.559 align:start position:0%
is Dow gradient of the landfill this
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
area has also been heavily used um for
 
02:04:22.830 --> 02:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
lee8 management purposes with a history
 
02:04:24.830 --> 02:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
of of issues that have been related
 
02:04:27.510 --> 02:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
there and and investigated however we
 
02:04:29.790 --> 02:04:29.800 align:start position:0%
have I believe a November 7th letter
 
02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
that has been put out that's requiring
 
02:04:33.709 --> 02:04:33.719 align:start position:0%
additional site investigation of those
 
02:04:36.830 --> 02:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
areas additional monitoring points um to
 
02:04:38.950 --> 02:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
help inform and update that pyc
 
02:04:41.709 --> 02:04:41.719 align:start position:0%
conceptual model I was discussing before
 
02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
conceptual models are not static they're
 
02:04:45.870 --> 02:04:45.880 align:start position:0%
meant to grow and under and improve as
 
02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
we uh learn more about a site and as
 
02:04:51.109 --> 02:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
such that's what our request is at this
 
02:04:54.350 --> 02:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
time okay thank you I'm going to have to
 
02:04:58.470 --> 02:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
um end our question answer time now and
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
um I want to thank the department for
 
02:05:03.069 --> 02:05:03.079 align:start position:0%

everybody thank you for inviting me I'm
 
02:08:32.709 --> 02:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
really excited to be here today um I've
 
02:08:34.109 --> 02:08:34.119 align:start position:0%
never been to New Hampshire and they
 
02:08:37.310 --> 02:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
tell me January is the best time to
 
02:08:40.589 --> 02:08:40.599 align:start position:0%
come this was wonderful for me um my
 
02:08:42.149 --> 02:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
name is Patrick creger I'm the vice
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
president of sustainability at the
 
02:08:46.470 --> 02:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
Plastics industry Association um I'm
 
02:08:48.149 --> 02:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
here to do to talk to you today a little
 
02:08:51.109 --> 02:08:51.119 align:start position:0%
bit about plastic recycling Technologies
 
02:08:53.069 --> 02:08:53.079 align:start position:0%
how we currently do it how we can do it
 
02:08:55.709 --> 02:08:55.719 align:start position:0%
better and and have a discussion about
 
02:08:57.750 --> 02:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
potential policies that can support
 
02:08:59.750 --> 02:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
recycling in New Hampshire New Hampshire
 
02:09:02.350 --> 02:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
does a really great job um but like in
 
02:09:04.990 --> 02:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
all things we can do them better and so
 
02:09:07.030 --> 02:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
let's talk about that and see how we can
 
02:09:09.229 --> 02:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
work together to improve
 
02:09:11.470 --> 02:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
recycling um the Plastics industry
 
02:09:13.390 --> 02:09:13.400 align:start position:0%
Association is the trade Association
 
02:09:15.229 --> 02:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
that was started in
 
02:09:17.870 --> 02:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
1937 and it represents the full plastic
 
02:09:19.910 --> 02:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
Supply chain that includes the equipment
 
02:09:23.390 --> 02:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
and mold makers the material suppliers
 
02:09:25.390 --> 02:09:25.400 align:start position:0%
and the processors converters who make
 
02:09:27.950 --> 02:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
those Pro who who use that equipment and
 
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
those materials to make the products
 
02:09:31.870 --> 02:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
that we use all throughout our daily
 
02:09:34.669 --> 02:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
lives um we also want to note that all
 
02:09:36.950 --> 02:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
our members include the recyclers who
 
02:09:38.350 --> 02:09:38.360 align:start position:0%
take those products when you're done
 
02:09:40.270 --> 02:09:40.280 align:start position:0%
with them and they make them into new
 
02:09:43.510 --> 02:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
things as well so when we talk about the
 
02:09:46.390 --> 02:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
Plastics industry in the United States
 
02:09:50.189 --> 02:09:50.199 align:start position:0%
that is a a very large group um so that
 
02:09:52.229 --> 02:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
is the seventh largest manufacturing
 
02:09:54.629 --> 02:09:54.639 align:start position:0%
industry in the United States um
 
02:09:57.030 --> 02:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
representing over a million jobs and
 
02:10:00.669 --> 02:10:00.679 align:start position:0%
over 548 billion dollars in shipments
 
02:10:03.709 --> 02:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
each year um in addition to that
 
02:10:06.390 --> 02:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
obviously we are very Reliant or many of
 
02:10:07.669 --> 02:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
the industries that we have in the
 
02:10:09.629 --> 02:10:09.639 align:start position:0%
United States are very reliant on
 
02:10:11.870 --> 02:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
Plastics to be able to do the things
 
02:10:14.669 --> 02:10:14.679 align:start position:0%
that they need to do to provide Comfort
 
02:10:17.870 --> 02:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
safety access and convenience for all of
 
02:10:20.109 --> 02:10:20.119 align:start position:0%
you and all of your citizens in New
 
02:10:22.910 --> 02:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in particular um we employ
 
02:10:25.189 --> 02:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
almost 5,000 people in the Plastics
 
02:10:27.069 --> 02:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
industry and then when we talk about
 
02:10:28.790 --> 02:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
those dependent Industries which include
 
02:10:32.270 --> 02:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
medical construction uh packaging Etc
 
02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
that would be almost 200,000 employees
 
02:10:38.510 --> 02:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
so representing about three M or 300 uh
 
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
million in payrolls and 30 million in
 
02:10:44.750 --> 02:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
taxes so I work with the sustainability
 
02:10:46.910 --> 02:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
team in the organization and we work
 
02:10:49.149 --> 02:10:49.159 align:start position:0%
with our members as you imagine for the
 
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
Plastics industry sustainability is a
 
02:10:54.069 --> 02:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
very core priority for us we love to say
 
02:10:56.189 --> 02:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
that we love plastic and we hate plastic
 
02:10:58.750 --> 02:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
waste we want to make sure that we are
 
02:11:01.069 --> 02:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
addressing uh the issues and challenges
 
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
that surround the sustainability of
 
02:11:05.790 --> 02:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
plastics and work to improve them we do
 
02:11:07.189 --> 02:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
those in three different kind of
 
02:11:09.549 --> 02:11:09.559 align:start position:0%
priority areas we promote plastic
 
02:11:12.030 --> 02:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
circularity we want to eliminate plastic
 
02:11:13.750 --> 02:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
waste in the environment and we want to
 
02:11:15.310 --> 02:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're using resources
 
02:11:17.470 --> 02:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
responsibly the ones that we use to make
 
02:11:20.310 --> 02:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
Plastics but also those Plastics
 
02:11:24.470 --> 02:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
themselves so in talking today I'm also
 
02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
going to talk pretty quickly because I
 
02:11:26.709 --> 02:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that there's
 
02:11:28.870 --> 02:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
definitely a lot of time for questions
 
02:11:31.390 --> 02:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a it's a pretty
 
02:11:33.390 --> 02:11:33.400 align:start position:0%
simplistic question to ask but what is
 
02:11:36.189 --> 02:11:36.199 align:start position:0%
recycling if you ask a lot of people
 
02:11:38.229 --> 02:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
they think it's an action they think
 
02:11:40.270 --> 02:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
that it's an act that they are doing
 
02:11:43.310 --> 02:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
putting the pet bottle in the blue bin I
 
02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
guess at which point magic converts it
 
02:11:48.830 --> 02:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
into something new it's not an action
 
02:11:51.510 --> 02:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's a process um it's actually a bunch
 
02:11:53.310 --> 02:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
of different steps all of which that
 
02:11:55.669 --> 02:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
need to happen correctly for something
 
02:11:58.510 --> 02:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
to be actually recycle right and that is
 
02:12:00.870 --> 02:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
true for Plastics as well as many other
 
02:12:02.510 --> 02:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
materials a lot of the things that we
 
02:12:04.910 --> 02:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
talk today are not unique to Plastics
 
02:12:06.470 --> 02:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
right so when we talk about the
 
02:12:08.750 --> 02:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
challenges that exist for us the great
 
02:12:11.350 --> 02:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
thing about that is the opportunities to
 
02:12:13.270 --> 02:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
improve Plastics recycling will also
 
02:12:16.629 --> 02:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
improve for other materials Metals glass
 
02:12:19.310 --> 02:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
fiber Etc
 
02:12:21.549 --> 02:12:21.559 align:start position:0%
ladies so when we talk about that
 
02:12:23.430 --> 02:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
process of recycling I like to talk
 
02:12:25.870 --> 02:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
about it in four different buckets so
 
02:12:28.950 --> 02:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
that's collection sortation processing
 
02:12:31.149 --> 02:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
and conversion but the other thing that
 
02:12:32.709 --> 02:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure that we talk about
 
02:12:36.549 --> 02:12:36.559 align:start position:0%
very clearly at the beginning um is that
 
02:12:38.310 --> 02:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
recycling is different everywhere you
 
02:12:41.270 --> 02:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
are so like we often say like I mean I'm
 
02:12:42.629 --> 02:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
sure that you as politicians can
 
02:12:44.910 --> 02:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate this you know much like
 
02:12:48.149 --> 02:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
politics recycling is local it depends
 
02:12:51.030 --> 02:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
on where you're at in your community
 
02:12:52.950 --> 02:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
even where you may live within that
 
02:12:54.990 --> 02:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
community so we want to make sure that
 
02:12:57.030 --> 02:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
that's important because acceptance
 
02:12:59.069 --> 02:12:59.079 align:start position:0%
rates what materials are accepted
 
02:13:01.950 --> 02:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
different differ widely uh across the
 
02:13:05.310 --> 02:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
United States in 2021 the sustainable
 
02:13:07.709 --> 02:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
packaging Coalition published an access
 
02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
study um and it showed various
 
02:13:13.310 --> 02:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
acceptance rates for materials across
 
02:13:16.149 --> 02:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
the United States so for example uh
 
02:13:19.430 --> 02:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
aluminum cans in non-deposit states were
 
02:13:23.669 --> 02:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
accepted in 89% of locations whereas pet
 
02:13:25.470 --> 02:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
water bottles beverage bottles were
 
02:13:28.549 --> 02:13:28.559 align:start position:0%
accepted in 87% right really high but
 
02:13:31.350 --> 02:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
that's not everything um so if you talk
 
02:13:33.669 --> 02:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
about polystyrene not expanded
 
02:13:35.629 --> 02:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
polystyrene but polystyrene itself
 
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
extruded um that's 37% and that actually
 
02:13:40.589 --> 02:13:40.599 align:start position:0%
matches the acceptance rate for other
 
02:13:43.229 --> 02:13:43.239 align:start position:0%
things like aluminum foil which people
 
02:13:46.270 --> 02:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
are often surprised is not just accepted
 
02:13:49.470 --> 02:13:49.480 align:start position:0%
everywhere um we travel a lot and and I
 
02:13:51.510 --> 02:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
often give presentations on how to
 
02:13:53.629 --> 02:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
recycle and one of the things that I
 
02:13:55.470 --> 02:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
often tell people that's very surprising
 
02:13:57.669 --> 02:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
is paper napkins paper napkins are not
 
02:14:00.229 --> 02:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
widely recyclable everywhere but then
 
02:14:03.149 --> 02:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
you could also say um who here things
 
02:14:06.069 --> 02:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
that are uh pizza box is recyclable
 
02:14:11.069 --> 02:14:11.079 align:start position:0%
right so in 90 over 90% of paper mills
 
02:14:12.709 --> 02:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
in the United States will accept a pizza
 
02:14:15.470 --> 02:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
box so pizza boxes are actually very
 
02:14:17.390 --> 02:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
widely recyclable in this in the United
 
02:14:20.069 --> 02:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
States as well well now the Mills are
 
02:14:21.430 --> 02:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
different than the communities some
 
02:14:23.350 --> 02:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
communities choose not to because
 
02:14:24.629 --> 02:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
they're worried about food waste and
 
02:14:26.629 --> 02:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
rodents and things like that but they
 
02:14:28.669 --> 02:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
are able to be recycled and they are
 
02:14:31.229 --> 02:14:31.239 align:start position:0%
very widely recycled so that's why you
 
02:14:33.390 --> 02:14:33.400 align:start position:0%
know many of the misconceptions about
 
02:14:37.270 --> 02:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
recycling are are shared amongst the
 
02:14:39.350 --> 02:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
materials so when we talk about
 
02:14:41.950 --> 02:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
collection I think in popular culture we
 
02:14:44.030 --> 02:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
often think of it as that blue bin that
 
02:14:46.350 --> 02:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
I mentioned where we are Trucking that
 
02:14:49.149 --> 02:14:49.159 align:start position:0%
out to our curb where then someone picks
 
02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
it up and it it again goes away
 
02:14:54.750 --> 02:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
magically right um that's true many
 
02:14:58.589 --> 02:14:58.599 align:start position:0%
places um in fact about 50% of
 
02:15:00.270 --> 02:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
communities in the United States and
 
02:15:02.030 --> 02:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
people or citizens in the United States
 
02:15:04.149 --> 02:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
households have access to curbside
 
02:15:06.629 --> 02:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
recycling that's not necessarily true
 
02:15:10.310 --> 02:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire in New Hampshire n
 
02:15:13.069 --> 02:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
71% of of your households actually
 
02:15:16.069 --> 02:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
recycle via drop off Community drop off
 
02:15:18.350 --> 02:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
which is actually that second image
 
02:15:20.350 --> 02:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
there um that's actually taken from the
 
02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
Newark post um recycling center that
 
02:15:24.430 --> 02:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
opened in
 
02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
2021 but also there are other forms of
 
02:15:30.390 --> 02:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
recycling besides curbside and uh and
 
02:15:32.830 --> 02:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
Community drop off there are things like
 
02:15:35.470 --> 02:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
store drop off so often a very common
 
02:15:38.229 --> 02:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
weighted collectings like film um but
 
02:15:41.069 --> 02:15:41.079 align:start position:0%
also batteries printer cartridges Etc
 
02:15:43.270 --> 02:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
they're also male-in recycling options
 
02:15:46.030 --> 02:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
as well um for certain types of products
 
02:15:47.870 --> 02:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
where it's really important to recycle
 
02:15:49.189 --> 02:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
them but you know there's not
 
02:15:51.830 --> 02:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily a lot of of concentration of
 
02:15:54.549 --> 02:15:54.559 align:start position:0%
that material in one geographic location
 
02:15:56.589 --> 02:15:56.599 align:start position:0%
so there are different ways to collect
 
02:15:59.430 --> 02:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
it but we have to collect it first we as
 
02:16:02.030 --> 02:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
an industry have invested billions of
 
02:16:04.629 --> 02:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
dollars in recycling technology and we
 
02:16:07.350 --> 02:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
as as parts of our coalitions like the
 
02:16:09.790 --> 02:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
recycling partnership and others have ex
 
02:16:12.990 --> 02:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
have invested even more or or additional
 
02:16:15.709 --> 02:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
money um in in improving things like
 
02:16:18.430 --> 02:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
collection but if someone can't get it
 
02:16:19.990 --> 02:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
in the bin or they don't put it in the
 
02:16:22.350 --> 02:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
bin in the first place like all of that
 
02:16:23.950 --> 02:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
is for
 
02:16:26.870 --> 02:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
not so when we think about collection we
 
02:16:28.549 --> 02:16:28.559 align:start position:0%
can improve that in three different ways
 
02:16:30.510 --> 02:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
we can discuss
 
02:16:34.469 --> 02:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
access um we can discuss engagement and
 
02:16:36.230 --> 02:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
then we can also talk about education
 
02:16:38.270 --> 02:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
those are three important things around
 
02:16:40.830 --> 02:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
how we can improve collection so in
 
02:16:42.309 --> 02:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
Access let's talk about the national
 
02:16:45.549 --> 02:16:45.559 align:start position:0%
recycling access so these dumbers come
 
02:16:47.270 --> 02:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
from the recycling partnership's most
 
02:16:49.270 --> 02:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
recent report published in January of
 
02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
this year 73% of communities have access
 
02:16:55.309 --> 02:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
to some form of recycling whether that's
 
02:16:58.509 --> 02:16:58.519 align:start position:0%
curbside or in those Community drop offs
 
02:17:02.150 --> 02:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
um 27% don't in New Hampshire which is
 
02:17:03.910 --> 02:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
those which are those numbers in the
 
02:17:07.990 --> 02:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
center um 95% of single family
 
02:17:10.110 --> 02:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
households have access unfortunately
 
02:17:12.910 --> 02:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
multif family is six now I will put a
 
02:17:16.270 --> 02:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
big caveat here so the recycling
 
02:17:18.150 --> 02:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
partnership in particular is really
 
02:17:20.230 --> 02:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
focused on Equitable access which is
 
02:17:21.750 --> 02:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
really important they want to make sure
 
02:17:23.870 --> 02:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
that it's as easy for you to throw it
 
02:17:25.549 --> 02:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
away as it is to recycle it and vice
 
02:17:27.830 --> 02:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
versa so when they're talking about this
 
02:17:30.709 --> 02:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
number there that is Equitable access
 
02:17:33.270 --> 02:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
that does not necessarily work super
 
02:17:35.549 --> 02:17:35.559 align:start position:0%
well in New Hampshire where you have
 
02:17:38.030 --> 02:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
such a very high Community drop off for
 
02:17:40.429 --> 02:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
recycling but it does mean that it is
 
02:17:42.150 --> 02:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
easier for people to throw things away
 
02:17:44.509 --> 02:17:44.519 align:start position:0%
than it is to
 
02:17:46.990 --> 02:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
recycle when we talk about engagement
 
02:17:48.709 --> 02:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
right that's the next just because you
 
02:17:51.230 --> 02:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
have it doesn't mean you do it so
 
02:17:54.549 --> 02:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
nationally 59% of people who have access
 
02:17:57.030 --> 02:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
to recycling actually do it it's a
 
02:17:59.230 --> 02:17:59.240 align:start position:0%
little bit less in New Hampshire at
 
02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:00.110 align:start position:0%
little bit less in New Hampshire at
about

02:18:00.110 --> 02:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:18:02.429 --> 02:18:02.439 align:start position:0%
50% um and what does that mean
 
02:18:04.629 --> 02:18:04.639 align:start position:0%
specifically for you as a state it means
 
02:18:06.990 --> 02:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
that you are losing
 
02:18:10.270 --> 02:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
172,000 pounds of material to landfill
 
02:18:14.549 --> 02:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
or uh you know incineration that could
 
02:18:16.030 --> 02:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise be
 
02:18:18.070 --> 02:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
recycled um we want want to make sure
 
02:18:20.110 --> 02:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
that that engagement number is up and
 
02:18:21.790 --> 02:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
how do we do that that's actually
 
02:18:24.549 --> 02:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
through education right so when I
 
02:18:28.349 --> 02:18:28.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned that that recycling is
 
02:18:30.469 --> 02:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
different everywhere it's incredibly
 
02:18:32.750 --> 02:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
complex and we recognize that but
 
02:18:34.790 --> 02:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
ensuring that people understand and are
 
02:18:36.990 --> 02:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
confident in how they can recycle where
 
02:18:39.349 --> 02:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
they're located is really important so
 
02:18:41.309 --> 02:18:41.319 align:start position:0%
this is an example of portsmouth's work
 
02:18:43.750 --> 02:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
with waste management or WM now excuse
 
02:18:45.790 --> 02:18:45.800 align:start position:0%
me to talk about the kinds of items that
 
02:18:48.150 --> 02:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
they do accept and don't accept those
 
02:18:50.429 --> 02:18:50.439 align:start position:0%
vary again why do that why does That
 
02:18:52.309 --> 02:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
Vary we can talk about that during the
 
02:18:54.790 --> 02:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
discussion um but it's just true that
 
02:18:56.950 --> 02:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
not every location accepts every single
 
02:18:59.349 --> 02:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
type of material in the same
 
02:19:01.990 --> 02:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
way um also what that really helps with
 
02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
is trust and building trust in recycling
 
02:19:07.230 --> 02:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
um we actually see decreased rates of
 
02:19:09.429 --> 02:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
the trust in recycling overall in the
 
02:19:10.669 --> 02:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
United States which is really
 
02:19:12.509 --> 02:19:12.519 align:start position:0%
unfortunate if you don't believe that
 
02:19:15.030 --> 02:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
recycling is actually happening then you
 
02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
are less likely to actually do that and
 
02:19:18.709 --> 02:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
it un fortunately becomes a little bit
 
02:19:21.150 --> 02:19:21.160 align:start position:0%
of a spiral right that if you don't do
 
02:19:22.990 --> 02:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
it then then your recycling rates are
 
02:19:24.910 --> 02:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
low and then people say recycling is a
 
02:19:26.629 --> 02:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
myth and so more people become
 
02:19:28.469 --> 02:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
discouraged so we want to make sure that
 
02:19:30.270 --> 02:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
we are showing that recycling is
 
02:19:32.709 --> 02:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
happening and that it is important and
 
02:19:34.309 --> 02:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
giving people the information that they
 
02:19:36.509 --> 02:19:36.519 align:start position:0%
need to feel empowered that's like why
 
02:19:38.309 --> 02:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
Plastics industry Association has worked
 
02:19:40.030 --> 02:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
on a new initiative called recycling is
 
02:19:41.910 --> 02:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
real where we've created a series of
 
02:19:44.230 --> 02:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
videos and we're engaging with people to
 
02:19:46.509 --> 02:19:46.519 align:start position:0%
actually show companies Recycling and
 
02:19:48.190 --> 02:19:48.200 align:start position:0%
converting plas Plastics and other
 
02:19:50.070 --> 02:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
materials into new
 
02:19:53.349 --> 02:19:53.359 align:start position:0%
products when we move on to sortation so
 
02:19:56.510 --> 02:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
for single stream the curbside material
 
02:19:58.309 --> 02:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
much of that needs to be sorted because
 
02:20:00.309 --> 02:20:00.319 align:start position:0%
it includes multiple materials in the
 
02:20:02.190 --> 02:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
same location this is a photo of a
 
02:20:04.309 --> 02:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
material recovery facility from where
 
02:20:06.349 --> 02:20:06.359 align:start position:0%
that happens so this is at the very
 
02:20:09.510 --> 02:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
beginning of that process where many
 
02:20:11.670 --> 02:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
where many conveyors and and a very
 
02:20:14.150 --> 02:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
manual process of people sitting there
 
02:20:16.870 --> 02:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
and picking out potential contaminants
 
02:20:19.190 --> 02:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
um I whenever I go to murfs I always ask
 
02:20:21.110 --> 02:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
them uh what's your favorite contaminant
 
02:20:22.990 --> 02:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
you've seen um the sheer number of
 
02:20:26.070 --> 02:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
bowling balls that get recycled um is
 
02:20:28.309 --> 02:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
staggering um that by the way is called
 
02:20:30.309 --> 02:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
wish cycling where people put something
 
02:20:32.469 --> 02:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
into the bin because they really hope
 
02:20:34.830 --> 02:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
but they're not sure that it is actually
 
02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
recyclable if you don't know that
 
02:20:38.429 --> 02:20:38.439 align:start position:0%
something is recyclable please do not
 
02:20:40.230 --> 02:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
put it in the bin um because that
 
02:20:42.349 --> 02:20:42.359 align:start position:0%
increases contamination and
 
02:20:45.670 --> 02:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
contamination is a really big issue
 
02:20:48.230 --> 02:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
because this process is very very
 
02:20:51.030 --> 02:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
expensive relative to everything else
 
02:20:53.349 --> 02:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
making sure that we are separating these
 
02:20:57.110 --> 02:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
things in a very uh efficient way um and
 
02:20:59.950 --> 02:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
as such if loads of material are too
 
02:21:02.190 --> 02:21:02.200 align:start position:0%
contaminated they are rejected by
 
02:21:04.150 --> 02:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
material recovery facilities and they
 
02:21:06.309 --> 02:21:06.319 align:start position:0%
are then sent directly to landfill so
 
02:21:08.830 --> 02:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
all that other great material and all of
 
02:21:12.710 --> 02:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
your uh you know fellow neighbors um and
 
02:21:14.469 --> 02:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
the great work that they did gets
 
02:21:17.750 --> 02:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
diverted along with that um there are no
 
02:21:20.510 --> 02:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
murfs in New Hampshire unfortunately
 
02:21:23.349 --> 02:21:23.359 align:start position:0%
there are 400 in the United States um
 
02:21:24.750 --> 02:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
but there are some pretty close ones
 
02:21:27.389 --> 02:21:27.399 align:start position:0%
around here um there's I think five
 
02:21:29.469 --> 02:21:29.479 align:start position:0%
pretty close in Massachusetts there's
 
02:21:33.950 --> 02:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
one in uh Maine and there's one in uh uh
 
02:21:37.070 --> 02:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
new Vermont as well and I can provide
 
02:21:38.830 --> 02:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
that information afterwards if if people
 
02:21:40.910 --> 02:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
are interested in seeing where those are
 
02:21:42.429 --> 02:21:42.439 align:start position:0%
um if you've never been to a murf I
 
02:21:45.349 --> 02:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
really encourage you to go they're
 
02:21:47.550 --> 02:21:47.560 align:start position:0%
fascinating um they have a a lot of
 
02:21:49.150 --> 02:21:49.160 align:start position:0%
really cool technology that they work
 
02:21:52.070 --> 02:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
with such as size filters magnets and
 
02:21:55.469 --> 02:21:55.479 align:start position:0%
Eddy currents to separate um Metals out
 
02:21:58.070 --> 02:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
they can classify by shooting um jets of
 
02:22:00.790 --> 02:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
air to separate different types of paper
 
02:22:02.830 --> 02:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
or different types of plastics they also
 
02:22:04.630 --> 02:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
use Optical sorters that's the image on
 
02:22:07.389 --> 02:22:07.399 align:start position:0%
the right um and then robotics which is
 
02:22:09.510 --> 02:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
that image there in the in the center
 
02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
many murfs now are really investing in
 
02:22:15.670 --> 02:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
both Optical sortation and uh robotics
 
02:22:18.230 --> 02:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
these are two types of equipment that
 
02:22:21.070 --> 02:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
really enable them to uh very quickly
 
02:22:23.389 --> 02:22:23.399 align:start position:0%
adapt to the incoming waste streams that
 
02:22:26.030 --> 02:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
evolve over time you know what we
 
02:22:28.270 --> 02:22:28.280 align:start position:0%
recycle now is very different than we
 
02:22:30.630 --> 02:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
recycled in the 90s for example we're
 
02:22:32.349 --> 02:22:32.359 align:start position:0%
not reading as much on newspapers
 
02:22:34.270 --> 02:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately so there's just less
 
02:22:36.910 --> 02:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
newspaper that's going into these murfs
 
02:22:39.469 --> 02:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
and so uh but there is however more
 
02:22:43.030 --> 02:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
flexibles and or more uh other types of
 
02:22:45.349 --> 02:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
plastics and so having options and
 
02:22:47.710 --> 02:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
technologies that can sort those out is
 
02:22:50.110 --> 02:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
really key and it's it's also very
 
02:22:52.590 --> 02:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
expensive an optical sorder can can be
 
02:22:56.150 --> 02:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
up to $2 million right so it it is
 
02:22:58.150 --> 02:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
something that is is very expensive for
 
02:23:00.110 --> 02:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
them to do and takes a
 
02:23:02.750 --> 02:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
while once we talk once we have all that
 
02:23:05.309 --> 02:23:05.319 align:start position:0%
material collected and bailed it is then
 
02:23:07.590 --> 02:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
sent to other locations those are
 
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
processors like Plastics recyclers like
 
02:23:15.110 --> 02:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
um uh let's see film or or Fiber pulpers
 
02:23:18.030 --> 02:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
things like that smelters um and in our
 
02:23:19.790 --> 02:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
industry when we're talking about how we
 
02:23:22.030 --> 02:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
recycle that there are a few common
 
02:23:24.230 --> 02:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
steps but again depending on the type of
 
02:23:26.590 --> 02:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
material that you as a company are
 
02:23:29.269 --> 02:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
accepting into your into your um
 
02:23:31.750 --> 02:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
facility those are very those can vary
 
02:23:35.349 --> 02:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
very widely um and the the that include
 
02:23:36.870 --> 02:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
size reduction which is a really nice
 
02:23:39.030 --> 02:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
way to say shredding right making it
 
02:23:41.269 --> 02:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
smaller so it's easier to handle we can
 
02:23:43.950 --> 02:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
then screen out spe specific items like
 
02:23:46.190 --> 02:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
in contaminants like metals and glass
 
02:23:48.269 --> 02:23:48.279 align:start position:0%
that inevitably find find their way into
 
02:23:51.590 --> 02:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
our recycling uh facilities we can wash
 
02:23:53.670 --> 02:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
off all of the food contamination that
 
02:23:55.150 --> 02:23:55.160 align:start position:0%
not everybody has done a great job of
 
02:23:57.590 --> 02:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
rinsing off whether that's hot or cold
 
02:23:59.429 --> 02:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
we can then also float and sink so one
 
02:24:00.790 --> 02:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
of the things that we often like to
 
02:24:03.389 --> 02:24:03.399 align:start position:0%
encourage people to do if you have a pet
 
02:24:05.790 --> 02:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
bottle is to put that cap back on right
 
02:24:07.510 --> 02:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
so we need to remember to keep that cap
 
02:24:10.150 --> 02:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
on that way that that very small cap
 
02:24:12.550 --> 02:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
Which is less than 2 in by the way and a
 
02:24:15.150 --> 02:24:15.160 align:start position:0%
fun fact for everybody here if an item
 
02:24:18.190 --> 02:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
is less than 2 in by 2 in in in two
 
02:24:21.670 --> 02:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
different uh you know uh different
 
02:24:25.269 --> 02:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
directions um it will not be recycled
 
02:24:28.590 --> 02:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
right so straws not readily recyclable
 
02:24:31.510 --> 02:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
through through um automatic processes
 
02:24:34.790 --> 02:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
but neither are um business cards
 
02:24:37.030 --> 02:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
neither are many small pieces of paper
 
02:24:40.150 --> 02:24:40.160 align:start position:0%
or aluminum foil wrappers right so very
 
02:24:43.150 --> 02:24:43.160 align:start position:0%
small items don't make it through those
 
02:24:47.230 --> 02:24:47.240 align:start position:0%
murfs and so when we float in sink
 
02:24:48.990 --> 02:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
separation enables us to be able to
 
02:24:51.510 --> 02:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
separate out that pet and that and that
 
02:24:54.190 --> 02:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
polypropylene cap that is used on top of
 
02:24:56.389 --> 02:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
those products and then once we have
 
02:24:58.269 --> 02:24:58.279 align:start position:0%
those separated and cleaned and washed
 
02:25:00.550 --> 02:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
we extrude them and then make pellets
 
02:25:02.030 --> 02:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
out of them so that we can then send
 
02:25:05.309 --> 02:25:05.319 align:start position:0%
them along the process um that's those
 
02:25:07.910 --> 02:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
are called mechanical and mechanical is
 
02:25:09.670 --> 02:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
the very classic way that we think about
 
02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
recycling in the United States and
 
02:25:13.389 --> 02:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
elsewhere there are also a growing
 
02:25:15.309 --> 02:25:15.319 align:start position:0%
amount of of other recycling
 
02:25:17.389 --> 02:25:17.399 align:start position:0%
Technologies um in the pl Plastics
 
02:25:19.269 --> 02:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
industry um some people call them
 
02:25:20.990 --> 02:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
Advanced I think that there are some
 
02:25:23.309 --> 02:25:23.319 align:start position:0%
pretty amazing mechanical recycling
 
02:25:25.750 --> 02:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
Innovations so um generally they don't
 
02:25:27.429 --> 02:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
like it when we call these Advanced and
 
02:25:30.110 --> 02:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
I totally get that so it's generally
 
02:25:32.510 --> 02:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
Advanced molecular or chemical and these
 
02:25:34.190 --> 02:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
are technologies that enable us to
 
02:25:36.870 --> 02:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
recycle materials that are too degraded
 
02:25:40.230 --> 02:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
so if you recycle um a pet bottle a
 
02:25:41.790 --> 02:25:41.800 align:start position:0%
certain number of times over time it
 
02:25:43.469 --> 02:25:43.479 align:start position:0%
gets a little grayer and a little bit
 
02:25:45.550 --> 02:25:45.560 align:start position:0%
yellower that's for a lot of reasons
 
02:25:48.349 --> 02:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
food contamination the heat process
 
02:25:51.469 --> 02:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
itself um and so after too long we need
 
02:25:54.550 --> 02:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
to recycle that and remake new polymers
 
02:25:56.110 --> 02:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
by the way that number is six and I
 
02:25:57.750 --> 02:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
think I find really interesting when I
 
02:25:59.590 --> 02:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
say our issues are the same as other
 
02:26:02.190 --> 02:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
issues um you can only really typically
 
02:26:04.670 --> 02:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
recycle fiber six times as well before
 
02:26:06.510 --> 02:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
it needs to be discarded but the
 
02:26:08.190 --> 02:26:08.200 align:start position:0%
difference between fiber products like
 
02:26:10.550 --> 02:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
paper and Plastics is that we can take
 
02:26:12.510 --> 02:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
those materials and we can make them
 
02:26:14.550 --> 02:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
into new products again through
 
02:26:16.910 --> 02:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
Technologies like purification de
 
02:26:19.550 --> 02:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
lization or a form of conversion like
 
02:26:21.950 --> 02:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
gasification or paralysis that makes a
 
02:26:24.070 --> 02:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
very basic feed stock that's much like
 
02:26:26.429 --> 02:26:26.439 align:start position:0%
oil or natural gas that we then use to
 
02:26:29.230 --> 02:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
make Plastics all over again this also
 
02:26:30.870 --> 02:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
really helps for certain types of
 
02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
applications like medical or food
 
02:26:34.910 --> 02:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
contact where we want to make sure that
 
02:26:38.630 --> 02:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
those contamination rates are very very
 
02:26:41.070 --> 02:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
low and then finally when we talk about
 
02:26:43.349 --> 02:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
conversion right so in the United States
 
02:26:46.150 --> 02:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
we recycle about 6 billion pounds of
 
02:26:47.950 --> 02:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
recycled plastic Plastics each year
 
02:26:51.030 --> 02:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's a really great number but it's
 
02:26:54.230 --> 02:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
candidly not enough that reflects to um
 
02:26:57.429 --> 02:26:57.439 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 8 and 10% of recycling
 
02:27:00.070 --> 02:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
a year it's not a great number but it's
 
02:27:02.230 --> 02:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
also very misleading compared to other
 
02:27:05.110 --> 02:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
types of products or materials because
 
02:27:07.710 --> 02:27:07.720 align:start position:0%
that number in our denominator includes
 
02:27:09.950 --> 02:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
the amount of plastic that is used in
 
02:27:13.790 --> 02:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
cars and in other durable applications
 
02:27:17.309 --> 02:27:17.319 align:start position:0%
whereas in other materials um those can
 
02:27:17.319 --> 02:27:19.550 align:start position:0%
whereas in other materials um those can
be

02:27:19.550 --> 02:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:27:21.950 --> 02:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
uh those are less common and so their
 
02:27:23.550 --> 02:27:23.560 align:start position:0%
recycling rates are often reflected to
 
02:27:26.030 --> 02:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
be very high and we'll talk a little bit
 
02:27:27.710 --> 02:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
about when we talk about specific
 
02:27:30.030 --> 02:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
product types how those can work in a
 
02:27:33.349 --> 02:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
different way um the conversion process
 
02:27:35.230 --> 02:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
is complicated and using recycled
 
02:27:37.190 --> 02:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
content especially mechanically recycled
 
02:27:41.389 --> 02:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
content is not necessarily easy um it as
 
02:27:44.190 --> 02:27:44.200 align:start position:0%
material tends to be more expensive um
 
02:27:46.790 --> 02:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
there is a premium relative to virgin
 
02:27:48.950 --> 02:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
because obviously there were a lot more
 
02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
costs associated with the processing of
 
02:27:54.990 --> 02:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
that material um and also that process
 
02:27:57.110 --> 02:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
especially mechanically could impact the
 
02:27:59.230 --> 02:27:59.240 align:start position:0%
mechanical or aesthetic appearances of
 
02:28:02.990 --> 02:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
those products um like viscosity so
 
02:28:05.630 --> 02:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
imagine anticipating having to work with
 
02:28:08.110 --> 02:28:08.120 align:start position:0%
something that kind of flowed like maple
 
02:28:10.670 --> 02:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
syrup and then instead having to deal
 
02:28:12.790 --> 02:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
with something that flowed like honey
 
02:28:15.030 --> 02:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
right so those are very different and as
 
02:28:18.269 --> 02:28:18.279 align:start position:0%
we try to use use our molds to make new
 
02:28:20.190 --> 02:28:20.200 align:start position:0%
Plastics we have to think about those in
 
02:28:23.710 --> 02:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
different ways um so when often I talk
 
02:28:24.990 --> 02:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
about this and that's collection
 
02:28:27.870 --> 02:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
sortation and processing um people are
 
02:28:31.030 --> 02:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
always like so the product tends to have
 
02:28:34.030 --> 02:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
you know aesthetic differences which are
 
02:28:35.830 --> 02:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
really important to communicate to
 
02:28:37.870 --> 02:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
Consumers so that they don't look at a
 
02:28:39.389 --> 02:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
gray bottle and think something's wrong
 
02:28:40.630 --> 02:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
with that package and they don't want to
 
02:28:44.550 --> 02:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
buy it um it's more expensive um and
 
02:28:46.830 --> 02:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
people love to say that they will that
 
02:28:48.710 --> 02:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
they want to they want to buy more
 
02:28:51.150 --> 02:28:51.160 align:start position:0%
recycled content if you ask them over
 
02:28:53.230 --> 02:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
70% of people will say that they're
 
02:28:56.590 --> 02:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
willing to pay more for recycled content
 
02:28:58.190 --> 02:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
but I think that if you ask those people
 
02:28:59.990 --> 02:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
if they went to church if they voted
 
02:29:01.269 --> 02:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
somewhere outside of New Hampshire where
 
02:29:02.429 --> 02:29:02.439 align:start position:0%
you'll have a much higher engagement
 
02:29:04.870 --> 02:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
rate um or floss like they're also going
 
02:29:06.469 --> 02:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
to say that they they do that really
 
02:29:09.230 --> 02:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
high it there it's really easy to say it
 
02:29:11.950 --> 02:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
um it's not necessarily as easy to show
 
02:29:14.230 --> 02:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
it and actually do it in real
 
02:29:18.590 --> 02:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
life so it's a challenge for us but how
 
02:29:20.910 --> 02:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
are we doing so if we talk about
 
02:29:22.990 --> 02:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
recycling rates as I mentioned earlier
 
02:29:25.150 --> 02:29:25.160 align:start position:0%
about that National recycling rate we
 
02:29:26.590 --> 02:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
actually say in the United States that
 
02:29:29.030 --> 02:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
we recycle our our total recycling rate
 
02:29:32.070 --> 02:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
is about 32% of material not great we
 
02:29:33.710 --> 02:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
definitely want to do better and we're
 
02:29:36.710 --> 02:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
working on ways to do better on that um
 
02:29:39.110 --> 02:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
but I want to go back one more slide so
 
02:29:41.070 --> 02:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
before we jump to that but we also want
 
02:29:43.710 --> 02:29:43.720 align:start position:0%
to look at like State Recycling rates so
 
02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
your overall recycling rate in New
 
02:29:47.510 --> 02:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and this is is a source of the
 
02:29:49.710 --> 02:29:49.720 align:start position:0%
from ball the company that makes glass
 
02:29:52.269 --> 02:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
jars um this is their 50 states of
 
02:29:54.510 --> 02:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
recycling 2.0 um that they just
 
02:29:56.670 --> 02:29:56.680 align:start position:0%
published your overall recycling rate is
 
02:29:59.750 --> 02:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
23% with aluminum at 29 but pet
 
02:30:01.510 --> 02:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
recycling right so those materials that
 
02:30:04.710 --> 02:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
we're using in packaging also
 
02:30:07.150 --> 02:30:07.160 align:start position:0%
29% if we look and this is also from the
 
02:30:09.030 --> 02:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
recycling partnership state of recycling
 
02:30:12.110 --> 02:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
report um those numbers compared to
 
02:30:14.590 --> 02:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
nationally versus New Hampshire they
 
02:30:18.030 --> 02:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
vary widely but you know we do see that
 
02:30:20.230 --> 02:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
that especially for very common types of
 
02:30:22.750 --> 02:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
plastics packaging we do recycle them in
 
02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
ways that are somewhat comparable to
 
02:30:26.630 --> 02:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
those other types so we want to make
 
02:30:29.150 --> 02:30:29.160 align:start position:0%
sure that we are all working together to
 
02:30:32.070 --> 02:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
increase recycling
 
02:30:36.030 --> 02:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
overall um but if it's so expensive and
 
02:30:38.469 --> 02:30:38.479 align:start position:0%
it's uh and it's difficult to work with
 
02:30:40.790 --> 02:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
why do we do it candidly there are a lot
 
02:30:42.710 --> 02:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
of benefits to recycling and I think
 
02:30:44.389 --> 02:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
that you know we can talk a little bit
 
02:30:46.990 --> 02:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
more about that um during the discussion
 
02:30:48.670 --> 02:30:48.680 align:start position:0%
if you're interested I just want to
 
02:30:51.150 --> 02:30:51.160 align:start position:0%
summarize a few here quickly right so
 
02:30:54.389 --> 02:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
here is the current benefit of recycling
 
02:30:56.429 --> 02:30:56.439 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire economy through
 
02:30:58.230 --> 02:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
metals and other forms Electronics
 
02:30:59.790 --> 02:30:59.800 align:start position:0%
electronic recycling is actually very
 
02:31:03.349 --> 02:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
common here in New Hampshire um and what
 
02:31:05.150 --> 02:31:05.160 align:start position:0%
I'll also point out is as we grow
 
02:31:07.790 --> 02:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
recycling that is really great for jobs
 
02:31:11.150 --> 02:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
so for every 10,000 pounds of material
 
02:31:14.030 --> 02:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
that goes to landfill that that relates
 
02:31:17.030 --> 02:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
to about one job for every 10,000 pounds
 
02:31:19.990 --> 02:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
of material that's recycled that's 90
 
02:31:23.910 --> 02:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
jobs so more recycling is more jobs also
 
02:31:25.670 --> 02:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
we know that a little bit less than half
 
02:31:27.349 --> 02:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
of the material that goes to New
 
02:31:29.070 --> 02:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire landfills comes from out of
 
02:31:32.469 --> 02:31:32.479 align:start position:0%
state rather than being paid for at once
 
02:31:34.230 --> 02:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
recycling enables you to be paid for it
 
02:31:36.110 --> 02:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
twice both when it's collected and and
 
02:31:38.349 --> 02:31:38.359 align:start position:0%
then when you sell it again um it
 
02:31:40.510 --> 02:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
promotes resiliency right so we
 
02:31:43.269 --> 02:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
understood during covid that we actually
 
02:31:46.070 --> 02:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
had a very fragile supply chain globally
 
02:31:48.550 --> 02:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
and so having recycled content in
 
02:31:51.190 --> 02:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
internally enables us to be able to help
 
02:31:53.630 --> 02:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
kind of smooth out some of those bumps
 
02:31:55.469 --> 02:31:55.479 align:start position:0%
it's also just candidly resource
 
02:31:58.269 --> 02:31:58.279 align:start position:0%
conservation right so many of the things
 
02:32:00.550 --> 02:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
that we use are finite and so we want to
 
02:32:02.429 --> 02:32:02.439 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are using them for as
 
02:32:04.790 --> 02:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
long as possible at the highest use
 
02:32:08.510 --> 02:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
possible um but that's also also means
 
02:32:12.030 --> 02:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
less energy and less water use so
 
02:32:14.550 --> 02:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
recycled content versus material so it
 
02:32:17.469 --> 02:32:17.479 align:start position:0%
takes 75% less energy to generally
 
02:32:19.510 --> 02:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
manufact to recycle a product than it
 
02:32:21.230 --> 02:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
does to manufacture it from a raw
 
02:32:23.510 --> 02:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
material so making sure that that's
 
02:32:24.870 --> 02:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
really important and then landfill
 
02:32:26.830 --> 02:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
diversion New Hampshire has a goal to
 
02:32:28.910 --> 02:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
reduce a certain amount of your landfill
 
02:32:31.550 --> 02:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
over time um and so by being able to
 
02:32:33.790 --> 02:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
recycle that it's really
 
02:32:37.469 --> 02:32:37.479 align:start position:0%
important and then talking very leastly
 
02:32:39.429 --> 02:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
again I'll I'll discuss a lot of this
 
02:32:41.670 --> 02:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
during discussion if you have questions
 
02:32:43.469 --> 02:32:43.479 align:start position:0%
but thinking about policies that can
 
02:32:45.550 --> 02:32:45.560 align:start position:0%
really help support recycling here in
 
02:32:47.349 --> 02:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire thinking about things like
 
02:32:49.750 --> 02:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
increasing access right recognizing that
 
02:32:52.790 --> 02:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
that multif Family Access is so low how
 
02:32:54.790 --> 02:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
do we increase that how do we enable
 
02:32:56.990 --> 02:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
that everybody can recycle as easily as
 
02:32:57.830 --> 02:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
they can
 
02:33:00.550 --> 02:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
landfill um increasing and developing
 
02:33:02.990 --> 02:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
instate sortation and processing how can
 
02:33:04.950 --> 02:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
you actually collect and sort that
 
02:33:06.950 --> 02:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
material inside the state of New
 
02:33:09.150 --> 02:33:09.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rather than exporting it
 
02:33:11.150 --> 02:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
because sorted material is more valuable
 
02:33:13.630 --> 02:33:13.640 align:start position:0%
even if it's being processed elsewhere
 
02:33:15.230 --> 02:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
um or and then even again going a step
 
02:33:18.070 --> 02:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
further and process seen it here as well
 
02:33:20.230 --> 02:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire has has already done
 
02:33:22.030 --> 02:33:22.040 align:start position:0%
one one thing to help with that in the
 
02:33:24.190 --> 02:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
advanced recycling space is a
 
02:33:26.550 --> 02:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
recognizing that advanced advanced
 
02:33:29.309 --> 02:33:29.319 align:start position:0%
recycling is manufacturing and so is
 
02:33:32.590 --> 02:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
permanent as such um we can also support
 
02:33:34.750 --> 02:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
demand and that can be by establishing
 
02:33:36.710 --> 02:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
minimum recycled content standards that
 
02:33:39.550 --> 02:33:39.560 align:start position:0%
I think are real and attainable uh for
 
02:33:41.230 --> 02:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
for type types of products that's a
 
02:33:43.550 --> 02:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
really great way to actually pull
 
02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
product through that entire process
 
02:33:47.790 --> 02:33:47.800 align:start position:0%
because if there's a demand at the end
 
02:33:50.389 --> 02:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
if people really want this or need this
 
02:33:52.950 --> 02:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
we will find ways we will innovate it is
 
02:33:56.070 --> 02:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
it is a it is a signal to invest and
 
02:33:58.230 --> 02:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
then also using the power of the purse
 
02:34:00.030 --> 02:34:00.040 align:start position:0%
right preferential State purchasing you
 
02:34:03.150 --> 02:34:03.160 align:start position:0%
do recognize that that um recycled
 
02:34:06.469 --> 02:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
content is ideal and so finding ways to
 
02:34:08.630 --> 02:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
further encourage that is really great
 
02:34:11.269 --> 02:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
one caveat here I will say is I think
 
02:34:14.070 --> 02:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
that there is a a goal of trying to make
 
02:34:15.870 --> 02:34:15.880 align:start position:0%
sure that you use the product that has
 
02:34:18.389 --> 02:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
the most recycled content you want to
 
02:34:20.990 --> 02:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that you are thoughtful um
 
02:34:24.469 --> 02:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
comparing apples and oranges so 100%
 
02:34:28.510 --> 02:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
paper product and a 30% uh pet bottle
 
02:34:31.510 --> 02:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
for example they will have different um
 
02:34:33.670 --> 02:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
Greenhouse Gas Energy costs and things
 
02:34:35.990 --> 02:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
so recognizing that from a life cycle
 
02:34:37.710 --> 02:34:37.720 align:start position:0%
analysis perspective you still want to
 
02:34:40.269 --> 02:34:40.279 align:start position:0%
make sure or it's it's ideal to make
 
02:34:41.750 --> 02:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
sure that you were you were choosing the
 
02:34:43.190 --> 02:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
one with the lowest environmental
 
02:34:45.269 --> 02:34:45.279 align:start position:0%
footprint and then extended producer
 
02:34:47.230 --> 02:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility and return to deposit
 
02:34:49.389 --> 02:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
schemes these are a really great way to
 
02:34:51.910 --> 02:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
pay for this like I said this equipment
 
02:34:54.870 --> 02:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
is very expensive trying to find ways to
 
02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
incentivize and and educate people on
 
02:35:00.910 --> 02:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
how to actually collect and and recycle
 
02:35:03.590 --> 02:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
the material is really really um
 
02:35:06.269 --> 02:35:06.279 align:start position:0%
important I think over time the industry
 
02:35:09.190 --> 02:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
has evolved and we are very supportive
 
02:35:12.990 --> 02:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
of good epr what is good epr right so
 
02:35:16.670 --> 02:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
it's realistic um it includes uh it's
 
02:35:19.030 --> 02:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
not punitive it includes all materials
 
02:35:21.510 --> 02:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
that go into the bin and other things to
 
02:35:23.950 --> 02:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
consider which we can talk about during
 
02:35:25.990 --> 02:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
discussion and then return deposit
 
02:35:28.230 --> 02:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
schemes many people know those as as
 
02:35:30.550 --> 02:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
bottle bills um so that's actually a
 
02:35:33.110 --> 02:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
really really effective way to collect
 
02:35:35.590 --> 02:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
um those states that have bottle bills
 
02:35:37.630 --> 02:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
actually have a significantly higher
 
02:35:40.190 --> 02:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
recycling rate um for those products
 
02:35:43.030 --> 02:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
compared to those who don't um and they
 
02:35:44.790 --> 02:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
are not necessarily just for bottles
 
02:35:46.870 --> 02:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
they they're used WID ly throughout
 
02:35:49.910 --> 02:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
other materials as well but they are a
 
02:35:54.309 --> 02:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
really great uh policy tool um so with
 
02:35:57.510 --> 02:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
that um I want to save time for
 
02:35:58.990 --> 02:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
questions and so I want to thank
 
02:36:01.830 --> 02:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
everybody for for your your patience as
 
02:36:05.389 --> 02:36:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:09.230 --> 02:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
slides thank you Mr creger that was um
 
02:36:09.240 --> 02:36:10.230 align:start position:0%
slides thank you Mr creger that was um
very

02:36:10.230 --> 02:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:36:13.429 --> 02:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
interesting um my my question
 
02:36:16.790 --> 02:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
is what I find
 
02:36:20.550 --> 02:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
as a consumer recycler person who
 
02:36:23.190 --> 02:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
recycles whatever
 
02:36:27.190 --> 02:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
um with our transfer stations in New
 
02:36:29.110 --> 02:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as you know we bring our trash
 
02:36:32.990 --> 02:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
to a collection point and they have you
 
02:36:34.910 --> 02:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
know recycling bins that you can put
 
02:36:37.830 --> 02:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
things in there are certain things that
 
02:36:40.870 --> 02:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
they won't take that are you know the
 
02:36:43.150 --> 02:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
the number threes or fours or fives or
 
02:36:45.550 --> 02:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
sixes of you know that the little number
 
02:36:46.870 --> 02:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
that's in in the little
 
02:36:50.309 --> 02:36:50.319 align:start position:0%
triangle and if they may take some they
 
02:36:52.750 --> 02:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
may take them but they can't be blue or
 
02:36:55.830 --> 02:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
black colored and so people find that
 
02:36:57.750 --> 02:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
very frustrating that because they want
 
02:36:59.590 --> 02:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
to recycle these
 
02:37:05.030 --> 02:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
materials but we have issues with
 
02:37:07.630 --> 02:37:07.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities rejecting them because
 
02:37:10.469 --> 02:37:10.479 align:start position:0%
maybe they can't find a market to sell
 
02:37:12.510 --> 02:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
them to or get them
 
02:37:16.469 --> 02:37:16.479 align:start position:0%
to how how do we how do we work with
 
02:37:19.830 --> 02:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
that I think first of all I recognize
 
02:37:22.550 --> 02:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
that that is very uh frustrating I also
 
02:37:25.389 --> 02:37:25.399 align:start position:0%
recycle at home and I'm like okay what
 
02:37:29.389 --> 02:37:29.399 align:start position:0%
can I recycle here what can't I um so I
 
02:37:30.590 --> 02:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
think there's two different things that
 
02:37:33.389 --> 02:37:33.399 align:start position:0%
we can do to address those issues one we
 
02:37:35.349 --> 02:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
as an industry are working on things
 
02:37:37.750 --> 02:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
like designing for recycling ensuring
 
02:37:39.910 --> 02:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
that the products that we make more
 
02:37:42.550 --> 02:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
closely conform to the recycling system
 
02:37:44.309 --> 02:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
that we have in the United States you
 
02:37:46.389 --> 02:37:46.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned colored versus CLE clear
 
02:37:49.150 --> 02:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
colored products often tend to be very
 
02:37:51.269 --> 02:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
difficult to recycle because they T the
 
02:37:53.990 --> 02:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
end result and so when a company then
 
02:37:55.910 --> 02:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
wants to buy that material on the other
 
02:37:58.150 --> 02:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
side they want to use it in a colored
 
02:37:59.750 --> 02:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
application so it becomes very
 
02:38:02.670 --> 02:38:02.680 align:start position:0%
challenging so thinking about ways to
 
02:38:05.590 --> 02:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
encourage clear um and not necessarily
 
02:38:07.790 --> 02:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
just clear but things like that um
 
02:38:09.990 --> 02:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
making sure that we are designing parts
 
02:38:11.910 --> 02:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
so that they can be easily removed so
 
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
that we don't contaminate different
 
02:38:16.110 --> 02:38:16.120 align:start position:0%
types of streams which is often a a
 
02:38:17.990 --> 02:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
similar problem why some items get
 
02:38:21.550 --> 02:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
rejected um but then we also on the back
 
02:38:25.150 --> 02:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
end are working on new technologies that
 
02:38:26.590 --> 02:38:26.600 align:start position:0%
will enable us to collect those
 
02:38:28.830 --> 02:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
materials so or or recycle those
 
02:38:31.150 --> 02:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
materials a really great example is a
 
02:38:32.510 --> 02:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
collaborative that's happening in
 
02:38:35.870 --> 02:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
Houston Texas so uh that is work that's
 
02:38:39.429 --> 02:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
being done by cylix Exxon lion delbel
 
02:38:41.349 --> 02:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
and a few other organizations I
 
02:38:44.230 --> 02:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
apologize for skipping their names but
 
02:38:46.469 --> 02:38:46.479 align:start position:0%
they have Community drop off hubs in
 
02:38:48.990 --> 02:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
Kingwood Texas and other locations and
 
02:38:50.950 --> 02:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
they enable you to just put all of your
 
02:38:52.990 --> 02:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
Plastics into a bag which makes it
 
02:38:54.950 --> 02:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
actually really easy to recycle it you
 
02:38:56.710 --> 02:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
can put it all in the same bag and then
 
02:38:58.990 --> 02:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
put it in there and then cyclics will
 
02:39:01.830 --> 02:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
then separate all of that material and
 
02:39:03.870 --> 02:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
those those colored products and those
 
02:39:05.389 --> 02:39:05.399 align:start position:0%
products that wouldn't necessarily be
 
02:39:07.469 --> 02:39:07.479 align:start position:0%
able to have an individual Market can
 
02:39:08.870 --> 02:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
then be recycled through advanced
 
02:39:11.510 --> 02:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
recycling Technologies thank you
 
02:39:13.670 --> 02:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
02:39:15.230 --> 02:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
02:39:18.030 --> 02:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
so as a parent of three children I can
 
02:39:20.950 --> 02:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
tell you that my mind goes to places uh
 
02:39:23.110 --> 02:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
that it it just nearly explodes some
 
02:39:24.590 --> 02:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
days when we're looking at toys or
 
02:39:26.389 --> 02:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
sporting equipment or any of those types
 
02:39:28.910 --> 02:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
of things and we work really hard to try
 
02:39:32.870 --> 02:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
and find um those mailin or rebate
 
02:39:36.510 --> 02:39:36.520 align:start position:0%
places or drop off uh in store centers
 
02:39:37.990 --> 02:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
um and they're feeling far between to be
 
02:39:41.269 --> 02:39:41.279 align:start position:0%
honest um so I guess my question to you
 
02:39:43.910 --> 02:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
would be where does epr fit in this
 
02:39:46.590 --> 02:39:46.600 align:start position:0%
whole conversation around
 
02:39:48.950 --> 02:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
specifically kid oriented and family
 
02:39:52.309 --> 02:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
oriented things that we use in our daily
 
02:39:55.429 --> 02:39:55.439 align:start position:0%
lives yeah I love that question because
 
02:39:57.590 --> 02:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
I think that uh parents do have a lot of
 
02:39:59.710 --> 02:39:59.720 align:start position:0%
challenges because of the types of
 
02:40:01.990 --> 02:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
products that they have and you know and
 
02:40:03.510 --> 02:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
they get so many from every single
 
02:40:05.150 --> 02:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
birthday and and they they sometimes
 
02:40:07.469 --> 02:40:07.479 align:start position:0%
just show up from school but also the
 
02:40:09.630 --> 02:40:09.640 align:start position:0%
types of packaging that is you know
 
02:40:12.830 --> 02:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
single serf packaging for for kids um
 
02:40:14.590 --> 02:40:14.600 align:start position:0%
it's a challenge first of all I commend
 
02:40:17.030 --> 02:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
you for looking for reuse use options so
 
02:40:18.950 --> 02:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
when we talk about that waste hierarchy
 
02:40:20.510 --> 02:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
we do want to make sure that we are
 
02:40:23.389 --> 02:40:23.399 align:start position:0%
thinking about recycling as the last
 
02:40:26.309 --> 02:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
option right so we do want to reduce if
 
02:40:28.070 --> 02:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
you don't need these products don't buy
 
02:40:30.309 --> 02:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
these products find ways to reuse them
 
02:40:33.870 --> 02:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
or you know be able to donate them and
 
02:40:36.750 --> 02:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
find ways to to uh extend their lives
 
02:40:40.429 --> 02:40:40.439 align:start position:0%
that way um epr can be very helpful in
 
02:40:42.389 --> 02:40:42.399 align:start position:0%
those for what we often call like large
 
02:40:45.469 --> 02:40:45.479 align:start position:0%
bulky items um because they can help in
 
02:40:47.630 --> 02:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
incentivize the collection of those
 
02:40:49.870 --> 02:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
materials um in some way either through
 
02:40:52.670 --> 02:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
the deposits I will say that the that
 
02:40:54.790 --> 02:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
you need to construct epr in such a way
 
02:40:57.190 --> 02:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
that is thinking about those kinds of
 
02:40:59.429 --> 02:40:59.439 align:start position:0%
objects most epr in the United States
 
02:41:01.910 --> 02:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
and other places are really focused on
 
02:41:04.510 --> 02:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
packaging right and so and most of the
 
02:41:07.830 --> 02:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
materials that we are recycling in in
 
02:41:10.830 --> 02:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
our communities and murfs Etc are are
 
02:41:14.389 --> 02:41:14.399 align:start position:0%
packaging items so those items can be
 
02:41:16.750 --> 02:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
addressed by epr some ways but thinking
 
02:41:18.510 --> 02:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
about policies specifically that could
 
02:41:21.070 --> 02:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
encourage that such as Grant programs
 
02:41:23.230 --> 02:41:23.240 align:start position:0%
the EPA has been working on those right
 
02:41:27.389 --> 02:41:27.399 align:start position:0%
now um to increase re uh Recycling and
 
02:41:31.030 --> 02:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
new Innovative uh collection
 
02:41:34.110 --> 02:41:34.120 align:start position:0%
methods representative
 
02:41:36.670 --> 02:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
bman thank you madam chair and thank you
 
02:41:38.910 --> 02:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um this is all
 
02:41:41.230 --> 02:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
very new to me so uh one thing that we
 
02:41:43.389 --> 02:41:43.399 align:start position:0%
heard in previous testimony and I'm
 
02:41:46.590 --> 02:41:46.600 align:start position:0%
sorry if I missed this is um the
 
02:41:49.750 --> 02:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
percentage of a plastic product that is
 
02:41:51.150 --> 02:41:51.160 align:start position:0%
able to be
 
02:41:55.429 --> 02:41:55.439 align:start position:0%
recycled and then in terms of of
 
02:41:58.190 --> 02:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
creating new plastic items that only a
 
02:42:01.630 --> 02:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
small percentage of that new product can
 
02:42:04.670 --> 02:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
include recycled products so I I don't
 
02:42:06.309 --> 02:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
remember the percentage right but I I
 
02:42:07.950 --> 02:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
think it was something like even if you
 
02:42:12.349 --> 02:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
create a bottle with recycled plastic
 
02:42:14.750 --> 02:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
that at least 30% of it had to be virgin
 
02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:15.870 align:start position:0%
that at least 30% of it had to be virgin
plastic

02:42:15.870 --> 02:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
plastic
 
02:42:18.389 --> 02:42:18.399 align:start position:0%
so it it seems like it might help a
 
02:42:21.269 --> 02:42:21.279 align:start position:0%
little but my question is do you do you
 
02:42:23.469 --> 02:42:23.479 align:start position:0%
have any information on that like what
 
02:42:27.110 --> 02:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
is the percentage that that that can be
 
02:42:29.110 --> 02:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
used in a new product I guess thank you
 
02:42:32.110 --> 02:42:32.120 align:start position:0%
for letting me talk through that sure um
 
02:42:35.550 --> 02:42:35.560 align:start position:0%
and and yes it it varies per product and
 
02:42:38.150 --> 02:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
and the reason being is because of that
 
02:42:40.469 --> 02:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
mechanically recycled aspect where there
 
02:42:42.830 --> 02:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
are again aesthetic issues or also
 
02:42:45.590 --> 02:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
mechanical issues where as we recycle
 
02:42:48.230 --> 02:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
these products that it may again in um
 
02:42:49.830 --> 02:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
address they may become more brittle
 
02:42:52.870 --> 02:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
over time things like that so in some
 
02:42:55.230 --> 02:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
applications we do need to incorporate
 
02:42:57.870 --> 02:42:57.880 align:start position:0%
new um virgin material to help kind of
 
02:42:59.990 --> 02:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
support that or use other forms of
 
02:43:03.630 --> 02:43:03.640 align:start position:0%
additives um that is not uh that there's
 
02:43:06.230 --> 02:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
not like a single number like no product
 
02:43:09.070 --> 02:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
can only have 30% in fact a pet bottle
 
02:43:12.429 --> 02:43:12.439 align:start position:0%
can have 100% um postc consumer
 
02:43:14.830 --> 02:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
mechanically recycled content in it for
 
02:43:18.389 --> 02:43:18.399 align:start position:0%
example the pet bottle itself um certain
 
02:43:21.309 --> 02:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
large blown film applications like for
 
02:43:23.910 --> 02:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
certain jug types that are made out of H
 
02:43:25.230 --> 02:43:25.240 align:start position:0%
um highdensity
 
02:43:28.349 --> 02:43:28.359 align:start position:0%
polyethylene um are uh they they may
 
02:43:32.710 --> 02:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
need up to 20% virgin right so that just
 
02:43:35.389 --> 02:43:35.399 align:start position:0%
be that is enable to select it so the
 
02:43:38.190 --> 02:43:38.200 align:start position:0%
the challenge is by material it differs
 
02:43:40.910 --> 02:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
and then the added complication is with
 
02:43:44.230 --> 02:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
Advanced recycling we can then enable
 
02:43:47.429 --> 02:43:47.439 align:start position:0%
100% recy recycled content as well so
 
02:43:49.429 --> 02:43:49.439 align:start position:0%
there's no great number right there that
 
02:43:52.349 --> 02:43:52.359 align:start position:0%
really currently exists um I'm sorry to
 
02:43:55.510 --> 02:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
say but it it would vary by product um
 
02:43:56.830 --> 02:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
and we want to make sure how we can
 
02:43:59.750 --> 02:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
increase it more and more followup um
 
02:44:02.710 --> 02:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
sure thank you um you you know you noted
 
02:44:06.030 --> 02:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
oh there are these specific ones um do
 
02:44:08.710 --> 02:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
you have any sense of again I'm looking
 
02:44:11.349 --> 02:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
if you don't have the number but is that
 
02:44:14.469 --> 02:44:14.479 align:start position:0%
more than it's not is it a small number
 
02:44:16.590 --> 02:44:16.600 align:start position:0%
that can that is like
 
02:44:21.510 --> 02:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
100% um recycled materials is that 1%
 
02:44:24.070 --> 02:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
can you give me some idea of like what
 
02:44:26.070 --> 02:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here in terms of
 
02:44:28.710 --> 02:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
What's um you
 
02:44:32.150 --> 02:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
know what is able to be recy I hear you
 
02:44:34.550 --> 02:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you I hear you and and and
 
02:44:35.990 --> 02:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
yeah we're we're we're veering into
 
02:44:38.230 --> 02:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
speculation so recognize this is this is
 
02:44:42.510 --> 02:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
a this is a a scientific wild guess um
 
02:44:44.750 --> 02:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
but that number is actually very high
 
02:44:47.030 --> 02:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
right so more and more we are increasing
 
02:44:48.830 --> 02:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
our ability to use more and more
 
02:44:53.110 --> 02:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
mechanically recycled content um so for
 
02:44:55.910 --> 02:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
rigid products things that have uh you
 
02:44:58.750 --> 02:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
know large wall thicknesses things like
 
02:45:00.670 --> 02:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
that we can have much much higher
 
02:45:04.309 --> 02:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
content somewhere closer to 75 even up
 
02:45:07.630 --> 02:45:07.640 align:start position:0%
to 100% for things that are very very
 
02:45:10.830 --> 02:45:10.840 align:start position:0%
thin or very very flexible like films
 
02:45:12.790 --> 02:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
making sure that we have the ability
 
02:45:14.790 --> 02:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
that they still be able to not have
 
02:45:16.550 --> 02:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
holes which is kind of counterproductive
 
02:45:19.830 --> 02:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
to a film bag and for example um you
 
02:45:22.150 --> 02:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
know those numbers vary and postc
 
02:45:23.710 --> 02:45:23.720 align:start position:0%
consumer recycle content can be
 
02:45:27.110 --> 02:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
somewhere like 15 to 20% po industrial
 
02:45:29.389 --> 02:45:29.399 align:start position:0%
content which is has which is much
 
02:45:32.670 --> 02:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
cleaner um which has fewer contamination
 
02:45:34.910 --> 02:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
um and has it gone through um fewer heat
 
02:45:36.750 --> 02:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
Cycles you can you can increase that
 
02:45:41.469 --> 02:45:41.479 align:start position:0%
even further maybe to uh 30
 
02:45:44.150 --> 02:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
40% U representive Bixby and then
 
02:45:46.030 --> 02:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
representive poen
 
02:45:48.230 --> 02:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
yeah so one
 
02:45:51.309 --> 02:45:51.319 align:start position:0%
challenge seems to with mechanical
 
02:45:54.030 --> 02:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
recycling is excuse
 
02:45:58.110 --> 02:45:58.120 align:start position:0%
me is the um potential
 
02:46:01.389 --> 02:46:01.399 align:start position:0%
contamination and and this can come from
 
02:46:04.550 --> 02:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
both what was in the in the container
 
02:46:07.830 --> 02:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
that was recycled and also what is in
 
02:46:12.110 --> 02:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
the plastic that is being uh recycled to
 
02:46:14.830 --> 02:46:14.840 align:start position:0%
get there so be all Plastics have you
 
02:46:17.190 --> 02:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
know various plasticizers and other
 
02:46:19.910 --> 02:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
things that change the color and the um
 
02:46:23.389 --> 02:46:23.399 align:start position:0%
you know radiation or UV resistance etc
 
02:46:25.349 --> 02:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
etc um
 
02:46:29.550 --> 02:46:29.560 align:start position:0%
and so and those things can make it
 
02:46:34.309 --> 02:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
unacceptable for food contact so um it
 
02:46:38.670 --> 02:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
seems like the uh chemical recycling or
 
02:46:41.710 --> 02:46:41.720 align:start position:0%
Advanced recycling might be a better
 
02:46:44.030 --> 02:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
option for food contact first of all is
 
02:46:46.870 --> 02:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
there so the question is in two part a
 
02:46:49.790 --> 02:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
couple parts one
 
02:46:52.230 --> 02:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
is is there a possibility of using
 
02:46:55.309 --> 02:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
mechanically recycled material for for
 
02:46:55.319 --> 02:46:56.630 align:start position:0%
mechanically recycled material for for
food

02:46:56.630 --> 02:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
food
 
02:47:01.429 --> 02:47:01.439 align:start position:0%
contact and how uh how can we increase
 
02:47:04.510 --> 02:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
the amount of chemical chemically
 
02:47:08.110 --> 02:47:08.120 align:start position:0%
recycled uh material for uh that would
 
02:47:10.150 --> 02:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
be available for food contact because
 
02:47:12.230 --> 02:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
that would you know definitely you have
 
02:47:14.230 --> 02:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
more control over the pro final product
 
02:47:18.349 --> 02:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
there uh and uh are we at a point of
 
02:47:19.990 --> 02:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
being at a at a scale where that's going
 
02:47:23.750 --> 02:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
to be useful for a broad swath of the uh
 
02:47:23.760 --> 02:47:24.670 align:start position:0%
to be useful for a broad swath of the uh
food

02:47:24.670 --> 02:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
food
 
02:47:27.950 --> 02:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
containers sure and I may miss aspects
 
02:47:30.269 --> 02:47:30.279 align:start position:0%
of that so please feel free to you know
 
02:47:32.750 --> 02:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
keep me honest and if I if I miss those
 
02:47:37.110 --> 02:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
but yes so um mechanically recycled
 
02:47:39.830 --> 02:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
content can be used in food food contact
 
02:47:42.150 --> 02:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
applications it's actually widely used
 
02:47:44.830 --> 02:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
right now we do love to see more
 
02:47:46.910 --> 02:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
recycled content in general which also
 
02:47:49.389 --> 02:47:49.399 align:start position:0%
means in those food contact applications
 
02:47:51.870 --> 02:47:51.880 align:start position:0%
right I I just gave an example of a pet
 
02:47:54.750 --> 02:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
soft drink bottle that can be you know
 
02:47:58.150 --> 02:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
mechanically recycled at 100% so we have
 
02:48:01.389 --> 02:48:01.399 align:start position:0%
the ability to do that it does require a
 
02:48:04.630 --> 02:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
very specific um observation of how that
 
02:48:07.870 --> 02:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
material is collected and processed and
 
02:48:10.550 --> 02:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
we work with the FDA to make sure that
 
02:48:13.070 --> 02:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
those products at the end of the day um
 
02:48:15.510 --> 02:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
do not do not have the contamin or the
 
02:48:17.870 --> 02:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
contaminants that are in them are below
 
02:48:20.230 --> 02:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate levels um so that they can
 
02:48:24.349 --> 02:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
be used in food contact so so yes we do
 
02:48:27.150 --> 02:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
that yes we are working more and more um
 
02:48:29.469 --> 02:48:29.479 align:start position:0%
to enable us to recycle more of those
 
02:48:31.510 --> 02:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
products through mechanically recycled
 
02:48:33.469 --> 02:48:33.479 align:start position:0%
which and I would like to say like we
 
02:48:35.190 --> 02:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
really support mechanically recycled
 
02:48:37.110 --> 02:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
products like so compared to Advanced
 
02:48:39.469 --> 02:48:39.479 align:start position:0%
recycling um it it does have a lower
 
02:48:42.670 --> 02:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
energy input and it does and it is lower
 
02:48:45.110 --> 02:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
cost and so if a product can can be
 
02:48:46.910 --> 02:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
mechanically recycled it should be
 
02:48:50.790 --> 02:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
mechanically recycled uh so so um we
 
02:48:52.590 --> 02:48:52.600 align:start position:0%
would love to see more of that so I
 
02:48:55.269 --> 02:48:55.279 align:start position:0%
think one of the other parts of that is
 
02:48:57.870 --> 02:48:57.880 align:start position:0%
um how can we increase that so there's a
 
02:49:00.269 --> 02:49:00.279 align:start position:0%
few different ways so we are increasing
 
02:49:02.269 --> 02:49:02.279 align:start position:0%
um investment in those kinds of cleaning
 
02:49:04.590 --> 02:49:04.600 align:start position:0%
technologies that enable us to remove
 
02:49:08.830 --> 02:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
odors to um promote um the cleaning
 
02:49:10.590 --> 02:49:10.600 align:start position:0%
filtering of the of the products
 
02:49:13.070 --> 02:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
themselves um things like that so we are
 
02:49:15.510 --> 02:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
working in those spaces um and we are
 
02:49:17.990 --> 02:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
increasing that amount of content I will
 
02:49:20.550 --> 02:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
say that the amount of mechanically
 
02:49:22.790 --> 02:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
recycled content content that is
 
02:49:26.309 --> 02:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
approved for food contact does not meet
 
02:49:29.670 --> 02:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
the the projected demand so if you look
 
02:49:31.990 --> 02:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
at what brands have made for their
 
02:49:34.790 --> 02:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
commitments um we cannot currently meet
 
02:49:36.830 --> 02:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
that with that with that mechanically
 
02:49:40.229 --> 02:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
recycled content so we will need to um
 
02:49:43.229 --> 02:49:43.239 align:start position:0%
increase that supply and then also um
 
02:49:45.269 --> 02:49:45.279 align:start position:0%
help cover the the differ difference
 
02:49:47.830 --> 02:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
with um Advanced recycled content
 
02:49:47.840 --> 02:49:49.870 align:start position:0%
with um Advanced recycled content
representative

02:49:49.870 --> 02:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:49:52.590 --> 02:49:52.600 align:start position:0%
Penza and then representative
 
02:49:55.269 --> 02:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
Murray I just had a question concerning
 
02:49:58.389 --> 02:49:58.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire specifically and if um if
 
02:50:02.349 --> 02:50:02.359 align:start position:0%
you knew where our recycling is is going
 
02:50:04.630 --> 02:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
and being processed and then I have a
 
02:50:07.550 --> 02:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
other question um I don't have that
 
02:50:09.510 --> 02:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
information I apologize but there are
 
02:50:12.309 --> 02:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
several Lo local ones and and it makes
 
02:50:13.910 --> 02:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
much more sense from an economic
 
02:50:15.870 --> 02:50:15.880 align:start position:0%
perspective for those to to go very
 
02:50:19.469 --> 02:50:19.479 align:start position:0%
local so New Hampshire Massachusetts or
 
02:50:22.349 --> 02:50:22.359 align:start position:0%
uh Maine not New Hampshire excuse me
 
02:50:28.309 --> 02:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
Vermont followup so um I lived in in um
 
02:50:30.269 --> 02:50:30.279 align:start position:0%
on the Sea Coast in New Hampshire and so
 
02:50:32.990 --> 02:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
we had a transfer station uh in Rye and
 
02:50:35.910 --> 02:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
I got to know uh those guys really well
 
02:50:38.590 --> 02:50:38.600 align:start position:0%
I've I worked for a um water company so
 
02:50:40.590 --> 02:50:40.600 align:start position:0%
I followed like Plastics with water
 
02:50:42.950 --> 02:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
bottles and all that for a long time and
 
02:50:46.950 --> 02:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
huge thing about recycling um and it was
 
02:50:48.790 --> 02:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
um and they explained to me and most
 
02:50:50.790 --> 02:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
people just really didn't know so I just
 
02:50:53.110 --> 02:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
kind of wanted to um about New Hampshire
 
02:50:55.389 --> 02:50:55.399 align:start position:0%
just in specific so people would come
 
02:50:57.469 --> 02:50:57.479 align:start position:0%
there and they would they'd have you
 
02:50:59.110 --> 02:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
know certain buckets for certain things
 
02:51:00.229 --> 02:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
of course you couldn't you know you
 
02:51:02.269 --> 02:51:02.279 align:start position:0%
couldn't recycle any caps on bottles and
 
02:51:03.710 --> 02:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
all of that you have to put your caps
 
02:51:05.790 --> 02:51:05.800 align:start position:0%
separate um because they're all colored
 
02:51:08.309 --> 02:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
caps all that kind of stuff so but glass
 
02:51:10.190 --> 02:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
for example you know everybody was you
 
02:51:11.630 --> 02:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
know rinsed out all their stuff and
 
02:51:13.469 --> 02:51:13.479 align:start position:0%
threw their glass there but they weren't
 
02:51:15.750 --> 02:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
taking that it was in a big bin and all
 
02:51:16.990 --> 02:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
that glass was just going into a
 
02:51:18.469 --> 02:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
landfill that everybody thought that was
 
02:51:21.190 --> 02:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
being recycled um and there's also these
 
02:51:22.990 --> 02:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
single streams that are going on all
 
02:51:25.190 --> 02:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire where they think
 
02:51:27.790 --> 02:51:27.800 align:start position:0%
that their stuff is sorted and recycled
 
02:51:29.190 --> 02:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
and it's not it's going straight to
 
02:51:31.190 --> 02:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
landfill so I just didn't know if you
 
02:51:34.590 --> 02:51:34.600 align:start position:0%
could speak to any of that um these
 
02:51:37.070 --> 02:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
gentlemen at that transfer station told
 
02:51:41.710 --> 02:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
me you know the absolute truth and um
 
02:51:43.750 --> 02:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
and so people were going there and you
 
02:51:45.830 --> 02:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
know doing their d diligence but it
 
02:51:48.550 --> 02:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't yeah and they told me there's
 
02:51:50.070 --> 02:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
nothing really happening here in New
 
02:51:52.030 --> 02:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire most of that stuff once China
 
02:51:54.830 --> 02:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
stopped taking our recycling we were in
 
02:51:56.870 --> 02:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
a a real pickle so I'd love you to speak
 
02:51:58.269 --> 02:51:58.279 align:start position:0%
to some of that if you have any
 
02:52:01.229 --> 02:52:01.239 align:start position:0%
information sure happy to do that so I'm
 
02:52:02.830 --> 02:52:02.840 align:start position:0%
going to jump around apologies on that
 
02:52:06.190 --> 02:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
so the the the China point so um most
 
02:52:08.190 --> 02:52:08.200 align:start position:0%
recycling on the East Coast did not go
 
02:52:10.469 --> 02:52:10.479 align:start position:0%
to China so most of that would happen in
 
02:52:12.870 --> 02:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
the United States so um that reference
 
02:52:15.710 --> 02:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
by the way is in 2017 China decided that
 
02:52:17.950 --> 02:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
they would no longer accept mixed
 
02:52:20.910 --> 02:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
materials so Plastics and paper that was
 
02:52:24.309 --> 02:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
primarily on the west coast uh so in
 
02:52:26.870 --> 02:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
addition in the United States uh we
 
02:52:29.870 --> 02:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
recycle more than 90% of the material
 
02:52:32.349 --> 02:52:32.359 align:start position:0%
that is collected here um and we import
 
02:52:34.830 --> 02:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
a very small percentage of that to other
 
02:52:37.710 --> 02:52:37.720 align:start position:0%
locations those locations are primarily
 
02:52:41.710 --> 02:52:41.720 align:start position:0%
Mexico and Canada um so glass and glass
 
02:52:44.790 --> 02:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
recycling um you know I I don't work for
 
02:52:47.349 --> 02:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
the glass industry but I I would say in
 
02:52:50.070 --> 02:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
their defense that that um they would
 
02:52:52.710 --> 02:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
also love their material to be recycled
 
02:52:55.950 --> 02:52:55.960 align:start position:0%
as well um often when that is collected
 
02:52:58.309 --> 02:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
separately and a lot of materials are
 
02:52:59.670 --> 02:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes collected separately for a
 
02:53:02.870 --> 02:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
myriad of reasons some of which is their
 
02:53:06.750 --> 02:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
their Community requires it some of it
 
02:53:10.830 --> 02:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
is that those markets may may be
 
02:53:13.590 --> 02:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
commercially viable um sometimes and
 
02:53:15.870 --> 02:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're not and so they they
 
02:53:17.590 --> 02:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
separate them and they continue to
 
02:53:20.070 --> 02:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
separate them for the opportunities when
 
02:53:23.950 --> 02:53:23.960 align:start position:0%
they can sell those um you know uh for
 
02:53:26.389 --> 02:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
profit and then sometimes that they do
 
02:53:29.790 --> 02:53:29.800 align:start position:0%
that because uh it enables them to not
 
02:53:31.349 --> 02:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
have that contamination in another
 
02:53:34.269 --> 02:53:34.279 align:start position:0%
stream uh like I mentioned so sometimes
 
02:53:36.229 --> 02:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
people really want to recycle certain
 
02:53:39.309 --> 02:53:39.319 align:start position:0%
items they have it in their head and so
 
02:53:41.510 --> 02:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh if you don't Source separate it there
 
02:53:43.389 --> 02:53:43.399 align:start position:0%
they'll just put it somewhere else but
 
02:53:46.070 --> 02:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
there are a myriad of reasons why a murf
 
02:53:48.429 --> 02:53:48.439 align:start position:0%
might collect something but not actually
 
02:53:50.870 --> 02:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
recycle it and you know it it is very
 
02:53:52.389 --> 02:53:52.399 align:start position:0%
very context
 
02:53:55.670 --> 02:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
specific representative Murray thank you
 
02:53:57.150 --> 02:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
uh for yes thank you madam chair and
 
02:53:58.790 --> 02:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so one
 
02:54:00.030 --> 02:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
of the questions that I did have was
 
02:54:02.469 --> 02:54:02.479 align:start position:0%
around multi-layer packaging and so
 
02:54:04.710 --> 02:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
things like potato chip bags squeezy
 
02:54:07.469 --> 02:54:07.479 align:start position:0%
food pouches dog food cat food you name
 
02:54:11.510 --> 02:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
it treat bags um is that better suited
 
02:54:14.510 --> 02:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
for something like the advanced chemical
 
02:54:17.110 --> 02:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
type of recycling versus the mechanical
 
02:54:20.469 --> 02:54:20.479 align:start position:0%
and could you speak to generally that
 
02:54:23.990 --> 02:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
stuff often ends up in a landfill um so
 
02:54:26.070 --> 02:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
can you speak to the direction that
 
02:54:28.469 --> 02:54:28.479 align:start position:0%
that's going sure so multi- laminates
 
02:54:29.910 --> 02:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
first of all what are multi-laminate
 
02:54:31.710 --> 02:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
films so they have multiple different
 
02:54:34.429 --> 02:54:34.439 align:start position:0%
layers of they're they're often not one
 
02:54:37.429 --> 02:54:37.439 align:start position:0%
specific type of polymer um and all of
 
02:54:39.590 --> 02:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
those different layers have a different
 
02:54:41.990 --> 02:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
function they may be um something to
 
02:54:43.710 --> 02:54:43.720 align:start position:0%
print on that you can have high impact
 
02:54:44.790 --> 02:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
printing on
 
02:54:46.790 --> 02:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
they may be a layer that is actually a
 
02:54:49.990 --> 02:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
vapor barrier or a barrier that is tear
 
02:54:52.790 --> 02:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
resistant or or you know that so that it
 
02:54:55.229 --> 02:54:55.239 align:start position:0%
the their structural Integrity to the to
 
02:54:57.910 --> 02:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
the package itself um it may be a UV
 
02:55:00.550 --> 02:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
blocker things like that which your
 
02:55:02.429 --> 02:55:02.439 align:start position:0%
those the reason that they tend to have
 
02:55:03.910 --> 02:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
multiple layers is because each one of
 
02:55:06.950 --> 02:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
those layers is doing a different role
 
02:55:10.349 --> 02:55:10.359 align:start position:0%
um now as an industry we are looking at
 
02:55:13.150 --> 02:55:13.160 align:start position:0%
Innovations to simplify those and to
 
02:55:15.710 --> 02:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
have more what are called monom material
 
02:55:17.870 --> 02:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
flexibles um and we're doing a lot of
 
02:55:19.870 --> 02:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
really really cool things on on that
 
02:55:22.389 --> 02:55:22.399 align:start position:0%
where it's you know um where we Orient
 
02:55:24.229 --> 02:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
the polymers One Direction and then we
 
02:55:25.910 --> 02:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
take another layer and we Orient the
 
02:55:27.990 --> 02:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
polymers another Direction it's it's
 
02:55:30.830 --> 02:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
very cool and very technical um so we
 
02:55:32.349 --> 02:55:32.359 align:start position:0%
are looking to innovate more towards
 
02:55:34.269 --> 02:55:34.279 align:start position:0%
that idea of design for recycling to
 
02:55:35.910 --> 02:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
make it easier to potentially
 
02:55:38.150 --> 02:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
mechanically recycle these in the future
 
02:55:40.190 --> 02:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
but for those multi laminates that we
 
02:55:43.150 --> 02:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
currently have yes Advanced recycling is
 
02:55:45.429 --> 02:55:45.439 align:start position:0%
a really uh
 
02:55:50.110 --> 02:55:50.120 align:start position:0%
uh is a is a very uh helpful option to
 
02:55:52.229 --> 02:55:52.239 align:start position:0%
be able to recycle those and I'd also
 
02:55:53.710 --> 02:55:53.720 align:start position:0%
point out the reason that we use those
 
02:55:56.389 --> 02:55:56.399 align:start position:0%
multi laminates is because they are so
 
02:55:58.429 --> 02:55:58.439 align:start position:0%
much more convenient for people like
 
02:56:00.389 --> 02:56:00.399 align:start position:0%
it's like well why why do we use those
 
02:56:03.030 --> 02:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
because you know we we really like to
 
02:56:04.590 --> 02:56:04.600 align:start position:0%
have those products and they actually
 
02:56:07.190 --> 02:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
have much lower um like carbon
 
02:56:09.269 --> 02:56:09.279 align:start position:0%
Footprints and other items and costs
 
02:56:12.710 --> 02:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
associated to it versus other
 
02:56:16.150 --> 02:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
materials thank you uh representative
 
02:56:18.510 --> 02:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
moris thank you m thank you for taking
 
02:56:20.630 --> 02:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
my question um you mentioned earlier and
 
02:56:22.910 --> 02:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
maybe I missed something along the way
 
02:56:26.190 --> 02:56:26.200 align:start position:0%
but um all of the New England states it
 
02:56:28.790 --> 02:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
sounds like have the Sorting centers or
 
02:56:30.910 --> 02:56:30.920 align:start position:0%
murfs as you called them is there do you
 
02:56:33.590 --> 02:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
know why we do not have one in New
 
02:56:35.590 --> 02:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't know why you don't
 
02:56:37.110 --> 02:56:37.120 align:start position:0%
have one in New Hampshire I'd love you
 
02:56:39.710 --> 02:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
to have one in New Hampshire followup
 
02:56:41.590 --> 02:56:41.600 align:start position:0%
followup um is there legislation that
 
02:56:43.510 --> 02:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
goes along with getting something like
 
02:56:45.389 --> 02:56:45.399 align:start position:0%
that going or is it more of like like a
 
02:56:47.670 --> 02:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
personal business type of situation so
 
02:56:49.269 --> 02:56:49.279 align:start position:0%
there are there are obviously business
 
02:56:52.910 --> 02:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
decisions and those those murfs um are
 
02:56:55.269 --> 02:56:55.279 align:start position:0%
most often in the United States are
 
02:56:57.349 --> 02:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
privately run right so a really great
 
02:57:00.870 --> 02:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
example I I mentioned earlier is WM WM
 
02:57:03.150 --> 02:57:03.160 align:start position:0%
not doesn't just do uh landfills they
 
02:57:06.030 --> 02:57:06.040 align:start position:0%
also do a lot of uh sortation so they
 
02:57:08.429 --> 02:57:08.439 align:start position:0%
are they they make economic decisions on
 
02:57:12.389 --> 02:57:12.399 align:start position:0%
the ability to aggregate enough material
 
02:57:14.269 --> 02:57:14.279 align:start position:0%
that it becomes economically viable to
 
02:57:17.030 --> 02:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
invest but there are other items such as
 
02:57:19.830 --> 02:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
permitting or tax incentives things like
 
02:57:23.269 --> 02:57:23.279 align:start position:0%
that that can attract specific
 
02:57:25.750 --> 02:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
businesses um representative Howard and
 
02:57:27.150 --> 02:57:27.160 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
02:57:29.190 --> 02:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
Bixby thank you madam chair and thank
 
02:57:31.269 --> 02:57:31.279 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I have
 
02:57:32.590 --> 02:57:32.600 align:start position:0%
actually have two questions that are
 
02:57:34.070 --> 02:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
sort of not related to each other the
 
02:57:36.429 --> 02:57:36.439 align:start position:0%
first one is in my town um the head of
 
02:57:39.269 --> 02:57:39.279 align:start position:0%
the DPW that it keeps changing things
 
02:57:41.670 --> 02:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
around be to CH to save money or to not
 
02:57:44.110 --> 02:57:44.120 align:start position:0%
spend as much money and um I I was
 
02:57:47.070 --> 02:57:47.080 align:start position:0%
wondering do we pay do we pay these
 
02:57:49.110 --> 02:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
these centers to take our our trash or
 
02:57:51.150 --> 02:57:51.160 align:start position:0%
do they pay or do they buy it from us
 
02:57:53.429 --> 02:57:53.439 align:start position:0%
our our recyclables and my second
 
02:57:56.429 --> 02:57:56.439 align:start position:0%
question um is in the news recently
 
02:58:01.670 --> 02:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
there was a um a um news of th millions
 
02:58:03.590 --> 02:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
of part plastic particulates and water
 
02:58:05.469 --> 02:58:05.479 align:start position:0%
bottles and I'm just wondering if that's
 
02:58:07.229 --> 02:58:07.239 align:start position:0%
safe for people or if if you guys are
 
02:58:09.750 --> 02:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
working to um mitigate
 
02:58:14.750 --> 02:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
that sure so taking those in order so
 
02:58:18.110 --> 02:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
typically a a community will contract
 
02:58:20.429 --> 02:58:20.439 align:start position:0%
with a station and I I don't and I will
 
02:58:22.910 --> 02:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
confess that that I I don't necessarily
 
02:58:25.870 --> 02:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
know like the relationships um for
 
02:58:27.830 --> 02:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
everybody in in New Hampshire what I
 
02:58:30.590 --> 02:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
will say is that the idea of epr is
 
02:58:32.710 --> 02:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
really helpful because it can help
 
02:58:34.670 --> 02:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
support the costs of those so that you
 
02:58:36.790 --> 02:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
don't have somebody constantly trying to
 
02:58:38.269 --> 02:58:38.279 align:start position:0%
change things around to make something
 
02:58:40.590 --> 02:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
more economically viable on the topic of
 
02:58:43.910 --> 02:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
microplastics or nanoplastics in in in
 
02:58:47.030 --> 02:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
bottles so that is that is currently an
 
02:58:51.229 --> 02:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
area of study um we you know I work in
 
02:58:53.710 --> 02:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
sustainability um and so this is rapidly
 
02:58:56.469 --> 02:58:56.479 align:start position:0%
outside my knowledge Zone um what I will
 
02:58:59.630 --> 02:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
say is that um I think that the United
 
02:59:02.950 --> 02:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
Nations did a study in 2019 of
 
02:59:06.030 --> 02:59:06.040 align:start position:0%
microplastics and they found that yes
 
02:59:08.150 --> 02:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
while we do ingest
 
02:59:11.070 --> 02:59:11.080 align:start position:0%
microplastics um at very very small
 
02:59:14.429 --> 02:59:14.439 align:start position:0%
amounts um they we also pass a large
 
02:59:16.510 --> 02:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
percentage of those out straight through
 
02:59:18.510 --> 02:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
and that there's no really great data
 
02:59:20.510 --> 02:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
right now that understands that health
 
02:59:23.190 --> 02:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
impact so um we as an industry are
 
02:59:25.229 --> 02:59:25.239 align:start position:0%
investing in more research we encourage
 
02:59:27.510 --> 02:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
more research in this area not just of
 
02:59:30.389 --> 02:59:30.399 align:start position:0%
the detection um for the for high impact
 
02:59:32.630 --> 02:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh like articles for to discover these
 
02:59:36.190 --> 02:59:36.200 align:start position:0%
items um but the next step for that is
 
02:59:38.590 --> 02:59:38.600 align:start position:0%
is is there actual a health impact as
 
02:59:40.429 --> 02:59:40.439 align:start position:0%
well so we are working on that to
 
02:59:43.030 --> 02:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
explore those impacts one last question
 
02:59:43.040 --> 02:59:44.429 align:start position:0%
explore those impacts one last question
representative

02:59:44.429 --> 02:59:44.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:59:48.349 --> 02:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so um I was so um in the most
 
02:59:50.389 --> 02:59:50.399 align:start position:0%
recent issue of the American scientist
 
02:59:53.349 --> 02:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
there was a piece about uh a group at
 
02:59:55.469 --> 02:59:55.479 align:start position:0%
Colorado State University that is
 
02:59:57.670 --> 02:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
working on something called multi-block
 
03:00:02.950 --> 03:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh polymers that would have uh the the
 
03:00:05.510 --> 03:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
the polymer bonds would be easier to be
 
03:00:08.550 --> 03:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
to be broken down in a recycling process
 
03:00:10.309 --> 03:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if this is something
 
03:00:14.469 --> 03:00:14.479 align:start position:0%
that is uh anywhere near being being uh
 
03:00:19.030 --> 03:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
available for uh for being used broadly
 
03:00:21.030 --> 03:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
and how that sort of thing might be
 
03:00:23.389 --> 03:00:23.399 align:start position:0%
separated from other sorts of
 
03:00:25.870 --> 03:00:25.880 align:start position:0%
plastics I I will confess that I'm not
 
03:00:29.229 --> 03:00:29.239 align:start position:0%
familiar with that article in multiblock
 
03:00:32.590 --> 03:00:32.600 align:start position:0%
polymers so so in general what I would
 
03:00:36.550 --> 03:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
say is that and and I'm guessing based
 
03:00:38.990 --> 03:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
on on that description is that these are
 
03:00:40.990 --> 03:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
are blocks within the polymer chain that
 
03:00:44.030 --> 03:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
enable them to break down easier so that
 
03:00:47.349 --> 03:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
would um that could conceivably be more
 
03:00:49.349 --> 03:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
like it could make forms of advanced
 
03:00:51.510 --> 03:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
recycling more efficient it's not
 
03:00:54.070 --> 03:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily valuable to Mechanical
 
03:00:56.030 --> 03:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
recycling where we're not breaking those
 
03:00:59.429 --> 03:00:59.439 align:start position:0%
polymer chains down right so I'm I'm I'm
 
03:01:01.550 --> 03:01:01.560 align:start position:0%
I'm speculating here I would be happy to
 
03:01:03.510 --> 03:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
take a look at it and follow up with you
 
03:01:06.950 --> 03:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay thanks thank you and thank you so
 
03:01:09.269 --> 03:01:09.279 align:start position:0%
much again for uh coming to New
 
03:01:11.790 --> 03:01:11.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to come and speak with us and
 
03:01:13.910 --> 03:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
and give us this presentation and take
 
03:01:17.670 --> 03:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
our questions um we really appreciate
 
03:01:21.389 --> 03:01:21.399 align:start position:0%
the time that you've taken and um thank
 
03:01:23.030 --> 03:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you for having me I really
 
03:01:26.950 --> 03:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate it all right all right um we

04:03:33.950 --> 04:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
and good afternoon I'd like to W welcome
 
04:03:36.389 --> 04:03:36.399 align:start position:0%
everybody back to um environment
 
04:03:38.469 --> 04:03:38.479 align:start position:0%
agriculture this afternoon we we have a
 
04:03:40.149 --> 04:03:40.159 align:start position:0%
series of bills that we're going to talk
 
04:03:43.070 --> 04:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
about in full committee work session I'm
 
04:03:45.149 --> 04:03:45.159 align:start position:0%
going to open up this committee work
 
04:03:47.710 --> 04:03:47.720 align:start position:0%
session um we will start by our
 
04:03:53.550 --> 04:03:53.560 align:start position:0%
discussion with Excuse me HB
 
04:03:57.269 --> 04:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
1182 which uh seeks to add certain equin
 
04:04:00.309 --> 04:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
practices to the definition of animal
 
04:04:04.269 --> 04:04:04.279 align:start position:0%
cruelty and um I'd like to open it up
 
04:04:04.279 --> 04:04:05.510 align:start position:0%
cruelty and um I'd like to open it up
for

04:04:05.510 --> 04:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:04:08.389 --> 04:04:08.399 align:start position:0%
discussion with our committee members to
 
04:04:08.399 --> 04:04:10.070 align:start position:0%
discussion with our committee members to
see

04:04:10.070 --> 04:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
see
 
04:04:13.389 --> 04:04:13.399 align:start position:0%
uh what our thoughts are uh regarding
 
04:04:16.269 --> 04:04:16.279 align:start position:0%
this legislation um anybody have any
 
04:04:18.910 --> 04:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
thoughts representative
 
04:04:23.590 --> 04:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
Kwa thank you madam chair um so my
 
04:04:25.590 --> 04:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
thought is is in the
 
04:04:28.990 --> 04:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
discussion cruelty is already defined as
 
04:04:32.269 --> 04:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
all of the items that were listed and I
 
04:04:36.309 --> 04:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
think that by narrowing although we
 
04:04:37.189 --> 04:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
would think that this would be
 
04:04:37.199 --> 04:04:38.590 align:start position:0%
would think that this would be
broadening

04:04:38.590 --> 04:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
broadening
 
04:04:41.070 --> 04:04:41.080 align:start position:0%
um that when we start listing things we
 
04:04:43.710 --> 04:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
will forget things and I believe that
 
04:04:45.750 --> 04:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
our animal cruelty laws that we worked
 
04:04:48.870 --> 04:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
on uh quite extensively to get to where
 
04:04:52.710 --> 04:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
it is today covers the issues at hand in
 
04:04:52.720 --> 04:04:54.990 align:start position:0%
it is today covers the issues at hand in
this

04:04:54.990 --> 04:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:57.990 --> 04:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
legislation any other comments from the
 
04:05:00.630 --> 04:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
04:05:03.590 --> 04:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
Duty go ahead and then represent and
 
04:05:05.870 --> 04:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
then representative smart don't don't
 
04:05:08.429 --> 04:05:08.439 align:start position:0%
duke it out over there you know um
 
04:05:10.389 --> 04:05:10.399 align:start position:0%
yeah I honestly think that this is a
 
04:05:14.710 --> 04:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
fairly modest Bill and um IT addresses
 
04:05:17.750 --> 04:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
some things that um you know are quite
 
04:05:20.950 --> 04:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
egregious that some
 
04:05:24.389 --> 04:05:24.399 align:start position:0%
people some people may not consider that
 
04:05:28.870 --> 04:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
they are um cruel uh they more in the
 
04:05:31.510 --> 04:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
area of uh competitive
 
04:05:35.189 --> 04:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
advantages um so I don't see any harm in
 
04:05:38.469 --> 04:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
modifying the cruelty to add um I
 
04:05:42.630 --> 04:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
believe it's these four um issues thank
 
04:05:47.229 --> 04:05:47.239 align:start position:0%
you representative smart hi
 
04:05:51.229 --> 04:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
um I agree that these are
 
04:05:57.189 --> 04:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
heinous these practices um but I think
 
04:05:59.910 --> 04:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
list if we start listing things that are
 
04:06:03.590 --> 04:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
cruel to animals or or anything we run a
 
04:06:05.510 --> 04:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
risk of leaving something out if we're
 
04:06:09.990 --> 04:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:13.870 --> 04:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
um definition of Cruelty covers
 
04:06:18.950 --> 04:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
everything in one F swoop um and I think
 
04:06:23.429 --> 04:06:23.439 align:start position:0%
in this instance the problem is um that
 
04:06:25.710 --> 04:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
when people see this they're not coming
 
04:06:27.950 --> 04:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
forward with it and maybe education
 
04:06:29.830 --> 04:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
might be the way to go rather than
 
04:06:32.550 --> 04:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
passing a bill um because there are
 
04:06:37.910 --> 04:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
already things in place um to bring in
 
04:06:39.990 --> 04:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
animals from out of state for shows
 
04:06:44.550 --> 04:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
horses they need to have a um a health
 
04:06:48.510 --> 04:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
certificate from a federally licensed
 
04:06:51.189 --> 04:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
veterinarian um I would think that that
 
04:06:53.429 --> 04:06:53.439 align:start position:0%
would be picked up then because this is
 
04:06:56.349 --> 04:06:56.359 align:start position:0%
not stuff that's the health certificate
 
04:06:59.550 --> 04:06:59.560 align:start position:0%
has to be within 30 days
 
04:07:03.229 --> 04:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
um are you talking about HB 1182 is that
 
04:07:05.269 --> 04:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
the animal practices right animal
 
04:07:08.630 --> 04:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
cruelty that's that's with the umin
 
04:07:11.790 --> 04:07:11.800 align:start position:0%
yeah and so and and in the state of New
 
04:07:14.950 --> 04:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire these are not practiced um
 
04:07:19.429 --> 04:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
it's the and for showing purposes to
 
04:07:21.710 --> 04:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
sell your animal bring your animal out
 
04:07:25.830 --> 04:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
of state to show your animal to sell it
 
04:07:28.229 --> 04:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
I don't think the Deerfield fair is the
 
04:07:29.550 --> 04:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
place that they're going to be doing
 
04:07:33.269 --> 04:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
that we don't have large um hores shows
 
04:07:36.229 --> 04:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
here um like in some of the other states
 
04:07:39.950 --> 04:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
like New York where it they have spe
 
04:07:42.670 --> 04:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
it's equin country you have these big
 
04:07:46.349 --> 04:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
farms so I just I think that this is a
 
04:07:49.349 --> 04:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
nonstarter there's no way to enforce
 
04:07:49.359 --> 04:07:50.950 align:start position:0%
nonstarter there's no way to enforce
it

04:07:50.950 --> 04:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:07:54.229 --> 04:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
so that's got representative Murray
 
04:07:56.070 --> 04:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for taking my
 
04:07:58.229 --> 04:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
question or just comment comment yeah
 
04:08:00.510 --> 04:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
we're just just very Loosely talking
 
04:08:02.550 --> 04:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
about this and what what our thoughts
 
04:08:04.389 --> 04:08:04.399 align:start position:0%
are as a committee sure and I think to
 
04:08:06.269 --> 04:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
the members Point uh representative
 
04:08:08.510 --> 04:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
smart was talking about COG and cogin
 
04:08:10.830 --> 04:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
are used either through like Interstate
 
04:08:13.429 --> 04:08:13.439 align:start position:0%
transport for horse shows or in the sale
 
04:08:15.070 --> 04:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
of an animal and I think that's what she
 
04:08:16.469 --> 04:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
might be
 
04:08:18.309 --> 04:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
referencing they also have to have a
 
04:08:20.030 --> 04:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
health certificate so they don't have
 
04:08:22.189 --> 04:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
any communicable diseases besides the
 
04:08:25.550 --> 04:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
cogin test right representative Bixby
 
04:08:30.070 --> 04:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
you had a comment yeah yeah
 
04:08:32.830 --> 04:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
um I was
 
04:08:35.790 --> 04:08:35.800 align:start position:0%
um kind of on the fence about this until
 
04:08:40.030 --> 04:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
it was the issue was mentioned that
 
04:08:42.710 --> 04:08:42.720 align:start position:0%
um excuse me
 
04:08:47.269 --> 04:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
um sometimes prosecutors are hesitant to
 
04:08:50.710 --> 04:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh work under the existing animal
 
04:08:53.149 --> 04:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
cruelty law because they don't think
 
04:08:54.790 --> 04:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
they're necessarily going to win the
 
04:08:58.149 --> 04:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
case because it's not specific enough
 
04:09:00.750 --> 04:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
and I think that this
 
04:09:04.550 --> 04:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
will this would provide the specificity
 
04:09:06.510 --> 04:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
that a prosecutor might need in order to
 
04:09:09.189 --> 04:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
actually bring and win the
 
04:09:12.269 --> 04:09:12.279 align:start position:0%
case representative H Haskins thank you
 
04:09:12.279 --> 04:09:13.269 align:start position:0%
case representative H Haskins thank you
madam

04:09:13.269 --> 04:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
madam
 
04:09:15.950 --> 04:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
chair I'm horrified that this kind of
 
04:09:17.870 --> 04:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
thing is still going
 
04:09:22.469 --> 04:09:22.479 align:start position:0%
on and if the animal cruelty laws were
 
04:09:25.469 --> 04:09:25.479 align:start position:0%
all it took it wouldn't be happening and
 
04:09:25.479 --> 04:09:26.710 align:start position:0%
all it took it wouldn't be happening and
I

04:09:26.710 --> 04:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:09:30.269 --> 04:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
think to have some specificity is better
 
04:09:33.189 --> 04:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
than not having any it doesn't mean that
 
04:09:36.950 --> 04:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
it will cover all conditions but it will
 
04:09:38.229 --> 04:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
cover the
 
04:09:40.590 --> 04:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm in favor of
 
04:09:43.670 --> 04:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
it thank
 
04:09:46.990 --> 04:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
you representative Howard thank you
 
04:09:48.830 --> 04:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair um I'm just wondering if the
 
04:09:50.309 --> 04:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
members think that this would be a
 
04:09:57.229 --> 04:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:59.269 --> 04:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
punitive I
 
04:10:01.910 --> 04:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
do you know quite frankly I don't I
 
04:10:03.149 --> 04:10:03.159 align:start position:0%
don't think that this would be a
 
04:10:06.109 --> 04:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
preventative at all I mean I to me
 
04:10:09.269 --> 04:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty is is pretty much well
 
04:10:09.279 --> 04:10:11.510 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty is is pretty much well
defined

04:10:11.510 --> 04:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
defined
 
04:10:17.429 --> 04:10:17.439 align:start position:0%
um in in 6 RSA 644 colon
 
04:10:17.439 --> 04:10:19.269 align:start position:0%
um in in 6 RSA 644 colon
8

04:10:19.269 --> 04:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
8
 
04:10:19.279 --> 04:10:21.830 align:start position:0%
8
um

04:10:21.830 --> 04:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:24.870 --> 04:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
H oh well no here it says in the section
 
04:10:26.830 --> 04:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
cruelty shall include but not be limited
 
04:10:28.710 --> 04:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
to Acts or emissions injurious or
 
04:10:30.910 --> 04:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the health safety or
 
04:10:32.830 --> 04:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
welfare of any animal including the
 
04:10:35.469 --> 04:10:35.479 align:start position:0%
abandoning of any animal without proper
 
04:10:37.149 --> 04:10:37.159 align:start position:0%
provision for its care sustenance and
 
04:10:39.070 --> 04:10:39.080 align:start position:0%
protection section or shelter and I
 
04:10:41.950 --> 04:10:41.960 align:start position:0%
think that's really broad enough to
 
04:10:44.590 --> 04:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
include hoof soaring gingering tail
 
04:10:46.950 --> 04:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
nicking tail blocking which are all
 
04:10:48.950 --> 04:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the health and safety and
 
04:10:53.149 --> 04:10:53.159 align:start position:0%
Welfare of the animal so to then um
 
04:10:56.389 --> 04:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
clutter up this statute with specific
 
04:11:00.269 --> 04:11:00.279 align:start position:0%
kinds of injuries opens the door to have
 
04:11:04.429 --> 04:11:04.439 align:start position:0%
you know a whole list of stuff that is
 
04:11:07.590 --> 04:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
already covered under the first line of
 
04:11:12.429 --> 04:11:12.439 align:start position:0%
this statute so for me I mean
 
04:11:16.950 --> 04:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
especially um USCF the eoin
 
04:11:20.790 --> 04:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
Federation um they have policies um they
 
04:11:25.429 --> 04:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
have pre-m competition checks um the
 
04:11:29.189 --> 04:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
community already is self- policing and
 
04:11:31.469 --> 04:11:31.479 align:start position:0%
the fact is the people are what we heard
 
04:11:33.550 --> 04:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
in testimony is that people are not
 
04:11:35.630 --> 04:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
reporting it well that's not the
 
04:11:37.070 --> 04:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
statute's fault that people are not
 
04:11:40.630 --> 04:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
repor supporting it and I I'm I don't
 
04:11:43.030 --> 04:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
agree I'm sorry representative Bixby I
 
04:11:46.109 --> 04:11:46.119 align:start position:0%
think that um a prosecutor could
 
04:11:49.149 --> 04:11:49.159 align:start position:0%
certainly uh say that these these
 
04:11:53.469 --> 04:11:53.479 align:start position:0%
practices fall under um 644 colon 8
 
04:11:55.590 --> 04:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
section one
 
04:11:59.070 --> 04:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely but representative coma thank
 
04:12:01.309 --> 04:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and just to uh piggy
 
04:12:04.550 --> 04:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
back on what you said what we heard in
 
04:12:08.830 --> 04:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
testimony was that people would not come
 
04:12:12.149 --> 04:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
forth and let others know that this was
 
04:12:14.229 --> 04:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
happening so that the animal cruelty
 
04:12:16.710 --> 04:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
laws could not be enforced by adding
 
04:12:18.790 --> 04:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
this this isn't going to make them come
 
04:12:21.830 --> 04:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
forth any more than they already do now
 
04:12:24.830 --> 04:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
I think the key is is to educate the
 
04:12:26.710 --> 04:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
people that when they see this that they
 
04:12:28.349 --> 04:12:28.359 align:start position:0%
need to call law enforcement or the
 
04:12:28.359 --> 04:12:29.189 align:start position:0%
need to call law enforcement or the
State

04:12:29.189 --> 04:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
State
 
04:12:31.790 --> 04:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
Vet because that's the only way we're
 
04:12:34.189 --> 04:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
going to correct the issue and that's
 
04:12:36.229 --> 04:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
what's not happening as we heard in
 
04:12:40.269 --> 04:12:40.279 align:start position:0%
testimony because people won't come
 
04:12:44.510 --> 04:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
forward so the purpose of this
 
04:12:47.790 --> 04:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
um U commissioner Jasper you have your
 
04:12:47.800 --> 04:13:02.469 align:start position:0%
um U commissioner Jasper you have your
hand

04:13:02.469 --> 04:13:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:05.870 --> 04:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
up oh thank you for that
 
04:13:08.830 --> 04:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
clarification this would be uh an issue
 
04:13:12.030 --> 04:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
for law enforcement then especially it's
 
04:13:14.990 --> 04:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
in the criminal code um so the purpose
 
04:13:17.109 --> 04:13:17.119 align:start position:0%
of a work session I guess is for us to
 
04:13:19.590 --> 04:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
try and figure out whether we want to um
 
04:13:22.550 --> 04:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
put any amendments on legislation or not
 
04:13:24.510 --> 04:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
and I I don't know that we
 
04:13:28.510 --> 04:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
do um unless anybody has any ideas
 
04:13:30.830 --> 04:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah um I'm my
 
04:13:33.750 --> 04:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
feeling is that um this doesn't need
 
04:13:36.349 --> 04:13:36.359 align:start position:0%
amending I think that uh I I still think
 
04:13:39.309 --> 04:13:39.319 align:start position:0%
that it uh does make sense but um
 
04:13:42.870 --> 04:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
obviously I have some I'm not there's a
 
04:13:44.590 --> 04:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
little bit of disagreement about that
 
04:13:46.229 --> 04:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that there's any way
 
04:13:48.349 --> 04:13:48.359 align:start position:0%
to improve it by amending it okay
 
04:13:48.359 --> 04:13:49.469 align:start position:0%
to improve it by amending it okay
representative

04:13:49.469 --> 04:13:49.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:13:54.510 --> 04:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
Duty uh yeah my question would be um if
 
04:13:57.830 --> 04:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
we left it as it is and put this in into
 
04:14:01.389 --> 04:14:01.399 align:start position:0%
law uh wouldn't that put the hores shows
 
04:14:04.349 --> 04:14:04.359 align:start position:0%
on notice that if they come to New
 
04:14:07.750 --> 04:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and these practices uh and
 
04:14:09.469 --> 04:14:09.479 align:start position:0%
they turn an Blind Eye to these
 
04:14:13.590 --> 04:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
practices that they will in fact be
 
04:14:15.950 --> 04:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
prosecuted I mean and if we don't have
 
04:14:19.229 --> 04:14:19.239 align:start position:0%
that many horse shows in the state I
 
04:14:22.830 --> 04:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
mean you know couldn't we have um a
 
04:14:24.790 --> 04:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
somebody from the Department of
 
04:14:27.189 --> 04:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
Agriculture go to the shows and just
 
04:14:29.349 --> 04:14:29.359 align:start position:0%
ensure that none of these practices are
 
04:14:32.229 --> 04:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
happening if other people will not go
 
04:14:35.070 --> 04:14:35.080 align:start position:0%
ahead and uh I mean you know if if the
 
04:14:37.670 --> 04:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
if the show owners will not police leas
 
04:14:39.990 --> 04:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
themselves then couldn't we have an
 
04:14:41.590 --> 04:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
entity I mean I don't know how many
 
04:14:45.750 --> 04:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
shows we have in a year what two three I
 
04:14:47.830 --> 04:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
mean what's you know so I mean that
 
04:14:49.950 --> 04:14:49.960 align:start position:0%
that's not a stretch in terms of
 
04:14:52.030 --> 04:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
somebody taking an hour checking out all
 
04:14:56.189 --> 04:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
the horses and if they do see these um
 
04:15:00.189 --> 04:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
you know this cruelty that they register
 
04:15:02.030 --> 04:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
a complaint and
 
04:15:04.389 --> 04:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
prosecute well you know it's possible
 
04:15:07.469 --> 04:15:07.479 align:start position:0%
that um the town or municipality that's
 
04:15:11.590 --> 04:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
hosting any particular uh ecoin event
 
04:15:14.149 --> 04:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
could send their Animal Control person
 
04:15:18.870 --> 04:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
to uh to check out the animals or to
 
04:15:21.309 --> 04:15:21.319 align:start position:0%
look you know look at the show and they
 
04:15:23.349 --> 04:15:23.359 align:start position:0%
would be familiar enough I believe with
 
04:15:26.790 --> 04:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
the criminal code to know that yeah we
 
04:15:29.950 --> 04:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
are serious about um what cruelty is and
 
04:15:34.790 --> 04:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
is not um and it is specifically in in
 
04:15:38.349 --> 04:15:38.359 align:start position:0%
our statute um
 
04:15:40.309 --> 04:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
Acts or emissions injurious or
 
04:15:42.149 --> 04:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the health safety or
 
04:15:45.630 --> 04:15:45.640 align:start position:0%
welfare of any animal and that's pretty
 
04:15:49.389 --> 04:15:49.399 align:start position:0%
clear representative uh Morse thank you
 
04:15:52.710 --> 04:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
madam chair I'm wondering if um perhaps
 
04:15:55.790 --> 04:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
instead of listing everything
 
04:15:58.590 --> 04:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
specifically as it's written currently
 
04:16:00.510 --> 04:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
would you be more comfortable just
 
04:16:03.349 --> 04:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
adding something about
 
04:16:06.710 --> 04:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
um cosmetic changes to an animal that
 
04:16:08.630 --> 04:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
could cause harm because perhaps there
 
04:16:10.830 --> 04:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
are people who see some of these things
 
04:16:12.870 --> 04:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
happening with horses and they don't
 
04:16:16.109 --> 04:16:16.119 align:start position:0%
recognize how harmful they can be so if
 
04:16:19.670 --> 04:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's something tied into language
 
04:16:21.790 --> 04:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
that could be used for more animals if
 
04:16:25.030 --> 04:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
it's just a you
 
04:16:27.630 --> 04:16:27.640 align:start position:0%
know harmful thing that's being done for
 
04:16:29.429 --> 04:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
cosmetic use instead
 
04:16:32.269 --> 04:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
of uh you know like leaving a dog out in
 
04:16:35.149 --> 04:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
the cold that's obvious right that it's
 
04:16:37.229 --> 04:16:37.239 align:start position:0%
it's going to harm the animal but when
 
04:16:39.990 --> 04:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
we're looking at things like show
 
04:16:42.710 --> 04:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
animals that are going under you know
 
04:16:44.550 --> 04:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
some distress because of of things that
 
04:16:46.309 --> 04:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
they're doing to make them more
 
04:16:49.349 --> 04:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
favorable in the show ring um I'm not
 
04:16:50.710 --> 04:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
sure that I'm hearing that that is
 
04:16:54.269 --> 04:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily covered in that
 
04:16:57.389 --> 04:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
RSA representative comto thank you madam
 
04:17:01.070 --> 04:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
chair as I sit here and listen that we
 
04:17:02.870 --> 04:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
think people are going to change how
 
04:17:05.710 --> 04:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
they act because we put something in law
 
04:17:09.149 --> 04:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
some of this is already against the law
 
04:17:12.910 --> 04:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
federally and they're still doing it so
 
04:17:14.830 --> 04:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
they're already breaking the law here in
 
04:17:16.229 --> 04:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire because there
 
04:17:18.990 --> 04:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
are federal laws outlawing these
 
04:17:22.269 --> 04:17:22.279 align:start position:0%
things and I think by changing our
 
04:17:24.070 --> 04:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty laws we're going to do
 
04:17:28.590 --> 04:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
more harm down the than anything because
 
04:17:31.950 --> 04:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
our laws are are broad enough to cover
 
04:17:35.189 --> 04:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
everything that if you injure an animal
 
04:17:37.630 --> 04:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
or don't permit the re required shelter
 
04:17:40.189 --> 04:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
and everything else then you can be
 
04:17:42.630 --> 04:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
prosecuted under the
 
04:17:45.710 --> 04:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
law representative gero thank you madam
 
04:17:47.469 --> 04:17:47.479 align:start position:0%
chair my apologies for coming in late we
 
04:17:49.109 --> 04:17:49.119 align:start position:0%
all know this is the the season where
 
04:17:50.910 --> 04:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
we've got bills off and other committees
 
04:17:54.950 --> 04:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
and uh you missed the fruit cup oh of
 
04:17:57.189 --> 04:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
course um one of the things that I was
 
04:17:58.870 --> 04:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
unclear about when we had the hearing on
 
04:18:00.469 --> 04:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
this bill was that there there were
 
04:18:04.149 --> 04:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
statements made about if we you know we
 
04:18:06.229 --> 04:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
have our our statute as it currently
 
04:18:09.149 --> 04:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
exists then if we added to that
 
04:18:11.510 --> 04:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
statute more precise language with
 
04:18:13.630 --> 04:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
regard to one animal does that somehow
 
04:18:16.630 --> 04:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
make it more difficult for prosecutors
 
04:18:18.469 --> 04:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
to prosecute other cases of animal
 
04:18:19.910 --> 04:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
cruelty right because these questions
 
04:18:22.389 --> 04:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
about well well if it's not allowed in
 
04:18:24.590 --> 04:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
this particular set of circumstances but
 
04:18:27.109 --> 04:18:27.119 align:start position:0%
it is not specific in other parts of the
 
04:18:29.630 --> 04:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
RSA right so there were questions raised
 
04:18:32.710 --> 04:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
about what uh works for prosecutors and
 
04:18:34.510 --> 04:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
what doesn't and my concern is that we
 
04:18:35.750 --> 04:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
haven't heard from anybody who can
 
04:18:37.870 --> 04:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
actually answer that question question
 
04:18:41.070 --> 04:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
um I I would actually I would think it
 
04:18:42.550 --> 04:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
would be beneficial for us to hear from
 
04:18:44.070 --> 04:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
someone from the Attorney General's
 
04:18:47.349 --> 04:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
office uh to to see if they think that
 
04:18:50.030 --> 04:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
this is a useful tool for them to have
 
04:18:52.670 --> 04:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
or perhaps they they think that getting
 
04:18:55.189 --> 04:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
specific uh over one species of animal
 
04:18:57.070 --> 04:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
for example is not helpful but anywhere
 
04:18:59.429 --> 04:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
there were questions raised about what
 
04:19:01.229 --> 04:19:01.239 align:start position:0%
this might mean for prosecutions and I
 
04:19:03.109 --> 04:19:03.119 align:start position:0%
don't think that any of us is in a
 
04:19:05.149 --> 04:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
position to really answer that question
 
04:19:09.870 --> 04:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
that's a good point I would um entertain
 
04:19:12.030 --> 04:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
speaking with uh the Attorney General's
 
04:19:15.910 --> 04:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
office about um whether adding specific
 
04:19:20.189 --> 04:19:20.199 align:start position:0%
language is would be beneficial or not I
 
04:19:21.149 --> 04:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
but I
 
04:19:24.590 --> 04:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
think it would seem that then you go
 
04:19:27.309 --> 04:19:27.319 align:start position:0%
down the road of of specifying every
 
04:19:30.030 --> 04:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
single kind of different kind of Cruelty
 
04:19:32.670 --> 04:19:32.680 align:start position:0%
and you know I don't
 
04:19:34.670 --> 04:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
know and I think that's a question we
 
04:19:36.590 --> 04:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
could ask ask them so thank you madam ch
 
04:19:36.600 --> 04:19:37.590 align:start position:0%
could ask ask them so thank you madam ch

04:19:40.910 --> 04:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
Duty yeah it just seems to me if hor
 
04:19:44.469 --> 04:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
shows are the venue that this where this
 
04:19:46.990 --> 04:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
is most often seen and we have two to
 
04:19:49.590 --> 04:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
three horse shows a year and Madame
 
04:19:52.189 --> 04:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
chair has said that maybe this is
 
04:19:54.750 --> 04:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
something that can be policed by the
 
04:19:57.830 --> 04:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
local municipality and one must assume
 
04:20:00.070 --> 04:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
that the local municipality is reaping
 
04:20:02.670 --> 04:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
the benefit of financial benefits from
 
04:20:04.670 --> 04:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
having a Horse Show there maybe people
 
04:20:07.229 --> 04:20:07.239 align:start position:0%
eating lunch and that kind of thing um
 
04:20:09.670 --> 04:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
then I think it should be amended so
 
04:20:13.109 --> 04:20:13.119 align:start position:0%
that we have that it's mandated that if
 
04:20:16.149 --> 04:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
a hor show is going to be in your
 
04:20:19.510 --> 04:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
municipality that um you know a police
 
04:20:24.469 --> 04:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
officer um uh it's mandated that they um
 
04:20:27.229 --> 04:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
go an hour before the show or whatever
 
04:20:29.830 --> 04:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
and uh inspect all of the animals I
 
04:20:31.790 --> 04:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
don't think that's a a really a big
 
04:20:34.269 --> 04:20:34.279 align:start position:0%
stretch why would we limit it to just
 
04:20:36.950 --> 04:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
horse shows I mean there's dog shows Cat
 
04:20:38.469 --> 04:20:38.479 align:start position:0%
shows there no no no but I mean it's
 
04:20:40.269 --> 04:20:40.279 align:start position:0%
Horse Show I mean but we're talking
 
04:20:43.950 --> 04:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
about a bill that has four cruelties
 
04:20:47.309 --> 04:20:47.319 align:start position:0%
that are specific to horses and so I
 
04:20:50.630 --> 04:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
think that's where we would want to
 
04:20:53.670 --> 04:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
start present Murray thank you madam
 
04:20:55.990 --> 04:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
chair and um just to representative
 
04:20:58.830 --> 04:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
Duty's uh point I just want to be clear
 
04:21:00.590 --> 04:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
here there are many different
 
04:21:03.229 --> 04:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
disciplines of ecoin horse shows and
 
04:21:07.189 --> 04:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
ecoin competitions so uh what is here is
 
04:21:10.830 --> 04:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
generally in one certain genre of of
 
04:21:12.389 --> 04:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
horse shows I just want it to be very
 
04:21:14.030 --> 04:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
clear when we're talking generally about
 
04:21:17.309 --> 04:21:17.319 align:start position:0%
horse shows that's not it's not
 
04:21:18.710 --> 04:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily the case that those things
 
04:21:24.070 --> 04:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:26.149 --> 04:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
disciplines anyone
 
04:21:28.710 --> 04:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
else representative
 
04:21:31.710 --> 04:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
Penza yeah do we even know how many of
 
04:21:34.870 --> 04:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
those specific hor shows
 
04:21:37.229 --> 04:21:37.239 align:start position:0%
um that specific spefic discipline are
 
04:21:39.070 --> 04:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
happening here in New
 
04:21:43.830 --> 04:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire i u from from uh testimony I
 
04:21:48.550 --> 04:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:53.510 --> 04:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
any so all right I'm gonna um move on to
 
04:21:54.870 --> 04:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
the next
 
04:21:58.149 --> 04:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
bill um HB
 
04:22:01.070 --> 04:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
1680 relative to prohibiting the sale of
 
04:22:03.590 --> 04:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
dogs and cats by retail Pet
 
04:22:06.149 --> 04:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
Shops and I know that that's generated a
 
04:22:09.429 --> 04:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
lot lot of conversation on our on our
 
04:22:09.439 --> 04:22:12.149 align:start position:0%
lot lot of conversation on our on our
emails

04:22:12.149 --> 04:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
emails
 
04:22:16.469 --> 04:22:16.479 align:start position:0%
um so I mean for my own my own thoughts
 
04:22:18.830 --> 04:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
on this is that you know this is this is
 
04:22:21.030 --> 04:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
a bill we've heard before in this
 
04:22:21.040 --> 04:22:23.070 align:start position:0%
a bill we've heard before in this
committee

04:22:23.070 --> 04:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:22:29.630 --> 04:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
um I find it to be a um anti-business
 
04:22:32.389 --> 04:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
Bill uh I think if we want to have the
 
04:22:34.309 --> 04:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
conversation about where these pet
 
04:22:36.990 --> 04:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
stores are sourcing their
 
04:22:39.389 --> 04:22:39.399 align:start position:0%
animals from we can have that
 
04:22:42.189 --> 04:22:42.199 align:start position:0%
conversation but I don't believe that
 
04:22:45.309 --> 04:22:45.319 align:start position:0%
banning any particular kind of
 
04:22:51.429 --> 04:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:53.870 --> 04:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
doing representative
 
04:22:56.990 --> 04:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
NAB yes thank you madam chair um I would
 
04:22:58.710 --> 04:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
overall agree with that I'm a little bit
 
04:23:00.590 --> 04:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with Banning a specific
 
04:23:03.469 --> 04:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
type of business and it feels like
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
that's a tough path forward in the state
 
04:23:10.830 --> 04:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
um but it does seem um it's troubling to
 
04:23:12.910 --> 04:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
me that there's actually not a lot of
 
04:23:14.670 --> 04:23:14.680 align:start position:0%
back a lot of Regulation around the
 
04:23:17.550 --> 04:23:17.560 align:start position:0%
sourcing of these animals and that seems
 
04:23:19.790 --> 04:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
like that to me that seems like a really
 
04:23:21.550 --> 04:23:21.560 align:start position:0%
Common Sense path forward to put some
 
04:23:24.670 --> 04:23:24.680 align:start position:0%
guidelines into the sourcing of them and
 
04:23:26.670 --> 04:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
um and I think there might be some
 
04:23:28.590 --> 04:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
consideration there in the sourcing of
 
04:23:30.030 --> 04:23:30.040 align:start position:0%
animals that come in through shelters as
 
04:23:33.189 --> 04:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
well I know personally looking for a dog
 
04:23:34.830 --> 04:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
that there are a lot of shelters that
 
04:23:36.950 --> 04:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
offer dogs but probably do come from
 
04:23:38.469 --> 04:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
puppy mills and it might be a positive
 
04:23:39.670 --> 04:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
thing they're trying to rescue them from
 
04:23:41.269 --> 04:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
puppy mills they're not trying to make
 
04:23:43.349 --> 04:23:43.359 align:start position:0%
profit off of them but I think there's a
 
04:23:45.510 --> 04:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
question of understanding where dogs are
 
04:23:47.070 --> 04:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
coming from into the state I don't want
 
04:23:49.189 --> 04:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
to restrict shelters because I think
 
04:23:50.429 --> 04:23:50.439 align:start position:0%
it's really important that shelters in
 
04:23:52.710 --> 04:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are able to to support
 
04:23:53.790 --> 04:23:53.800 align:start position:0%
shelters out of state that are
 
04:23:55.349 --> 04:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
overcrowded and there's a demand in this
 
04:23:59.070 --> 04:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
state but um so I sorry I feel like I'm
 
04:24:00.950 --> 04:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
ramping a little bit but um
 
04:24:03.750 --> 04:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
that's but I but I do think the
 
04:24:05.030 --> 04:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
consideration of sourcing putting
 
04:24:07.109 --> 04:24:07.119 align:start position:0%
guidelines around sourcing it's a it's a
 
04:24:09.590 --> 04:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
really necessary path forward to ensure
 
04:24:12.349 --> 04:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
the health of these animals um and I
 
04:24:13.349 --> 04:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
would just comment that I was a little
 
04:24:14.830 --> 04:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
surprised we didn't hear from any of the
 
04:24:17.750 --> 04:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
pet stores um either by email or in
 
04:24:21.269 --> 04:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
testimony and I I do sort of wish we had
 
04:24:25.149 --> 04:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
so thank you sure representative Bixby
 
04:24:28.510 --> 04:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
yeah um sort of following up on
 
04:24:30.189 --> 04:24:30.199 align:start position:0%
representative nab's point about
 
04:24:33.510 --> 04:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
sourcing I think that uh there I think
 
04:24:37.870 --> 04:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
there may be uh a real issue in terms of
 
04:24:39.950 --> 04:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
how animals are sourced both by pet
 
04:24:43.630 --> 04:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
stores and by uh rescues and shelters
 
04:24:47.429 --> 04:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
and uh that um I think we heard in
 
04:24:49.830 --> 04:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
testimony from the I believe it was from
 
04:24:54.229 --> 04:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
the Department that uh there
 
04:24:57.429 --> 04:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
um there is
 
04:25:00.389 --> 04:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
uh what the information we have about
 
04:25:03.229 --> 04:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
dogs coming into the state is really
 
04:25:04.950 --> 04:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
insufficient in order to be able to
 
04:25:07.309 --> 04:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
track their potential for carrying
 
04:25:10.750 --> 04:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
disease into the state uh there uh the
 
04:25:14.149 --> 04:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
possibility of them being uh brought
 
04:25:18.830 --> 04:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
from areas that uh either from from uh
 
04:25:21.590 --> 04:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
breeders that are not uh following
 
04:25:24.990 --> 04:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines or uh brought in from
 
04:25:27.630 --> 04:25:27.640 align:start position:0%
other countries where there is a higher
 
04:25:29.670 --> 04:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
prevalence prevalence of rabies and
 
04:25:33.109 --> 04:25:33.119 align:start position:0%
others of anotic diseases uh so I think
 
04:25:35.750 --> 04:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
that there's that there's a bigger issue
 
04:25:38.309 --> 04:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
behind this build and whether or not we
 
04:25:40.910 --> 04:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
have uh some number of pet stores in the
 
04:25:43.149 --> 04:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
state that are selling animals that may
 
04:25:45.349 --> 04:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
or may not have been served from puppy
 
04:25:50.429 --> 04:25:50.439 align:start position:0%
mills uh and I also think that you know
 
04:25:54.109 --> 04:25:54.119 align:start position:0%
uh especially given that this excludes
 
04:25:57.469 --> 04:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
the existing pet stores uh there's going
 
04:26:01.429 --> 04:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
to be absolutely no Market impact of the
 
04:26:05.389 --> 04:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire on the uh on
 
04:26:07.109 --> 04:26:07.119 align:start position:0%
poppy Mill
 
04:26:09.189 --> 04:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh from this from the number that would
 
04:26:12.070 --> 04:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
come through retail pet stores I think
 
04:26:15.670 --> 04:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
that uh there another issue that uh is
 
04:26:18.349 --> 04:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
sort of parallel issue is what about
 
04:26:23.070 --> 04:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
internet sales where there are uh where
 
04:26:27.349 --> 04:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
the uh actual transfer of the animal uh
 
04:26:29.710 --> 04:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
H happens without any paperwork in a
 
04:26:32.229 --> 04:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
parking lot somewhere off a
 
04:26:35.309 --> 04:26:35.319 align:start position:0%
highway also not this this bill would
 
04:26:37.790 --> 04:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
not do anything about about that um I
 
04:26:40.030 --> 04:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
have I know people who have gotten
 
04:26:44.309 --> 04:26:44.319 align:start position:0%
animals that way but uh that's that's
 
04:26:46.429 --> 04:26:46.439 align:start position:0%
something else that is I think a bigger
 
04:26:49.269 --> 04:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
issue in terms of problematic souring of
 
04:26:51.070 --> 04:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
animals I think this bill does not
 
04:26:54.070 --> 04:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
address enough of the PO possible
 
04:26:57.229 --> 04:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
problems uh to make it worth
 
04:26:59.990 --> 04:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
passing representative Murray thank you
 
04:27:01.750 --> 04:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair I concur uh with
 
04:27:03.389 --> 04:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby as well I think the
 
04:27:06.630 --> 04:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
underlying con uh concern really is uh
 
04:27:10.269 --> 04:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
around sourcing and also I agree that if
 
04:27:13.790 --> 04:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
we if we're not truly clear on where
 
04:27:16.189 --> 04:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
that ultimate source whether it's
 
04:27:18.109 --> 04:27:18.119 align:start position:0%
instate out of state internationally
 
04:27:19.750 --> 04:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
these animals are potentially coming
 
04:27:22.670 --> 04:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
from there is also a larger concern for
 
04:27:25.550 --> 04:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
zoonotic disease transfer if um we don't
 
04:27:28.269 --> 04:27:28.279 align:start position:0%
even have a great handle on the
 
04:27:30.990 --> 04:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
sourcing I know that
 
04:27:35.309 --> 04:27:35.319 align:start position:0%
um was I guess Taylor Lil who had sent
 
04:27:40.550 --> 04:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
us um um an email that had um State pet
 
04:27:43.349 --> 04:27:43.359 align:start position:0%
store sourcing I'm trying to pull this
 
04:27:43.359 --> 04:27:45.229 align:start position:0%
store sourcing I'm trying to pull this
up

04:27:45.229 --> 04:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:27:45.239 --> 04:27:49.790 align:start position:0%
up
here

04:27:49.790 --> 04:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:54.469 --> 04:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
uh I can't get this um but she had a a
 
04:27:56.109 --> 04:27:56.119 align:start position:0%
list of different states and what some
 
04:27:59.830 --> 04:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
of their laws were uh having to do with
 
04:28:02.349 --> 04:28:02.359 align:start position:0%
uh pets being imported into the state
 
04:28:05.070 --> 04:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
and um I thought that that that was a
 
04:28:07.469 --> 04:28:07.479 align:start position:0%
document that was very you know
 
04:28:10.030 --> 04:28:10.040 align:start position:0%
interesting to see statute from
 
04:28:12.030 --> 04:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
different states on how they control a
 
04:28:14.349 --> 04:28:14.359 align:start position:0%
little bit better uh the sourcing of
 
04:28:18.510 --> 04:28:18.520 align:start position:0%
these animals so um I'm going to see if
 
04:28:19.910 --> 04:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
I can't pull this up and then in the
 
04:28:22.269 --> 04:28:22.279 align:start position:0%
meantime representative com while you
 
04:28:25.109 --> 04:28:25.119 align:start position:0%
can uh
 
04:28:31.630 --> 04:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
uh no thank you madam chair um so one of
 
04:28:31.640 --> 04:28:34.790 align:start position:0%
uh no thank you madam chair um so one of
the

04:28:34.790 --> 04:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:34.800 --> 04:28:38.550 align:start position:0%
 
things

04:28:38.550 --> 04:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:41.149 --> 04:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
do you have copies of the state dog and
 
04:28:43.189 --> 04:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
cat sourcing restrictions and breeder
 
04:28:45.790 --> 04:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
standards okay yes so you thank you if
 
04:28:49.269 --> 04:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
you can pass that along uh along uh you
 
04:28:53.469 --> 04:28:53.479 align:start position:0%
had a uh list of Statute that Arizona
 
04:28:53.479 --> 04:28:55.710 align:start position:0%
had a uh list of Statute that Arizona
Connecticut

04:28:55.710 --> 04:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
Connecticut
 
04:28:58.030 --> 04:28:58.040 align:start position:0%
Louisiana uh New
 
04:29:00.510 --> 04:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
Jersey Ohio and
 
04:29:06.670 --> 04:29:06.680 align:start position:0%
Virginia um they have different laws uh
 
04:29:09.550 --> 04:29:09.560 align:start position:0%
regarding how animals come into the
 
04:29:14.590 --> 04:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
state and how animals are sourced from
 
04:29:17.990 --> 04:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
different um you know licensed breeders
 
04:29:21.550 --> 04:29:21.560 align:start position:0%
versus unlicensed and so forth so that's
 
04:29:23.429 --> 04:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
an interesting document I think we
 
04:29:26.189 --> 04:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
should take a look at representative
 
04:29:29.510 --> 04:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
coma thank you madam chair what I found
 
04:29:32.550 --> 04:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
interesting in the testimony is that
 
04:29:32.560 --> 04:29:33.429 align:start position:0%
interesting in the testimony is that
pent

04:29:33.429 --> 04:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
pent
 
04:29:37.630 --> 04:29:37.640 align:start position:0%
vendors or people that transfer animals
 
04:29:39.790 --> 04:29:39.800 align:start position:0%
are required to have a health
 
04:29:42.910 --> 04:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
certificate uh within the last 14 within
 
04:29:45.030 --> 04:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
14 days of transferring that
 
04:29:49.030 --> 04:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
animal however shelters are
 
04:29:50.790 --> 04:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
excluded I
 
04:29:53.309 --> 04:29:53.319 align:start position:0%
think that there should be no exemption
 
04:29:55.830 --> 04:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
for any animal whether it's in state or
 
04:29:58.750 --> 04:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
out of state and that all animals being
 
04:30:00.710 --> 04:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
transferred should have a health
 
04:30:04.070 --> 04:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
certificate because that is the only way
 
04:30:05.269 --> 04:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
that we're going to make sure that
 
04:30:07.710 --> 04:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
people getting healthy animals and it's
 
04:30:09.550 --> 04:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
the only way we can hold the
 
04:30:11.389 --> 04:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
veterinarians are not going to put their
 
04:30:14.349 --> 04:30:14.359 align:start position:0%
license on the line if they're not
 
04:30:17.990 --> 04:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
transferring a healthy animal and a
 
04:30:19.469 --> 04:30:19.479 align:start position:0%
health certificate and the reason it's
 
04:30:21.790 --> 04:30:21.800 align:start position:0%
only good and I'm not sure if we change
 
04:30:24.389 --> 04:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
it from 10 to 14 days but it's in that
 
04:30:26.670 --> 04:30:26.680 align:start position:0%
area and the reason it's only good for
 
04:30:28.030 --> 04:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
that is because they're putting their
 
04:30:30.429 --> 04:30:30.439 align:start position:0%
license on the line that says at this
 
04:30:33.670 --> 04:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
time this animal was healthy and they
 
04:30:35.630 --> 04:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
would not even guarantee that out more
 
04:30:38.550 --> 04:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
more than two weeks so if you did not
 
04:30:39.990 --> 04:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
transfer that animal within the two
 
04:30:41.469 --> 04:30:41.479 align:start position:0%
weeks you would have to go back to the
 
04:30:43.349 --> 04:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
vet and get another health certificate
 
04:30:45.990 --> 04:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
and I don't think any animal from a
 
04:30:49.790 --> 04:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
shelter rescue or pet vendor or pet
 
04:30:51.670 --> 04:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
store should be excluded from those
 
04:30:54.389 --> 04:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
requirements and I really think that we
 
04:30:56.149 --> 04:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to make sure that
 
04:30:59.030 --> 04:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
happens representative ger thank you
 
04:31:02.389 --> 04:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh I want to um Echo the
 
04:31:04.950 --> 04:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
sentiments of number of my colleagues
 
04:31:06.950 --> 04:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
regarding the need to really get to the
 
04:31:09.189 --> 04:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
root of the problem which is sourcing I
 
04:31:12.189 --> 04:31:12.199 align:start position:0%
think that if frankly I think that if if
 
04:31:14.469 --> 04:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
we do if we were able to solve that
 
04:31:16.630 --> 04:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
problem I I think that the kinds of pet
 
04:31:18.870 --> 04:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
stores we're concerned about wouldn't be
 
04:31:20.590 --> 04:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
doing the business they're doing so I
 
04:31:22.229 --> 04:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
completely agree with that I do want to
 
04:31:23.830 --> 04:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
say that I was a little concerned during
 
04:31:26.990 --> 04:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
our uh the testimony that we heard that
 
04:31:29.309 --> 04:31:29.319 align:start position:0%
there were moments when I felt like
 
04:31:32.349 --> 04:31:32.359 align:start position:0%
there was an attempt to kind of defend
 
04:31:34.750 --> 04:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
retail pet stores by casting aspersions
 
04:31:36.630 --> 04:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
on the work that sh shelters do I feel
 
04:31:38.030 --> 04:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
like I've heard that echoed a number of
 
04:31:41.030 --> 04:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
times and that concerns me because my
 
04:31:42.550 --> 04:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is when when shelters if
 
04:31:45.309 --> 04:31:45.319 align:start position:0%
you're getting a dog from a puppy mill
 
04:31:47.830 --> 04:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
for example at a shelter it's because
 
04:31:50.030 --> 04:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
these dogs are still rescues that that
 
04:31:52.830 --> 04:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
is what they are uh right and this is an
 
04:31:56.070 --> 04:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
industry that produces by Design far
 
04:31:59.550 --> 04:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
more animals than the market is going to
 
04:32:01.950 --> 04:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
be able to deliver to customers a to use
 
04:32:05.510 --> 04:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
that term but uh so when shelters are
 
04:32:06.790 --> 04:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
performing this work and some of those
 
04:32:08.670 --> 04:32:08.680 align:start position:0%
dogs are coming from from these Mills
 
04:32:11.950 --> 04:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
that we want to see uh
 
04:32:15.349 --> 04:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
discontinued I I I just want to say we
 
04:32:17.109 --> 04:32:17.119 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be putting them in the same
 
04:32:19.389 --> 04:32:19.399 align:start position:0%
category as the kind of pet retailers
 
04:32:21.229 --> 04:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
that we're we're talking about but
 
04:32:23.109 --> 04:32:23.119 align:start position:0%
ultimately I think we do need to get to
 
04:32:26.109 --> 04:32:26.119 align:start position:0%
the to the root cause representative
 
04:32:30.550 --> 04:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
ktoa uh thank you madam chair and I am
 
04:32:34.710 --> 04:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
not I have had dogs from shelters and
 
04:32:34.720 --> 04:32:36.590 align:start position:0%
not I have had dogs from shelters and
rescues

04:32:36.590 --> 04:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
rescues
 
04:32:39.950 --> 04:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
but I do believe that all animals no
 
04:32:41.950 --> 04:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
matter where they come from should have
 
04:32:43.189 --> 04:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
a health
 
04:32:46.229 --> 04:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
certificate I think people have the
 
04:32:47.910 --> 04:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
right to know that they've been examined
 
04:32:50.750 --> 04:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
by a licensed veterinarian in the
 
04:32:52.910 --> 04:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
state unless they're coming from out of
 
04:32:54.109 --> 04:32:54.119 align:start position:0%
state where they would have a different
 
04:32:54.119 --> 04:32:54.990 align:start position:0%
state where they would have a different
health

04:32:54.990 --> 04:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
health
 
04:32:58.109 --> 04:32:58.119 align:start position:0%
certificate but people have the right to
 
04:32:59.670 --> 04:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
know that they're getting a healthy
 
04:33:02.309 --> 04:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
animal and the only way we can do that
 
04:33:04.349 --> 04:33:04.359 align:start position:0%
is if they have a health certificate no
 
04:33:06.830 --> 04:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
matter where they come from
 
04:33:08.189 --> 04:33:08.199 align:start position:0%
very quickly say I'm sorry I I agree
 
04:33:09.789 --> 04:33:09.799 align:start position:0%
with with representative ktoa on that I
 
04:33:11.349 --> 04:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't actually even though it came
 
04:33:13.230 --> 04:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
after your comment it was not meant to
 
04:33:16.390 --> 04:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
address your comments so I understand
 
04:33:18.109 --> 04:33:18.119 align:start position:0%
why it seemed that way but I assure you
 
04:33:20.510 --> 04:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
it was not intended that
 
04:33:24.310 --> 04:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
way represent VI okay so a minor
 
04:33:28.470 --> 04:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
correction uh on for I I think it might
 
04:33:30.709 --> 04:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
just not have been come out very clearly
 
04:33:33.709 --> 04:33:33.719 align:start position:0%
uh about how the about health
 
04:33:38.830 --> 04:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
certificates uh shelters rescues Etc do
 
04:33:40.629 --> 04:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
have to provide a health certificate if
 
04:33:42.949 --> 04:33:42.959 align:start position:0%
the animal is coming from out of state
 
04:33:46.029 --> 04:33:46.039 align:start position:0%
the the logic behind not requiring it
 
04:33:49.390 --> 04:33:49.400 align:start position:0%
from instate was that and and this goes
 
04:33:51.949 --> 04:33:51.959 align:start position:0%
back histo more more historically I
 
04:33:53.510 --> 04:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
don't think this is as big an issue
 
04:33:59.789 --> 04:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
right now was that uh be there the um
 
04:34:04.949 --> 04:34:04.959 align:start position:0%
having a having to have a lot of uh of
 
04:34:08.189 --> 04:34:08.199 align:start position:0%
Health certificates done for Animals uh
 
04:34:11.390 --> 04:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
in shelters that were uh found that were
 
04:34:15.510 --> 04:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
gotten from instate would uh put a a
 
04:34:17.750 --> 04:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
burden on the nonprofits in terms of the
 
04:34:19.949 --> 04:34:19.959 align:start position:0%
cost of the health certificates and that
 
04:34:23.590 --> 04:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
it would uh reduce the speed with which
 
04:34:28.750 --> 04:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
they could get the animals out to uh to
 
04:34:30.470 --> 04:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
people who would want to have them you
 
04:34:33.390 --> 04:34:33.400 align:start position:0%
take them as pets uh I'm not saying that
 
04:34:35.910 --> 04:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
this is a that this is currently
 
04:34:38.830 --> 04:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
good uh a good policy I'm just saying
 
04:34:41.070 --> 04:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
that historically that's the way it it
 
04:34:44.349 --> 04:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
was uh I think that it probably makes
 
04:34:46.390 --> 04:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
sense to revisit whether or not that
 
04:34:49.429 --> 04:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
exemption remains for instate animals
 
04:34:52.910 --> 04:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
from uh and shelters uh I don't think
 
04:34:55.070 --> 04:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is the place to do that
 
04:34:58.230 --> 04:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
reexamination uh I think that uh it
 
04:35:00.949 --> 04:35:00.959 align:start position:0%
probably makes sense to do a bill next
 
04:35:03.029 --> 04:35:03.039 align:start position:0%
year that has to do with sourcing of
 
04:35:05.830 --> 04:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
animals I don't think that this bill is
 
04:35:08.390 --> 04:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
the place to do that to I don't think
 
04:35:10.629 --> 04:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
amending this bill to do that is the
 
04:35:16.109 --> 04:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:18.510 --> 04:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
agree any other
 
04:35:21.269 --> 04:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
comments all right thank you um we will
 
04:35:25.830 --> 04:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:27.670 --> 04:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
1572 which
 
04:35:32.230 --> 04:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
is prohibiting using mRNA technology and
 
04:35:35.390 --> 04:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
food and requiring the labeling of AB
 
04:35:39.629 --> 04:35:39.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
insects how about who wants to start off
 
04:35:45.510 --> 04:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
the conversation on
 
04:35:48.590 --> 04:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
that representative saitis and then
 
04:35:48.600 --> 04:35:50.029 align:start position:0%
that representative saitis and then
representative

04:35:50.029 --> 04:35:50.039 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:35:54.189 --> 04:35:54.199 align:start position:0%
Penza um I would just say that as far as
 
04:35:58.230 --> 04:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:02.551 --> 04:36:02.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:05.990 --> 04:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
Penza Okay so
 
04:36:08.429 --> 04:36:08.439 align:start position:0%
this bill I think
 
04:36:11.029 --> 04:36:11.039 align:start position:0%
um I think it makes sense I just got an
 
04:36:12.750 --> 04:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
article the other day about a beef
 
04:36:16.750 --> 04:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
producer that talked about um that he
 
04:36:18.910 --> 04:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
would shut down his uh
 
04:36:21.109 --> 04:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
manufacturing uh if he was forced to
 
04:36:24.789 --> 04:36:24.799 align:start position:0%
have to inject his um animals with um
 
04:36:27.830 --> 04:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
mRNA technology but I believe just like
 
04:36:29.390 --> 04:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
what we what that was discussed during
 
04:36:31.070 --> 04:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
the hearing when we've talked about a
 
04:36:33.230 --> 04:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
lot of things that are automatically
 
04:36:36.029 --> 04:36:36.039 align:start position:0%
labeled that this is really coming that
 
04:36:40.949 --> 04:36:40.959 align:start position:0%
it this is new technology I get it um
 
04:36:42.590 --> 04:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
but I believe the federal government is
 
04:36:45.670 --> 04:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
going to have a role in this with all of
 
04:36:49.230 --> 04:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
that said um you know I would I would
 
04:36:52.029 --> 04:36:52.039 align:start position:0%
recommend maybe we could put this into a
 
04:36:55.310 --> 04:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
interim study at this point um there's
 
04:36:57.390 --> 04:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
parts of the bill that I that I I think
 
04:36:59.990 --> 04:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
are just unnecessary to be in there I
 
04:37:02.670 --> 04:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
think this has to do with um honesty and
 
04:37:05.390 --> 04:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
labeling um I've done a little research
 
04:37:09.910 --> 04:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
in in regards with the bugs and um
 
04:37:12.070 --> 04:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
crickets are usually only listed as like
 
04:37:12.080 --> 04:37:12.990 align:start position:0%
crickets are usually only listed as like
cricket

04:37:12.990 --> 04:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
cricket
 
04:37:16.070 --> 04:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
flower um ever rarely they're put by
 
04:37:18.990 --> 04:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
their scientific name so and crickets
 
04:37:20.629 --> 04:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
are I guess the only thing that is
 
04:37:24.310 --> 04:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
actually used in food right now um you
 
04:37:26.910 --> 04:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
know that we've heard from that are from
 
04:37:29.590 --> 04:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
the Feds that are the FDA allows or
 
04:37:34.470 --> 04:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
whatever so uh I I think that um I like
 
04:37:35.670 --> 04:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
the idea
 
04:37:37.470 --> 04:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
because I I think we should have uh
 
04:37:39.551 --> 04:37:39.561 align:start position:0%
honesty in in labeling we should know
 
04:37:41.029 --> 04:37:41.039 align:start position:0%
what we're eating and where our food
 
04:37:44.551 --> 04:37:44.561 align:start position:0%
comes from but that's my two cents thank
 
04:37:47.629 --> 04:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
you um I I just want to say that I I had
 
04:37:49.949 --> 04:37:49.959 align:start position:0%
some conversations with a fellow named
 
04:37:52.910 --> 04:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
Aaron Hobbs who is the executive
 
04:37:55.070 --> 04:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
director of the North American Coalition
 
04:37:57.230 --> 04:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
for insect
 
04:38:00.189 --> 04:38:00.199 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and he sent me an email and
 
04:38:03.070 --> 04:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
called me and talking about this bill
 
04:38:06.150 --> 04:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
and basically let me know that that the
 
04:38:08.910 --> 04:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
only insect that is allowed or
 
04:38:11.390 --> 04:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
permissible in to be used as an
 
04:38:13.070 --> 04:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
ingredient in
 
04:38:16.390 --> 04:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
food purposefully I mean I know there's
 
04:38:20.029 --> 04:38:20.039 align:start position:0%
bug parts in some of our food anyway but
 
04:38:23.429 --> 04:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
uh he said the only uh insect that is
 
04:38:27.429 --> 04:38:27.439 align:start position:0%
allowed by the FDA is Crickets at this
 
04:38:29.629 --> 04:38:29.639 align:start position:0%
time and
 
04:38:34.551 --> 04:38:34.561 align:start position:0%
um he also said that um with regard to
 
04:38:37.150 --> 04:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
lab in
 
04:38:40.150 --> 04:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
insects based on federal
 
04:38:45.670 --> 04:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
law um all ingredients and this is in
 
04:38:48.830 --> 04:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah in federal law he's he stated
 
04:38:51.830 --> 04:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
the chapter and everything ingredients
 
04:38:54.150 --> 04:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
required to be declared on the label or
 
04:38:56.830 --> 04:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
labeling of a food including foods that
 
04:39:00.390 --> 04:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
comply with standards of identity accept
 
04:39:03.830 --> 04:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
those ingredients Exempted by
 
04:39:07.230 --> 04:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
101100 shall be listed by Common or
 
04:39:09.990 --> 04:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
usual name in descending order of
 
04:39:12.109 --> 04:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
predominance by weight on either the
 
04:39:14.349 --> 04:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
principal display panel or the
 
04:39:16.590 --> 04:39:16.600 align:start position:0%
information panel in accordance with the
 
04:39:18.390 --> 04:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
provisions of
 
04:39:20.869 --> 04:39:20.879 align:start position:0%
101.2 except that ingredients and
 
04:39:23.230 --> 04:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
dietary supplements that are listed in
 
04:39:25.990 --> 04:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
the nutrition label in accordance with
 
04:39:28.470 --> 04:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
10136 need not be repeated in the
 
04:39:32.470 --> 04:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
ingredient list so you know with regard
 
04:39:33.830 --> 04:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
to truth and
 
04:39:33.840 --> 04:39:35.429 align:start position:0%
to truth and
labeling

04:39:35.429 --> 04:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
labeling
 
04:39:39.670 --> 04:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
if there is a an insect in your food
 
04:39:42.390 --> 04:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
purposefully it is supposed to be listed
 
04:39:45.670 --> 04:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
by its common or usual name so that's by
 
04:39:45.680 --> 04:39:46.750 align:start position:0%
by its common or usual name so that's by
federal

04:39:46.750 --> 04:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
federal
 
04:39:50.590 --> 04:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
law um and with regard
 
04:39:55.310 --> 04:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
to the rest of the the bill I
 
04:39:59.310 --> 04:39:59.320 align:start position:0%
mean I I I would like to know if there's
 
04:40:01.590 --> 04:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
lab grown meat in my food and I'd like
 
04:40:03.990 --> 04:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
to know if there is any other kind of
 
04:40:06.190 --> 04:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
bugs in my food food and I'd like to
 
04:40:09.350 --> 04:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
know if there's ingredients that contain
 
04:40:12.270 --> 04:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
some mRNA technology it's no different
 
04:40:15.390 --> 04:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
than when we went through wanting to
 
04:40:18.590 --> 04:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
have labeled GMO stuff or milk that's
 
04:40:24.030 --> 04:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
got BST or and hormones or um you
 
04:40:27.470 --> 04:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
know or you know any of the other
 
04:40:29.150 --> 04:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
ingredients that were concerned about in
 
04:40:32.110 --> 04:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
our life but by the same
 
04:40:34.708 --> 04:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
token it seems to me that kind of lab
 
04:40:36.868 --> 04:40:36.878 align:start position:0%
labing has to come from the federal
 
04:40:38.868 --> 04:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
government because I don't know that
 
04:40:41.390 --> 04:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
each individual State can dictate what
 
04:40:44.750 --> 04:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
goes on labels I think that becomes a
 
04:40:46.990 --> 04:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
problem because then you have these
 
04:40:49.510 --> 04:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
producers that would have to have 50
 
04:40:51.310 --> 04:40:51.320 align:start position:0%
different kinds of labels on their
 
04:40:54.110 --> 04:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
products anyway that's kind of I just
 
04:40:56.030 --> 04:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to let you know my conversation
 
04:40:59.430 --> 04:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
with Mr Hobbs and take it away
 
04:41:02.990 --> 04:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative Morris thank you um I I I
 
04:41:04.750 --> 04:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
agree with what you just said I think
 
04:41:07.830 --> 04:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
think that um when it comes to States
 
04:41:09.948 --> 04:41:09.958 align:start position:0%
labeling food and making those decisions
 
04:41:12.948 --> 04:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
it starts to get very muddy um there was
 
04:41:16.510 --> 04:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
recently a study done that had uh 2% of
 
04:41:18.070 --> 04:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
the hot dogs that they tested had human
 
04:41:21.390 --> 04:41:21.400 align:start position:0%
DNA in them so when we start to have
 
04:41:23.550 --> 04:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
these discussions about what is in our
 
04:41:26.470 --> 04:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
food and you know whether or not that's
 
04:41:27.948 --> 04:41:27.958 align:start position:0%
a fingernail or hair or whatever who
 
04:41:30.670 --> 04:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
know but the point is if we start to go
 
04:41:33.470 --> 04:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
down this road of the State of New
 
04:41:35.230 --> 04:41:35.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire telling every single food
 
04:41:37.510 --> 04:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
company that they have to label every
 
04:41:41.150 --> 04:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
single thing whether it's you know human
 
04:41:45.910 --> 04:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
DNA in your hot dog or you know mRNA
 
04:41:47.550 --> 04:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
technology or any of these things I
 
04:41:50.628 --> 04:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
think that it becomes too difficult for
 
04:41:52.270 --> 04:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
us to do at the state level and this is
 
04:41:54.110 --> 04:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be taken care of
 
04:41:56.470 --> 04:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
at the at a federal level representative
 
04:41:59.708 --> 04:41:59.718 align:start position:0%
Bixby and then NAB and then poten yeah
 
04:42:03.910 --> 04:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
so Mr mRNA has been around for hundreds
 
04:42:08.150 --> 04:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
of millions of not billions of years and
 
04:42:12.150 --> 04:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh biological organisms have uh
 
04:42:15.110 --> 04:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
developed uh enzymes that break down our
 
04:42:20.070 --> 04:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
Mr RNA within hours to at the most days
 
04:42:22.670 --> 04:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
of the time that it enters the the
 
04:42:26.990 --> 04:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
organism uh in order to get mRNA to
 
04:42:30.868 --> 04:42:30.878 align:start position:0%
persist in some it would be impossible
 
04:42:34.310 --> 04:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
with uh now today's technology probably
 
04:42:36.868 --> 04:42:36.878 align:start position:0%
not not even within you know hundreds of
 
04:42:40.390 --> 04:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
years of technology to grow figure out
 
04:42:42.948 --> 04:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
how to grow an animal or a plant that
 
04:42:46.590 --> 04:42:46.600 align:start position:0%
would have Mr that would have mRNA that
 
04:42:49.430 --> 04:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
would function as a vaccine for whoever
 
04:42:53.150 --> 04:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
was consuming it uh it's just not
 
04:42:56.708 --> 04:42:56.718 align:start position:0%
possible um in terms of mRNA and
 
04:42:59.470 --> 04:42:59.480 align:start position:0%
vaccines it requires an a vast amount of
 
04:43:03.230 --> 04:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
engineering to get the uh the
 
04:43:07.150 --> 04:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
MRNA uh from the vaccine into the cell
 
04:43:09.590 --> 04:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
where it will Express itself for a
 
04:43:11.750 --> 04:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
little while in order to create an
 
04:43:14.830 --> 04:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
immune response and then it breaks down
 
04:43:14.840 --> 04:43:15.868 align:start position:0%
immune response and then it breaks down
uh

04:43:15.868 --> 04:43:15.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:43:21.670 --> 04:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
so uh the if a if mRNA is injected into
 
04:43:26.430 --> 04:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
a uh into an animal if if if you have an
 
04:43:29.270 --> 04:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
mRNA vaccine like the covid vaccine that
 
04:43:32.150 --> 04:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
injected into an animal for a particular
 
04:43:34.190 --> 04:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
disease that they're trying to inoculate
 
04:43:34.200 --> 04:43:35.510 align:start position:0%
disease that they're trying to inoculate
gas

04:43:35.510 --> 04:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
gas
 
04:43:38.750 --> 04:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh the MRNA from that will be destroyed
 
04:43:43.310 --> 04:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
within a day or two at the most uh and
 
04:43:45.190 --> 04:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
what will be left will be the immune
 
04:43:48.070 --> 04:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
immune response which will uh hopefully
 
04:43:51.230 --> 04:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
protect the animal from the disease uh
 
04:43:55.190 --> 04:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
so uh it's there's in terms of having
 
04:43:57.470 --> 04:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
this in our food supply it's really a
 
04:44:00.830 --> 04:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
non-issue uh and in terms of whether
 
04:44:03.350 --> 04:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's something that a particular farmer
 
04:44:05.070 --> 04:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
will want to use on on his or her
 
04:44:07.788 --> 04:44:07.798 align:start position:0%
animals or not that is a choice that the
 
04:44:10.788 --> 04:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
farmer gets to make okay and as as as
 
04:44:15.550 --> 04:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
far as I know I've been ined that
 
04:44:19.110 --> 04:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
there's no farm animals in New Hampshire
 
04:44:23.030 --> 04:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
that have had any kind of mRNA
 
04:44:26.510 --> 04:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
vaccinations available to them I don't
 
04:44:29.190 --> 04:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
know that's kind of what I heard from
 
04:44:30.750 --> 04:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
testimony was
 
04:44:34.310 --> 04:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
that um it's not it's not available
 
04:44:37.070 --> 04:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
ailable to anybody yet yeah I I believe
 
04:44:40.310 --> 04:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
that there are some that there is one
 
04:44:43.628 --> 04:44:43.638 align:start position:0%
swine vaccine that is uses M mRNA
 
04:44:46.150 --> 04:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
technology it was it was in one of the
 
04:44:48.910 --> 04:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
links of something that uh was presented
 
04:44:51.830 --> 04:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
by one of our uh someone who tested oh
 
04:44:54.350 --> 04:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
actually from actually from the
 
04:44:58.910 --> 04:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh and uh but uh that's I
 
04:45:02.310 --> 04:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
believe it's being used in the Carol in
 
04:45:04.670 --> 04:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
North Carolina and maybe one other state
 
04:45:06.628 --> 04:45:06.638 align:start position:0%
not New Hampshire not in there was no
 
04:45:07.910 --> 04:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
matching of it being used in New
 
04:45:11.430 --> 04:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire get representative NAB thank
 
04:45:13.390 --> 04:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I just wanted to um
 
04:45:15.510 --> 04:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
agree with you and representative Morris
 
04:45:17.350 --> 04:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
and remind people that um the
 
04:45:19.230 --> 04:45:19.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner when we had the hearing
 
04:45:20.910 --> 04:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
told us this would severely limit the
 
04:45:22.430 --> 04:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
food options in New Hampshire and going
 
04:45:24.470 --> 04:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
to really disrupt our supply chain if we
 
04:45:26.868 --> 04:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
enact these requirements so for that
 
04:45:28.110 --> 04:45:28.120 align:start position:0%
reason I would also agree with the
 
04:45:31.230 --> 04:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
representative sopus about iing the Bill
 
04:45:33.270 --> 04:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:45:33.280 --> 04:45:35.070 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
Penza

04:45:35.070 --> 04:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
Penza
 
04:45:36.470 --> 04:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
I think if we're going to talk about
 
04:45:39.390 --> 04:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
anything that has to do with labeling we
 
04:45:41.590 --> 04:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
could take this down on a local level
 
04:45:43.910 --> 04:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
since we're already requiring certain
 
04:45:46.310 --> 04:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
labeling of producers here in New
 
04:45:47.948 --> 04:45:47.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so if this was New Hampshire
 
04:45:50.830 --> 04:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
specific and there's a someone that is
 
04:45:53.550 --> 04:45:53.560 align:start position:0%
providing pork it's been since
 
04:45:57.470 --> 04:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
2018 um there's uh some some pork
 
04:45:59.470 --> 04:45:59.480 align:start position:0%
producers that are that are injecting
 
04:46:02.788 --> 04:46:02.798 align:start position:0%
them with M mRNA technology but I I
 
04:46:04.990 --> 04:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
think that would be the only only way
 
04:46:07.230 --> 04:46:07.240 align:start position:0%
that this um this bill would have a
 
04:46:09.430 --> 04:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
place to go would be if that would just
 
04:46:12.150 --> 04:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
be um them having to disclose that if
 
04:46:14.910 --> 04:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
some if you're purchasing meat from you
 
04:46:17.510 --> 04:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
know let's say a butcher that's local
 
04:46:21.070 --> 04:46:21.080 align:start position:0%
that's that I think like a local Farm
 
04:46:24.190 --> 04:46:24.200 align:start position:0%
correct representative
 
04:46:28.310 --> 04:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
CR thank you madam chair the uh I just
 
04:46:31.070 --> 04:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
taking this bill up to 30,000 ft and
 
04:46:33.350 --> 04:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
looking down on it this is like apples
 
04:46:36.150 --> 04:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
oranges and peaches is you got three
 
04:46:37.390 --> 04:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
completely separate things you're
 
04:46:40.430 --> 04:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
talking labeling you're talking Banning
 
04:46:42.670 --> 04:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
you're talking all sorts of stuff all
 
04:46:43.788 --> 04:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
three of which
 
04:46:47.030 --> 04:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
have um Cricket I was gonna say apples
 
04:46:48.990 --> 04:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
oranges and crickets
 
04:46:52.590 --> 04:46:52.600 align:start position:0%
crickets you got it so but but in my
 
04:46:55.030 --> 04:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
mind none of those three are well
 
04:46:58.830 --> 04:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
thought out and and if if nothing
 
04:47:02.150 --> 04:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
happens no one's going to die today so I
 
04:47:05.510 --> 04:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
I'm an itl for this bill um and if
 
04:47:06.868 --> 04:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
there's something specific we want to
 
04:47:09.670 --> 04:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
work on crickets or artificial meat or
 
04:47:10.628 --> 04:47:10.638 align:start position:0%
something like that let's knock
 
04:47:12.910 --> 04:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
ourselves out but right now I I just
 
04:47:16.110 --> 04:47:16.120 align:start position:0%
think it's a it's like a Frankenstein
 
04:47:19.430 --> 04:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
bill yeah you know but I I understand
 
04:47:23.110 --> 04:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
the concern of the sponsor of the bill
 
04:47:25.270 --> 04:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
in so far as you know wanting to
 
04:47:27.590 --> 04:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
know what's in your food that you're
 
04:47:30.670 --> 04:47:30.680 align:start position:0%
purchasing and that's a very valid
 
04:47:34.270 --> 04:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
concern um but I I also don't know that
 
04:47:36.830 --> 04:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
this is the correct vehicle to do that
 
04:47:41.150 --> 04:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
and um I I in so far as talking about
 
04:47:43.350 --> 04:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
labeling I mean I remember when we went
 
04:47:47.190 --> 04:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
through the whole um compost thing of
 
04:47:51.070 --> 04:47:51.080 align:start position:0%
what is it the the disposable wipes and
 
04:47:52.430 --> 04:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
there wasn't really anything that we
 
04:47:55.430 --> 04:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
could do as a state to say that no on
 
04:47:57.788 --> 04:47:57.798 align:start position:0%
the label these are not really
 
04:48:02.190 --> 04:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
compostable or flushable and that again
 
04:48:05.868 --> 04:48:05.878 align:start position:0%
becomes a federal labeling
 
04:48:10.030 --> 04:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
issue and um so I I don't again I don't
 
04:48:14.628 --> 04:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
know that uh we can dictate what goes on
 
04:48:17.150 --> 04:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
these labels for our state
 
04:48:17.160 --> 04:48:18.270 align:start position:0%
these labels for our state
representative

04:48:18.270 --> 04:48:18.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:48:20.948 --> 04:48:20.958 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam
 
04:48:24.948 --> 04:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
chair so my question is is as we did
 
04:48:26.670 --> 04:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
with the disposable wipes we sent
 
04:48:29.708 --> 04:48:29.718 align:start position:0%
something to the federal delegation
 
04:48:32.390 --> 04:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
asking uh for them to look into the
 
04:48:34.910 --> 04:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
labeling and would that be something
 
04:48:37.190 --> 04:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
that this committee could do to look at
 
04:48:38.868 --> 04:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
and say you know we really feel it's
 
04:48:42.310 --> 04:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
necessary uh that people know if they're
 
04:48:45.830 --> 04:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
having lab grown meet uh or something
 
04:48:48.310 --> 04:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
like that I'm just just question I I
 
04:48:50.110 --> 04:48:50.120 align:start position:0%
think a letter to the delegation from
 
04:48:51.910 --> 04:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
this committee would be a really good
 
04:48:55.788 --> 04:48:55.798 align:start position:0%
idea to say uh you know from a federal
 
04:48:59.390 --> 04:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
standpoint uh we as the New Hampshire uh
 
04:49:00.990 --> 04:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
house environment and agriculture
 
04:49:03.628 --> 04:49:03.638 align:start position:0%
committee are interested in seeing truth
 
04:49:06.548 --> 04:49:06.558 align:start position:0%
and labeling uh for the for the foods
 
04:49:09.310 --> 04:49:09.320 align:start position:0%
that people are consuming and that if it
 
04:49:12.708 --> 04:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
does contain insects it should say so if
 
04:49:15.150 --> 04:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
it does contain lab grown meat it should
 
04:49:19.750 --> 04:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
say so so um I think that's a very good
 
04:49:24.350 --> 04:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:30.270 --> 04:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:34.830 --> 04:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
then uh let's see HP 1565
 
04:49:36.670 --> 04:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
uh relative to the sale of Homestead
 
04:49:38.990 --> 04:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
food to Consumers and local food
 
04:49:41.390 --> 04:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
production and I wonder if the committee
 
04:49:45.510 --> 04:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
would like to speak um on both bills HB
 
04:49:50.150 --> 04:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
1685 since they are somewhat the
 
04:49:54.150 --> 04:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
same uh just to save time and not rehash
 
04:49:56.350 --> 04:49:56.360 align:start position:0%
the same thing from Bill to bill so why
 
04:49:58.948 --> 04:49:58.958 align:start position:0%
don't we why don't we talk of them talk
 
04:50:02.190 --> 04:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
about both bills um and just in general
 
04:50:07.788 --> 04:50:07.798 align:start position:0%
the concept of of um changing the rsas
 
04:50:12.510 --> 04:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
to be less restrictive for uh certain
 
04:50:15.548 --> 04:50:15.558 align:start position:0%
food producers in the state and what
 
04:50:17.590 --> 04:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
that would look like representative
 
04:50:20.750 --> 04:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
dsy yes thank you madam chair um in
 
04:50:23.910 --> 04:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
thinking about this bill uh I came to
 
04:50:26.510 --> 04:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
the conclusion that both bills are in
 
04:50:29.590 --> 04:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
the wrong committee and the reason I say
 
04:50:31.830 --> 04:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
that is I think it was last session or
 
04:50:34.990 --> 04:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
the session before we dealt dealt with
 
04:50:38.470 --> 04:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh Homestead food act but that was
 
04:50:44.190 --> 04:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
around um the um dollar amount in sales
 
04:50:48.470 --> 04:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
um you know before uh lure or inspection
 
04:50:51.470 --> 04:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
or or having a license would be invoked
 
04:50:53.510 --> 04:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
and I think something like that is very
 
04:50:56.830 --> 04:50:56.840 align:start position:0%
much business oriented it touches on
 
04:50:59.670 --> 04:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
agriculture and you know I felt very
 
04:51:02.150 --> 04:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
comfortable listening to that bill and
 
04:51:04.830 --> 04:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
voting to approve it this on the other
 
04:51:08.350 --> 04:51:08.360 align:start position:0%
hand is a bill that really requires I
 
04:51:11.670 --> 04:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
think more scientific uh information and
 
04:51:16.470 --> 04:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
in uh and I do not feel comfortable um
 
04:51:20.070 --> 04:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
passing a bill when I really don't
 
04:51:23.310 --> 04:51:23.320 align:start position:0%
understand and have a lot of knowledge U
 
04:51:26.670 --> 04:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
regarding food safety issues uh I did
 
04:51:30.510 --> 04:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
read uh you know a gentleman's um uh
 
04:51:33.590 --> 04:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
letter that we got Mr Ren bodan from
 
04:51:37.070 --> 04:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
from from nashwa who is a you know uh
 
04:51:39.070 --> 04:51:39.080 align:start position:0%
taught uh
 
04:51:42.350 --> 04:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
microbiology and food safety uh to the
 
04:51:45.670 --> 04:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
nurses at Rivier and you know he uh was
 
04:51:47.270 --> 04:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
a very good letter raised some
 
04:51:49.910 --> 04:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
cautionary issues and it was at that
 
04:51:51.788 --> 04:51:51.798 align:start position:0%
point that I realized I just don't have
 
04:51:53.868 --> 04:51:53.878 align:start position:0%
the expertise and I don't think this
 
04:51:55.670 --> 04:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
committee does I think it should be in
 
04:51:57.470 --> 04:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
uh Health and Human
 
04:52:01.030 --> 04:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
Services representative Bixby yeah um I
 
04:52:03.750 --> 04:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
respectively I need to disagree uh
 
04:52:08.190 --> 04:52:08.200 align:start position:0%
because the uh this committee one of the
 
04:52:11.310 --> 04:52:11.320 align:start position:0%
one of the purviews of this committee is
 
04:52:15.990 --> 04:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
the food safety um uh the Food Safety
 
04:52:18.350 --> 04:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
Division of
 
04:52:24.390 --> 04:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
DHHS so um uh so we very so basically if
 
04:52:27.030 --> 04:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
it has to do with food safety it's this
 
04:52:29.350 --> 04:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
committee's job and that's that's in
 
04:52:33.310 --> 04:52:33.320 align:start position:0%
that's in our in the house rules agree
 
04:52:33.320 --> 04:52:34.350 align:start position:0%
that's in our in the house rules agree
absolutely

04:52:34.350 --> 04:52:34.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
04:52:34.360 --> 04:52:36.430 align:start position:0%
absolutely
representative

04:52:36.430 --> 04:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:52:39.590 --> 04:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair um I think
 
04:52:40.788 --> 04:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
that if we're going to discuss the two
 
04:52:43.670 --> 04:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
bills together I would I would um say
 
04:52:47.270 --> 04:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
that the that kons bill um 1565 is the
 
04:52:50.230 --> 04:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
better of the two um I think um I hear
 
04:52:53.190 --> 04:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
from my constituents that who are in the
 
04:52:55.390 --> 04:52:55.400 align:start position:0%
in this sort of business that that they
 
04:52:58.270 --> 04:52:58.280 align:start position:0%
would really benefit from the expansion
 
04:53:02.110 --> 04:53:02.120 align:start position:0%
I also think that the labeling that um
 
04:53:05.470 --> 04:53:05.480 align:start position:0%
requirements of the US da is sufficient
 
04:53:07.948 --> 04:53:07.958 align:start position:0%
for to um the fact that you're buying
 
04:53:09.430 --> 04:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
the food directly from the person who
 
04:53:11.510 --> 04:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
cooked it and you the ingredients must
 
04:53:13.270 --> 04:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
be listed according to the USDA
 
04:53:16.910 --> 04:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
requirements I think is enough to um to
 
04:53:20.230 --> 04:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
protect the safety or the the validity
 
04:53:21.470 --> 04:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:53:24.310 --> 04:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
food okay representative
 
04:53:27.830 --> 04:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
kraton thank you madam chair I I agree
 
04:53:30.310 --> 04:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
with representative Howard's um
 
04:53:31.708 --> 04:53:31.718 align:start position:0%
assessment on the two
 
04:53:34.948 --> 04:53:34.958 align:start position:0%
bills uh and I'm not taking credit for
 
04:53:36.430 --> 04:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
this idea I think Madam chair it was
 
04:53:40.548 --> 04:53:40.558 align:start position:0%
your idea or someone else's but uh one
 
04:53:44.030 --> 04:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
of the critical parts to
 
04:53:48.190 --> 04:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
um the bill is that uh it was a safety
 
04:53:52.150 --> 04:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
issue and in in the business that I run
 
04:53:54.390 --> 04:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
um which is a guide business we serve
 
04:53:56.708 --> 04:53:56.718 align:start position:0%
several hundreds of meals a year to
 
04:53:59.270 --> 04:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
wound the Warriors and other folks um we
 
04:54:01.910 --> 04:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
did take the the food safe
 
04:54:05.708 --> 04:54:05.718 align:start position:0%
course uh in in preparation for our
 
04:54:08.470 --> 04:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
business and we modified our procedures
 
04:54:10.670 --> 04:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
based on that course so I think if you
 
04:54:13.910 --> 04:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
amended this bill to add a food safe
 
04:54:16.310 --> 04:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
course responsibility certificate
 
04:54:19.590 --> 04:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
whatever that that that would in my mind
 
04:54:23.350 --> 04:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
alleviate some of that safety issue
 
04:54:25.788 --> 04:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
over representative
 
04:54:30.510 --> 04:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
bman thank you uh representative Kon I
 
04:54:31.830 --> 04:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
hope that's the correct
 
04:54:35.030 --> 04:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
pronunciation um I I I would like to add
 
04:54:37.708 --> 04:54:37.718 align:start position:0%
to that I I agree with you on that as a
 
04:54:40.230 --> 04:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
nurse um the one thing here you know I
 
04:54:43.190 --> 04:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
totally support all of these the people
 
04:54:44.390 --> 04:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
who are making the local food and
 
04:54:45.628 --> 04:54:45.638 align:start position:0%
selling I mean this is a great part of
 
04:54:47.150 --> 04:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire right this makes us who we
 
04:54:49.670 --> 04:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
are um at the same time as a nurse I
 
04:54:51.390 --> 04:54:51.400 align:start position:0%
haven't been fully convinced of the
 
04:54:54.110 --> 04:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
safety of it and I'm not really sure how
 
04:54:56.470 --> 04:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
we do that I love this suggestion um
 
04:54:59.110 --> 04:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
about the food safety course um but
 
04:55:01.350 --> 04:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
again I think that it it doesn't seem
 
04:55:03.070 --> 04:55:03.080 align:start position:0%
like we have enough expertise here to
 
04:55:06.190 --> 04:55:06.200 align:start position:0%
know exactly what would make it safe so
 
04:55:08.708 --> 04:55:08.718 align:start position:0%
I um I'm not sure where that leaves us
 
04:55:10.190 --> 04:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
but I would suggest that we would get
 
04:55:11.670 --> 04:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
more input before we would pass
 
04:55:14.670 --> 04:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
something like that representative Bixby
 
04:55:18.750 --> 04:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so um I think that I I like the
 
04:55:23.190 --> 04:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
concept of being able to uh produce more
 
04:55:26.948 --> 04:55:26.958 align:start position:0%
Homestead Foods uh and have them and
 
04:55:29.948 --> 04:55:29.958 align:start position:0%
distribute on on on a relatively limited
 
04:55:34.230 --> 04:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
scale uh and I I think that um I think I
 
04:55:37.270 --> 04:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
like that aspect of both bills uh I
 
04:55:39.230 --> 04:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
think that as other people have pointed
 
04:55:41.430 --> 04:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
out the food safety part of this is not
 
04:55:44.030 --> 04:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
really here yet and I don't think that
 
04:55:46.150 --> 04:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to be able to figure it out
 
04:55:51.510 --> 04:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
in the next week uh and I think that uh
 
04:55:53.670 --> 04:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
this is I think this is a good candidate
 
04:55:55.910 --> 04:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
either for for a study committee or for
 
04:55:58.548 --> 04:55:58.558 align:start position:0%
an interim study uh because I think
 
04:56:01.990 --> 04:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
it'll take us more work to get all the
 
04:56:04.990 --> 04:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
details worked out um we got a letter
 
04:56:07.510 --> 04:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
from uh the department saying that they
 
04:56:09.628 --> 04:56:09.638 align:start position:0%
would be willing to work with us on it
 
04:56:13.628 --> 04:56:13.638 align:start position:0%
they are experts so we can depend on
 
04:56:16.510 --> 04:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
their uh their Knowledge and Skills to
 
04:56:19.830 --> 04:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
help us craft something that would uh
 
04:56:22.390 --> 04:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
expand the uh possibilities for
 
04:56:25.470 --> 04:56:25.480 align:start position:0%
Homestead food but also uh maintain the
 
04:56:27.430 --> 04:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
food safety end of
 
04:56:30.868 --> 04:56:30.878 align:start position:0%
things so here's the deal for me and
 
04:56:33.750 --> 04:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
before I call on other people I mean I
 
04:56:37.230 --> 04:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
have constituents that have Farms um
 
04:56:39.510 --> 04:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
specifically I I'll call out a farm in
 
04:56:42.110 --> 04:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in um Washington New
 
04:56:47.110 --> 04:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um you know she she has a
 
04:56:51.190 --> 04:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
a farm where she produces meat and pork
 
04:56:57.310 --> 04:56:57.320 align:start position:0%
and um chicken and she does she she has
 
04:57:01.110 --> 04:57:01.120 align:start position:0%
a farm store she sells muffins she sells
 
04:57:04.470 --> 04:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
um cookies um all different kinds of
 
04:57:07.628 --> 04:57:07.638 align:start position:0%
things she said to me you know the the
 
04:57:11.230 --> 04:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
food laws are just so
 
04:57:15.190 --> 04:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
um they're so weird she said that how
 
04:57:20.390 --> 04:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
come I can I can bake a uh a you know
 
04:57:23.548 --> 04:57:23.558 align:start position:0%
fruit pie but I can't bake a pumpkin
 
04:57:27.070 --> 04:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
pie I can I I would really love to be
 
04:57:29.670 --> 04:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
able to sell a chicken pot pie and keep
 
04:57:32.030 --> 04:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
it either in my refrigerator case or in
 
04:57:34.830 --> 04:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
my freezer or some sort of beef
 
04:57:37.270 --> 04:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
casserole or something so that you know
 
04:57:39.590 --> 04:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
my customers can have like a a grab andg
 
04:57:39.600 --> 04:57:40.470 align:start position:0%
my customers can have like a a grab andg
go

04:57:40.470 --> 04:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
go
 
04:57:43.190 --> 04:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
dinner and she said you know we we
 
04:57:45.788 --> 04:57:45.798 align:start position:0%
Slaughter all our all our meat USDA
 
04:57:49.708 --> 04:57:49.718 align:start position:0%
facilities we practice you know food
 
04:57:53.750 --> 04:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
safety and I you know I don't see why we
 
04:57:56.708 --> 04:57:56.718 align:start position:0%
can't um we can't sell these different
 
04:57:57.910 --> 04:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
kinds of
 
04:58:01.510 --> 04:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
items by the same token I also
 
04:58:05.390 --> 04:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
understand from DH hs's standpoint they
 
04:58:08.190 --> 04:58:08.200 align:start position:0%
don't want just random people making
 
04:58:11.150 --> 04:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
macaroni salad in their bathtub and
 
04:58:14.750 --> 04:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
selling it so I mean you know yeah it's
 
04:58:16.190 --> 04:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
nasty that's
 
04:58:19.190 --> 04:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
nasty so I mean you
 
04:58:22.788 --> 04:58:22.798 align:start position:0%
know as long as you label it yeah so I I
 
04:58:25.830 --> 04:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
mean I get I get the two sides here and
 
04:58:28.390 --> 04:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
we've gotta I think we need to find some
 
04:58:32.390 --> 04:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
kind of balance between being able to
 
04:58:36.830 --> 04:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
open up the markets for our producers
 
04:58:39.708 --> 04:58:39.718 align:start position:0%
who are just trying to find ways in
 
04:58:42.510 --> 04:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
which to generate more income and
 
04:58:44.230 --> 04:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
satisfy their
 
04:58:44.240 --> 04:58:45.948 align:start position:0%
satisfy their
customers

04:58:45.948 --> 04:58:45.958 align:start position:0%
customers
 
04:58:47.868 --> 04:58:47.878 align:start position:0%
versus people who don't know what
 
04:58:51.030 --> 04:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
they're doing and
 
04:58:56.390 --> 04:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
um I I would just like to to to find a
 
04:58:59.708 --> 04:58:59.718 align:start position:0%
some some happy medium between
 
04:59:02.510 --> 04:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
everything and I would be more than
 
04:59:04.788 --> 04:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
willing to to do some sort of inter
 
04:59:08.750 --> 04:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
study for it or see if we can't maybe
 
04:59:10.590 --> 04:59:10.600 align:start position:0%
even do some kind of amendment to the
 
04:59:14.750 --> 04:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
bill to move it forward representative
 
04:59:17.548 --> 04:59:17.558 align:start position:0%
Penza so I come from a family that had a
 
04:59:21.030 --> 04:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
restaurant uh since 1969 my father and
 
04:59:23.190 --> 04:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
my brother took that over and uh he's
 
04:59:26.670 --> 04:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
got five and we dabbled in that my
 
04:59:29.670 --> 04:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
myself and my husband for 5 years so I'm
 
04:59:32.350 --> 04:59:32.360 align:start position:0%
Serve Safe certified I kept up with that
 
04:59:35.510 --> 04:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
my husband is um it's a very extensive
 
04:59:37.628 --> 04:59:37.638 align:start position:0%
course and I think that that is the
 
04:59:40.350 --> 04:59:40.360 align:start position:0%
amendment that could help this bill and
 
04:59:44.310 --> 04:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
besides that I I'm not really sure like
 
04:59:47.548 --> 04:59:47.558 align:start position:0%
there are tons of people that I know so
 
04:59:50.590 --> 04:59:50.600 align:start position:0%
for example he's a caterer he works out
 
04:59:52.270 --> 04:59:52.280 align:start position:0%
of his home but he has like this small
 
04:59:55.230 --> 04:59:55.240 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen and you can order
 
04:59:57.628 --> 04:59:57.638 align:start position:0%
meals for a week from him and they're
 
04:59:59.910 --> 04:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
all hot meals and stuff like that of
 
05:00:02.310 --> 05:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
course he's serf safe certified he'll do
 
05:00:04.670 --> 05:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
you know he does catering as well as
 
05:00:07.030 --> 05:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
just you know meals for people that they
 
05:00:08.868 --> 05:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
that can order you know busy families
 
05:00:11.548 --> 05:00:11.558 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that so this is already
 
05:00:13.750 --> 05:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
happening and he falls underneath a
 
05:00:16.230 --> 05:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
purview but someone else doesn't
 
05:00:17.788 --> 05:00:17.798 align:start position:0%
necessarily which they would be kind of
 
05:00:20.510 --> 05:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing so I think that
 
05:00:22.910 --> 05:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
this is an easy fix I'm very much in
 
05:00:27.830 --> 05:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
support uh of these bills and and also
 
05:00:29.868 --> 05:00:29.878 align:start position:0%
the the problems that happen with food
 
05:00:33.150 --> 05:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
safety 99% of the time in the state if
 
05:00:35.310 --> 05:00:35.320 align:start position:0%
you look at the numbers the numbers are
 
05:00:37.230 --> 05:00:37.240 align:start position:0%
happening in restaurants this is not
 
05:00:38.830 --> 05:00:38.840 align:start position:0%
something that's happening in someone's
 
05:00:43.990 --> 05:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
little little kitchen so um yeah I just
 
05:00:45.510 --> 05:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
been in the restaurant business I've
 
05:00:47.910 --> 05:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
lived it my whole life uh NATO's Subs
 
05:00:49.948 --> 05:00:49.958 align:start position:0%
that's my name name if anybody's
 
05:00:53.350 --> 05:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
familiar yeah I'm Kelly NATO so yeah so
 
05:00:55.230 --> 05:00:55.240 align:start position:0%
I know the space really well and I think
 
05:00:58.110 --> 05:00:58.120 align:start position:0%
that um I I think we can strike a
 
05:00:59.708 --> 05:00:59.718 align:start position:0%
balance and I don't want to kick the can
 
05:01:00.590 --> 05:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
down the
 
05:01:04.430 --> 05:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
road okay and so I know in either Bill
 
05:01:06.510 --> 05:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
we would certainly have to put in any
 
05:01:09.788 --> 05:01:09.798 align:start position:0%
kind of amendment to include the um
 
05:01:12.750 --> 05:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue so that you know
 
05:01:14.310 --> 05:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
put that language in so that they're not
 
05:01:17.110 --> 05:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
left out of the food and meals room and
 
05:01:20.470 --> 05:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
meals tax um so that's one one amendment
 
05:01:22.070 --> 05:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
that would have to be made along with
 
05:01:25.750 --> 05:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
that but um the other thing is I know uh
 
05:01:27.948 --> 05:01:27.958 align:start position:0%
our committee researcher did some work
 
05:01:31.270 --> 05:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
for us and sent out a memo to all of us
 
05:01:34.230 --> 05:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
which cited um how many food born
 
05:01:36.150 --> 05:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
illnesses were reported in I guess the
 
05:01:38.708 --> 05:01:38.718 align:start position:0%
past five years and I think that's makes
 
05:01:41.270 --> 05:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
some interesting reading uh just so that
 
05:01:44.628 --> 05:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
we're aware of what the incidents are
 
05:01:46.948 --> 05:01:46.958 align:start position:0%
currently representative
 
05:01:51.150 --> 05:01:51.160 align:start position:0%
moris thank you um I think that we need
 
05:01:53.390 --> 05:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
to remember that our job here first of
 
05:01:55.510 --> 05:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
all should be the health and well-being
 
05:01:58.910 --> 05:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
of our constituents um so making sure
 
05:02:01.190 --> 05:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
that we are not trying to pass anything
 
05:02:04.750 --> 05:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
that could risk some health I think is
 
05:02:09.948 --> 05:02:09.958 align:start position:0%
critical um I I think that looking at um
 
05:02:11.270 --> 05:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
studying this a little bit more seeing
 
05:02:13.628 --> 05:02:13.638 align:start position:0%
how we can amend it to move forward is a
 
05:02:15.830 --> 05:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
good idea I have concerns about when
 
05:02:18.030 --> 05:02:18.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about um restaurants
 
05:02:19.030 --> 05:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
having the
 
05:02:21.868 --> 05:02:21.878 align:start position:0%
highest uh risk of contamination
 
05:02:24.868 --> 05:02:24.878 align:start position:0%
obviously that is mostly because of the
 
05:02:27.070 --> 05:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
volume that they are putting out so when
 
05:02:28.590 --> 05:02:28.600 align:start position:0%
we start to have discussions about
 
05:02:30.670 --> 05:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
opening up for more volume in these
 
05:02:33.150 --> 05:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
small home kitchens are we going to
 
05:02:35.390 --> 05:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
start to see numbers of contamination
 
05:02:37.430 --> 05:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
and sickness going up in those as well
 
05:02:39.590 --> 05:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
because we are expanding the volume
 
05:02:41.350 --> 05:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
there so I just think that it's
 
05:02:43.590 --> 05:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
something that we need to be cautious
 
05:02:47.430 --> 05:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
about and well I support you know small
 
05:02:50.628 --> 05:02:50.638 align:start position:0%
businesses and and um homeowners trying
 
05:02:52.190 --> 05:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
to to make a little extra money when we
 
05:02:54.590 --> 05:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
start talking about you know chicken pot
 
05:02:57.948 --> 05:02:57.958 align:start position:0%
pie that can spoil so easily and uh
 
05:02:59.788 --> 05:02:59.798 align:start position:0%
custard pies that have eggs in them if
 
05:03:01.470 --> 05:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
they're not refrigerated properly and
 
05:03:03.470 --> 05:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
those are the things that while it might
 
05:03:05.788 --> 05:03:05.798 align:start position:0%
seem silly that you can sell one type of
 
05:03:09.150 --> 05:03:09.160 align:start position:0%
pie and not another um it's really not
 
05:03:11.070 --> 05:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
there there are reasons for those things
 
05:03:13.990 --> 05:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
so I just think that
 
05:03:17.470 --> 05:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
um we should be careful with bills like
 
05:03:20.430 --> 05:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
this and loosening regulations around
 
05:03:22.390 --> 05:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
health and food safety would you think
 
05:03:24.310 --> 05:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
though that the folks who would be
 
05:03:26.990 --> 05:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
producing these you know chicken P pie
 
05:03:30.230 --> 05:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
or custard pies if they took if they
 
05:03:33.230 --> 05:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
were required to take um
 
05:03:35.510 --> 05:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
Safe Serve course that they would be
 
05:03:38.110 --> 05:03:38.120 align:start position:0%
more cognizant of how they're handling
 
05:03:40.070 --> 05:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
their food and
 
05:03:43.070 --> 05:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
therefore in essence be more safe as a
 
05:03:45.628 --> 05:03:45.638 align:start position:0%
result I think very likely but I think
 
05:03:46.868 --> 05:03:46.878 align:start position:0%
that we also have to take into
 
05:03:49.510 --> 05:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
consideration that if they are in just a
 
05:03:53.510 --> 05:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
home kitchen if their um freezer or
 
05:03:55.510 --> 05:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
refrigerator is not cold enough if their
 
05:03:58.030 --> 05:03:58.040 align:start position:0%
dishwasher is not hot enough to sanitize
 
05:03:59.788 --> 05:03:59.798 align:start position:0%
there there are so many things that if
 
05:04:01.470 --> 05:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
you're just taking a course but you're
 
05:04:03.190 --> 05:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
not you know in a certif kitchen and all
 
05:04:07.750 --> 05:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
of those things that we should just be
 
05:04:11.270 --> 05:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
considering and yet I mean we do have
 
05:04:13.310 --> 05:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
Community soup kitchens and Community
 
05:04:17.430 --> 05:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
potluck dinners and all that that are
 
05:04:20.788 --> 05:04:20.798 align:start position:0%
also you know not necessarily following
 
05:04:22.948 --> 05:04:22.958 align:start position:0%
best practices that's true but also a
 
05:04:25.590 --> 05:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
lot of those places are insured you know
 
05:04:28.310 --> 05:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
for safety and that sort of concern
 
05:04:28.320 --> 05:04:29.750 align:start position:0%
for safety and that sort of concern
representative

05:04:29.750 --> 05:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:04:32.548 --> 05:04:32.558 align:start position:0%
Duty um thank you for seg weighing into
 
05:04:33.990 --> 05:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
to my question
 
05:04:36.110 --> 05:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative uh that was my question
 
05:04:39.868 --> 05:04:39.878 align:start position:0%
is uh liability insurance so you know I
 
05:04:42.110 --> 05:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
go to the farm standand and I buy a pot
 
05:04:44.788 --> 05:04:44.798 align:start position:0%
pie and I die of s
 
05:04:48.548 --> 05:04:48.558 align:start position:0%
salmonella okay uh so what kind of
 
05:04:50.910 --> 05:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
liability insurance are we going to
 
05:04:54.430 --> 05:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
require of these um you know uh
 
05:04:56.868 --> 05:04:56.878 align:start position:0%
Homestead kitchens because I don't
 
05:04:58.590 --> 05:04:58.600 align:start position:0%
remember seeing any of that in the Bill
 
05:05:01.230 --> 05:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
maybe it's an existing law but you know
 
05:05:04.110 --> 05:05:04.120 align:start position:0%
so I I would need to know
 
05:05:06.548 --> 05:05:06.558 align:start position:0%
that well I'm not sure you know we're
 
05:05:09.948 --> 05:05:09.958 align:start position:0%
looking at requiring people to hold
 
05:05:11.910 --> 05:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
liability insurance but certainly if
 
05:05:14.868 --> 05:05:14.878 align:start position:0%
they're labeling their product saying
 
05:05:17.750 --> 05:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
that um you know it's an unlicensed
 
05:05:21.948 --> 05:05:21.958 align:start position:0%
kitchen or whatever the verbiage is that
 
05:05:25.190 --> 05:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
the consumer is aware of whatever risk
 
05:05:25.200 --> 05:05:25.948 align:start position:0%
the consumer is aware of whatever risk
they're

05:05:25.948 --> 05:05:25.958 align:start position:0%
they're
 
05:05:28.030 --> 05:05:28.040 align:start position:0%
taking it's the same I don't think
 
05:05:30.310 --> 05:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
that's the way the law I still think you
 
05:05:32.990 --> 05:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
would be able to to Sue I mean because
 
05:05:36.310 --> 05:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
nobody nobody buys a chicken pot pie
 
05:05:38.430 --> 05:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
hoping to die of salmonella and I don't
 
05:05:40.628 --> 05:05:40.638 align:start position:0%
think they label it like I mean you know
 
05:05:43.270 --> 05:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
those things happen and all I'm saying
 
05:05:45.788 --> 05:05:45.798 align:start position:0%
you know is you know like a lot of
 
05:05:47.830 --> 05:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
people have mentioned here this is a
 
05:05:47.840 --> 05:05:48.750 align:start position:0%
people have mentioned here this is a
huge

05:05:48.750 --> 05:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
huge
 
05:05:51.150 --> 05:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility and people need to
 
05:05:53.470 --> 05:05:53.480 align:start position:0%
understand that this is a huge
 
05:05:57.510 --> 05:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility and and so they so they
 
05:06:00.868 --> 05:06:00.878 align:start position:0%
need to be educated they need to have
 
05:06:03.708 --> 05:06:03.718 align:start position:0%
liability insurance because that's not
 
05:06:06.030 --> 05:06:06.040 align:start position:0%
just for them it's for their customers
 
05:06:09.030 --> 05:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
also if something happens and and I
 
05:06:11.910 --> 05:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
think we treat this whole subject as you
 
05:06:13.990 --> 05:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
know Holly Homemaker who wants to bake
 
05:06:16.350 --> 05:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
some cookies and you know make an extra
 
05:06:20.150 --> 05:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
$100 a week and this is serious business
 
05:06:21.830 --> 05:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
and I think that there should be
 
05:06:24.190 --> 05:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
something in the bill if there isn't
 
05:06:27.270 --> 05:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
already in law that you know indicates
 
05:06:29.110 --> 05:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
that they need to be Co covered by
 
05:06:31.628 --> 05:06:31.638 align:start position:0%
liability insurance because this is very
 
05:06:31.638 --> 05:06:33.150 align:start position:0%
liability insurance because this is very
serious

05:06:33.150 --> 05:06:33.160 align:start position:0%
serious
 
05:06:33.160 --> 05:06:34.350 align:start position:0%
serious
representative

05:06:34.350 --> 05:06:34.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:06:37.150 --> 05:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
Howard um I I I would be willing to work
 
05:06:39.788 --> 05:06:39.798 align:start position:0%
on an amendment that would include um
 
05:06:42.628 --> 05:06:42.638 align:start position:0%
the safe service um and I'd like to work
 
05:06:45.708 --> 05:06:45.718 align:start position:0%
with DHHS on that um because they had a
 
05:06:47.948 --> 05:06:47.958 align:start position:0%
lot to say about about inspection and
 
05:06:49.590 --> 05:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
stuff like that so I I would want to
 
05:06:52.110 --> 05:06:52.120 align:start position:0%
talk to them about what amendment would
 
05:06:53.910 --> 05:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
work for them and I think that I think
 
05:06:58.270 --> 05:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
the safe service um uh safe food service
 
05:07:01.030 --> 05:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh certification would actually be sign
 
05:07:04.788 --> 05:07:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:08.750 --> 05:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby yeah um I I don't think
 
05:07:12.390 --> 05:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
that having Ju Just um putting in the
 
05:07:14.350 --> 05:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
the Serve Safe program would be
 
05:07:17.430 --> 05:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
sufficient I think that it is necessary
 
05:07:21.030 --> 05:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
but I think that uh the issues that uh
 
05:07:22.910 --> 05:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative Duty brought up in terms
 
05:07:25.350 --> 05:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
of liability and how that's dealt with
 
05:07:28.030 --> 05:07:28.040 align:start position:0%
are important uh I believe that most
 
05:07:30.470 --> 05:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
farmers markets require their vendors to
 
05:07:36.150 --> 05:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
have uh liability Insurance uh and uh
 
05:07:39.310 --> 05:07:39.320 align:start position:0%
there are also a number of uh there are
 
05:07:41.590 --> 05:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
a number of different categories of food
 
05:07:45.548 --> 05:07:45.558 align:start position:0%
that uh are hazardous in one degree or
 
05:07:49.470 --> 05:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
another so I would be comfortable with
 
05:07:52.030 --> 05:07:52.040 align:start position:0%
uh Ser with people being able to serve
 
05:07:54.628 --> 05:07:54.638 align:start position:0%
once they had done the Serve Safe
 
05:07:58.628 --> 05:07:58.638 align:start position:0%
program uh chicken pot pies or um
 
05:08:01.910 --> 05:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
pumpkin pies uh or a whole range of
 
05:08:04.750 --> 05:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
other sort of pre-made meals as long as
 
05:08:08.910 --> 05:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
they know how to keep them safe until uh
 
05:08:13.150 --> 05:08:13.160 align:start position:0%
they are they go out the door um but I
 
05:08:16.750 --> 05:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
would not be comfortable with uh can
 
05:08:18.990 --> 05:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
with people selling canned low acid
 
05:08:23.070 --> 05:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
foods because uh if you typically with
 
05:08:25.990 --> 05:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
the you know the if you eat a uh if you
 
05:08:31.310 --> 05:08:31.320 align:start position:0%
get a bad meal that is um made that
 
05:08:33.310 --> 05:08:33.320 align:start position:0%
typically a bad chicken pot pie will
 
05:08:36.990 --> 05:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
make you uncomfortably sick for a few
 
05:08:40.150 --> 05:08:40.160 align:start position:0%
days typically a case of botulism will
 
05:08:43.430 --> 05:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
kill you and there there needs to be a
 
05:08:46.470 --> 05:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
distinction there uh and so I'm not I
 
05:08:48.868 --> 05:08:48.878 align:start position:0%
don't I think there are enough different
 
05:08:50.390 --> 05:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
aspects of this that need to be looked
 
05:08:52.390 --> 05:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
at carefully that we can't put something
 
05:08:54.150 --> 05:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
together in the next week and pass it I
 
05:08:56.948 --> 05:08:56.958 align:start position:0%
think that we need to do either a study
 
05:09:00.350 --> 05:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
committee or or an interim study I think
 
05:09:02.230 --> 05:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
I would probably prefer the interim
 
05:09:04.430 --> 05:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
study because we could make sure it
 
05:09:06.190 --> 05:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
happens and we'd control that within our
 
05:09:08.310 --> 05:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
committee as opposed to hoping the
 
05:09:10.910 --> 05:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
Senate will then pass it on and then
 
05:09:12.708 --> 05:09:12.718 align:start position:0%
hoping that some of us get appointed to
 
05:09:15.830 --> 05:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
the committee uh so but I I could not
 
05:09:18.310 --> 05:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
support passing it uh with an amendment
 
05:09:20.670 --> 05:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
in the next week uh I could definitely
 
05:09:22.868 --> 05:09:22.878 align:start position:0%
support and would be happy to work on an
 
05:09:28.070 --> 05:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
interm study representative um Mary I'm
 
05:09:30.150 --> 05:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
sorry uh thank you madam chair I think
 
05:09:32.510 --> 05:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
to uh representative bixby's point I'm
 
05:09:35.190 --> 05:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking back to um mushroom
 
05:09:37.150 --> 05:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
harvesting and and mushroom foraging
 
05:09:38.830 --> 05:09:38.840 align:start position:0%
which I did work with the Department on
 
05:09:43.070 --> 05:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
several years back um and I I I do
 
05:09:44.628 --> 05:09:44.638 align:start position:0%
concur that I think inter room study
 
05:09:46.510 --> 05:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
would be the best path forward to
 
05:09:48.788 --> 05:09:48.798 align:start position:0%
looking at this to make sure that we
 
05:09:52.350 --> 05:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
have um all of those sort of safety uh
 
05:09:53.510 --> 05:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
when we're not we're not just talking
 
05:09:56.350 --> 05:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
about Hass hup or Serve Safe we're also
 
05:09:58.548 --> 05:09:58.558 align:start position:0%
talking about records and being able to
 
05:10:01.230 --> 05:10:01.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that those are there um for
 
05:10:03.868 --> 05:10:03.878 align:start position:0%
the future when we know who who has or
 
05:10:05.788 --> 05:10:05.798 align:start position:0%
if they're doing a self attestation and
 
05:10:07.910 --> 05:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
have completed it where that information
 
05:10:10.070 --> 05:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
is being kept so I I would agree with
 
05:10:12.470 --> 05:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
that this is this is something that not
 
05:10:14.430 --> 05:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
just a very like quick Amendment could
 
05:10:14.440 --> 05:10:15.590 align:start position:0%
just a very like quick Amendment could
be

05:10:15.590 --> 05:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:10:18.628 --> 05:10:18.638 align:start position:0%
drafted represent poens you look like
 
05:10:19.560 --> 05:10:19.570 align:start position:0%
you're gonna say
 
05:10:19.570 --> 05:10:21.390 align:start position:0%
you're gonna say
[Laughter]

05:10:21.390 --> 05:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:10:24.628 --> 05:10:24.638 align:start position:0%
something let me think about that um so
 
05:10:27.548 --> 05:10:27.558 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to speak to um I'm not
 
05:10:29.750 --> 05:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
sure who said it over there uh maybe it
 
05:10:32.070 --> 05:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
was Duty um representative Duty in
 
05:10:35.030 --> 05:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
regards with um liability insurance I
 
05:10:38.390 --> 05:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
strongly disagree um I think that we are
 
05:10:41.470 --> 05:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
in a space where um Everybody sues for
 
05:10:45.150 --> 05:10:45.160 align:start position:0%
everything so um if you know we go
 
05:10:47.150 --> 05:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
around this table right now and ask how
 
05:10:49.110 --> 05:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
many people have been have had food
 
05:10:50.830 --> 05:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
poisoning I'm going to be able to raise
 
05:10:54.310 --> 05:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
my hand four times did I ever Sue any of
 
05:10:55.830 --> 05:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
those restaurants where I got food
 
05:10:58.070 --> 05:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
poisoning from so I think we just have
 
05:11:02.390 --> 05:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
to I think I understand uh I understand
 
05:11:05.868 --> 05:11:05.878 align:start position:0%
balancing safety with also um
 
05:11:09.430 --> 05:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
encouraging this private business um I
 
05:11:10.948 --> 05:11:10.958 align:start position:0%
also don't think that we're going to
 
05:11:12.548 --> 05:11:12.558 align:start position:0%
have people that are going to be
 
05:11:15.030 --> 05:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
utilizing this making the macaroni out
 
05:11:17.190 --> 05:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
of their bathtub and by the way nobody
 
05:11:19.910 --> 05:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
should eat hot dogs ever again I just
 
05:11:23.430 --> 05:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that on the record but um
 
05:11:26.070 --> 05:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
so I just I I think that we have to be
 
05:11:28.070 --> 05:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
careful I you know if everybody feels
 
05:11:31.150 --> 05:11:31.160 align:start position:0%
that studies the way um you know I I
 
05:11:32.788 --> 05:11:32.798 align:start position:0%
would love to be able to do an amendment
 
05:11:35.310 --> 05:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
for this and get this pushed through but
 
05:11:37.590 --> 05:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
um yeah but I don't believe that we have
 
05:11:39.788 --> 05:11:39.798 align:start position:0%
to go down a path of liability insurance
 
05:11:42.190 --> 05:11:42.200 align:start position:0%
and all that other stuff unless the
 
05:11:44.750 --> 05:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
business Falls within those criteria
 
05:11:46.948 --> 05:11:46.958 align:start position:0%
we're also looking at that goes by size
 
05:11:50.230 --> 05:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
and volume and and things like that so
 
05:11:53.990 --> 05:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative comto thank you madam
 
05:11:56.750 --> 05:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
chair we have been talking about things
 
05:11:59.110 --> 05:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
like this for years and we keep kicking
 
05:12:02.670 --> 05:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
the can down the road far have to get
 
05:12:06.310 --> 05:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:08.910 --> 05:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
they how do I say
 
05:12:12.470 --> 05:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
this sell their product donate their
 
05:12:17.548 --> 05:12:17.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:20.708 --> 05:12:20.718 align:start position:0%
Etc we are
 
05:12:23.030 --> 05:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
constantly trying
 
05:12:23.040 --> 05:12:25.030 align:start position:0%
constantly trying
to

05:12:25.030 --> 05:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:12:28.948 --> 05:12:28.958 align:start position:0%
um we have I understand the food safety
 
05:12:31.868 --> 05:12:31.878 align:start position:0%
portion and the public health but yet
 
05:12:33.310 --> 05:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
that we
 
05:12:36.390 --> 05:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
allow I believe and I can be
 
05:12:41.230 --> 05:12:41.240 align:start position:0%
corrected um but I believe that a
 
05:12:45.310 --> 05:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
entity without a commercial license can
 
05:12:50.510 --> 05:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
have two to four dinners or
 
05:12:55.230 --> 05:12:55.240 align:start position:0%
breakfasts and serve several people at a
 
05:12:58.310 --> 05:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
time with no license and no
 
05:13:01.030 --> 05:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
oversight I believe that's current law
 
05:13:02.270 --> 05:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
05:13:03.910 --> 05:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
it is thank
 
05:13:07.548 --> 05:13:07.558 align:start position:0%
you we don't have
 
05:13:09.910 --> 05:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
oversight and
 
05:13:15.150 --> 05:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:18.868 --> 05:13:18.878 align:start position:0%
locks and when you go to somebody to buy
 
05:13:21.868 --> 05:13:21.878 align:start position:0%
a product directly from the consumer you
 
05:13:23.868 --> 05:13:23.878 align:start position:0%
are assessing everything about that
 
05:13:26.390 --> 05:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
person you're assessing what they look
 
05:13:30.390 --> 05:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
like if their home is clean
 
05:13:33.948 --> 05:13:33.958 align:start position:0%
everything and I can tell you from an
 
05:13:33.958 --> 05:13:36.628 align:start position:0%
everything and I can tell you from an
agricultural

05:13:36.628 --> 05:13:36.638 align:start position:0%
agricultural
 
05:13:40.190 --> 05:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
standpoint that no farmer would ever
 
05:13:43.190 --> 05:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
jeopardize your livelihood by producing
 
05:13:46.190 --> 05:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
something that would harm somebody else
 
05:13:49.150 --> 05:13:49.160 align:start position:0%
because word travels immediately in this
 
05:13:52.070 --> 05:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
state and the same thing would go for
 
05:13:55.310 --> 05:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
the homestead
 
05:13:55.320 --> 05:13:56.910 align:start position:0%
the homestead
cooking

05:13:56.910 --> 05:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
cooking
 
05:13:59.628 --> 05:13:59.638 align:start position:0%
and people are
 
05:14:02.670 --> 05:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
struggling people are looking for means
 
05:14:06.430 --> 05:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
to make ends meet and sometimes
 
05:14:11.230 --> 05:14:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:17.788 --> 05:14:17.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:21.110 --> 05:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
certification but I am thinking that we
 
05:14:23.470 --> 05:14:23.480 align:start position:0%
need to pass something and if it needs
 
05:14:25.350 --> 05:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
to go to the Senate to be amended I
 
05:14:27.190 --> 05:14:27.200 align:start position:0%
think that's where it needs to
 
05:14:32.150 --> 05:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
go but people have the right to buy food
 
05:14:34.948 --> 05:14:34.958 align:start position:0%
from where they want we just sat here
 
05:14:37.390 --> 05:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
and talked about how we don't want to
 
05:14:40.470 --> 05:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
force people to label our food because
 
05:14:42.470 --> 05:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
it belongs at the federal level but then
 
05:14:44.230 --> 05:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
we're telling consumers you can't buy
 
05:14:45.868 --> 05:14:45.878 align:start position:0%
food from where you want
 
05:14:51.670 --> 05:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:58.910 --> 05:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:03.190 --> 05:15:03.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment okay might drop
 
05:15:05.470 --> 05:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
representative Howard you have you have
 
05:15:08.628 --> 05:15:08.638 align:start position:0%
a comment I I just wanted to remind
 
05:15:10.868 --> 05:15:10.878 align:start position:0%
everyone that uh representative kulan
 
05:15:14.628 --> 05:15:14.638 align:start position:0%
also wanted this to be part of um the
 
05:15:17.230 --> 05:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire offering the New Hampshire
 
05:15:19.350 --> 05:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
image it's you know he wants it to be
 
05:15:20.948 --> 05:15:20.958 align:start position:0%
out there wants the
 
05:15:24.350 --> 05:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
agricultural food and offerings to be
 
05:15:24.360 --> 05:15:26.230 align:start position:0%
agricultural food and offerings to be
more

05:15:26.230 --> 05:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:15:28.548 --> 05:15:28.558 align:start position:0%
prominent representative
 
05:15:30.350 --> 05:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
Morris thank
 
05:15:32.628 --> 05:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
you um
 
05:15:34.430 --> 05:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
so one of the problems that I have with
 
05:15:36.708 --> 05:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
that argument representative Kat is that
 
05:15:38.708 --> 05:15:38.718 align:start position:0%
you're very selective on which Farmers
 
05:15:41.910 --> 05:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
you support so when we have a room full
 
05:15:44.310 --> 05:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
of organic farmers in here begging for
 
05:15:44.320 --> 05:15:45.030 align:start position:0%
of organic farmers in here begging for
their

05:15:45.030 --> 05:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:15:45.040 --> 05:15:46.670 align:start position:0%
their
future

05:15:46.670 --> 05:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
future
 
05:15:49.830 --> 05:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
um you're not overly supportive of those
 
05:15:53.070 --> 05:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
people but then you want to shove
 
05:15:55.310 --> 05:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
through a bill that could potentially
 
05:15:57.390 --> 05:15:57.400 align:start position:0%
endanger a lot of
 
05:16:01.670 --> 05:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
people so I'm just wondering why we
 
05:16:04.548 --> 05:16:04.558 align:start position:0%
continue to hear this sort of hypocrisy
 
05:16:07.030 --> 05:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
of we have I would like not not like to
 
05:16:09.830 --> 05:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
use that kind of language and not to
 
05:16:13.030 --> 05:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
make attacks on each other okay let's
 
05:16:16.070 --> 05:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
see if we can work through this issue
 
05:16:19.590 --> 05:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
without using such um verbiage please
 
05:16:21.830 --> 05:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay I I'm just curious then why we
 
05:16:23.670 --> 05:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
would be so supportive of pushing
 
05:16:26.830 --> 05:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
through a bill quickly quickly amended
 
05:16:29.470 --> 05:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
that could potentially harm our
 
05:16:32.948 --> 05:16:32.958 align:start position:0%
constituents um when we don't seem to
 
05:16:36.070 --> 05:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
give that same level of thought to
 
05:16:38.350 --> 05:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
promoting other
 
05:16:38.360 --> 05:16:40.030 align:start position:0%
promoting other
Farmers

05:16:40.030 --> 05:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
Farmers
 
05:16:43.470 --> 05:16:43.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam
 
05:16:46.430 --> 05:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
chair I support all
 
05:16:49.990 --> 05:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
Farmers certified organic
 
05:16:54.110 --> 05:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
organic practicing organic permaculture
 
05:16:57.788 --> 05:16:57.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:00.390 --> 05:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
them there are other
 
05:17:03.990 --> 05:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
means by sitting here and saying because
 
05:17:08.990 --> 05:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
66 Farms May will have over 14 months to
 
05:17:11.350 --> 05:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
find another Avenue to be certified does
 
05:17:14.030 --> 05:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
not mean I don't support them because I
 
05:17:18.070 --> 05:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
think that everybody in agriculture as
 
05:17:21.990 --> 05:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
long as they're helping their soil and
 
05:17:23.590 --> 05:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
making it
 
05:17:27.190 --> 05:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
better is promoting good good management
 
05:17:29.830 --> 05:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
practices for the State of New Hampshire
 
05:17:34.510 --> 05:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
it is not one farmer versus another
 
05:17:38.590 --> 05:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
we've gone to NOA I go to NOA
 
05:17:41.270 --> 05:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
events I support
 
05:17:43.590 --> 05:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
them and you can sit there and shake
 
05:17:46.230 --> 05:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
your head no at me all day long but I
 
05:17:48.510 --> 05:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
support agriculture 100% in the state of
 
05:17:49.990 --> 05:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire no matter what type of
 
05:17:51.830 --> 05:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
farming you're doing all right let's
 
05:17:54.670 --> 05:17:54.680 align:start position:0%
bring this back to the actual bill and
 
05:17:59.510 --> 05:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
and the um the things that were the the
 
05:18:02.548 --> 05:18:02.558 align:start position:0%
items in the bill that are uh of
 
05:18:04.590 --> 05:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
question and
 
05:18:07.990 --> 05:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh I think I saw some other hands up
 
05:18:08.000 --> 05:18:09.310 align:start position:0%
uh I think I saw some other hands up
representative

05:18:09.310 --> 05:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:18:12.350 --> 05:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
Duty uh yes thank you madam chair you
 
05:18:15.350 --> 05:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
know we throw away
 
05:18:20.190 --> 05:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
330 billion tons of food every year that
 
05:18:23.708 --> 05:18:23.718 align:start position:0%
was the last number that I heard so it's
 
05:18:28.030 --> 05:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
not you know like the the
 
05:18:33.110 --> 05:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
consumers of you know um the these Foods
 
05:18:35.948 --> 05:18:35.958 align:start position:0%
uh can't find food someplace else and I
 
05:18:39.350 --> 05:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
mean this is clearly not a program that
 
05:18:42.628 --> 05:18:42.638 align:start position:0%
is set up to feed those who do not have
 
05:18:46.948 --> 05:18:46.958 align:start position:0%
access to food um the beneficiaries of
 
05:18:50.310 --> 05:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
this bill are clearly The
 
05:18:54.430 --> 05:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
Producers okay and I think we have to um
 
05:18:57.030 --> 05:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
to keep that in mind and to use the
 
05:19:00.948 --> 05:19:00.958 align:start position:0%
argument to promote this bill and and I
 
05:19:03.788 --> 05:19:03.798 align:start position:0%
do not feel that it is ready for for
 
05:19:08.270 --> 05:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
prime time at all but to say that consu
 
05:19:11.110 --> 05:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
that that consumers are being denied the
 
05:19:15.628 --> 05:19:15.638 align:start position:0%
right to uh to buy what they want just
 
05:19:18.150 --> 05:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be a little
 
05:19:20.270 --> 05:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
disingenuous um because to be honest
 
05:19:23.030 --> 05:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
with you I mean may maybe you see it I
 
05:19:25.948 --> 05:19:25.958 align:start position:0%
do not I have not had one constituent
 
05:19:29.788 --> 05:19:29.798 align:start position:0%
call me and say gee I wish I could buy
 
05:19:33.430 --> 05:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah and I can't okay so let's
 
05:19:36.670 --> 05:19:36.680 align:start position:0%
be honest here this is about the people
 
05:19:38.708 --> 05:19:38.718 align:start position:0%
who are going to create a business it's
 
05:19:40.708 --> 05:19:40.718 align:start position:0%
not about the consumers that's my
 
05:19:42.788 --> 05:19:42.798 align:start position:0%
opinion and I and I don't think that
 
05:19:45.190 --> 05:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
this is a safe
 
05:19:48.830 --> 05:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
Bill representative Bixby um I would
 
05:19:50.990 --> 05:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
respectably have to disagree that this
 
05:19:53.590 --> 05:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
is just about the producers I think that
 
05:19:56.430 --> 05:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
it is actually about a community of
 
05:20:00.310 --> 05:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
people who want to have food that is
 
05:20:03.390 --> 05:20:03.400 align:start position:0%
produced by people they know and I think
 
05:20:09.150 --> 05:20:09.160 align:start position:0%
that uh and uh or people who may be you
 
05:20:11.510 --> 05:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
know maybe one a couple of degrees of
 
05:20:14.948 --> 05:20:14.958 align:start position:0%
separation but but within a but
 
05:20:18.868 --> 05:20:18.878 align:start position:0%
essentially it's about wanting to have a
 
05:20:18.878 --> 05:20:20.430 align:start position:0%
essentially it's about wanting to have a
locally

05:20:20.430 --> 05:20:20.440 align:start position:0%
locally
 
05:20:25.350 --> 05:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
based uh food community and uh that
 
05:20:27.548 --> 05:20:27.558 align:start position:0%
involves both the producers and the
 
05:20:30.590 --> 05:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
consumers and I don't think that this is
 
05:20:30.600 --> 05:20:31.948 align:start position:0%
consumers and I don't think that this is
about

05:20:31.948 --> 05:20:31.958 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:20:35.590 --> 05:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
um that that the problem with this bill
 
05:20:38.390 --> 05:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
is that is is the fundamental model I
 
05:20:40.708 --> 05:20:40.718 align:start position:0%
think that the problem is that there
 
05:20:42.830 --> 05:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
needs there need to be some things
 
05:20:45.150 --> 05:20:45.160 align:start position:0%
ironed out to make sure that people who
 
05:20:48.030 --> 05:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
are well- intended don't end up getting
 
05:20:52.430 --> 05:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
into trouble and I think that
 
05:20:54.830 --> 05:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh I think that there are some as
 
05:20:57.190 --> 05:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
aspects of the bill that are fairly
 
05:20:58.708 --> 05:20:58.718 align:start position:0%
obvious but I think there are others
 
05:21:00.190 --> 05:21:00.200 align:start position:0%
that I think we really need to work
 
05:21:03.350 --> 05:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
through more carefully with the people
 
05:21:05.190 --> 05:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
from the Department who know a lot about
 
05:21:09.750 --> 05:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
food safety and uh I think that this
 
05:21:12.070 --> 05:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
would be a really great Bill to have
 
05:21:15.110 --> 05:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
before us in a finished form next term
 
05:21:15.120 --> 05:21:16.910 align:start position:0%
before us in a finished form next term
representative

05:21:16.910 --> 05:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:21:21.110 --> 05:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
kraton uh thank you ma'am I I uh I want
 
05:21:24.110 --> 05:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
to reiterate what uh representative
 
05:21:26.030 --> 05:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
Bixby just said it it is about a
 
05:21:27.350 --> 05:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
community there's nothing in this bill
 
05:21:29.910 --> 05:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
says anything about Farms the word Farm
 
05:21:32.030 --> 05:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
is not in this bill
 
05:21:34.110 --> 05:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
but it does not distinguish between
 
05:21:37.430 --> 05:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
organic or regular or anything else so
 
05:21:39.990 --> 05:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
he is he is right this is not about
 
05:21:42.788 --> 05:21:42.798 align:start position:0%
Farms this is about a community of folks
 
05:21:46.190 --> 05:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
that want to make and sell and buy food
 
05:21:50.230 --> 05:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm fine with the with the uh Serve
 
05:21:52.750 --> 05:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
Safe as a an amendment and I would vote
 
05:21:55.390 --> 05:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
for that as an OTP but I'm also fine
 
05:21:59.310 --> 05:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
with a an is you know I'm okay with that
 
05:22:02.788 --> 05:22:02.798 align:start position:0%
to to strengthen it but um I I just read
 
05:22:03.910 --> 05:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
the bill it doesn't say anything about
 
05:22:05.910 --> 05:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
farms in here at all
 
05:22:09.070 --> 05:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
over representative NAB thank you madam
 
05:22:10.750 --> 05:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
chair um I just wanted to Second what
 
05:22:13.150 --> 05:22:13.160 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby and Murray and also
 
05:22:16.548 --> 05:22:16.558 align:start position:0%
a little bit Katon said um I I want to
 
05:22:17.948 --> 05:22:17.958 align:start position:0%
air on the side of the Department of
 
05:22:19.910 --> 05:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
agriculture's recommendations and I
 
05:22:21.990 --> 05:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
would also like there to be a pre-cooked
 
05:22:24.270 --> 05:22:24.280 align:start position:0%
meal waiting for me at home that I can
 
05:22:25.750 --> 05:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
pop in the oven when I get home from
 
05:22:27.910 --> 05:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
this so
 
05:22:30.788 --> 05:22:30.798 align:start position:0%
um so I you know I see the value in it
 
05:22:33.470 --> 05:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
and and I and I don't want to stand in
 
05:22:34.910 --> 05:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
the way of that but I we have to make
 
05:22:36.548 --> 05:22:36.558 align:start position:0%
this a safe process the reason we have
 
05:22:38.230 --> 05:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
regulations is to keep people safe once
 
05:22:40.230 --> 05:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
upon a time there were horrible problems
 
05:22:41.628 --> 05:22:41.638 align:start position:0%
around food safety and this is why we
 
05:22:43.070 --> 05:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
have regulations right so we have to be
 
05:22:45.470 --> 05:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
careful when we dial them back um so I
 
05:22:46.948 --> 05:22:46.958 align:start position:0%
am fully in support of the inter room
 
05:22:48.750 --> 05:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
study and thinking about ways to make
 
05:22:51.030 --> 05:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
this bill move forward and and enable
 
05:22:53.788 --> 05:22:53.798 align:start position:0%
homesteaders to do this work and also to
 
05:22:54.990 --> 05:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that we do it in the safest
 
05:22:58.030 --> 05:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
way possible thank you representative
 
05:23:02.190 --> 05:23:02.200 align:start position:0%
saitis thank you madam chair um I think
 
05:23:06.510 --> 05:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
that perhaps this bill came
 
05:23:12.350 --> 05:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
because um during the pandemic um we saw
 
05:23:17.948 --> 05:23:17.958 align:start position:0%
bluntly how um Supply chains could be
 
05:23:23.310 --> 05:23:23.320 align:start position:0%
destroyed and um we need to have food
 
05:23:28.788 --> 05:23:28.798 align:start position:0%
that comes from our area we have a rich
 
05:23:33.150 --> 05:23:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:38.830 --> 05:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
uh history in the state and um anything
 
05:23:41.628 --> 05:23:41.638 align:start position:0%
that can marry that to bring us more
 
05:23:44.548 --> 05:23:44.558 align:start position:0%
healthy food food from where we
 
05:23:50.948 --> 05:23:50.958 align:start position:0%
live um and I have to admit um my
 
05:23:54.270 --> 05:23:54.280 align:start position:0%
godmother who was Greek you know call
 
05:23:58.230 --> 05:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
her and say could you feed 750 people
 
05:24:00.470 --> 05:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
tomorrow for dinner and she would say
 
05:24:02.590 --> 05:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
yeah let me just take something out the
 
05:24:06.110 --> 05:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
freezer because there's a lot of people
 
05:24:10.750 --> 05:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
who are really good cooks and and
 
05:24:14.470 --> 05:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
um you know we're not giving them enough
 
05:24:14.480 --> 05:24:15.788 align:start position:0%
um you know we're not giving them enough
credit

05:24:15.788 --> 05:24:15.798 align:start position:0%
credit
 
05:24:18.350 --> 05:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
because there's going to be bad apples
 
05:24:20.628 --> 05:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
everywhere somebody's going to make a
 
05:24:23.230 --> 05:24:23.240 align:start position:0%
mistake mostly it'll be an honest
 
05:24:26.590 --> 05:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
mistake or whatever but hopefully we're
 
05:24:29.948 --> 05:24:29.958 align:start position:0%
um strong enough to overcome this we had
 
05:24:34.030 --> 05:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
a a long period when we were trying to
 
05:24:38.390 --> 05:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
decide if it was legal to um buy raw
 
05:24:41.670 --> 05:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
milk yeah and you would have thought
 
05:24:44.590 --> 05:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
that that uh we were asking to give up
 
05:24:47.910 --> 05:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
our firstborn child for Raam
 
05:24:51.910 --> 05:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
mil so we get funny about
 
05:24:56.110 --> 05:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
food until we don't have any and for
 
05:24:59.670 --> 05:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
these people who who are trying to make
 
05:25:05.670 --> 05:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
money or to to um save their
 
05:25:08.788 --> 05:25:08.798 align:start position:0%
property um I mean last
 
05:25:11.948 --> 05:25:11.958 align:start position:0%
year people got a huge property tax
 
05:25:15.868 --> 05:25:15.878 align:start position:0%
increase so maybe that these nanas are
 
05:25:20.788 --> 05:25:20.798 align:start position:0%
trying to um make up that money we won't
 
05:25:23.150 --> 05:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
know but I just think that we have to
 
05:25:26.230 --> 05:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
Foster and cherish every single food
 
05:25:28.070 --> 05:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
source that we
 
05:25:30.470 --> 05:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
have so I'd say it would you be with
 
05:25:30.480 --> 05:25:31.310 align:start position:0%
have so I'd say it would you be with
them

05:25:31.310 --> 05:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:25:35.590 --> 05:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank you representative ger
 
05:25:38.510 --> 05:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh I I think we
 
05:25:40.190 --> 05:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
should move to interim study that's
 
05:25:41.750 --> 05:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's what I would support I want to
 
05:25:43.270 --> 05:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
Echo a couple things representative
 
05:25:46.110 --> 05:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
Moore said first of all we have to have
 
05:25:48.708 --> 05:25:48.718 align:start position:0%
the balance I absolutely agree with with
 
05:25:50.230 --> 05:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill but we have to
 
05:25:52.830 --> 05:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
have a balance when we uh had
 
05:25:55.628 --> 05:25:55.638 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper here with us last
 
05:25:57.350 --> 05:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
session talking about there a couple of
 
05:25:59.708 --> 05:25:59.718 align:start position:0%
bills right that had to do with kind of
 
05:26:01.868 --> 05:26:01.878 align:start position:0%
changing regul regarding Apple
 
05:26:03.430 --> 05:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
inspections changing regulations
 
05:26:05.548 --> 05:26:05.558 align:start position:0%
regarding seed inspections and one of
 
05:26:07.990 --> 05:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
the things the commissioner said was
 
05:26:10.350 --> 05:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
that and these were his his words and
 
05:26:12.110 --> 05:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
you can hear him saying it as soon as I
 
05:26:15.150 --> 05:26:15.160 align:start position:0%
so is that he resented implications that
 
05:26:16.868 --> 05:26:16.878 align:start position:0%
the regulations weren't put there for a
 
05:26:19.030 --> 05:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
specific reason right that legislators
 
05:26:22.150 --> 05:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
had simply kind of picked a number out
 
05:26:24.788 --> 05:26:24.798 align:start position:0%
of a hat uh and so that regulations are
 
05:26:28.030 --> 05:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
in place because they a response to a
 
05:26:29.628 --> 05:26:29.638 align:start position:0%
something that happened at some point
 
05:26:31.868 --> 05:26:31.878 align:start position:0%
right so uh and and so for that reason I
 
05:26:34.150 --> 05:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
think it is important for us to promote
 
05:26:36.070 --> 05:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
this cause but to do so in a way that
 
05:26:39.310 --> 05:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
keeps in mind that regulations do exist
 
05:26:41.430 --> 05:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
for a reason and the other point that
 
05:26:43.030 --> 05:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative Morse made that I I'd
 
05:26:44.910 --> 05:26:44.920 align:start position:0%
like to second is that and I've only
 
05:26:48.150 --> 05:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
been here for a year but I haven't yet
 
05:26:50.030 --> 05:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
heard us make the suggestion that we
 
05:26:52.868 --> 05:26:52.878 align:start position:0%
should pass a bill that we're not good
 
05:26:55.430 --> 05:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
with with the idea that it's going to be
 
05:26:57.510 --> 05:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
amended on the other side of the wall
 
05:26:59.510 --> 05:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's not an argument that I have heard
 
05:27:02.230 --> 05:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
anyone make with regard to any of our
 
05:27:03.948 --> 05:27:03.958 align:start position:0%
other legislation so that's a reason why
 
05:27:05.350 --> 05:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
I support interim
 
05:27:07.390 --> 05:27:07.400 align:start position:0%
study thank
 
05:27:10.548 --> 05:27:10.558 align:start position:0%
you well and
 
05:27:14.390 --> 05:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
um kind of don't want to uh go against
 
05:27:16.948 --> 05:27:16.958 align:start position:0%
our animal cruelty statutes and beat
 
05:27:22.470 --> 05:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:26.350 --> 05:27:26.360 align:start position:0%
longer I'm going to say that uh we our
 
05:27:28.150 --> 05:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
discussion's pretty much done around
 
05:27:31.470 --> 05:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
this these two bills and um let's see if
 
05:27:33.750 --> 05:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
we you know I don't know if we can come
 
05:27:35.628 --> 05:27:35.638 align:start position:0%
up with any kind of amendment between
 
05:27:39.030 --> 05:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
now and next week if not um I'd be fine
 
05:27:42.030 --> 05:27:42.040 align:start position:0%
with inm study on this too and I want to
 
05:27:45.868 --> 05:27:45.878 align:start position:0%
make it very clear for this
 
05:27:48.628 --> 05:27:48.638 align:start position:0%
committee when we say inter in study
 
05:27:50.788 --> 05:27:50.798 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean a dignified death it
 
05:27:53.430 --> 05:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
means that we will study it and we will
 
05:27:54.948 --> 05:27:54.958 align:start position:0%
come up with a
 
05:27:58.910 --> 05:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
solution and present some kind of um
 
05:28:01.350 --> 05:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
legislation that
 
05:28:04.390 --> 05:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
is beneficial in the next for the next
 
05:28:08.070 --> 05:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
term so just for the record interim
 
05:28:09.670 --> 05:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
study for this committee doesn't mean
 
05:28:13.110 --> 05:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
that it's just going to go away and die
 
05:28:17.868 --> 05:28:17.878 align:start position:0%
somewhere with that um I guess we're
 
05:28:20.110 --> 05:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
done for
 
05:28:22.910 --> 05:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
today our representative Bixby yes would
 
05:28:25.470 --> 05:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
it be um in order to bring up one of the
 
05:28:27.350 --> 05:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
bills we were discussing last
 
05:28:30.190 --> 05:28:30.200 align:start position:0%
week uh we have a little bit of time so
 
05:28:33.628 --> 05:28:33.638 align:start position:0%
one not so uh I had a chance to uh talk
 
05:28:37.670 --> 05:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
to our city manager about the uh bill
 
05:28:41.470 --> 05:28:41.480 align:start position:0%
that uh was in response to the um
 
05:28:43.310 --> 05:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
nutrients going into Great Bay and the
 
05:28:48.350 --> 05:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
need to uh to um follow EP for follow
 
05:28:52.990 --> 05:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
the EPA permit Rel regarding um whether
 
05:28:56.270 --> 05:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
uh a sewer plant needs to be upgraded uh
 
05:29:00.430 --> 05:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
Etc and uh one of the things that so I I
 
05:29:01.868 --> 05:29:01.878 align:start position:0%
got a bit more of the history which I'm
 
05:29:05.230 --> 05:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
not going to rehash right now um
 
05:29:08.548 --> 05:29:08.558 align:start position:0%
but uh one of the things that I got from
 
05:29:11.548 --> 05:29:11.558 align:start position:0%
him was that this in this is in fact a
 
05:29:14.788 --> 05:29:14.798 align:start position:0%
real problem that the Department of
 
05:29:17.430 --> 05:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services has been better
 
05:29:20.910 --> 05:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
at stepping in between the EPA and the
 
05:29:24.070 --> 05:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the last uh four three
 
05:29:29.030 --> 05:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
or four years but uh that uh what might
 
05:29:32.868 --> 05:29:32.878 align:start position:0%
really help is if uh rather than the
 
05:29:38.470 --> 05:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
federal EPA uh issuing permits uh for uh
 
05:29:40.708 --> 05:29:40.718 align:start position:0%
water quality uh if that's something
 
05:29:44.548 --> 05:29:44.558 align:start position:0%
that was delegated to uh the state Dees
 
05:29:46.948 --> 05:29:46.958 align:start position:0%
because that would give Dees they'd
 
05:29:48.910 --> 05:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
still had to follow the same the
 
05:29:52.948 --> 05:29:52.958 align:start position:0%
same uh laws but they would be able to
 
05:29:54.788 --> 05:29:54.798 align:start position:0%
recognize more readily what the
 
05:29:57.788 --> 05:29:57.798 align:start position:0%
communities need and be able to work out
 
05:30:02.310 --> 05:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
um better accommodations uh so we might
 
05:30:05.548 --> 05:30:05.558 align:start position:0%
want to amend that bill to
 
05:30:09.430 --> 05:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
um uh to study making Dees a delegated
 
05:30:14.430 --> 05:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
authority and also um study U
 
05:30:18.470 --> 05:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
possibilities uh for uh Dees to be able
 
05:30:22.230 --> 05:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
to provide more uh Municipal Aid funding
 
05:30:25.310 --> 05:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
to uh communities that need assistance
 
05:30:28.070 --> 05:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh in in meeting those guidelines so I I
 
05:30:29.470 --> 05:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
I think we might want to see if we can
 
05:30:32.230 --> 05:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
make that into a study committee and and
 
05:30:34.548 --> 05:30:34.558 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that that bill that
 
05:30:37.750 --> 05:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
really would be under the purview of
 
05:30:40.510 --> 05:30:40.520 align:start position:0%
resources not under our committee so if
 
05:30:43.750 --> 05:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
we can write that if we can maybe get
 
05:30:47.110 --> 05:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
talk with um representative friend Zula
 
05:30:50.230 --> 05:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
yes and see if uh he'd be willing to be
 
05:30:53.230 --> 05:30:53.240 align:start position:0%
in support of such an amendment of a
 
05:30:56.230 --> 05:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
study committee and perhaps provide some
 
05:30:58.230 --> 05:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
Personnel for it then that would be very
 
05:31:00.868 --> 05:31:00.878 align:start position:0%
helpful okay sounds like a plan
 
05:31:02.708 --> 05:31:02.718 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh thank you madam
 
05:31:05.150 --> 05:31:05.160 align:start position:0%
chair I uh support representative
 
05:31:08.310 --> 05:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
bixby's um request I do want to make
 
05:31:11.430 --> 05:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
sure that we in whatever direction we
 
05:31:15.110 --> 05:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
proceed that the department is obviously
 
05:31:16.948 --> 05:31:16.958 align:start position:0%
brought in because I you know I just
 
05:31:19.270 --> 05:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that they felt would
 
05:31:20.990 --> 05:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
feel like they had the bandwidth to do
 
05:31:23.670 --> 05:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
such a thing versus where it is now so I
 
05:31:25.270 --> 05:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
could definitely support a study
 
05:31:28.230 --> 05:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
committee that would wrap in um both
 
05:31:29.510 --> 05:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
resources and environment and
 
05:31:32.230 --> 05:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
agriculture represent U part of the
 
05:31:34.350 --> 05:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
reason for doing that as a study
 
05:31:36.030 --> 05:31:36.040 align:start position:0%
committee is to be able to get their
 
05:31:38.708 --> 05:31:38.718 align:start position:0%
input and the other thing is that it's
 
05:31:40.628 --> 05:31:40.638 align:start position:0%
also the sort of Bill that would
 
05:31:43.590 --> 05:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
probably make sense to go in the first
 
05:31:46.190 --> 05:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh term first year of the term because
 
05:31:48.310 --> 05:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
it's going to have a budget impact uh
 
05:31:50.910 --> 05:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
Dees would need more Personnel for that
 
05:31:53.350 --> 05:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
and uh that's the sort of thing that uh
 
05:31:55.788 --> 05:31:55.798 align:start position:0%
would need to U be considered in terms
 
05:31:59.070 --> 05:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
of the budget yeah sounds right
 
05:32:02.150 --> 05:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
okay very
 
05:32:06.270 --> 05:32:06.280 align:start position:0%
good all right well um I bid we adjourn
 
05:32:08.868 --> 05:32:08.878 align:start position:0%
I'm going to gavl us out and hope you
 
05:32:10.548 --> 05:32:10.558 align:start position:0%
have a good rest of the evening thank
 
05:32:12.030 --> 05:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
you all
 
05:32:22.070 --> 05:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:29.030 --> 05:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:29.040 --> 05:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
