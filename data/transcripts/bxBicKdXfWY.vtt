00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
of an existing institution to fill a new
 
00:11:59.690 --> 00:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
role within the department the division
 
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
of Behavioral Health Services currently
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
is the only division at HHS that does
 
00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:08.339 align:start position:0%
not have a deputy director position
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
um and with various expansions it's a
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
role that's sorely needed to be able to
 
00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
attend to operational oversight and
 
00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
day-to-day management of the division
 
00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.269 align:start position:0%
day-to-day management of the division
um

00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
so this is a vacant position
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
that we are asking for the grade of GG
 
00:12:29.399 --> 00:12:32.509 align:start position:0%
that we are asking for the grade of GG
okay

00:12:32.509 --> 00:12:32.519 align:start position:0%

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:56.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:00.779 align:start position:0%

00:13:06.769 --> 00:13:06.779 align:start position:0%
this is a range from 79 430 up to 110
 
00:13:06.779 --> 00:13:11.150 align:start position:0%
this is a range from 79 430 up to 110
682.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
I don't have anything any questions
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:49.740 align:start position:0%
and the next one is uh director of
 
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid policy and clinical
 
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:57.110 align:start position:0%
Medicaid policy and clinical
programs

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:59.150 --> 00:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
okay this is also Health and Human
 
00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
Services position this is another new
 
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
function within the department
 
00:14:06.769 --> 00:14:06.779 align:start position:0%
these duties were currently or were
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
previously performed by the deputy
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
director of Medicaid services however
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
scope and population served have
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
expanded and so we have a need to have a
 
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:20.700 align:start position:0%
dedicated position to oversee both
 
00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
policy and clinical programming within
 
00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and our recommended letter
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
grade is FF
 
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
okay and um
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
oh here it is on the back I was looking
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
to see
 
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
and again for uh people's information FF
 
00:14:42.839 --> 00:14:45.290 align:start position:0%
and again for uh people's information FF
is

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
73 580 to 102 518. and I assume you know
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
where they people fall in there depends
 
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
on their experience and
 
00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
what it takes to hire somebody I guess
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
yeah our recommendation and I believe
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
corn Ferry's analysis is based on a
 
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
number of factors but it does include
 
00:15:05.449 --> 00:15:05.459 align:start position:0%
recommended education and experience to
 
00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:08.339 align:start position:0%
be successful in the role right okay uh
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
sorry it's my first time
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
I understand recruitment has been a kind
 
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
of a struggle Statewide on a lot of
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
different places for this position
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
particularly I think it's going to be an
 
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
important one going forward
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
are you confident that you can recruit
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
with that income bracket or that pay
 
00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.170 align:start position:0%
with that income bracket or that pay
scale

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:36.180 align:start position:0%
scale
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
we do feel confident that this is an
 
00:15:41.689 --> 00:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
appropriate range given the requirements
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%
for the position
 
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh Senator Rosenwald
 
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
is this a position that you could
 
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
recruit from inside the department for
 
00:15:55.009 --> 00:15:55.019 align:start position:0%
I think we could certainly potentially
 
00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
have internal candidates that would
 
00:15:59.329 --> 00:15:59.339 align:start position:0%
always be you know the optimal
 
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
experience would so somebody who already
 
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
knows the Medicaid Program
 
00:16:06.769 --> 00:16:06.779 align:start position:0%
exactly I mean knowledge of Medicaid
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
policy is is a critical function in this
 
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
role so to have someone who already
 
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
understands Medicaid policy in New
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would be the ideal
 
00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:18.899 align:start position:0%
so other than somebody who's already in
 
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
working for the Department
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
you know what kind of other
 
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
experience or background would give
 
00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:26.220 align:start position:0%
somebody that so what's kind of the pool
 
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
again we're looking for a depth of
 
00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
experience in policy generally strategic
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
planning so we are looking for a
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
candidate with a background in public
 
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
Administration health administration
 
00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:51.860 align:start position:0%
prior experience and health network
 
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
so that would be I think the primary
 
00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
pool and again ideally we would be
 
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
identifying an internal candidate that
 
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
we would
 
00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:03.959 align:start position:0%
promote to fulfill this role sure and if
 
00:17:05.689 --> 00:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
you find somebody who has some
 
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
experience in that and has a larger
 
00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:08.819 align:start position:0%
experience but doesn't know all the
 
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
details of how Medicaid Works in New
 
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are there people already in
 
00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:14.579 align:start position:0%
the department working would be working
 
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
under him who have a lot of experience
 
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:18.839 align:start position:0%
with that absolutely
 
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
um yeah our State Medicaid director is
 
00:17:23.689 --> 00:17:23.699 align:start position:0%
extremely knowledgeable and the core
 
00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
team within clinical policy or excuse me
 
00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
clinical programs is strong in
 
00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.870 align:start position:0%
clinical programs is strong in
experience

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
sure and and uh of course it this would
 
00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
be an unclassified position all
 
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions would be posted
 
00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:41.220 align:start position:0%
externally as well so so it's not
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
classified so it doesn't go through an
 
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
internal posting first it it would go
 
00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.710 align:start position:0%
internal posting first it it would go
external

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
external
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
um last year we recently hired somebody
 
00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
external to the department that did have
 
00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:51.059 align:start position:0%
a lot of skills and experience in the
 
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
Medicaid field within Medicaid and they
 
00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
brought in a wealth of experience and I
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
think also bringing in um
 
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
bringing the experience from other
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
states or national experience is really
 
00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
helpful for New Hampshire because they
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
can give us alternatives to the way that
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
we're doing things right now so while
 
00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
there are definitely benefits of hiring
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
internally if there is a is indeed a
 
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
qualified individual but B an individual
 
00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
who's interested in taking on an
 
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
unclassified position which is a little
 
00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
bit different than a classified role
 
00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:22.980 align:start position:0%
that could be beneficial but there's
 
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
also benefits to having folks come from
 
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.090 align:start position:0%
also benefits to having folks come from
external

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
external
 
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:27.900 align:start position:0%
um and and as indicated earlier we
 
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
believe that at this labor grade we
 
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
would we would be able to attract an
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
individual whether it be internal or
 
00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
external to the state to be successful
 
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
in this role any other questions or
 
00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.029 align:start position:0%
in this role any other questions or
discussion

00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:18:45.289 --> 00:18:45.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
okay all right so it's been moved and
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
seconded to approve this request Senator
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
Abbas yes yes Senator Rosenwald Senator
 
00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
Schmidt yes and the chair about CS so
 
00:19:00.909 --> 00:19:00.919 align:start position:0%
that's four to zero all right thank you
 
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
Anna you're also up for the next one
 
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
this is executive director of the
 
00:19:10.029 --> 00:19:10.039 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board
 
00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
so the department recommended HH
 
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:20.940 align:start position:0%
which would have been
 
00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
86 yeah 86 502 to 125.62
 
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
and corn Ferry said GG which is the next
 
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
one down 79 430 to 110 682
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
so any any comments on that or nature of
 
00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
the position
 
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
or and and I believe I thought
 
00:19:42.049 --> 00:19:42.059 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant was going to be
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
here to speak to this so just to clarify
 
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
the prescription drug affordability
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
board I believe a legislation was passed
 
00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:53.220 align:start position:0%
in 2021 to establish the sport
 
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
um the board is administratively
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
attached to the department so the
 
00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
department does not oversee the
 
00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:01.100 align:start position:0%
day-to-day functions instead it's it's
 
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to us they
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
operate independently
 
00:20:09.169 --> 00:20:09.179 align:start position:0%
um I I cannot speak to the specifics of
 
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
the program I approach things more from
 
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
the financial side I can give you all
 
00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:14.039 align:start position:0%
the history there if you'd like it
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
um but I do know when I have heard
 
00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:18.020 align:start position:0%
represent representative Merchant speak
 
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
to the qualifications of a director for
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
this type of role that it's going to be
 
00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
challenging to find somebody who's
 
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
qualified because they may need to have
 
00:20:30.289 --> 00:20:30.299 align:start position:0%
uh they may need to have a background
 
00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
within the pharmaceutical industry they
 
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
may need to have a background in in law
 
00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
as well which is why we had originally
 
00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
come forward with a with a higher
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
request than what corn fairy had
 
00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
recommended just because we do
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
anticipate finding or the board the
 
00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
prescriptions of affordability board
 
00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:50.220 align:start position:0%
anticipates a difficult time finding a
 
00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
qualified individual to to run the
 
00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
functions of that board
 
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
so there hasn't been anybody in this
 
00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.669 align:start position:0%
so there hasn't been anybody in this
position

00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
today no this is this is a brand new
 
00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:02.990 align:start position:0%
today no this is this is a brand new
position

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:06.260 align:start position:0%
um the the budget currently includes
 
00:21:09.049 --> 00:21:09.059 align:start position:0%
funding for for this position as it
 
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
currently stands with the Senate that
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
this would be brand new
 
00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
uh Senator Rosenwald thank you I'm a
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
member of this board
 
00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.330 align:start position:0%
member of this board
so

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:23.820 align:start position:0%
um I do know that it took the state of
 
00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.190 align:start position:0%
um I do know that it took the state of
Maryland

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
Maryland
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
about 18 months to hire someone it's
 
00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
kind of a specialized feel but but I
 
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
hesitate to go against corn fairy
 
00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
because I think they
 
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
seem to somehow know what they're doing
 
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
so if they recommend GG
 
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
all right uh did you have a comment
 
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt well of course uh
 
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant the chair is a
 
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
former member of Edna as the chair and I
 
00:21:58.850 --> 00:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
are uh he's been before us uh in
 
00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
committee on on this issue uh and this
 
00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
is a vital position that's one of the
 
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
reasons as Senator Rosenwald undoubtedly
 
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
knows well one of the reasons that uh
 
00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
prescription uh drug affordability board
 
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
is not as functional as it needs to be
 
00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
you know what I have in this person now
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
this is still a very substantial salary
 
00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
uh and but I see the commissioner
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
coming up to give us some additional
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
guidance yeah I'm uh actually fairly
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
familiar with this thing and in full
 
00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
disclosure although it won't affect my
 
00:22:36.289 --> 00:22:36.299 align:start position:0%
decision here I I have made attempts to
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
abolish the board but
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
an amendment I tried to get through not
 
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
this year but
 
00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.169 align:start position:0%
this year but
um

00:22:45.169 --> 00:22:45.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
thank you what attempts have been made
 
00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
to actually recruit someone before this
 
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:50.590 align:start position:0%
to actually recruit someone before this
position

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that it so it can't
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
be posted because no salary has been set
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
and that's the process you're undergoing
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
now I would say that um and I you know I
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
don't know what exactly what the board's
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
going to do and I understand the
 
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
position they are looking for something
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
of a unicorn
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
um you know it'd be great to find a
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
lawyer who's also a pharmacist I think
 
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
would be like Eagle right
 
00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
and that's unlikely I I wanted to talk a
 
00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:17.460 align:start position:0%
little bit about corn fairy and what
 
00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:19.860 align:start position:0%
they do and how that process works for
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
for members of the committee who aren't
 
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
so corn fairy examines positions by by
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
content they don't make any effort to
 
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
determine whether the salary is an
 
00:23:30.649 --> 00:23:30.659 align:start position:0%
appropriate salary for recruitment
 
00:23:33.529 --> 00:23:33.539 align:start position:0%
they do no market analysis at all in
 
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
fact it's part of what they do is they
 
00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
don't do market analysis they make no
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
effort on that the all the unclassified
 
00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
positions in the state are placed into a
 
00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
grid based on their complexity versus
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
all the other state positions and
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
whether we pay those positions
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
you know 30 more 20 less or whatever but
 
00:23:54.649 --> 00:23:54.659 align:start position:0%
no all you know is that ggs are
 
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
similarly complex that the committee has
 
00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
00:23:59.100 --> 00:23:59.750 align:start position:0%
in the past
um

00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
periodically made adjustments
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
um to salaries based on issues like
 
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
recruitment for example the medical
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
examiners historically are not a very
 
00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.330 align:start position:0%
examiners historically are not a very
complicated

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
I mean nobody wants to do it but it's
 
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
not as complicated as some job so their
 
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:20.700 align:start position:0%
salary came in
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
probably like GG or something and they
 
00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:24.539 align:start position:0%
make more than anybody else in state
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
government they make like double what
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
the governor makes or something like
 
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
that and uh and so the committee the
 
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
committee does that and so typically
 
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
what what committees have done in the
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
past is look at it and say okay corn
 
00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
fairy has said based on complexity
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
points Gigi is about where they are
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
um it would be unusual for the committee
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
to deviate from that by more than a
 
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
letter grade but it would not be unusual
 
00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:51.299 align:start position:0%
for the committee to deviate from that
 
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
by a letter grade
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
um historically people have looked at it
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
and said well you know what this
 
00:24:58.970 --> 00:24:58.980 align:start position:0%
position is going to be harder to
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
recruit financially for reasons that are
 
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
legitimate not just that because frankly
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
all of us can sit up here at some point
 
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
and go well we're having a really hard
 
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
time hiring
 
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
I mean frankly everything right from
 
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
building cleaners to engineers and
 
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
um but in this in this case what
 
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
committee says has historically done is
 
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
looked at it and said are there things
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
about this position that make it
 
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
particularly I don't say weird what's
 
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
the word I'm looking for
 
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
um unusual or anomalous and and that's
 
00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:30.059 align:start position:0%
something you would look at and I say
 
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:31.740 align:start position:0%
that to say that even corn fairy would
 
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
tell you they're not meant to be
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
we went higher because we needed
 
00:25:51.409 --> 00:25:51.419 align:start position:0%
somebody in that position and when we
 
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
went higher we got some
 
00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
yeah my understanding is there is
 
00:25:58.730 --> 00:25:58.740 align:start position:0%
somebody doing that and he makes a lot
 
00:25:59.570 --> 00:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
of money
 
00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:01.860 align:start position:0%
actually these
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
the salary range for that is uh
 
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:07.980 align:start position:0%
well there is no range it's one amount
 
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
and it's 176 696. yeah that's one of the
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
off-the-grid positions so to speak
 
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
I say that not because I I'm not on the
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%
affordability board I've talked to
 
00:26:21.769 --> 00:26:21.779 align:start position:0%
represent a merchant I don't know but my
 
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
understanding is they are looking for a
 
00:26:24.289 --> 00:26:24.299 align:start position:0%
bit of a unicorn it's going to be very
 
00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
hard to recruit
 
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
any other comments uh Senator Evans
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
thank you it's more of a general
 
00:26:33.169 --> 00:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
question but if the corn fairy hay
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation sounds like their
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
analysis can be
 
00:26:39.529 --> 00:26:39.539 align:start position:0%
flawed depending on the context it's in
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
why are we going to take that rely on
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
their recommendations going forward
 
00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
it's a good question their analysis
 
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
isn't flawed as much as it's limited
 
00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:53.820 align:start position:0%
um their uh classification is a is a
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
complicated thing
 
00:26:57.649 --> 00:26:57.659 align:start position:0%
um in employee well employee
 
00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:00.900 align:start position:0%
classification generally and it it and
 
00:27:03.169 --> 00:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
there are multiple ways to do it the
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
truth is that most people and and most
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
of it in America dates back a little
 
00:27:09.529 --> 00:27:09.539 align:start position:0%
over 100 years to some to the
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia Transit company but
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
um there are
 
00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
there are ways to do it the most
 
00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:17.820 align:start position:0%
important way to do any classification
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
is based on job content and and that is
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
to say that uh you know markets
 
00:27:24.649 --> 00:27:24.659 align:start position:0%
fluctuate up and down and we can look at
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
things but when you're doing a system
 
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
where you're taking hundreds of
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
thousands of employees and trying to
 
00:27:33.049 --> 00:27:33.059 align:start position:0%
align them all against each other I mean
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
think of it if you've got a smallish
 
00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
business and there's five people working
 
00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
for you you can be like
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll give you 10 this year and and
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
and Senator you'll get eight
 
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
um or I could reverse that if if one of
 
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
you is offended but um the uh but but
 
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
you sort of go along that way and and uh
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
what we've hired them for and frankly
 
00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:56.039 align:start position:0%
that's what the division of personnel
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
does to the classified system is to
 
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
examine job content and so they're
 
00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
coming to you with that and nine times
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
out of ten or 95 times out of a hundred
 
00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:07.799 align:start position:0%
job content is going to get you the
 
00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
employee to the place where they are
 
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
neither heart uh harder or easier to
 
00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:17.460 align:start position:0%
recruit than average right when when you
 
00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
know during recession no State positions
 
00:28:21.049 --> 00:28:21.059 align:start position:0%
are very hard to recruit during good
 
00:28:22.669 --> 00:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
Economic Times All State positions are
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
hard to recruit and it's sort of a
 
00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:26.220 align:start position:0%
truism of of the waiting at labor market
 
00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
works but there are always going to be
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
one-offs and so what they're hired to do
 
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
is to do a
 
00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:33.409 align:start position:0%
is to do a
um

00:28:33.409 --> 00:28:33.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:36.649 --> 00:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
a non-economic evaluation so
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
here's my take on it and correct me if
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
this is not correct correct um there's
 
00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
um there's sort of two aspects of this
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
one is
 
00:28:48.669 --> 00:28:48.679 align:start position:0%
how does the
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
difficulty complexity level experience
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
and everything needed for this job
 
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
compared to other jobs in the state
 
00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
and having that lined up for one thing
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
would avoid issues where two people who
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
are doing kind of more or less the same
 
00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
thing or paid widely wildly differently
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
which could cause problems
 
00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:09.900 align:start position:0%
but so they help with that
 
00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
but the for each classification how much
 
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
they're going to get paid or the salary
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
range is basically up to the legislature
 
00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:19.740 align:start position:0%
you know you can request it now it's a
 
00:29:21.049 --> 00:29:21.059 align:start position:0%
disc committee that would propose
 
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
adjusting those numbers the actual
 
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
dollar amount or what would be the
 
00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:26.700 align:start position:0%
process of that they're not suggesting
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
that now but to understand when you say
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
adjusting the actual dollar amount uh on
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
um how does that get set that gets set
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
by Statute and so typically that gets
 
00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:47.700 align:start position:0%
set during Collective like um when
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining happens there's a
 
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:52.740 align:start position:0%
there's a bill that follows it okay um
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
this year it happens to be in-house Bill
 
00:29:57.169 --> 00:29:57.179 align:start position:0%
2 where salaries are adjusted as a
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
result of that
 
00:30:00.409 --> 00:30:00.419 align:start position:0%
unclassified are not part of collective
 
00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:02.220 align:start position:0%
bargaining but typically that it's
 
00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
extended to collective bargaining so for
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
example this year the the bill has that
 
00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
these ranges will also go up by 10 or 2
 
00:30:12.409 --> 00:30:12.419 align:start position:0%
or in the second year or whatever okay
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
Senator Roswell so does that mean that
 
00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:17.820 align:start position:0%
if we were to
 
00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:03.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:20.169 --> 00:31:20.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:47.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.529 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:31:53.529 --> 00:31:53.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
time being 9 31 we will open up our May
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
18th meeting of long-range Capital
 
00:32:03.649 --> 00:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
planning and utilization committee to
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
the members in the audience I want to
 
00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:09.740 align:start position:0%
welcome you to Public Works and highways
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
the first item on our agenda is the
 
00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
acceptance of minutes from April 21st
 
00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:20.220 align:start position:0%
2023 as distributed are there questions
 
00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
comments omissions move to a proof
 
00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
motion by Senator Lang to approve second
 
00:32:36.889 --> 00:32:36.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:39.769 --> 00:32:39.779 align:start position:0%
my informality catches up with me at
 
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
times and I have to think of Sandra's
 
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
last name so thank you

he retired in December of last year and
 
00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
I recently took over he was uh he was a
 
00:41:20.569 --> 00:41:20.579 align:start position:0%
wonderful asset for our state
 
00:41:22.609 --> 00:41:22.619 align:start position:0%
um did a lot of work in my region and
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
we're looking forward to working with
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
you please uh if you could uh present
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
your proposal here sure
 
00:41:32.089 --> 00:41:32.099 align:start position:0%
um so New Hampshire Department of
 
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services is looking to
 
00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
dispose of the York Dam and Associated
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
structures easements
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
um and flow adjustments to uh Briar
 
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
Hydro Associates
 
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
the the site is made up of four
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
structures and five easements we have
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
the York canal dam which is on the main
 
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
stem of the Kentucky River in Concord uh
 
00:41:56.569 --> 00:41:56.579 align:start position:0%
in Penacook and uh then we have the
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
canal Dyke which is a historic structure
 
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
on basically an old Canal that was used
 
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
during uh for meal purposes
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
the uh Rolf Canal gate stem which is at
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
the entrance of the current Canal that's
 
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
used by Briar Hydro Associates uh to
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
allow water to flow down to their
 
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:15.660 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric facility and then also in
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
easement along that Canal for what was
 
00:42:20.089 --> 00:42:20.099 align:start position:0%
that one time called the Ralph canal dam
 
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:23.220 align:start position:0%
that was removed in 1980. these
 
00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
structures and easements were
 
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
transferred to the state in 1967
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
by the city of Concord and the Water
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
Resources board rebuilt the York Dam
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
which is the dam on the main stem using
 
00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:39.020 align:start position:0%
their Force account in
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
1968. the site was redeveloped by Briar
 
00:42:44.329 --> 00:42:44.339 align:start position:0%
Hydro Associates in 1986 and at that
 
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
point in time Elise was entered a
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
50-year lease with Briar Hydra
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
Associates for uh operation and
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the site at that time
 
00:42:56.089 --> 00:42:56.099 align:start position:0%
Briar Hydra associates also built the
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
Rolf Canal gate stem at the on the state
 
00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:00.300 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire easement at the
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
entrance to the canal and since that
 
00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
time Briar Hydro has been operating the
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
site of the hydroelectric facility
 
00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:10.740 align:start position:0%
prior Hydro uh would like to purchase
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
the sites and transfer the easements to
 
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
them for uh six hundred thousand dollars
 
00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:18.660 align:start position:0%
and the site was assessed in 2020 by the
 
00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:19.740 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Revenue
 
00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:22.460 align:start position:0%
Administration Municipal and property
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
appraisal division and they came out
 
00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:27.140 align:start position:0%
with the the six hundred thousand dollar
 
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
estimate and
 
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
basically the reason we're doing this is
 
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
we currently uh as you know we lease the
 
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
site to Briar Hydro Associates we do
 
00:43:37.849 --> 00:43:37.859 align:start position:0%
receive revenue from that lease however
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
by uh disposing of the site and selling
 
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
it to Briar Hydro it reduces the state's
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
liability for this site and removes one
 
00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
of 60 High Hazard dams off our current
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
inventory so we can um help reduce the
 
00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:55.140 align:start position:0%
state's risk and liability associated
 
00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
with the site so and I'll just like to
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
add that's
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
um it's funny you mentioned Jim uh Corey
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
taking over for Jim we actually have
 
00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:05.819 align:start position:0%
used this
 
00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
um as an opportunity to kind of
 
00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
reevaluate our portfolio the 275 dams we
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
own and the uh amount of capital needs
 
00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:15.349 align:start position:0%
own and the uh amount of capital needs
and

00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:17.700 align:start position:0%
um the ongoing operation and maintenance
 
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
it would require it this sale is very
 
00:44:22.849 --> 00:44:22.859 align:start position:0%
consistent with
 
00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
um our goal is to drastically reduce the
 
00:44:28.089 --> 00:44:28.099 align:start position:0%
amount of dams the state owns
 
00:44:30.589 --> 00:44:30.599 align:start position:0%
you know if there there isn't a safety
 
00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
or another state policy mitigating
 
00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
reason to own a dam where you're gonna
 
00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
we're gonna be over the next couple
 
00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
years looking for options and other
 
00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
opportunities to find other owners of
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
these dams find other options for these
 
00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:49.460 align:start position:0%
dams because right now we have 275 dams
 
00:44:52.849 --> 00:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
440 million dollars of capital needs and
 
00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:55.140 align:start position:0%
that doesn't even count on going o m so
 
00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:57.900 align:start position:0%
this is very consistent with how we
 
00:44:59.450 --> 00:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
would like to start moving forward with
 
00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:01.140 align:start position:0%
our overall portfolio
 
00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner they further
 
00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:06.349 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner they further
questions

00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you Mr Stewart uh I know
 
00:45:13.609 --> 00:45:13.619 align:start position:0%
the condition of our dibs uh is is not
 
00:45:16.609 --> 00:45:16.619 align:start position:0%
up to par what what is the condition of
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
this of this site as as we speak
 
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
this site is actually in in pretty good
 
00:45:25.609 --> 00:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
shape it's been um basically uh all the
 
00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
O M costs and maintenance costs and
 
00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:28.190 align:start position:0%
O M costs and maintenance costs and
capital

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
capital
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
um input into the site has been done by
 
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
Briar as required under their ferc
 
00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
license that they have for this entire
 
00:45:36.589 --> 00:45:36.599 align:start position:0%
site and the lease so it's this site is
 
00:45:38.329 --> 00:45:38.339 align:start position:0%
is in Fairly good shape and I believe
 
00:45:40.609 --> 00:45:40.619 align:start position:0%
Breyer is planning on continuing to
 
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
operate the site as they currently do
 
00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
and just really quickly follow up on
 
00:45:47.569 --> 00:45:47.579 align:start position:0%
that that's an example of why we want to
 
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
move to this model this is a dam
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
currently being leased that has value to
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
a private operator and has been doing
 
00:45:56.809 --> 00:45:56.819 align:start position:0%
the work and putting the money in to
 
00:45:58.130 --> 00:45:58.140 align:start position:0%
maintain it
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
um and and that's like what we'd like to
 
00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:02.220 align:start position:0%
see for these future uh find owners of
 
00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
these dams that that there where there's
 
00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:06.780 align:start position:0%
a value to them and they can take on the
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
maintenance and uh capital investment
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
needed which has happened in this site
 
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
and it's just a good time to fully move
 
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
ownership over okay thank you thank you
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator Lang I'll wave after
 
00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:20.220 align:start position:0%
they answer my question okay
 
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
um I um it would appear shortly you're
 
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
going to be flush with money in this
 
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
department so I just want to tell you
 
00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
that the Mill Pond Dam owned by the town
 
00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
of ospi which was topped ogre that I
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
heard about issues that perhaps town of
 
00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:37.740 align:start position:0%
Osby could sell you back one for one
 
00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:39.370 align:start position:0%
Osby could sell you back one for one
dollar

00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:39.380 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
that is inconsistent with our current
 
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
strategy but I uh we will take that
 
00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:47.220 align:start position:0%
under advisement but I I just want to
 
00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:49.380 align:start position:0%
mention that I was told that it was
 
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
someone from your department is going up
 
00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
to Osprey the next couple days to look
 
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
at that yes it was recently inspected
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
back in September and so they're going
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
to be heading back up there to see if
