name is representative Pat long and I
 
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
serve Hillsboro district
 
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
10 um this this this proposed
 
00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
legislation uh came with a conversation
 
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
uh that I've had with our former
 
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester's former superintendent Dr
 
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
Vargas and current superintendent Dr
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
gohad and Madame clerk I'll be I'll be
 
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
emailing you this testimony um thank you
 
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
so this proposed
 
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
legislation is for school district's uh
 
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
SAU superintendent are given a choice to
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
have the district contribution and their
 
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
personal contribution to the retirement
 
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
system at whatever the current rate is
 
00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:53.959 align:start position:0%
either be contributed to the New
 
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State retirement system or to
 
00:09:58.350 --> 00:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
have this same contribution put into a
 
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:01.240 align:start position:0%
private and approved retirement account
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
or a combination thereof if the
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
contribution exceeds Federal limits uh
 
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
if the superintendent chooses this
 
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:09.160 align:start position:0%
option the local school board will
 
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
include the rision in the
 
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
superintendent's contract furthermore if
 
00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:15.519 align:start position:0%
the superintendent chooses this option
 
00:10:17.949 --> 00:10:17.959 align:start position:0%
and they in the district they work for
 
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
have made contributions to the state
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
retirement system up to three years of
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
past personal and District contrib
 
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
contributions to the state retirement
 
00:10:28.509 --> 00:10:28.519 align:start position:0%
system may be transferred to the private
 
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
retirement account uh however uh with
 
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
conversations with uh OS we couldn't
 
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
determine whether this
 
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
um whether this
 
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
benefit could be to people that are
 
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
already in the system if it would have
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
to be for somebody that would be new in
 
00:10:48.509 --> 00:10:48.519 align:start position:0%
the system we haven't been able to
 
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
determine that um the the purpose my
 
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:53.720 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the number of
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
superintendent vacancies in the United
 
00:10:56.629 --> 00:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
States and in New Hampshire is
 
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
increasing while the number of
 
00:10:59.550 --> 00:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
applicants for those
 
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
positions is decreasing the likelihood
 
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
of continuing to replace retiring and
 
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
resigning superintendents with current
 
00:11:11.069 --> 00:11:11.079 align:start position:0%
District leadership is also decreased
 
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
substantially being a superintendent is
 
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
no longer a sought-after and covered
 
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
position like once it was in my opinion
 
00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:20.519 align:start position:0%
I've recognized that in the last four
 
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
years uh with the more challenges to
 
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
superintendence it may have always
 
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
happened but I've just recognized it the
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
last four years um that uh you know for
 
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
simple decisions
 
00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:35.079 align:start position:0%
um uh there's controversy for example
 
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
snow days there's major controversies
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
for for a superintendent uh to fill the
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
need to to fill the need to
 
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
superintendent turnover many districts
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
utilize search firms to recruit
 
00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:50.519 align:start position:0%
candidates in National searches the
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
likelihood of hiring a superintendent
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
from out of state is quite High allowing
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
superintendant to have the choice
 
00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
between the current retirement system we
 
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
having the exact same amount of money
 
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:03.160 align:start position:0%
contributed to a private or approved
 
00:12:06.269 --> 00:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
retirement or a combination there
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
thereof enhances the likelihood of a of
 
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
State superintendent candidates
 
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
accepting positions in New Hampshire
 
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
most of not all a of State
 
00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:17.079 align:start position:0%
superintendent hires will come with many
 
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
year of previous experience and will
 
00:12:21.189 --> 00:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
have many years already vested in
 
00:12:23.949 --> 00:12:23.959 align:start position:0%
another state system the likelihood of
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
getting 10 years for vesting rights in
 
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is unlikely and in my
 
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
opinion is a is a big dealbreaker for
 
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
candidates I've I've worked uh I've
 
00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:36.519 align:start position:0%
worked with four of Manchester's past uh
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
and current um
 
00:12:41.069 --> 00:12:41.079 align:start position:0%
superintendents uh two of them were from
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh the last two were from
 
00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
out of state and I've watched um and
 
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
I've watched the applicants diminish and
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
or drop out after the interview process
 
00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:53.710 align:start position:0%
or drop out after the interview process
was

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:53.720 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
applied for example not one of the last
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
three superintendents in Manchester
 
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
state PA more than five years and the
 
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
last superintendent was the uh was the
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
last applicant remaining uh fortunately
 
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
from Manchester School District that
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
superintendent was uh very
 
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
capable I do realize that this proposal
 
00:13:15.069 --> 00:13:15.079 align:start position:0%
would have an impact on an the Hampshire
 
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
00:13:18.629 --> 00:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
contribution however I'm not convinced
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
that that impact would be detrimental to
 
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
the allall sustainment of our retirement
 
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.829 align:start position:0%
the allall sustainment of our retirement
Financial

00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839 align:start position:0%
Financial
 
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
stability I may be mistaken but I
 
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to confirm
 
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
I'm of the belief that that if I'm faced
 
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
with a choice between a superintendent's
 
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
contribution to the retirement system or
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
the superintendent's right to maximize
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
their invest their investment I I would
 
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
choose the
 
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
latter so in conclusion I thank you for
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
your consideration of HS Bill 497 and
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
ask that you support the
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
concept in the interest of our students
 
00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
families District employees and
 
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities I will finally also add
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
that when I was told by Dr goart that
 
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:01.720 align:start position:0%
Manchester's current superintendent that
 
00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:04.839 align:start position:0%
he was not able to testify I was taken
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
back for about 15 seconds I would rather
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
see him dedicating his time to our
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
district than being present today uh it
 
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
qualifies my belief that he was the best
 
00:14:16.829 --> 00:14:16.839 align:start position:0%
choice for Manchester I thank you and
 
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions uh thank you
 
00:14:21.949 --> 00:14:21.959 align:start position:0%
very much representative long
 
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative long has said he's
 
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
willing to take questions are there
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
questions from committee
 
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.310 align:start position:0%
questions from committee
members

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative Miler uh thank you Mr
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
long for taking my question my
 
00:14:38.749 --> 00:14:38.759 align:start position:0%
presumption is that if this bill should
 
00:14:42.269 --> 00:14:42.279 align:start position:0%
pass then the uh the amount of
 
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
retirement that a superintendent would
 
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:47.720 align:start position:0%
receive would be up to negotiations
 
00:14:49.749 --> 00:14:49.759 align:start position:0%
between the individual and and the
 
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
school board and not necessarily reflect
 
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
the amount that he or she would be
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
receiving uh would they be
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
if they would be in the retirement
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
system is that
 
00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
correct uh my my thank you for the
 
00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
question representative my understanding
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
is that um
 
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
the it's it's an agreement between the
 
00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:15.759 align:start position:0%
the applicant and the school districts
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
and the uh School District or
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
municipality um but my understanding is
 
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
that they would both need to contribute
 
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
to whatever retirement system um that
 
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:29.720 align:start position:0%
they current at the rate that they're
 
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.350 align:start position:0%
they current at the rate that they're
currently

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
paying so I I don't believe the city
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
could cut a deal saying you put in your
 
00:15:38.309 --> 00:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
amount and we'll put in half of
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
ours um I you know that's the way I
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
understand it thank you thank you very
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
much representative Miler uh further
 
00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
questions uh representa long I do have
 
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
one question and I I I see that
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%

00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
hand
 
00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
up sure thank you Mr chairman uh and
 
00:15:59.870 --> 00:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative long for taking
 
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
the question um do you have any data on
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
the current numbers of superintendents
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
who um are not vested or have uh not
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
stayed on in other words do we have any
 
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
notion of the size or scope of this uh
 
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh imputed problem so thank you for the
 
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
question the the uh what I do know
 
00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
serving on the Manchester uh Board of
 
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:22.710 align:start position:0%
serving on the Manchester uh Board of
school

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:16:25.629 --> 00:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
committee um that the average the
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
average length of superintendent in
 
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
state of the Hampshire was three years
 
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
that was uh that was probably three or
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
four years ago that data so no I don't I
 
00:16:39.629 --> 00:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
know Manchester Nasher a few other
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
districts have a high salary rate um so
 
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
I realize that's quite a bit of a
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
contribution um but the average I'm not
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
sure of and how much how much money the
 
00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:55.079 align:start position:0%
potential has for in reducing the
 
00:16:55.079 --> 00:16:56.389 align:start position:0%
potential has for in reducing the
retirement

00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
00:16:59.230 --> 00:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
system uh I don't have that figure
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
either thank you thank you very much uh
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative who do we have Ford
 
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
Ford yes
 
00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:13.230 align:start position:0%
Ford yes
yes

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh can you hear me now yes I'm still
 
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0%
struggling with this system thank you uh
 
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
um representative Turner I'm sorry I
 
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
lost you the my picture I don't have
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
your name in front of Oh Long
 
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:32.799 align:start position:0%
um my question is does this allow people
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
who have been in our system gone away
 
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
and then transfer those credits earned
 
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere else back into this
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
system I speak as one who's done exactly
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
that it's very common in University
 
00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
Systems to be in three or four different
 
00:17:53.549 --> 00:17:53.559 align:start position:0%
because you moved around in your career
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
and then at some point you pick the one
 
00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
that's most advantageous to you trans
 
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
transfer all the other funds into that
 
00:18:02.669 --> 00:18:02.679 align:start position:0%
and that's the one you actually retire
 
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
from but I'm just wondering how that
 
00:18:07.149 --> 00:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
works for school superintendent I'm not
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
familiar with their system so uh thank
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative I I
 
00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
um I would suspect that this would be
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
attractive for superintendents that are
 
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
coming to New Hampshire from OT State um
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
I think I know the two uh superintendant
 
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
that were in Manchester from within the
 
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
state uh had no issue with with
 
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
contributing to their retirement plan um
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
it was the two from OT state that
 
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
thought it would be more attractive uh
 
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
and more of a Le leveraging Point for
 
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
the municipality and or the district to
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
um offer such a uh a contribution as
 
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
this well at some point when you have so
 
00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:55.559 align:start position:0%
many of them collected three or four
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
maybe uh it becomes almost NE necessary
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
to transfer all the ones all the funds
 
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
into one just whichever one you think or
 
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
can do it with and that that becomes the
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
issue for them and so that that's why I
 
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
support you in what you're we're doing
 
00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
here I think this is U perhaps
 
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
overdue uh representative long I'd like
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
to follow up with a question um in your
 
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
writing and designing this
 
00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:25.640 align:start position:0%
legislation uh most likely would the
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
superintendent that we're speaking of or
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
both individuals you spoke of in
 
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester was there any effort on your
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
part to communicate with the school
 
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
administrators Association to discern
 
00:19:40.149 --> 00:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
where they stand on this I note in the
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
testimony requests here we have the
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
school administrators Association not
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
speaking but they oppose this
 
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
bill okay I I did uh through my uh Board
 
00:19:55.149 --> 00:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
of school committee asked a few of them
 
00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
to ask the association as to where they
 
00:20:01.149 --> 00:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
would stand on this
 
00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
um and I I didn't get that result so no
 
00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
I wasn't able to uh to connect with them
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you are are there any further
 
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:13.720 align:start position:0%

representative the last part of this
 
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
bill has a section that indicates that
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
if a school superintendent and the
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
school district they work for enter into
 
00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:35.480 align:start position:0%
this agreement and they've already
 
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
contributed to the New Hampshire
 
00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
retirement system then they can go back
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
as far as three years and transfer that
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
money from the retirement system to the
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
private retirement account am I am I
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%

00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill yes yes yes it is the
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%

whether or not somebody who's already in
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
the system was allowed would be allowed
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
to do that by tax code or
 
00:21:17.789 --> 00:21:17.799 align:start position:0%
General Financial practices so that that
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
is to be
 
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:23.240 align:start position:0%

if I if if a superintendent participates
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
if this bill is passed in this program
 
00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
stays in New Hampshire two or three
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
years as a private non contributor
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
leaves and comes back four or five years
 
00:22:00.029 --> 00:22:00.039 align:start position:0%
later later can he buy back into the
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
system for the time he did was here or
 
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
is this a one option you're out or
 
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
you're in uh yeah well actually the bill
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't give you a one option uh that's
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
that's a good question that I haven't uh
 
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
thought about um you know I mean for
 
00:22:19.149 --> 00:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
sure they could make another contract if
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
if they're going to be a
 
00:22:24.909 --> 00:22:24.919 align:start position:0%
superintendent um for this bill uh
 
00:22:26.909 --> 00:22:26.919 align:start position:0%
however the opt in to the retirement
 
00:22:29.269 --> 00:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
system I I guess they could if there's
 
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
no contract to do this than thank you Mr

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
dog barks I
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
apologize um nhrs has no position on
 
00:23:09.789 --> 00:23:09.799 align:start position:0%
this bill um because we see it as a
 
00:23:12.669 --> 00:23:12.679 align:start position:0%
policy matter uh as to whether there's a
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
a you know a need a policy need to
 
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
exempt these positions uh going forward
 
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:19.720 align:start position:0%
however I did sign up to testify to
 
00:23:22.029 --> 00:23:22.039 align:start position:0%
provide some background information and
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
try to answer any questions the
 
00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:24.919 align:start position:0%
committee may
 
00:23:29.269 --> 00:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
have um essentially um according to the
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Education there are about
 
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
100 to 105 superintendents in New
 
00:23:36.669 --> 00:23:36.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh with an average salary of
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
$126,000 so that makes them the
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
typically the highest paid School
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
District employee in all um all of the
 
00:23:46.909 --> 00:23:46.919 align:start position:0%
districts um superintendent contri
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
employers contribute at the employee uh
 
00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
rate of 14% um for superintendant and
 
00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
the superintendant pay 7% into the
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
retirement system is a member
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
contribution um the way our
 
00:24:02.909 --> 00:24:02.919 align:start position:0%
contributions are set up and this this
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
will this will be important as we go
 
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
forward is the member contributions are
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
always associated with the member's
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
individual account so whatever money the
 
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
active contributing member puts into the
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
system they're going to get that back
 
00:24:16.269 --> 00:24:16.279 align:start position:0%
you know either through a pension
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately or through a refund of
 
00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:20.799 align:start position:0%
contributions plus interest the employer
 
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
contributions however aren't credited to
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
individual accounts like you'd see like
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
in a match in a a defined
 
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
benefit defined contribution plan rather
 
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
employer contributions are put into the
 
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
state accumulated annuity fund which
 
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
pays the benefits for for all members so
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
so there is a distinction there it's not
 
00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
like you know there's an individual
 
00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
account for a person and that the
 
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
employer contributions match up to those
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
person to those folks
 
00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
um there was a similar piece of
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
legislation introduced back in 2018 uh
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
it was House Bill 1427
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
um and it was u in in response to an
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
issue with the prior superintendent in
 
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester before the current person um
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
my understanding from my notes was that
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
that individual was given the option to
 
00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
participate in the retirement system or
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
not which it is a mandatory membership
 
00:25:18.029 --> 00:25:18.039 align:start position:0%
position so um you know the bill was
 
00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:19.799 align:start position:0%
attempted an attempt to address that I'm
 
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
not sure what the situation is with the
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
current superintendent contractually uh
 
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
that bill actually was heard by Housey
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
DNA not educ
 
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
and um adna amended the bill to make it
 
00:25:36.149 --> 00:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
um a limited window to allow Manchester
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
um to to to fix its situation but not um
 
00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
keep it going prospectively that that
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
did pass the house and and died in the
 
00:25:46.269 --> 00:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
Senate uh when the Senate uh amended the
 
00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
bill to a completely different provision
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
regarding our statute um in terms of
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
this bill a couple of
 
00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
um uh sections of how we interpret it
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
because this plays into some of the
 
00:25:59.710 --> 00:25:59.720 align:start position:0%
questions you had for representative
 
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
long um on um page one line 20 um it
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
refers to um this opt out at the initial
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
at the time of initial hiring or
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
appointment so we would read that to be
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
when someone you know is hired as a
 
00:26:15.389 --> 00:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
superintendent that would be the period
 
00:26:19.149 --> 00:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
in which the opin would be allowed not
 
00:26:23.389 --> 00:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
retroactively um and when someone opts
 
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
out of the retirement system as is
 
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
allowed for chief Municipal officers I
 
00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
you know Town managers Town
 
00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:32.919 align:start position:0%
administrators positions like that um
 
00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
you know they can't choose to opt in in
 
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
that position while they're continuing
 
00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
that position if they went to another
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
town and decided to join their
 
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
Retirement System in their new job uh
 
00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
they could you know become a member
 
00:26:46.389 --> 00:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
there uh but they wouldn't be able to
 
00:26:48.029 --> 00:26:48.039 align:start position:0%
purchase prior service because there was
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
an opt out so that you weren't there
 
00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:51.919 align:start position:0%
wasn't any service to a crew and buy
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
back um the town manager provision in
 
00:26:57.789 --> 00:26:57.799 align:start position:0%
our statute has been around since um the
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
early 70s uh I think I think Municipal
 
00:27:03.149 --> 00:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
management was a relatively new field
 
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
then and it was more of a Transit
 
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
position where people would move from
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
state to state you know for for jobs so
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
um that that piece uh allowing optional
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
membership at the time of hiring for
 
00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
those folks has been around for close to
 
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
50 years
 
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
now um couple of other provisions on
 
00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:22.120 align:start position:0%
page one line
 
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
29 um it refers to
 
00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
um uh the school District May by
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
contract pay to the superintendent a sum
 
00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:32.559 align:start position:0%
equivalent to the employer contribution
 
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
so may is not shall so I think that
 
00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:37.799 align:start position:0%
would answer the question of uh you know
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
there's no statutory requirement to pay
 
00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
the nhrs rate to to a new superintendent
 
00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:45.039 align:start position:0%
who opted out that would that would be a
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
negotiable point and then finally um the
 
00:27:50.909 --> 00:27:50.919 align:start position:0%
the second section
 
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
um on page two lines 1 through 7 the
 
00:27:59.149 --> 00:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
three-year um look back um we we see our
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
our legal staff seees some potential
 
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:03.640 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue code issues um with
 
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
both of those Provisions the refund of a
 
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
member's contributions if the person
 
00:28:14.029 --> 00:28:14.039 align:start position:0%
isn't um you know eligible to retire um
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
you know may may violate the separation
 
00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
from service provision and the Internal
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue code and then the transfer of
 
00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
employer contributions from the state
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
accumul accumulated annuity fund to an
 
00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
individual reti enement account for a
 
00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:30.919 align:start position:0%
specific member um you know may be an
 
00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
issue in terms of the exclusive benefit
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
rule in the code if if the bill moves
 
00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:37.799 align:start position:0%
forward we'd uh likely reach out to
 
00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
outside tax Council uh to to get more of
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
a clarification on that but our initial
 
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
interpretation is that that that's a a
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
problematic look back uh that that does
 
00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
not apply to the municipal manager um
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
exemption in the statute if those folks
 
00:28:58.029 --> 00:28:58.039 align:start position:0%
are hired there's no look back or retro
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
with them um so um you know this this
 
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
would be a unique benefit specifically
 
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.430 align:start position:0%
would be a unique benefit specifically
for

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
superintendence I I other than the raw
 
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
numbers from the doe website I don't I
 
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
don't have any information on how many
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
of our superintendents are vested versus
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
non-vested um we don't track position
 
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
titles in the retirement system they're
 
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
just you know considered an employee um
 
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
so I would I wouldn't be able to to run
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
anything to to get you that number and I
 
00:29:26.909 --> 00:29:26.919 align:start position:0%
you know I just just from reading the
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
paper over the you know the years I know
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester has had a lot of
 
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
superintendence and um I'm not sure how
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
that how other communities do because
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
they they're not as heavily covered as
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester um with that I'd be glad to
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
answer any questions anyone may have uh
 
00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh Mr Carlin are
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
possible for the nhrs to um just look at
 
00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
the number of superintendents and
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
determine how many years or or group
 
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
them in terms of okay this many have
 
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
this many years within the system this
 
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
many have this many years within the
 
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:12.440 align:start position:0%
system so that even if we don't know
 
00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
whether vested or not uh we would have a
 
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
better idea of what we're looking at
 
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
here um I you know probably me well if
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
we would if this if the doe has a list
 
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
of their names you know we would have to
 
00:30:28.509 --> 00:30:28.519 align:start position:0%
manually look up their records to see
 
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
that but um you know and that that's I I
 
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
suppose it's possible it may take some
 
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
time for staff to to pull that but you
 
00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:38.039 align:start position:0%
know I believe this bill is prospective
 
00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't affect anybody currently
 
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
in the system it only be for future
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
folks and maybe the school
 
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.269 align:start position:0%
folks and maybe the school
administrators

00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
administrators
 
00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
Association has data like that I know
 
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
they didn't sign up to testify I I would
 
00:30:50.669 --> 00:30:50.679 align:start position:0%
probably reach out to them myself as
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
well if if I came away from the hearing
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
um you know with with that request from
 
00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
you just to see we how we can get us you
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
fastest thank you followup please yes
 
00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
rep and Le thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr Carlin for taking this other
 
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
question so correct me if I'm I'm wrong
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
on this but I think you were saying that
 
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
uh in one portion of the bill um it's
 
00:31:16.629 --> 00:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
basically stating that this is um the
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
decision has to be
 
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
made at the time of higher or
 
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
appointment correct and if so how then
 
00:31:26.669 --> 00:31:26.679 align:start position:0%
would that that last set of Provisions
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
lines one to seven on page two work
 
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
because there it has going back three
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
years um and and it states that um those
 
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
are contributions to have been made I
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
Believe by the district but the district
 
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
would not have hired that person would
 
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
not have made contributions prior the
 
00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
prior three years if they're just hiring
 
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
at this point that that U that that that
 
00:31:51.789 --> 00:31:51.799 align:start position:0%
puzzled us a bit as well I mean you know
 
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919 align:start position:0%
just sort of trying to play out
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
different scenarios if a you know an
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
assistant superintendent or a principal
 
00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
in the district was hired as
 
00:32:00.629 --> 00:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
superintendent that that's that's what
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
we see as a possibility I I we didn't
 
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
see it as um you know if you were the
 
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
superintendent in Portsmouth and you
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
went you know to conquered would give
 
00:32:12.629 --> 00:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
Portsmith money back to the individual
 
00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039 align:start position:0%
when they moved to conquered but you
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
know if it was somebody who was in The
 
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
District already is is the only way we
 
00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
would see that is working so your
 
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
understanding then is that that that
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
sort of look back is applicable only to
 
00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
funds uh contributed by the specific
 
00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:28.039 align:start position:0%
District that that's how we would see it
 
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much uh
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
representative Le and Mr Carin are there
 
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
further questions we have a question
 
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
from Ralph B representative
 
00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:42.519 align:start position:0%
bom represent thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking a question I see
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
one little problem here or maybe not
 
00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:50.120 align:start position:0%
maybe you can ask so if a
 
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
superintendent's contract runs out and
 
00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:55.240 align:start position:0%
being renewed so in the case of being
 
00:32:57.549 --> 00:32:57.559 align:start position:0%
renewed is it then a possibility ility
 
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
that that superintendent May opt into
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
this plan or but because he's already an
 
00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
employee would it not so good
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
yeah um the way we've always treated the
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
the provision as it exists currently for
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
municipal managers is you know initial
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
hiring or appointment and initial is
 
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
they weren't working in that position
 
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
and they were hired to do that job not
 
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
that they were
 
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.990 align:start position:0%
that they were
renewed

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
renewed
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
thank you um we're getting close to the
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
time frame we have for this hearing are
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%

00:33:37.149 --> 00:33:37.159 align:start position:0%
you need to get out or are they
 
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
something we could you know follow up
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
later or would the uh administrators
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%

House Bill 349 which is uh to repeal the
 
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
school nurse
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
certification um program
 
00:37:31.309 --> 00:37:31.319 align:start position:0%
this is uh a an original bill that came
 
00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
out in
 
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:37.720 align:start position:0%
2016 um very unusual circumstances uh
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
the original bill was heard in HHS and
 
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
had nothing to do with School
 
00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
nurses um It ultimately went through
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
house and into the Senate where it again
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
had no mention of School nurses and then
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
on the house floor I'm sorry on the
 
00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
senate floor
 
00:37:59.910 --> 00:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
um an amendment was added for the first
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
time it added a school nurse
 
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
certification um it was uh therefore
 
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
never passed with with no public hearing
 
00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.510 align:start position:0%
never passed with with no public hearing
whatsoever

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
um this has been a rush job all along
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
and uh and no one seems to be able to
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
tell me why the rush job but as with all
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
bills that we've seen that have no
 
00:38:27.069 --> 00:38:27.079 align:start position:0%
public scrutiny
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
um there were problems with it right
 
00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:31.720 align:start position:0%
from the start um one of the biggest
 
00:38:34.309 --> 00:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
problems was school budgets had uh no
 
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
time to correct for any increase in
 
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
wages um it also had problems with
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
existing School nurses not being sure
 
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
whether uh or how to do any continuing
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
education or whether they needed any
 
00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.670 align:start position:0%
education or whether they needed any
continuing

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
continuing
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
education um it was also a problem that
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
um that there was no Ru making Authority
 
00:39:05.069 --> 00:39:05.079 align:start position:0%
in the original bill so the doe had no
 
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
ability to create certificates of any
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
kind and you'll see if you go back in
 
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
the record that it had to they had to
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
wait a full year before they got all of
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
the doe rule making done for this in
 
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
order for um people to become
 
00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
compliant the key thing in this bill um
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
that I would take a look at is that um
 
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:35.720 align:start position:0%
from the very get-go um all of the
 
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
existing School nurses were Exempted
 
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
from this new
 
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
law I would take that to mean that um
 
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
that there is
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
no um emergency um there were no case
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
for um for need ever having been made um
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
there was no immediate danger to the
 
00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
public um or to school children that
 
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
indicated um there were no legal issues
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
that caused this change there were no
 
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:13.880 align:start position:0%
lawsuits there were no federal mandates
 
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
um nothing shows that our constituents
 
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
gain any benefit for what would
 
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly be higher costs and probably
 
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
U most important ly uh greater shortage
 
00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
of quality
 
00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
candidates um during that that hearing I
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
happened to sit next to a fellow that
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
was in the hiring business for School
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
nurses and he mentioned that he hadn't
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
seen a candidate for three years with
 
00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
that would have qualified under the
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
these new
 
00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:48.839 align:start position:0%
qualifications what happened was they
 
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
would be going from a um an associates
 
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:55.640 align:start position:0%
degree to a bachelor's degree plus three
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
years of pediatric nursing
 
00:41:02.349 --> 00:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
experience all of that seemed honorous
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
when my district was already telling me
 
00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:07.640 align:start position:0%
that they were having difficulty finding
 
00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:08.550 align:start position:0%
that they were having difficulty finding
School

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
School
 
00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
nurses um and I should tell you that
 
00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
School nurses are not a mandated item um
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
by the doe in New Hampshire um it's a
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
voluntary program so um the immediate
 
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
concern would be that uh that school
 
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
districts would just cross off School
 
00:41:31.829 --> 00:41:31.839 align:start position:0%
nurses from their list of needs and and
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
make it a want but uh but not fill the
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
position um one of the other things that
 
00:41:41.069 --> 00:41:41.079 align:start position:0%
we've seen lately is that School nurses
 
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sorry School departments have um
 
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
have circumvented this law and changed
 
00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
the name of the people that they are
 
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
hiring from school nurse um and they are
 
00:41:56.309 --> 00:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
calling them Health coordinators in some
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
cases to get around this uh this state
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
mandated uh requirement of hiring a
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree with three years of
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
pediat pediatric
 
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
experience we also heard in a prior uh
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
bill that um you know there are people I
 
00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
think uh anecdotally this was a
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
pediatrician that had uh 20 or 30 years
 
00:42:25.349 --> 00:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
as a as a pediatrician that was
 
00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
determined would not qualify as a school
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
nurse um she was looking for a
 
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
retirement job quote unquote and uh and
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
she didn't qualify under these
 
00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:38.599 align:start position:0%
requirements well that's just crazy as
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
far as I'm
 
00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
concerned finally um I would like to say
 
00:42:46.109 --> 00:42:46.119 align:start position:0%
that um I've never met a more competent
 
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
group of people than School nurses um or
 
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
that nurses in general um I believe uh
 
00:42:56.829 --> 00:42:56.839 align:start position:0%
anyone that calls themselves a nurse
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh could probably rebuild my car
 
00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
transmission and and run a hotel and
 
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
probably run Wall Street um these are
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
extremely competent people and um and to
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
say that someone needs a bachelor's
 
00:43:15.069 --> 00:43:15.079 align:start position:0%
degree and three years of pediatric
 
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
nursing to be a school nurse uh just
 
00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
flies on the face of of reality I think
 
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
um with that I will end my testimony I'm
 
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions but I'm sure
 
00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
there are people better better capable
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%

question isn't it true that whether or

not a a nurse has an associate degree or
 
00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
a bachelor's degree they still have to
 
00:43:54.549 --> 00:43:54.559 align:start position:0%
take the same Nationwide test to become
 
00:43:57.870 --> 00:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
a registered nurse
 
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:20.680 align:start position:0%

thank you resent Hill for taking my
 
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
question as we as we look at bills one
 
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
of the questions that I always have of
 
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of a bill is what is the
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill so could you
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
summarize the intent of this bill for us
 
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
please um thank you for your question
 
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
representative um it's an it's an
 
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
excellent one and and I wish more people
 
00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:55.640 align:start position:0%
asked that question um the intent for me
 
00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
is to um alleviate the uh the problem of
 
00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
our school districts um that have
 
00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
difficulty had difficulty already uh
 
00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
filling this position of school nurse um
 
00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
what we've done with this legislation is
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
make it harder to um to hire competent
 
00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
um School nurses and uh made it more
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
expensive for the taxpayer um and and
 
00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
finally with all of that um we haven't
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
made uh the position there there's been
 
00:45:35.069 --> 00:45:35.079 align:start position:0%
no need shown why we need to do these
 
00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
things and and I think that's important
 
00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
in any legislation uh to make sure that
 
00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
we're we're honoring uh the goal which
 
00:45:47.069 --> 00:45:47.079 align:start position:0%
was to make the public safer and that

00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
unity um I was a public high school
 
00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
teacher for 35 years at karge Regional

High School and worked very intimately
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
with our school nurse on uh teaching
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
health education and also as a former
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
EMT I worked with her on all the
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
different injuries that occur uh
 
00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
normally in a school
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
situation I'm uh very distressed by this
 
00:48:10.549 --> 00:48:10.559 align:start position:0%
this bill which seems to be coming up I
 
00:48:12.549 --> 00:48:12.559 align:start position:0%
guess groundhog days a good day for it
 
00:48:16.109 --> 00:48:16.119 align:start position:0%
to come up um the I'd like to address a
 
00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
couple of issues that uh representative
 
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
Hill brought up one is uh that he sees
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
no need for uh specialists in this
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
particular field and that um pediatric
 
00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
experience is necessary uh through this
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
law it also has a point for related
 
00:48:36.309 --> 00:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
experience so it isn't um strictly
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
pediatric U experience that's needed uh
 
00:48:42.109 --> 00:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
for many students entering our schools
 
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
today uh they're dealing with serious
 
00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:48.200 align:start position:0%
injuries uh and serious issues plus
 
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
covid um and chronic uh complex chronic
 
00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:55.640 align:start position:0%
medical conditions like diabetes asthma
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
depression abuse and neglect
 
00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
homelessness food insecurity sexual
 
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
assault substance abuse and violence the
 
00:49:06.549 --> 00:49:06.559 align:start position:0%
school nurse is the lifeline and the
 
00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
main reason the many of these students
 
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
can continue to attend
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
school the health of the student and
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
staff in the entire building or School
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
District can be significantly affected
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
by the actions of the school nurse it
 
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
seems like under covid this would even
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
be uh more critical and when a nurse um
 
00:49:30.109 --> 00:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
receives the uh Registered Nursing
 
00:49:32.789 --> 00:49:32.799 align:start position:0%
certification after that most of them go
 
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
on to different Specialties um and
 
00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:38.799 align:start position:0%
nursing in a school situation you're by
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
yourself for the most part um you're
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
confronting all these different issues
 
00:49:46.589 --> 00:49:46.599 align:start position:0%
and you're dealing with either young
 
00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
children or even worse teenagers um so
 
00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
that they uh have to balance a lot of
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
plates up in the air they have to
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
balance uh State education laws uh
 
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
concussion protocols the use of
 
00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
epipens uh the use of Bronco dilators um
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
oxygen and
 
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
nebulizers uh emergency response
 
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
procedures and then they have to balance
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
that with federal laws the Hippa furpa
 
00:50:18.789 --> 00:50:18.799 align:start position:0%
504 Ida they're actually uh School
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
nurses are listed under the
 
00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
SSA um they have to also be aware of
 
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
Public Health laws that affect um
 
00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
schools with monitoring vaccinations and
 
00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
covid um communicable disease outbreaks
 
00:50:38.349 --> 00:50:38.359 align:start position:0%
in school uh rep reporting laws for
 
00:50:41.309 --> 00:50:41.319 align:start position:0%
abuse neglects uh universal precautions
 
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:43.720 align:start position:0%
training and screening programs many of
 
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
those things would not be something that
 
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
an RN would know right out of um school
 
00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
and so this the school nurse um is
 
00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
really important and in many of our too
 
00:50:58.589 --> 00:50:58.599 align:start position:0%
many of our schools don't have a school
 
00:51:01.549 --> 00:51:01.559 align:start position:0%
nurse in the uh laws there's actually a
 
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
way that um a person with three years of
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
experience related experience can
 
00:51:09.789 --> 00:51:09.799 align:start position:0%
actually get certified uh through a
 
00:51:12.349 --> 00:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
program of mentoring and continuing ed
 
00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
credits so that's not a problem and I
 
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
think you'll find out from uh Paula and
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
Carla who are going to speak that School
 
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
nurses are not a shortage uh nurses in
 
00:51:26.349 --> 00:51:26.359 align:start position:0%
general are a shortage but often uh
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
School nursing positions are are high on
 
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
the list because people who are nurses
 
00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
like the fact that if they have a family
 
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
they're working the school hours and the
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
school year um I'd also like to address
 
00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
another issue that was brought up and
 
00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
that is in this bill is that it also uh
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
addresses the position of the school
 
00:51:51.309 --> 00:51:51.319 align:start position:0%
nurse coordinator in the Department of
 
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
Education um I worked very hard in 2018
 
00:51:58.270 --> 00:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
uh along with poly campan who was
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative in health and human
 
00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
services at the time to reinstate a
 
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
position in the department of education
 
00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:07.240 align:start position:0%
for a school nurse
 
00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
coordinator um the position was
 
00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
originally established in
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
1919 and was funded through various
 
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
funds and federal funds but in 2010 when
 
00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
we had the last austerity uh drive this
 
00:52:24.589 --> 00:52:24.599 align:start position:0%
was not funded and remained vacant until
 
00:52:24.599 --> 00:52:26.230 align:start position:0%
was not funded and remained vacant until
2015

00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
2015
 
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
at that time the commissioner
 
00:52:29.309 --> 00:52:29.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner Barry secured funding
 
00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
through a grant to reestablish the
 
00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
position and the Substance Abuse and
 
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Grant samama ended in
 
00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
September of 2017 and the position
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
became vacant again um this made New
 
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one of nine states only nine
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
states in the Northeast with no Central
 
00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:49.559 align:start position:0%
qualified person to give guidance and
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
direction to School nurses or School
 
00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
Personnel who are not qualified who who
 
00:52:57.789 --> 00:52:57.799 align:start position:0%
work in that area who are forced to deal
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
with these issues responsible for school
 
00:53:02.789 --> 00:53:02.799 align:start position:0%
health leaving few places to find
 
00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:05.480 align:start position:0%
answers for questions um all kinds of
 
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
questions on these laws and and
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
different things that are happening to
 
00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
students in school so um that position
 
00:53:16.109 --> 00:53:16.119 align:start position:0%
still is vacant uh it has been unfilled
 
00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:17.480 align:start position:0%
even though there have been applicants
 
00:53:20.829 --> 00:53:20.839 align:start position:0%
for that position and and um I find that
 
00:53:23.789 --> 00:53:23.799 align:start position:0%
uh very distressing particularly again
 
00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
with the epidemic that we had have and
 
00:53:29.549 --> 00:53:29.559 align:start position:0%
the and the um communicable disease
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
problem we have in schools today so um I
 
00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:36.839 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose this bill um I think the
 
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
situation um this is a bill that is just
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
um spirited towards uh reducing cost to
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
schools uh at the expense of students
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
and staff so with that I'll take any
 
00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much

00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
yourself got
 
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:13.960 align:start position:0%
it I'm curious as to what a teacher a
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
stu a nurse learns in those two years of
 
00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
college which are
 
00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:21.220 align:start position:0%
college which are
often

00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:21.230 align:start position:0%
often
 
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:22.630 align:start position:0%
often

[Music]
 
00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
um writing and
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
Humanities and other things for those
 
00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
additional two years what she learns
 
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to give her that information
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
of all those things that you listed and
 
00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
what difference there's going to be five
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
years down the road
 
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
between um a teacher who has the RN you
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
know the four years and the teacher who
 
00:54:50.829 --> 00:54:50.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
experience well I think um you know this
 
00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
is kind of uh a question of you know
 
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
what does a doctor learn in the four
 
00:55:03.069 --> 00:55:03.079 align:start position:0%
years that they take after they take a
 
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
general uh Bachelor of Arts degree uh
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
you know nursing is is a a specialty
 
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
it's um I I don't know about you but
 
00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
when I'm in a hospital situation and a
 
00:55:16.789 --> 00:55:16.799 align:start position:0%
nurse comes in the room I don't want
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
just uh jeie Smith off the off the
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
sidewalk that's maybe taken two years at
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
a community college uh with um basic uh
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
education and I have something that's
 
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
that's very technical um I think that um
 
00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
you know certification for certain
 
00:55:41.029 --> 00:55:41.039 align:start position:0%
things indicate a level of expertise and
 
00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:43.880 align:start position:0%
education and that is acquired in in
 
00:55:46.589 --> 00:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
those two years between
 
00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
um an LNA or a nurses assistant and a a
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
registered nurse and and as I said
 
00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
before many registered nurses go on to
 
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
Specialties uh a nurse that works in a
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
surgical ward has a or an ICU H has had
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
experience and training in that
 
00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
particular aspect of medic medicine and
 
00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh School nursing is no different thank
 
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
you very much uh representa Tanner H are
 
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
there any other questions we do have uh
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
some other folks in the queue here to
 
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
speak we have uh an individual from New
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire School Nurses Association the
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire nursing association uh
 
00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:31.640 align:start position:0%
school boards Association we had
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
technical support from the Department um
 
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
are I see repon Hopson yeah I had a
 
00:56:43.470 --> 00:56:43.480 align:start position:0%
question um so uh oh yeah I'm unmuted
 
00:56:48.029 --> 00:56:48.039 align:start position:0%
the um covid has really shown that
 
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
nurses are um are needed in New
 
00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:55.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um I was wondering if
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
it it seems like we're making it more
 
00:57:02.190 --> 00:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
difficult to get nurses into positions
 
00:57:05.829 --> 00:57:05.839 align:start position:0%
and at at UNH or at the other nursing
 
00:57:08.349 --> 00:57:08.359 align:start position:0%
schools they're required to do an
 
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
internship so that gives them experience
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
in the job um would that not be
 
00:57:19.630 --> 00:57:19.640 align:start position:0%
helpful I assume that question is for me
 
00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
and um yes you know just like an
 
00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
internship in in any particular field
 
00:57:29.029 --> 00:57:29.039 align:start position:0%
whether it's plumber or Carpenter um or
 
00:57:32.349 --> 00:57:32.359 align:start position:0%
teacher or nurse uh internships are very
 
00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
relevant to the experience but uh a
 
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
nurse who who has just come out of
 
00:57:41.309 --> 00:57:41.319 align:start position:0%
nursing school goes is accepted at a
 
00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:43.160 align:start position:0%
hospital Ashley goes through another
 
00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:45.160 align:start position:0%
training program and usually that
 
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
training program is anywhere from six
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
months to a year just for a floor nurse
 
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
um and that's not a nurse that's in a
 
00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
specialty I mean when I was when I was
 
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
teaching and working with the nurse you
 
00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
know we we had incidents obviously
 
00:58:02.309 --> 00:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
broken arms and things like that that's
 
00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
kind of typical that that happens in a
 
00:58:07.470 --> 00:58:07.480 align:start position:0%
school cure Sarge it was eight minutes
 
00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
um for an ambulance to arrive from New
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
London Hospital we actually had a staff
 
00:58:16.029 --> 00:58:16.039 align:start position:0%
member have a um fatal heart attack um
 
00:58:18.589 --> 00:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
but we were able to keep him sustained
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
until he got to the hospital uh we had
 
00:58:26.549 --> 00:58:26.559 align:start position:0%
some some terrific injuries uh um that
 
00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
you know it was um through training and
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
experience that we were able to handle
 
00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:33.880 align:start position:0%
them but other than that the school
 
00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:37.160 align:start position:0%
nurse has as I said um you know issues
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
of homelessness and food insecurity
 
00:58:41.309 --> 00:58:41.319 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with a lot of public
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
health issues they're dealing with laws
 
00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
from uh not only School law but federal
 
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
law and and healthc Care law so it's
 
00:58:54.029 --> 00:58:54.039 align:start position:0%
it's um much more complex than as I
 
00:58:55.470 --> 00:58:55.480 align:start position:0%
think some people people think it's
 
00:58:59.029 --> 00:58:59.039 align:start position:0%
putting Band-Aids on little kids uh boo
 
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:02.799 align:start position:0%
boos thank you uh further questions of
 
00:59:02.799 --> 00:59:04.990 align:start position:0%
boos thank you uh further questions of
represent

00:59:04.990 --> 00:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:59:09.069 --> 00:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
taner U before you move on um we have
 
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
Drew kleene and I'm not sure he's in the
 
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
attendees and I'm not sure if he signed
 
00:59:17.069 --> 00:59:17.079 align:start position:0%
up to speak um or what what his role
 
00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:19.640 align:start position:0%
might be uh yes I'm I'm aware of that we
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
have two other folks that have signed up
 
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
previously we're gonna take them first
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
and as I mentioned the school board will
 
00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
come in following the two nursing
 
00:59:30.789 --> 00:59:30.799 align:start position:0%
associations okay I believe we have uh
 
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
both speakers ready to speak in the
 
00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:39.870 align:start position:0%

McKinnon thank you representatives for
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak before you today I
 
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
want to start out by saying um I'm
 
00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
confused by uh Representatives Hill's
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
comments that the original certification
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
Bill had nothing to to do with School
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
nurses uh quite the opposite it it was a
 
01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:00.760 align:start position:0%
work in progress since
 
01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:03.400 align:start position:0%
2014 uh between commissioner Barry and
 
01:00:05.789 --> 01:00:05.799 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire uh School Nurses
 
01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
Association and in 2016 it definitely
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
was a bill for School nurses it was not
 
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
a rush job um there as all other bills
 
01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:19.559 align:start position:0%
was plenty of time for anyone to
 
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
research or testify just as the very
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
short notice that we got to come here
 
01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
today to speak with you um it was no
 
01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
different back in
 
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
2016 I I'd like to give you a very brief
 
01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
synopsis of the history of the bill so
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
that you all can understand where the
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
Nurses Association might be coming from
 
01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
in 1919 to 1947 New Hampshire's first
 
01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
school nurse was Elizabeth merphy and
 
01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
she worked for the city of conquer and
 
01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
became the director of school health
 
01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
services in the department Department of
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
Education for 23 years running from 1919
 
01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.349 align:start position:0%
Education for 23 years running from 1919
to

01:01:00.349 --> 01:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
1947 in 1947 the New Hampshire Board of
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
Education voted unanimously that School
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
nurses who care for children's health in
 
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
the public schools are teachers of
 
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
Public Health and are eligible eligible
 
01:01:15.309 --> 01:01:15.319 align:start position:0%
to join the State teachers retirement
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
system so we joined the retirement
 
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
system in 47 somewhere in the 40s or 50s
 
01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:23.720 align:start position:0%
School nurses were included in the
 
01:01:25.789 --> 01:01:25.799 align:start position:0%
department of educ ation certification
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
system and the rules at that time is
 
01:01:29.829 --> 01:01:29.839 align:start position:0%
that they had to have 30 hours of
 
01:01:33.549 --> 01:01:33.559 align:start position:0%
continuing education above their diploma
 
01:01:36.029 --> 01:01:36.039 align:start position:0%
um in years back most of your nurses
 
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
were diploma nurses meaning it was a
 
01:01:39.549 --> 01:01:39.559 align:start position:0%
hospital that trained
 
01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
them we could not find in the history
 
01:01:44.029 --> 01:01:44.039 align:start position:0%
and it was very unclear when this
 
01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
certification was repealed but we do
 
01:01:48.349 --> 01:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
know that in
 
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
1971 a certification was again
 
01:01:55.630 --> 01:01:55.640 align:start position:0%
legislated for School nurses in 19 75
 
01:01:59.269 --> 01:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
certification was repealed during the uh
 
01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
massive teacher strike in New Hampshire
 
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
and the nurse could no longer be in the
 
01:02:06.269 --> 01:02:06.279 align:start position:0%
teachers contract during those
 
01:02:09.390 --> 01:02:09.400 align:start position:0%
negotiations during the strike in
 
01:02:12.349 --> 01:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
1989 Barbara Ward who was the president
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
of our association filed a brief on
 
01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
behalf of our association documenting
 
01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
the legal and professional basis for the
 
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
role of the school nurse this went to
 
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court and it was ruled at
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
School nurses could now be a part of the
 
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
teachers bargaining
 
01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:32.559 align:start position:0%
Union so then we fast forward to
 
01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:36.799 align:start position:0%
2016 the certification law was passed uh
 
01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
that uh is the first time that you'll
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
see that this present certification was
 
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
passed in
 
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
2018 a bill was presented to uh repeal
 
01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:52.279 align:start position:0%
it uh it was defeated in
 
01:02:56.269 --> 01:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
2019 a uh it was again a bill to defeat
 
01:02:57.549 --> 01:02:57.559 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
presented um that was voted
 
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
down however the current bill was
 
01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
amended and it increased the length of
 
01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
grandfathering that a nurse could um
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
have more time to get into her
 
01:03:16.029 --> 01:03:16.039 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree uh at the same time in
 
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:18.559 align:start position:0%
2019 it was legislated that a school
 
01:03:21.269 --> 01:03:21.279 align:start position:0%
nurse coordinator position uh would be
 
01:03:24.069 --> 01:03:24.079 align:start position:0%
funded through legislation so where does
 
01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:25.880 align:start position:0%
that bring us
 
01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
now well it's it's uh where are we now
 
01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:30.559 align:start position:0%
School nurses have shown their
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
contributions again and again as an
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
extension of Public Health and the most
 
01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
obvious uh example of that is the work
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
that we've done uh during the
 
01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
pandemic where are we now the school
 
01:03:45.269 --> 01:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
nurse coordinator position has still not
 
01:03:47.789 --> 01:03:47.799 align:start position:0%
been filled by commissioner edel blut we
 
01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:49.640 align:start position:0%
do not know why there have been
 
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
interviews uh but there's been no action
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
taken on that and again someone made the
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
very uh valid point that the school
 
01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
nurse Coordinator would not just answer
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
questions and uh for School nurses they
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
would be advising school districts that
 
01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
don't have school nurses uh to be able
 
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
to help them to develop health programs
 
01:04:14.109 --> 01:04:14.119 align:start position:0%
within their school so I first I want to
 
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
dispel some myths that have come up time
 
01:04:19.309 --> 01:04:19.319 align:start position:0%
and again because um and these have all
 
01:04:21.069 --> 01:04:21.079 align:start position:0%
been stated at past hearings when
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
there's have been attempts to repeal
 
01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:25.799 align:start position:0%
certification we hear again and again
 
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
that Manchester and other school
 
01:04:30.309 --> 01:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
districts have difficulty hiring BSN
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
nurses the fact is that Manchester is
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
not even under this law Manchester hires
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
Public Health nurses and as such Public
 
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
Health nurses are exempt from
 
01:04:42.910 --> 01:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
certification because they're not paid
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
by the school district um the same is
 
01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
true of spear Memorial Hospital and
 
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
Huggins hospital as well as any travel
 
01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:53.480 align:start position:0%
agencies that Supply nurses to school um
 
01:04:55.870 --> 01:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
this certification law does not apply to
 
01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
them a second myth is to keep registered
 
01:05:02.029 --> 01:05:02.039 align:start position:0%
nurses license the nurse must complete
 
01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh or to keep the certification license
 
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
it's a burden to um get more hours in
 
01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
order to keep their
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
certification here's the truth okay a
 
01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
every nurse in New Hampshire must
 
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
complete 30 hours every two years to
 
01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
keep their board of nursing license the
 
01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:23.720 align:start position:0%
45 hours every 3 years that the DOE
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
certif ification requires is not an
 
01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
added burden because it is the exact
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
same hours the hours can be counted
 
01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
during both so if you break it down by
 
01:05:37.549 --> 01:05:37.559 align:start position:0%
year the Board of Nursing requires 15
 
01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
hours per year and certification
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
requires 15 hours per year they can be
 
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
the same hours submitted to both
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
organizations there are zero additional
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
hours that a school nurse would have to
 
01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
put in there is no burden anywhere uh to
 
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
the school nurses on
 
01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
that and the third myth that keeps being
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
repeated that schools have trouble
 
01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
filling school nurse jobs because um
 
01:06:09.069 --> 01:06:09.079 align:start position:0%
because the BSN nurses don't want the
 
01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:11.839 align:start position:0%
job the fact is that schools have
 
01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
trouble filling the school nurse jobs
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
with BSN nurses because they don't pay
 
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
them well enough even though we're
 
01:06:20.589 --> 01:06:20.599 align:start position:0%
allowed to be in the teachers union
 
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
we're treated separately many school
 
01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
districts pay them less
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
the school districts that don't pay them
 
01:06:28.029 --> 01:06:28.039 align:start position:0%
less and have had them on teacher
 
01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
contract at full te teacher pay for
 
01:06:33.069 --> 01:06:33.079 align:start position:0%
years have seen no difference in in
 
01:06:33.079 --> 01:06:34.069 align:start position:0%
years have seen no difference in in
hiring

01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
hiring
 
01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
nurses um I would also like to give you
 
01:06:39.789 --> 01:06:39.799 align:start position:0%
a few stats on Who currently is
 
01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
certified um in the state of New
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there are 568 School nurses
 
01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
presently in the uh certification
 
01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
system there are three levels of school
 
01:06:55.870 --> 01:06:55.880 align:start position:0%
nursing certification school nurse one
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
are nurses who are currently enrolled in
 
01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
an RN BSN degree there are 22 nurses
 
01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:05.839 align:start position:0%
that fit that category so there are 22
 
01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
nurses in the state of New Hampshire who
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
are currently working toward their BSN
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
school nurse 2 is everyone who was
 
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
grandfathered when the law first was
 
01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
enacted they were grandfathered because
 
01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to put an extra burden on
 
01:07:23.069 --> 01:07:23.079 align:start position:0%
these nurses we wanted to look ahead we
 
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
want to move forward forward we don't
 
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
want to look at our present Workforce
 
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
and make things harder for them we're
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
looking to the Future and making a plan
 
01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
for the future the school nurse 2
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
category presently has
 
01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
366 um and those School nurses
 
01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:41.720 align:start position:0%
regardless of their degree we still have
 
01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
some diploma nurses working in the state
 
01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire uh we have Associates
 
01:07:49.230 --> 01:07:49.240 align:start position:0%
nurses but many of those could also be
 
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
BSN nurses at the time that
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
certification was first enacted there
 
01:07:56.109 --> 01:07:56.119 align:start position:0%
were was no fee to become a school nurse
 
01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
too so many of our BSN nurses opted to
 
01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
go with a two the school nurse two so
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't have to pay the
 
01:08:06.789 --> 01:08:06.799 align:start position:0%
higher fee for school nurse 3 now we
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
come to school nurse 3 there are
 
01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:13.160 align:start position:0%
presently 180 School nurses that are uh
 
01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
certified under the school nurse 3 this
 
01:08:18.749 --> 01:08:18.759 align:start position:0%
means that at the time if they hire they
 
01:08:21.789 --> 01:08:21.799 align:start position:0%
either already had a BSN or they
 
01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
completed their BSN after after they had
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
applied for certification certification
 
01:08:30.030 --> 01:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
is a three-year cycle we are coming up
 
01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
on year three and there's many School
 
01:08:33.630 --> 01:08:33.640 align:start position:0%
nurses that are going to shift out of
 
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
school nurse 2 into school nurse 3
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
simply because they already had their
 
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
BSN but they chose to go for the option
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
of school nurse too because there was no
 
01:08:45.309 --> 01:08:45.319 align:start position:0%
fee attached to it
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's coming up
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
soon do our nurses support it we hear uh
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh complaints that there are nurses out
 
01:08:59.149 --> 01:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
there that don't support it well we've
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
got some solid facts for you uh there
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
were two different recent meetings held
 
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
one of them was with 240 New Hampshire
 
01:09:09.550 --> 01:09:09.560 align:start position:0%
nurses not necessarily School nurses but
 
01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire nurses the certification
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
bill was talked about and presented and
 
01:09:17.550 --> 01:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
89% of the nurses present voted to
 
01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
support school nurse
 
01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
certification the second is a poll that
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
our association took of its school nurse
 
01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:29.960 align:start position:0%
membership uh we had 178 School nurses
 
01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.510 align:start position:0%
membership uh we had 178 School nurses
respond

01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
respond
 
01:09:34.669 --> 01:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
36 did want certification to be uh
 
01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
repealed which represented 25% and 142
 
01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
voted to keep uh certification so 75% of
 
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
the school nurses voted to keep the
 
01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
certification why did they vote to keep
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
it the feedback that we got uh this is
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
coming directly from one nurse the the
 
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
nurses of my sa were able to advocate
 
01:09:58.229 --> 01:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
for placement on the bachelor's uh pay
 
01:10:01.229 --> 01:10:01.239 align:start position:0%
scale for those of us who were State
 
01:10:03.630 --> 01:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
Certified another nurse said state
 
01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
certification gave us a foundation to
 
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
Advocate as a professional practice
 
01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
through Union negotiations for our new
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
contract this year another said
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
certification requirements have helped
 
01:10:16.350 --> 01:10:16.360 align:start position:0%
the principles understand better how to
 
01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
hire new School nurses in our district
 
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
Paul Paul excuse me for a second um
 
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
we're going on uh upwards towards uh 15
 
01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
minutes uh oh I apologize yeah we have
 
01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
you have a fellow nurse waiting to speak
 
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
and then we have the school board also
 
01:10:35.550 --> 01:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
so uh can you try to conclude it sure I
 
01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
I will conclude it by saying that we are
 
01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
tired of having to uh continually come
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
before the legislature to defend our
 
01:10:46.669 --> 01:10:46.679 align:start position:0%
professionalism uh and we hope that here
 
01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
today we can put an end to that and make
 
01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
a strong statement that School nurses
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
are where they belong thank you thank
 
01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
you very much for testimony other
 
01:10:57.189 --> 01:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
questions of of Paul McKinnon yes
 
01:10:57.199 --> 01:11:01.630 align:start position:0%
questions of of Paul McKinnon yes
represented

01:11:01.630 --> 01:11:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:04.189 --> 01:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
likeus un
 
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
muted got it took a bit um I'm gonna ask
 
01:11:12.149 --> 01:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
you the same question what is the
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
difference in training between a
 
01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
two-year nurse and a four-year nurse
 
01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
given that both have to pass the same
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
test that's well I have two questions
 
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
but that's my first one yes it it it is
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
actually very different and I believe
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
that one of our members has submitted
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
testim written testimony to that regard
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
the uh extra schooling for a master's in
 
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
education is very different than for a
 
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh bachelor's and nursing public health
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
is a big part of it statistics is a big
 
01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
part of it how to navigate the bigger
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
picture is very much a part of
 
01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
it thank you and you have a followup yes
 
01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
please um
 
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
I notice it says a school nurse shall be
 
01:11:59.950 --> 01:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
a registered nurse currently licensed in
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which means um I'm
 
01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
wondering wouldn't a two-year nurse who
 
01:12:11.709 --> 01:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
did the 30 hours and all that other
 
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
stuff also you know fit that
 
01:12:17.790 --> 01:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
qualification an Associates nurse has
 
01:12:21.229 --> 01:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
until a certain point to be able to
 
01:12:24.629 --> 01:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
apply for certification and then have
 
01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
six years to complete a bachelor's so a
 
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree from Associates nurse
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
to to a bachelor's degree spread out
 
01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
over six years we feel is not an undue
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
burden in fact it's quite generous
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
length of time to give them that a
 
01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
length of time to get it uh no we're not
 
01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
gon to allow any follow-ups to that
 
01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to go on are there further
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
questions repres Miler thank you Mr
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%

01:12:57.550 --> 01:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
568 uh School nurses in the state and we
 
01:13:02.990 --> 01:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
have heard under previous testimony that
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to hire uh teach nurses
 
01:13:09.310 --> 01:13:09.320 align:start position:0%
under this particular law can you tell
 
01:13:11.709 --> 01:13:11.719 align:start position:0%
the committee how many vacancies are
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
currently in schools uh regarding School
 
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
nurses vacancies yes we researched that
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
right before coming on and we could only
 
01:13:22.990 --> 01:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
find three uh that currently have
 
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.310 align:start position:0%
find three uh that currently have
vacancy

01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
vacancy
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh one of them being Manchester who
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
clearly states in their ad that they do
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
not have to be certified so of the of
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
the 568 there are only two vacancies to
 
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
your knowledge at this point in time to
 
01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%

for your time uh in committee this uh
 
01:13:55.709 --> 01:13:55.719 align:start position:0%
this morning um uh I want to sort of get
 
01:13:59.910 --> 01:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
at um I I I think something similar to
 
01:14:01.950 --> 01:14:01.960 align:start position:0%
to some of the other questions with
 
01:14:03.550 --> 01:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
regards to you know what's the
 
01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
difference between you know a two-year
 
01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
and a four-year degree with respect to
 
01:14:12.390 --> 01:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
um toh to professional nurses and um and
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
I guess what I what I'd like to like it
 
01:14:17.950 --> 01:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
if you could talk with us about a little
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
bit is um is is like the management and
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
Leadership of a um of a nursing staff in
 
01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
a let's say a hospital environment
 
01:14:31.709 --> 01:14:31.719 align:start position:0%
compared to that in a in a school
 
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
set I could I defer that question to
 
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
Carla Smith who is an educator uh uh and
 
01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
teaches at that level she yeah I'm I'm
 
01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
happy with that as long as the chair
 
01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
will allow me to ask that question again
 
01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
when um when when Miss myth speaks well
 
01:14:51.870 --> 01:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
I I think uh she's listening and I I see
 
01:14:54.669 --> 01:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
her smiling so yeah I I'm sure she'll
 
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
answer your question if she doesn't I'll
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
recognize you again represent luno okay
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh so with that let's go on to
 
01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
um uh uh nurse Smith uh who's recognized
 
01:15:10.910 --> 01:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
and you you are from the New Hampshire's
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh nursing association is that correct
 
01:15:15.229 --> 01:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
yes I'm here representing New Hampshire
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
Nurses Association today so we are a
 
01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
Statewide organization that um
 
01:15:23.669 --> 01:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
represents nurses across all specialties
 
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
in turn I also do serve um with the New
 
01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school Nurses Association with
 
01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
Paula McKinnon so I can really speak to
 
01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
those areas of questions that you had
 
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
been asking of her um I'd like to start
 
01:15:36.189 --> 01:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
just to tell you a little about my
 
01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
background so I have been a nurse for 18
 
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
years a registered nurse in the state of
 
01:15:43.229 --> 01:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I actually started my
 
01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
profession as an associate degree nurse
 
01:15:48.990 --> 01:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
and the big key takeaway here is you
 
01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
don't know what you don't know um and
 
01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
it's very enlightening when you return
 
01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
to school as an adult and you get your
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
BSN degree the difference in educational
 
01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
preparation um from that student growth
 
01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
perspective is enormous um I have worked
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
at Portsmouth Regional Hospital in their
 
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
cardiac Telemetry unit in their ICU I
 
01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
spent eight years in their emergency
 
01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
department before I became a school
 
01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
nurse when I became a school nurse for
 
01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:20.470 align:start position:0%
nurse when I became a school nurse for
SAU

01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
SAU
 
01:16:24.270 --> 01:16:24.280 align:start position:0%
883 I was on an island all by myself
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
with an associates degree even though I
 
01:16:30.270 --> 01:16:30.280 align:start position:0%
had solid nursing knowledge experience
 
01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:31.430 align:start position:0%
had solid nursing knowledge experience
and

01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:33.709 --> 01:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
background I knew nothing about the
 
01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
educational world I never even heard of
 
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
a 504 plan an
 
01:16:41.709 --> 01:16:41.719 align:start position:0%
IEP working with team members who didn't
 
01:16:43.870 --> 01:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
include other nurses it was a very
 
01:16:46.189 --> 01:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
foreign environment to me that's when I
 
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
was inspired to go back to school not
 
01:16:49.550 --> 01:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
only did I get my bachelor's degree but
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
I got a master's I spent five years in
 
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
my district I loved every moment of it
 
01:16:56.590 --> 01:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
and I decided to pursue higher education
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
I am now a professor of nursing at mcphs
 
01:17:02.189 --> 01:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
University in Manchester and I teach in
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
a BSN program so I feel I can very well
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
articulate to you what the differences
 
01:17:10.229 --> 01:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
are between these education platforms um
 
01:17:12.510 --> 01:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
prior to taking on that role I did work
 
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
um at St Joseph's School of Nursing in
 
01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
Nashville which is an associates degree
 
01:17:18.629 --> 01:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
program so I've experienced teaching at
 
01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
both levels I can tell you I have
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
graduated fantastic new Nur nures from
 
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
both programs but that's at entry level
 
01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
nursing entry level is what you need to
 
01:17:30.629 --> 01:17:30.639 align:start position:0%
sit and take the
 
01:17:34.830 --> 01:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
enlex the BSN nurse is prepared above
 
01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
and beyond the ASN nurse especially for
 
01:17:40.830 --> 01:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
those roles where they have to work
 
01:17:42.910 --> 01:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
independently I actually pulled some
 
01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
statistics from and I used UNH um unh's
 
01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
nursing curriculum and I use the
 
01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
curriculum from the New Hampshire
 
01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
Community College on HTI to give you a
 
01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
better understanding and I thought by
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
using a state level platform it'd be a
 
01:17:59.229 --> 01:17:59.239 align:start position:0%
little more applicable um than just the
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
the two schools that I have um taught at
 
01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:03.470 align:start position:0%
the two schools that I have um taught at
at

01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
UNH you need 133 credits to obtain a
 
01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree in nursing 70 of those
 
01:18:13.390 --> 01:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
credits are nursing specific meaning
 
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
they are dedicated n are only given to
 
01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
nursing courses this is not A&amp;P this is
 
01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
not lifespan this is not microbiology
 
01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
because those applied to multiple
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
degrees nursing specific is 70 credits
 
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
in comparison an associates degree at
 
01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
nhti you need 71 total credits to
 
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
graduate with an associates degree only
 
01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
21 of those are dedicated specific to
 
01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
nursing so the difference in education
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
is not liberal arts based it is not
 
01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
additional writing classes Humanities
 
01:18:53.310 --> 01:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
classes it is a significant difference
 
01:18:58.430 --> 01:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
of 49 credits in specific handson
 
01:19:01.229 --> 01:19:01.239 align:start position:0%
nursing curriculum I I think that in
 
01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
itself is just a profound difference um
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
to speak to that some of the differences
 
01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
in the coursework that you will see is
 
01:19:11.470 --> 01:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
pediatric specific content and
 
01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics spans a it's a lifespan it
 
01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
goes from the newborn up to age
 
01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
21 in a school district we give early
 
01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:21.400 align:start position:0%
intervention services to Children
 
01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
starting at age three up through age 21
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
so we're really capturing that
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
population my particular course I taught
 
01:19:30.669 --> 01:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
over the summer was nine credit units
 
01:19:33.390 --> 01:19:33.400 align:start position:0%
dedicated to that population including
 
01:19:35.310 --> 01:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
clinical placement in
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
labs in the associate degree program
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
that I taught my students got one day
 
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
one single day that they were allowed to
 
01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
go out into the community to work with a
 
01:19:48.270 --> 01:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
school nurse or a wick program and they
 
01:19:51.189 --> 01:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
spent two days on a labor and delivery
 
01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
unit they had a handful of one-hour
 
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
lectures that is a vast difference from
 
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
a nine credit load okay um specific to
 
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics in turn the other difference
 
01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
is public health
 
01:20:08.990 --> 01:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
nursing school nursing is a subsp
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
specialty of Public Health it is
 
01:20:13.070 --> 01:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
recognized that at the national level
 
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
because we don't just care for the
 
01:20:16.030 --> 01:20:16.040 align:start position:0%
student that's in front of us but you
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
care for the entire Community the
 
01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
community within the school building and
 
01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
the community beyond the school building
 
01:20:24.270 --> 01:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
that extends into a home and you arrange
 
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
for services and yes we do a lot with
 
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
homelessness food insecurity um social
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
emotional Wellness that is not just for
 
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
your school counselors School nurses see
 
01:20:36.669 --> 01:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
that on a day-to-day
 
01:20:38.830 --> 01:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
basis we have children that come into
 
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
manifestations they're not they come in
 
01:20:47.709 --> 01:20:47.719 align:start position:0%
with that physical
 
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
manifestation for Mental Health Services
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
mental health curriculum we have three
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
dedicated credit hours to a mental
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
health course that includes practicum
 
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
experience our students go to Hamstead
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
hospital and work in the children's
 
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
units there they go to the New Hampshire
 
01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:05.870 align:start position:0%
units there they go to the New Hampshire
State

01:21:05.870 --> 01:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
State
 
01:21:08.669 --> 01:21:08.679 align:start position:0%
Hospital okay they have actual Hands-On
 
01:21:12.430 --> 01:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
practicum experience with mental
 
01:21:14.830 --> 01:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
health they go out into the communities
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
as part of that public health
 
01:21:19.189 --> 01:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
curriculum they will spend an entire
 
01:21:21.629 --> 01:21:21.639 align:start position:0%
semester in a school nurse's
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
office that's one to two days per week
 
01:21:28.270 --> 01:21:28.280 align:start position:0%
times 15 weeks versus one day in
 
01:21:31.229 --> 01:21:31.239 align:start position:0%
isolation so the difference in schooling
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
and preparation I it it's really a night
 
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
and day difference the best comparison I
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
can give it to you is your difference
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
between your par Educators and your
 
01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:40.709 align:start position:0%
between your par Educators and your
licensed

01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:40.719 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
teachers there are wonderful parent
 
01:21:45.070 --> 01:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
Educators in our school systems that are
 
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
dedicated to their students who are
 
01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:47.870 align:start position:0%
dedicated to their students who are
highly

01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
highly
 
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
professional but they are not qualified
 
01:21:52.270 --> 01:21:52.280 align:start position:0%
to design and deliver the curriculum
 
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
that is needed for that teacher
 
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
certification it doesn't mean they
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
didn't qualify for an entrylevel
 
01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
position it means that they needed that
 
01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
above and beyond to give the best to our
 
01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:05.800 align:start position:0%
students so I key takeaway I'd really
 
01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
like to share with you and I feel Paula
 
01:22:09.629 --> 01:22:09.639 align:start position:0%
has addressed this is supported by
 
01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
nurses I think she's addressed the
 
01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
questions that there really is not a
 
01:22:15.709 --> 01:22:15.719 align:start position:0%
school short uh shortage of School
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
nurses like she said there's three
 
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
identified positions in the state I will
 
01:22:22.030 --> 01:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
add to that to say there's a multiple
 
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
positions adverti for substitute School
 
01:22:27.790 --> 01:22:27.800 align:start position:0%
nurses okay there's always a shortage of
 
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
substitute School nurses because we all
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
know substitute pay is really not in
 
01:22:35.629 --> 01:22:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
be substitutes do not require
 
01:22:40.030 --> 01:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
certification this does not apply to
 
01:22:42.430 --> 01:22:42.440 align:start position:0%
them other districts that may have
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
difficulty finding a nurse are not
 
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
hiring at a full-time
 
01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:47.320 align:start position:0%
equivalent if they're hiring at a
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
fractional part-time rate it's very hard
 
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
as a nurse to work full-time in a
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
hospital system in part time in a school
 
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
system I know I did
 
01:22:59.030 --> 01:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
that before I went full-time as a school
 
01:23:02.590 --> 01:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
nurse so the key takeaway here is really
 
01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
you're giving your students
 
01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:06.270 align:start position:0%
you're giving your students
certification

01:23:06.270 --> 01:23:06.280 align:start position:0%
certification
 
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
allows principal superintendent hiring
 
01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
systems to know that this nurse has
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
really got that above and beyond
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
training to give the best to a
 
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
supportive learning environment because
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
that's what School nurses are there for
 
01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
to bring Wellness into the school that
 
01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
allows those students to have that seat
 
01:23:26.350 --> 01:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
time to keep them in the classrooms to
 
01:23:28.350 --> 01:23:28.360 align:start position:0%
keep them learning to decrease
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
absenteeism related to illness that can
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
be easily managed in a building and the
 
01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
care that is given is so complex and
 
01:23:38.229 --> 01:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
different um it's kind of interesting as
 
01:23:41.629 --> 01:23:41.639 align:start position:0%
an as a nursing Professor right now I
 
01:23:43.629 --> 01:23:43.639 align:start position:0%
see things that I teach my students that
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
I learned in
 
01:23:49.870 --> 01:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
practiced completely differently 20
 
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
years ago when I first learned about it
 
01:23:55.229 --> 01:23:55.239 align:start position:0%
Healthcare is is evolved the complexity
 
01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
of the Care in the students and this is
 
01:23:59.550 --> 01:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
even in a hospital level right now an
 
01:24:01.149 --> 01:24:01.159 align:start position:0%
associates degree may get you in the
 
01:24:03.709 --> 01:24:03.719 align:start position:0%
door but you're also signing a contract
 
01:24:05.550 --> 01:24:05.560 align:start position:0%
within a hospital system and this is
 
01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
very common in New Hampshire that you
 
01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
will obtain a BSN within three to five
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
years of hire it is an expectation at
 
01:24:12.239 --> 01:24:13.189 align:start position:0%
years of hire it is an expectation at
this

01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
point Hospital Systems Health Care
 
01:24:17.149 --> 01:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
Systems View and Associates degreees
 
01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
this is awesome thank you for going to
 
01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
school we're going to take you in but
 
01:24:21.070 --> 01:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
now we need to put you through a
 
01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
mentoring program and you need to sign
 
01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
up for continuing education or you're
 
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
not going to continue to work
 
01:24:29.229 --> 01:24:29.239 align:start position:0%
here okay and this is really seen across
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
the nation but even very specifically
 
01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire I have students
 
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
past students and graduates all the time
 
01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:37.480 align:start position:0%
reaching out and telling me about this
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
um so thank you I really hope um you
 
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
vote to support certification to keep it
 
01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
in place um I think as representative
 
01:24:47.629 --> 01:24:47.639 align:start position:0%
Tanner said it's kind of ironic it shows
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
up on Groundhog Day because I think this
 
01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
is the third time now I've sat before
 
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
you to to say please keep certification
 
01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
and do not remove it so I'm available
 
01:24:59.070 --> 01:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
for questions and I thank you all thank
 
01:25:00.990 --> 01:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
you very much Carla uh we have seven
 
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
minutes left in this hearing and still
 
01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
several folks out there uh are there
 
01:25:06.510 --> 01:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
some questions for Carla did your
 
01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
question get answered representa luno um
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
i' i' I'd actually like to ask it go
 
01:25:14.669 --> 01:25:14.679 align:start position:0%
ahead and and then we're g to try to
 
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
spin to some of the other folks to
 
01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
testify sure no thank you very much and
 
01:25:22.030 --> 01:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um Miss Smith for um
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
um for uh being here this morning um you
 
01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:27.800 align:start position:0%
you you started to um to address it a
 
01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
little bit and certainly your your uh
 
01:25:31.709 --> 01:25:31.719 align:start position:0%
professional experiences both in the
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
hospital setting as well as the um the
 
01:25:37.950 --> 01:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
in school setting and uh and I I I was
 
01:25:42.990 --> 01:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
just gonna ask um how U management and
 
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
Leadership uh uh uh over you know of a
 
01:25:51.709 --> 01:25:51.719 align:start position:0%
nursing staff uh how that compares in a
 
01:25:54.910 --> 01:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
in AAL hospital setting versus uh what
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
you find in an in school setting uh uh
 
01:26:00.669 --> 01:26:00.679 align:start position:0%
particularly as it relates to I think a
 
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
lot of the um you know
 
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
complexities that you that you talked
 
01:26:08.430 --> 01:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
about not not just in terms of of uh of
 
01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
of students but uh but in terms of um of
 
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
their the you know the educational
 
01:26:16.590 --> 01:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
environment absolutely thank you um and
 
01:26:20.189 --> 01:26:20.199 align:start position:0%
I apologize I did not touch on that so
 
01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
one of the things BSN nurses are
 
01:26:24.109 --> 01:26:24.119 align:start position:0%
prepared to do and this is actually a
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
course that I'm teaching this semester
 
01:26:27.629 --> 01:26:27.639 align:start position:0%
is um has to do with leadership in
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
interprofessional education
 
01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
IP which is really working with members
 
01:26:35.709 --> 01:26:35.719 align:start position:0%
of other professions not just nurses and
 
01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
how to collaboratively sit at a table
 
01:26:39.709 --> 01:26:39.719 align:start position:0%
and look at something from a
 
01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
multifaceted view to manage and plan
 
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
care in any setting um a and we see
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
teams do that on Hospital floors we see
 
01:26:49.950 --> 01:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
teams we do that all the time at my
 
01:26:52.669 --> 01:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
University um these teams can happen in
 
01:26:54.430 --> 01:26:54.440 align:start position:0%
school systems and it really has to do
 
01:26:56.189 --> 01:26:56.199 align:start position:0%
with the receptiveness of including the
 
01:26:58.229 --> 01:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
nurse but it also has to do with the
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
training of the nurse to be able to step
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
up and participate as a member in that
 
01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
team versus just sitting passively in a
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
room um nurses do approach things with a
 
01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:09.400 align:start position:0%
very unique and different perspective
 
01:27:11.950 --> 01:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
and there is curriculum that is
 
01:27:15.109 --> 01:27:15.119 align:start position:0%
dedicated to that type of training um
 
01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
that is not taught in an associate
 
01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
degree level thank you Carla we we
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
really are running short of time here
 
01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
going to jump to the school board's
 
01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
Association not not Association School
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education and uh Drew
 
01:27:34.590 --> 01:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
kleene is in the queue waiting to speak
 
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
there can you hear us Drew hi I can hear
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
you um uh Mr chairman and members of the
 
01:27:54.910 --> 01:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
committee thank you this is Drew Klein
 
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
I'm chair of the State Board of
 
01:27:58.590 --> 01:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
Education I had not intended to um
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
testify today I was catching this
 
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
meeting and saw this and I thought I
 
01:28:03.229 --> 01:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
could add a little bit of perspective
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
from the state board so uh forgive me if
 
01:28:07.669 --> 01:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
my thoughts are um a little bit
 
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
disorganized I just want to make first
 
01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
of all a point of clarification if I
 
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
could um understand this bill um as I
 
01:28:18.510 --> 01:28:18.520 align:start position:0%
read the bill it does not remove the
 
01:28:20.350 --> 01:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
state law requirement that nurses School
 
01:28:22.629 --> 01:28:22.639 align:start position:0%
nurses have a bachelor's degree
 
01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
correct it it removes the requirement
 
01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
that they receive Department of
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
Education certification but the law
 
01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
continues to say that they must have a
 
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree so as I read this bill
 
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
um am I get do I have that wrong I see
 
01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
rep tanor shaking her head so um I hope
 
01:28:43.629 --> 01:28:43.639 align:start position:0%
maybe the sponsor can clarify that
 
01:28:45.669 --> 01:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
because that would change this a little
 
01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
bit so if there is if the bill simply
 
01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
removes the requirement for
 
01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:53.430 align:start position:0%
removes the requirement for
certification

01:28:53.430 --> 01:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
certification
 
01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
um that uh from the state board's
 
01:28:57.550 --> 01:28:57.560 align:start position:0%
perspective that would be a relief we
 
01:28:59.950 --> 01:28:59.960 align:start position:0%
really struggled certifying uh nurses
 
01:29:02.709 --> 01:29:02.719 align:start position:0%
and writing these rules the law driving
 
01:29:04.750 --> 01:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
the the law um requiring a bachelor's
 
01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
degree for nurses is what really drove a
 
01:29:10.270 --> 01:29:10.280 align:start position:0%
lot of this um we created the
 
01:29:11.950 --> 01:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
three-level uh
 
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
certification on the fly so to speak
 
01:29:16.629 --> 01:29:16.639 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't even clear that we
 
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
could do that and the testimony we
 
01:29:21.229 --> 01:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
received from school districts was if we
 
01:29:22.750 --> 01:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
didn't do that there would be an
 
01:29:24.629 --> 01:29:24.639 align:start position:0%
instantaneous and massive shortage of
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
School nurses on top of the already
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
existing shortage of School nurses and
 
01:29:31.270 --> 01:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
believe me we have heard from districts
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
um consistently that there is in fact a
 
01:29:35.390 --> 01:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
shortage of School nurses and the school
 
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
Nurses Association told WMUR last month
 
01:29:39.790 --> 01:29:39.800 align:start position:0%
that there was a shortage of School
 
01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:42.400 align:start position:0%
nurses you can see it on the wmr website
 
01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
there was a national shortage of School
 
01:29:48.430 --> 01:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
nurses um so so there is a shortage the
 
01:29:51.070 --> 01:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree requirement um makes
 
01:29:54.149 --> 01:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
this worse much much worse um so what we
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
had to do was write rules that that
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
grandfathered in but also that created
 
01:30:00.990 --> 01:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
the school nurse one so you could have
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
the registered nurse and get the uh and
 
01:30:05.950 --> 01:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
come in in the process of getting the
 
01:30:10.430 --> 01:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
training um so we can have uh registered
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
nurses who had Associates degrees come
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
in so um it was a a difficult process
 
01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
and and the board really felt like uh
 
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
this was not our expertise or our strong
 
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
point we we did not want to certified
 
01:30:23.550 --> 01:30:23.560 align:start position:0%
School nurses we didn't want to be
 
01:30:25.790 --> 01:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
involved in that at all we thought that
 
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
they were health professionals and
 
01:30:30.189 --> 01:30:30.199 align:start position:0%
should be um hired on on the basis of
 
01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
their skills as health professionals and
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
I wanted to dispel some of the myths
 
01:30:35.950 --> 01:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
here we just heard some testimony that
 
01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh that is really driven by the
 
01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree requirement um the
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
certification if you read the the 500s
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
where we certify School nurses nothing
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:30:51.390 --> 01:30:51.400 align:start position:0%
certification requires School nurses to
 
01:30:54.189 --> 01:30:54.199 align:start position:0%
learn anything about education there's
 
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
nothing in the certification that says
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
they have to take teaching courses or
 
01:30:58.990 --> 01:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
learn the school environment or do
 
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
anything like that we wrote these rules
 
01:31:03.070 --> 01:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
to comply with the law for bachelor's
 
01:31:06.629 --> 01:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
degree requirements um the way we we
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
wrote the rules as Loose as we could
 
01:31:12.270 --> 01:31:12.280 align:start position:0%
possibly write them um in in our
 
01:31:16.229 --> 01:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
view so that schools and districts
 
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we wouldn't burden them any
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
further in making it in even greater
 
01:31:24.990 --> 01:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
school nurse shortage um
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
so the certification itself does not
 
01:31:32.350 --> 01:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
require nurses to know anything about uh
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
504 plans or IEPs or any of the stuff
 
01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
that goes on in schools there's nothing
 
01:31:38.709 --> 01:31:38.719 align:start position:0%
in the certification requirement that
 
01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
adds to that um it is it is really
 
01:31:46.030 --> 01:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
driven towards their um education as a
 
01:31:49.149 --> 01:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
nurse and their experience as a nurse
 
01:31:51.070 --> 01:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
and so removing the certification
 
01:31:52.830 --> 01:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
requirements with wouldn't affect that
 
01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
in any way
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
um one of the previous speakers talked
 
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
about entry level and I think that is
 
01:32:03.510 --> 01:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
really really really important we
 
01:32:05.109 --> 01:32:05.119 align:start position:0%
created the three
 
01:32:08.310 --> 01:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
levels to create an entry level nurse
 
01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's the school nurse one um because
 
01:32:14.270 --> 01:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
that wasn't in the law had we not gone
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
down that path um you would have had an
 
01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
entry-level bachelor's degree
 
01:32:19.950 --> 01:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
requirement basically and then the
 
01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
people would be grandfathered who were
 
01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:22.350 align:start position:0%
people would be grandfathered who were
already

01:32:22.350 --> 01:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
and that would have created again as I
 
01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
said a serious and immediate shortage on
 
01:32:30.790 --> 01:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
top of the existing shortage so what we
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
see and this is I want to share with you
 
01:32:33.550 --> 01:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
some of the antidotes we've received
 
01:32:36.990 --> 01:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
some school districts
 
01:32:41.070 --> 01:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
um Manchester for example has zero
 
01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
certified School nurses to my
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
understanding because they hire their
 
01:32:46.669 --> 01:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
nurses on the city side of the
 
01:32:48.910 --> 01:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
department uh of the city not on the
 
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
school side because they hire them
 
01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
through the public Health Department
 
01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
they are not um they do not fall under
 
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
our certification process so the largest
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
District in the state has no certified
 
01:33:04.149 --> 01:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
nurses they do not have to get the
 
01:33:07.229 --> 01:33:07.239 align:start position:0%
certification so if you were to say that
 
01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:09.560 align:start position:0%
the certification is necessary and adds
 
01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
all these um benefits I don't know how
 
01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
you can um can feel comfortable that the
 
01:33:17.229 --> 01:33:17.239 align:start position:0%
largest District in the state does not
 
01:33:18.750 --> 01:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
have this certification and goes around
 
01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
the process other districts could easily
 
01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
do that um if they arrange their hiring
 
01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
in that way so there are workarounds and
 
01:33:32.669 --> 01:33:32.679 align:start position:0%
I'm it's not clear to me how that really
 
01:33:36.270 --> 01:33:36.280 align:start position:0%
helps the situation um if we have
 
01:33:39.790 --> 01:33:39.800 align:start position:0%
workarounds and have outs um but we have
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
this requirement in place we're just
 
01:33:43.470 --> 01:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
creating a bureaucratic system where we
 
01:33:45.310 --> 01:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
kind of force districts to go around and
 
01:33:48.109 --> 01:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
we force schools to go around the system
 
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
um we also have received feedback back
 
01:33:54.149 --> 01:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
from schools that uh this has made it
 
01:33:56.990 --> 01:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
harder for them to fire to hire nurses
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
um as an antidote I can tell you we had
 
01:34:02.830 --> 01:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
one School uh tell us that they had a a
 
01:34:04.669 --> 01:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
person who was going to be hired as a
 
01:34:06.390 --> 01:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
school nurse this person is a registered
 
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
nurse with I think a couple decades
 
01:34:10.590 --> 01:34:10.600 align:start position:0%
experience as a registered nurse who
 
01:34:11.790 --> 01:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
came to the school because he wanted to
 
01:34:15.390 --> 01:34:15.400 align:start position:0%
get into this uh become a school nurse
 
01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
these requirements certification
 
01:34:19.470 --> 01:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
requirements were pretty burdensome so
 
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
they just hired the nurse as an admin
 
01:34:24.629 --> 01:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
administrator at the school and the the
 
01:34:26.430 --> 01:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
person is on staff as an office
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
administrator but is the school nurse is
 
01:34:31.590 --> 01:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
is a nurse in the school and that and
 
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
they don't have a school nurse so we are
 
01:34:36.229 --> 01:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
seeing districts and schools try to come
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
up with workarounds from the bachelor's
 
01:34:40.270 --> 01:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
degree requirement in particular and the
 
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
certification process so my point is
 
01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
that this multi-layered certification
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
process even as um easy as we tried to
 
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
make make it for districts is a problem
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
and is creating um headaches for
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
districts and is not adding the the
 
01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
level of um
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
extra um Quality I think that is assumed
 
01:35:09.149 --> 01:35:09.159 align:start position:0%
that it adds so I will end there just to
 
01:35:11.149 --> 01:35:11.159 align:start position:0%
not take up any more time thank you very
 
01:35:14.350 --> 01:35:14.360 align:start position:0%
much Drew are there questions for Drew
 
01:35:17.669 --> 01:35:17.679 align:start position:0%
Klein uh yes represent luno thank you
 
01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair thank you very much
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
um chair Klein for uh for joining us
 
01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
this morning um uh I'm it's it's pretty
 
01:35:30.109 --> 01:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
clear from from your discussion that uh
 
01:35:31.709 --> 01:35:31.719 align:start position:0%
that that you don't have a strong
 
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
understanding of what this bill does but
 
01:35:36.510 --> 01:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
um but I wanted to ask you about one of
 
01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
the comments you made uh particularly
 
01:35:42.750 --> 01:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
that uh that you don't want the board to
 
01:35:46.229 --> 01:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
be seen as burdening districts but I was
 
01:35:48.149 --> 01:35:48.159 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could talk a little bit
 
01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
about that in terms of state board
 
01:35:52.189 --> 01:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
response about
 
01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to burdening districts
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
public um I'm afraid I don't understand
 
01:36:05.189 --> 01:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
your question there there are
 
01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
tradeoffs um that that any uh government
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
makes when you write laws and rules so
 
01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
if you were to require um you
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
know let put it this
 
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
way in pursuing quote unquote quality
 
01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
you can easily make perfect be the enemy
 
01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
of the good so as I've tried to point
 
01:36:29.070 --> 01:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
out we have districts that are working
 
01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
around these requirements so I don't I'm
 
01:36:38.430 --> 01:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
afraid I don't quite understand um
 
01:36:41.550 --> 01:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
how it how it isn't obvious that
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
imposing burdens on school systems that
 
01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
are unreasonable in the marketplace
 
01:36:49.390 --> 01:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
again there is a shortage of nurses in
 
01:36:51.870 --> 01:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um there a shortage of
 
01:36:54.990 --> 01:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
School nurses in New Hampshire and when
 
01:36:58.470 --> 01:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
you are um well rep Tanner I mean when
 
01:37:00.109 --> 01:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
the when the school nurse Association
 
01:37:01.510 --> 01:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
tells the press that there's a shortage
 
01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
of nurses and we hear it from districts
 
01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
um that's the information that I get so
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
um so I'm afraid
 
01:37:14.109 --> 01:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
I I just don't quite understand how the
 
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
state can think that it can simply
 
01:37:20.669 --> 01:37:20.679 align:start position:0%
impose a requirement that certain
 
01:37:25.709 --> 01:37:25.719 align:start position:0%
hurdles be hurdled be junked um and when
 
01:37:27.430 --> 01:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
there is already a shortage in the state
 
01:37:30.830 --> 01:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
of nurses and not expect that that will
 
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
affect the supply of nurses in schools
 
01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
so um one of the things I think the
 
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
is you you're writing rules that would
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
positions do you want to set the bar so
 
01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
high that you make it much more
 
01:37:56.430 --> 01:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
difficult for districts especially
 
01:37:59.229 --> 01:37:59.239 align:start position:0%
smaller rural districts
 
01:38:02.350 --> 01:38:02.360 align:start position:0%
um to to hire for that
 
01:38:05.470 --> 01:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
position and you create an artificial
 
01:38:07.629 --> 01:38:07.639 align:start position:0%
shortage is that
 
01:38:11.990 --> 01:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
better than having um a system where you
 
01:38:15.629 --> 01:38:15.639 align:start position:0%
can have an entrylevel um person come in
 
01:38:20.109 --> 01:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
with um requirements that are equal
 
01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
to hospital or equal to a doctor's
 
01:38:27.669 --> 01:38:27.679 align:start position:0%
office um I I think that's kind of the
 
01:38:30.109 --> 01:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
question here is do we want to create a
 
01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
system where a nurse who can work in the
 
01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
emergency room and care for your child
 
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
who comes in with an emergency or care
 
01:38:41.229 --> 01:38:41.239 align:start position:0%
for your child uh who gets sick um at a
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
hospital bed is not qualified to be a
 
01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
nurse in the school system and that's
 
01:38:48.109 --> 01:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
what the certification has effectively
 
01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
done and um I think that's an issue
 
01:38:53.830 --> 01:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh that that the legis legislature ought
 
01:38:57.149 --> 01:38:57.159 align:start position:0%
to um think about
 
01:38:59.589 --> 01:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not gonna allow any follow-ups
 
01:39:01.709 --> 01:39:01.719 align:start position:0%
right now I'm sorry we've run over our
 
01:39:05.910 --> 01:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
time limit into the next bill um uh if
 
01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh folks have a question uh I'm sure uh
 
01:39:12.270 --> 01:39:12.280 align:start position:0%
Mr Klein will respond to if you ask the
 
01:39:15.189 --> 01:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
question to him uh following this
 
01:39:17.550 --> 01:39:17.560 align:start position:0%
hearing he's over at the Department of
 
01:39:19.629 --> 01:39:19.639 align:start position:0%
Education he can be
 
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
contacted um so with that the I'm
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
looking at our sheet right here yes we
 
01:39:28.270 --> 01:39:28.280 align:start position:0%
did have uh some technical support from
 
01:39:30.189 --> 01:39:30.199 align:start position:0%
the Department available if we need it
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
but at this time um I don't think we are
 
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
there um so I'm going to conclude this
 
01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:41.719 align:start position:0%

phone we are taking testimony but that
 
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
request by phone came after I had said
 
01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
we're closing this meeting down it just
 
01:41:38.709 --> 01:41:38.719 align:start position:0%

01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:51.750 align:start position:0%
 
screen

01:41:51.750 --> 01:41:51.760 align:start position:0%

their hand raised for quite a while um
 
01:42:04.629 --> 01:42:04.639 align:start position:0%
there's no way for me to find out who it

conversation uh I I will allow that
 
01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
individual because I believe that may
 
01:42:25.229 --> 01:42:25.239 align:start position:0%
have been there but the rep line came up
 
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.040 align:start position:0%

01:42:31.390 --> 01:42:31.400 align:start position:0%

Jen hi this is representative Leah
 
01:43:13.149 --> 01:43:13.159 align:start position:0%
kushman hi
 
01:43:16.669 --> 01:43:16.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for taking my my uh call
 
01:43:20.790 --> 01:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
and uh letting me speak uh Mr chairman
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
my name is representative Leah kushman I
 
01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
represent wear and Dearing um I'm a
 
01:43:28.950 --> 01:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
registered nurse a recent best back
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
laurate degree program graduate um I had
 
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
my RN for six years as an associate
 
01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
degree R RN prior to that um I just want
 
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
to I'm I'm a little unclear on um the
 
01:43:47.109 --> 01:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
the discrepancy about the borate
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
requirement um but I'll just speak
 
01:43:52.950 --> 01:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
briefly um um in support of this bill uh
 
01:43:54.550 --> 01:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
I think this bill will help reduce the
 
01:43:57.950 --> 01:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
shortage of School nurses by reducing um
 
01:44:00.750 --> 01:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
kind of sloppy requirements that have
 
01:44:03.310 --> 01:44:03.320 align:start position:0%
all kinds of loopholes and we'll just
 
01:44:06.870 --> 01:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
open it up um to anyone any registered
 
01:44:10.709 --> 01:44:10.719 align:start position:0%
nurse uh to serve as a school
 
01:44:14.709 --> 01:44:14.719 align:start position:0%
nurse um without having to be certified
 
01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
through the Department of Education RNs
 
01:44:19.229 --> 01:44:19.239 align:start position:0%
who work for staffing agencies with
 
01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
associate degrees are filling in at
 
01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
schools now without certification and
 
01:44:25.149 --> 01:44:25.159 align:start position:0%
without prior experience I know because
 
01:44:26.709 --> 01:44:26.719 align:start position:0%
I received the alerts from staffing
 
01:44:28.830 --> 01:44:28.840 align:start position:0%
agencies that I work for uh putting
 
01:44:30.910 --> 01:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
calls out for nurses to pick up these
 
01:44:33.589 --> 01:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
shifts um and I will say the only
 
01:44:35.470 --> 01:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
difference between a borate degree
 
01:44:37.189 --> 01:44:37.199 align:start position:0%
nursing program and associate degree
 
01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
program is the level of Community Health
 
01:44:41.589 --> 01:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
that is taught and it's really just
 
01:44:43.709 --> 01:44:43.719 align:start position:0%
rather redundant if you go through
 
01:44:45.550 --> 01:44:45.560 align:start position:0%
nursing school and an associate degree
 
01:44:47.709 --> 01:44:47.719 align:start position:0%
program you do your general education
 
01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
courses over two or three years as
 
01:44:51.550 --> 01:44:51.560 align:start position:0%
prerequisites before you can start the
 
01:44:53.189 --> 01:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
two-year nursing
 
01:44:55.669 --> 01:44:55.679 align:start position:0%
courses um and in a borate degree
 
01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
program nursing students do their
 
01:44:58.990 --> 01:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
general education courses in the first
 
01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
two years of their four-year program
 
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
followed by two years of core nursing
 
01:45:07.629 --> 01:45:07.639 align:start position:0%
courses associate degrees are um the the
 
01:45:10.669 --> 01:45:10.679 align:start position:0%
most common Avenue that RNs get their
 
01:45:14.229 --> 01:45:14.239 align:start position:0%
licensure both Avenues um include
 
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
extensive clinical training in
 
01:45:19.709 --> 01:45:19.719 align:start position:0%
facilities and labs and both nurses both
 
01:45:22.669 --> 01:45:22.679 align:start position:0%
um Associates degree and borate degree
 
01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
RN take the exact same RN lure exam the
 
01:45:29.550 --> 01:45:29.560 align:start position:0%
enlex and they they both do um
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
generational intergenerational nursing
 
01:45:34.390 --> 01:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
that includes Pediatrics and there's no
 
01:45:37.629 --> 01:45:37.639 align:start position:0%
reason that I see that um the any RMS
 
01:45:41.109 --> 01:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
need to be certified to be School nurses
 
01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
so that's all I'll say today thank you
 
01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you very much
 
01:45:48.430 --> 01:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
representative are there questions for
 
01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:49.470 align:start position:0%
representative are there questions for
the

01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:52.589 --> 01:45:52.599 align:start position:0%
representative point of order Mr chair
 
01:45:56.430 --> 01:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
yes please uh I have a message uh
 
01:45:58.750 --> 01:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
representative Lang had said that he had
 
01:46:00.550 --> 01:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak and has been trying
 
01:46:03.070 --> 01:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
to speak I just uh want to make sure
 
01:46:05.910 --> 01:46:05.920 align:start position:0%

01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor thank you oh I'm sorry

there yes I'm trying to look at the um
 
01:46:23.669 --> 01:46:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
that is a problem with the system that
 
01:46:28.629 --> 01:46:28.639 align:start position:0%
people can continue to register after we
 
01:46:33.470 --> 01:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
relay the results to the chairs
 
01:46:36.430 --> 01:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
349 yeah this this needs to be somehow
 
01:46:38.350 --> 01:46:38.360 align:start position:0%
resolved seeing that we're trying to
 
01:46:41.669 --> 01:46:41.679 align:start position:0%
build um a schedule as we're going
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
through these hearings that's not
 
01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:46.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh applicable to every
 
01:46:47.790 --> 01:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
hearing because a different number of
 
01:46:49.870 --> 01:46:49.880 align:start position:0%
people trying to testify this particular
 
01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
situation when you see few people
 
01:46:53.629 --> 01:46:53.639 align:start position:0%
signing up you allow more time for
 
01:46:56.510 --> 01:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
individuals to speak um then when we
 
01:46:59.470 --> 01:46:59.480 align:start position:0%
have others piling on then it starts to
 
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
give us a this Crunch at the end so yes
 
01:47:03.669 --> 01:47:03.679 align:start position:0%
representative vad my record shows that
 
01:47:07.589 --> 01:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
he registered to speak at 9:54 this
 
01:47:07.599 --> 01:47:09.310 align:start position:0%
he registered to speak at 9:54 this
morning

01:47:09.310 --> 01:47:09.320 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:11.390 align:start position:0%
morning
954

01:47:11.390 --> 01:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
954
 
01:47:15.189 --> 01:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
yes okay um of course that's that's
 
01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
after the start of this particular
 
01:47:22.589 --> 01:47:22.599 align:start position:0%
hearing um so um if uh if the
 
01:47:24.310 --> 01:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
representative is there and wants to
 
01:47:26.750 --> 01:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
speak I will allow him you know a few
 
01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
moments but I really got to get on to
 
01:47:31.109 --> 01:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
the next hearing
 
01:47:33.790 --> 01:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
here okay he's he's permitted to speak
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative Lang thank you
 
01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh chairman thank you committee members
 
01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:40.719 align:start position:0%
for taking my testimony I apologize I
 
01:47:42.270 --> 01:47:42.280 align:start position:0%
hadn't intend to speak and just sign
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
support the testimony I was hearing
 
01:47:47.229 --> 01:47:47.239 align:start position:0%
maybe want to speak um and I'll be real
 
01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
brief I want to make sure we're clear
 
01:47:52.910 --> 01:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
that a a vote to uh OTP this bill is not
 
01:47:55.229 --> 01:47:55.239 align:start position:0%
a vote against nurses that I think our
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
nurses do a great job and I think that
 
01:47:59.910 --> 01:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
the only differential here is is the
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
regulatory requirement we've placed
 
01:48:03.790 --> 01:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
within the Board of Education reflective
 
01:48:05.550 --> 01:48:05.560 align:start position:0%
of the medical care that our students
 
01:48:08.350 --> 01:48:08.360 align:start position:0%
are receiving and I'm I'm saying no uh
 
01:48:09.790 --> 01:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
and that that's why I supported this
 
01:48:11.830 --> 01:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
bill is that in a time when we're
 
01:48:14.830 --> 01:48:14.840 align:start position:0%
talking about getting every every
 
01:48:16.709 --> 01:48:16.719 align:start position:0%
squeezing every nickel so we can get the
 
01:48:18.629 --> 01:48:18.639 align:start position:0%
best value out of out of that nickel for
 
01:48:21.070 --> 01:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
our education system this borous
 
01:48:24.030 --> 01:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
regulatory requirement that serves no
 
01:48:26.470 --> 01:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
real new function as we've heard these
 
01:48:28.229 --> 01:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
nurses can serve in there emergency
 
01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
rooms and our hospitals and our doctor's
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
offices but some reason they can't serve
 
01:48:35.229 --> 01:48:35.239 align:start position:0%
in our school system so I again I want
 
01:48:36.750 --> 01:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure we're when we're talking
 
01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the regulatory
 
01:48:40.550 --> 01:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
burden that we've applied to schools in
 
01:48:43.669 --> 01:48:43.679 align:start position:0%
hiring and not the quality of care that
 
01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
are our students are getting I apologize
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
for uh being in coming in late but I
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
just wanted after hearing some of the
 
01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
testimony I wanted to make sure again
 
01:48:55.149 --> 01:48:55.159 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about the quality of
 
01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
care our students get because I think in
 
01:48:59.830 --> 01:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
RN again we've heard takes the same test
 
01:49:01.589 --> 01:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
regardless of where they work and that
 
01:49:03.629 --> 01:49:03.639 align:start position:0%
if our requirement is an RN that should
 
01:49:05.109 --> 01:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
be our requirement let the medical
 
01:49:07.149 --> 01:49:07.159 align:start position:0%
professionals determine medical care but
 
01:49:08.910 --> 01:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
the educational professionals worry
 
01:49:10.709 --> 01:49:10.719 align:start position:0%
about teaching thank you that's all I
 
01:49:12.589 --> 01:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
have to say thank you very much
 
01:49:15.189 --> 01:49:15.199 align:start position:0%
representative uh with that uh I'm not
 
01:49:16.709 --> 01:49:16.719 align:start position:0%
going to ask the representa take
 
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
questions uh we will conclude this
 
01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:20.750 align:start position:0%
questions uh we will conclude this
hearing

01:49:20.750 --> 01:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:49:24.030 --> 01:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
um I had on the sheet that I had
 
01:49:26.669 --> 01:49:26.679 align:start position:0%
received earlier just so we can get that
 
01:49:30.189 --> 01:49:30.199 align:start position:0%
done supporting was 10 opposed 12 and
 
01:49:33.149 --> 01:49:33.159 align:start position:0%
neutral zero obviously we've had a few
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
people come in speaking um presenting to
 
01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
us so that the count that I just
 
01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned does not is not inclusive of
 
01:49:44.830 --> 01:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
them so uh in conclusion we are
 
01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
finishing are closing this hearing on
 
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.560 align:start position:0%

Cornell good morning and thank you for
 
01:50:15.790 --> 01:50:15.800 align:start position:0%
allowing me to present this and first I
 
01:50:18.189 --> 01:50:18.199 align:start position:0%
want to say that this bill was first
 
01:50:21.070 --> 01:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
presented last session by then
 
01:50:23.189 --> 01:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
representative Dave dhy who I believe
 
01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
has signed up to speak after me so
 
01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully I will just briefly introduce
 
01:50:31.709 --> 01:50:31.719 align:start position:0%
this and we'll allow representative DH
 
01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:33.679 align:start position:0%
to be the next speaker to take more
 
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
questions and give more background on
 
01:50:39.310 --> 01:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
this bill um the intent of the bill is
 
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
to establish the position of school
 
01:50:43.709 --> 01:50:43.719 align:start position:0%
counselor coordinator in the Department
 
01:50:46.270 --> 01:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
of Education and the Coordinator would
 
01:50:48.750 --> 01:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
work and give assistance to school
 
01:50:51.310 --> 01:50:51.320 align:start position:0%
counselors career counselors School
 
01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
psychologists and school social workers
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
and insist in developing school programs
 
01:51:00.109 --> 01:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic that's going on now
 
01:51:03.510 --> 01:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
and afterwards schools will be dealing
 
01:51:06.189 --> 01:51:06.199 align:start position:0%
with and are dealing with numerous
 
01:51:10.470 --> 01:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
issues with students staff families and
 
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
I think those Personnel need a liaison
 
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Education to
 
01:51:18.910 --> 01:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
assist them in referrals with help of
 
01:51:22.750 --> 01:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
what to do program to do um the position
 
01:51:25.629 --> 01:51:25.639 align:start position:0%
was previously funded and filled but
 
01:51:27.990 --> 01:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
it's been completely vacant since I
 
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.069 align:start position:0%
it's been completely vacant since I
think

01:51:30.069 --> 01:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:51:34.270 --> 01:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
2018 this bill passed in 2018 came out
 
01:51:36.750 --> 01:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
of our committee I think
 
01:51:41.310 --> 01:51:41.320 align:start position:0%
18-2 went to finance who finance took
 
01:51:44.270 --> 01:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
the money out and recommended to the
 
01:51:47.910 --> 01:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner to put it in his budget for
 
01:51:51.790 --> 01:51:51.800 align:start position:0%
the next year um and then covid happened
 
01:51:54.589 --> 01:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
and this bill was one of the ones that
 
01:51:55.709 --> 01:51:55.719 align:start position:0%
just got
 
01:51:58.430 --> 01:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
lost so I think it's really important
 
01:52:00.629 --> 01:52:00.639 align:start position:0%
that we have a coordinator at the
 
01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:03.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to help with
 
01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:09.960 align:start position:0%

01:53:45.790 --> 01:53:45.800 align:start position:0%
of the uh what was then called the New
 
01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire guidance Directors Association
 
01:53:52.430 --> 01:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
from 2005 to 2008 when I
 
01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
retired um this this is a very important
 
01:53:58.709 --> 01:53:58.719 align:start position:0%
position it's been around for a while it
 
01:54:02.109 --> 01:54:02.119 align:start position:0%
started uh back in the 60s and 70s it
 
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
was fully funded by the state as were
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
many other things in those days um for
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
those of you who are familiar at all
 
01:54:15.310 --> 01:54:15.320 align:start position:0%
with with counseling um Jim Carr and
 
01:54:18.030 --> 01:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
Joanne hlip were the the two Originators
 
01:54:20.990 --> 01:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
of this position and during the 70s and
 
01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
80s they were very active in terms of
 
01:54:25.830 --> 01:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
helping counselors around the
 
01:54:29.550 --> 01:54:29.560 align:start position:0%
state um after they left the position
 
01:54:32.350 --> 01:54:32.360 align:start position:0%
was vacant for about 10 years and then
 
01:54:35.470 --> 01:54:35.480 align:start position:0%
since then it's been kind of up and down
 
01:54:37.550 --> 01:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's been a full-time position
 
01:54:39.629 --> 01:54:39.639 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's been a part-time position
 
01:54:42.270 --> 01:54:42.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's been funded by the state
 
01:54:44.589 --> 01:54:44.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes from federal resources or
 
01:54:47.669 --> 01:54:47.679 align:start position:0%
grants sometimes a combination of both
 
01:54:50.669 --> 01:54:50.679 align:start position:0%
it's been very era
 
01:54:53.189 --> 01:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
as representative Cornell indicated
 
01:54:57.669 --> 01:54:57.679 align:start position:0%
since um 2018 June of 2018 the position
 
01:54:59.109 --> 01:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:55:03.390 --> 01:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
vacant and um so um this is the reason
 
01:55:06.510 --> 01:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
that I introduced this bill last year
 
01:55:08.629 --> 01:55:08.639 align:start position:0%
because I felt this was a position that
 
01:55:10.430 --> 01:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
needed to be
 
01:55:13.629 --> 01:55:13.639 align:start position:0%
reintroduced um over the years
 
01:55:15.390 --> 01:55:15.400 align:start position:0%
counselors have been asked to do more
 
01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
and more counselors exist in all levels
 
01:55:22.669 --> 01:55:22.679 align:start position:0%
of Education in the state K to 12 um
 
01:55:24.589 --> 01:55:24.599 align:start position:0%
very important to students very
 
01:55:28.830 --> 01:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
important to staff to have competent and
 
01:55:31.790 --> 01:55:31.800 align:start position:0%
experienced counselors in the building
 
01:55:33.790 --> 01:55:33.800 align:start position:0%
and but there's no advocate for for
 
01:55:35.229 --> 01:55:35.239 align:start position:0%
counselors in the Department of
 
01:55:38.109 --> 01:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
Education and there really should be uh
 
01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
counselor duties have expanded they're
 
01:55:44.550 --> 01:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
very different depending on the area um
 
01:55:46.510 --> 01:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
in the school that the counselors work
 
01:55:49.310 --> 01:55:49.320 align:start position:0%
in depends on if you know if they're in
 
01:55:52.229 --> 01:55:52.239 align:start position:0%
an Urban school or suburban school the
 
01:55:55.069 --> 01:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic background the types of
 
01:55:58.069 --> 01:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
students and as representative Cornell
 
01:56:03.910 --> 01:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
indicated since the pandemic pandemic um
 
01:56:06.629 --> 01:56:06.639 align:start position:0%
this is um more and more reason that
 
01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
counselors need support and help and
 
01:56:13.790 --> 01:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
guidance of for themselves and this is
 
01:56:15.790 --> 01:56:15.800 align:start position:0%
what this position can
 
01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:17.750 align:start position:0%
what this position can
provide

01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:56:21.229 --> 01:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
um all teachers all counselors all
 
01:56:24.350 --> 01:56:24.360 align:start position:0%
Personnel working in school need all
 
01:56:26.709 --> 01:56:26.719 align:start position:0%
kinds of support they need financial
 
01:56:28.830 --> 01:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
support they need emotional
 
01:56:32.870 --> 01:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
support um and uh I think this position
 
01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
can provide that one of the uh things
 
01:56:39.510 --> 01:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
that happened last year when I
 
01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill uh representative
 
01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
lad asked me if I would include some
 
01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development as part of this uh
 
01:56:50.950 --> 01:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility ility of this coordinator
 
01:56:53.310 --> 01:56:53.320 align:start position:0%
so that we could make this a bipartisan
 
01:56:56.950 --> 01:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
bill I was happy to do that I think it's
 
01:56:59.589 --> 01:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
important uh I've been a advocate for
 
01:57:02.470 --> 01:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development for CTE
 
01:57:05.149 --> 01:57:05.159 align:start position:0%
education um I have no problem with that
 
01:57:07.109 --> 01:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the reasons why it had
 
01:57:09.390 --> 01:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
such strong bipartisan support from the
 
01:57:12.550 --> 01:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
education committee last time
 
01:57:14.910 --> 01:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there just wasn't enough
 
01:57:17.109 --> 01:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
money in the budget to be able to fund
 
01:57:19.629 --> 01:57:19.639 align:start position:0%
this position so I'm certainly hoping
 
01:57:22.069 --> 01:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
that's going to
 
01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
change go ahead well thank you very much
 
01:57:28.069 --> 01:57:28.079 align:start position:0%

um are there some questions for repres
 
01:57:43.030 --> 01:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
Dave dhy um uh we we do have h h a
 
01:57:45.069 --> 01:57:45.079 align:start position:0%
number of people that have indicated
 
01:57:47.950 --> 01:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
desire to speak to this uh I see on my
 
01:57:49.470 --> 01:57:49.480 align:start position:0%
sheet and I don't know if it's the
 
01:57:52.109 --> 01:57:52.119 align:start position:0%
current sheet based upon the last bill
 
01:57:54.270 --> 01:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
but we have one two three four five six
 
01:57:59.910 --> 01:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
seven people up uh or in on Deck so um
 
01:58:04.149 --> 01:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:11.149 --> 01:58:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:14.229 --> 01:58:14.239 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you Mr chairman uh Mr Dy
 
01:58:15.950 --> 01:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
welcome again good to see you and hear
 
01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
from you uh Dave I just had a question
 
01:58:20.470 --> 01:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
when you were talking about Workforce
 
01:58:23.109 --> 01:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
Development I'm looking at line 15 of
 
01:58:25.709 --> 01:58:25.719 align:start position:0%
the page two of the bill it talks about
 
01:58:27.910 --> 01:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
Bureau of career development using that
 
01:58:32.750 --> 01:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
as the same uh notation is that the same
 
01:58:35.550 --> 01:58:35.560 align:start position:0%
language I think that's I think that's
 
01:58:37.629 --> 01:58:37.639 align:start position:0%
correct representative
 
01:58:40.709 --> 01:58:40.719 align:start position:0%
Woodcock um it's all part of the same
 
01:58:43.030 --> 01:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
package I think uh you know councelors
 
01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
do a lot of different jobs and one of
 
01:58:49.310 --> 01:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
them uh is to help kids not only look at
 
01:58:52.310 --> 01:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
postsecondary education but look at post
 
01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:53.669 align:start position:0%
postsecondary education but look at post
educ

01:58:53.669 --> 01:58:53.679 align:start position:0%
educ
 
01:58:57.390 --> 01:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
postsecondary career choices and um I
 
01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
think that u a coordinator in the
 
01:59:02.990 --> 01:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education can certainly
 
01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
bring together some other aspects of
 
01:59:07.310 --> 01:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
educ of Educators in the department to
 
01:59:11.550 --> 01:59:11.560 align:start position:0%
work on further developing uh um career
 
01:59:13.790 --> 01:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities for students I hope that
 
01:59:15.709 --> 01:59:15.719 align:start position:0%

um for the record my name is Mary San
 
02:00:30.030 --> 02:00:30.040 align:start position:0%
Heath and I represent district 14 in
 
02:00:32.910 --> 02:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester and um I just will speak very
 
02:00:35.910 --> 02:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
briefly and I certainly am in support of
 
02:00:37.350 --> 02:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
02:00:42.350 --> 02:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
96 um and as a former um employee of the
 
02:00:44.910 --> 02:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Ed I worked
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
consistently with the person formally in
 
02:00:51.350 --> 02:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
that position and saw the good results
 
02:00:54.629 --> 02:00:54.639 align:start position:0%
um it gave us the ability to coordinate
 
02:00:56.270 --> 02:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
across the state with guidance
 
02:00:58.510 --> 02:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
counselors but I want to talk about my
 
02:01:01.390 --> 02:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
role um in division two um in the
 
02:01:03.950 --> 02:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
finance committee um when the bill came
 
02:01:07.109 --> 02:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
to the finance it the house passed the
 
02:01:10.669 --> 02:01:10.679 align:start position:0%
bill uh fully um and I actually think it
 
02:01:13.350 --> 02:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
might have been on the consent agenda um
 
02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
but when it got to division 2 in finance
 
02:01:19.910 --> 02:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
um we knew at that point point in time
 
02:01:21.629 --> 02:01:21.639 align:start position:0%
we did not have enough money in the
 
02:01:24.270 --> 02:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
budget to pass it and at that point in
 
02:01:28.470 --> 02:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
time we actually amended the bill um and
 
02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
asked that the department include this
 
02:01:34.310 --> 02:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
position in their budget request coming
 
02:01:38.069 --> 02:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
forward to us um now that was a a a
 
02:01:40.629 --> 02:01:40.639 align:start position:0%
bipartisan unanimous vote coming out of
 
02:01:42.750 --> 02:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
the house uh coming out of house finance
 
02:01:46.310 --> 02:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
division to then Co happened and and it
 
02:01:49.030 --> 02:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
lost its way um and didn't end up in in
 
02:01:51.629 --> 02:01:51.639 align:start position:0%
any of the Omnibus bills um that came
 
02:01:54.910 --> 02:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
back to us from the Senate so um I just
 
02:01:58.030 --> 02:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
want to speak um that we really need

near the turn of the century school
 
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
counselors did not only replace guidance

counselors in name but in job

responsive when students presented a
 
02:03:41.109 --> 02:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
need in stark contrast and decades later
 
02:03:43.870 --> 02:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
school counselors by definition now are
 
02:03:46.549 --> 02:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
still responsive as needed but also
 
02:03:48.830 --> 02:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
proactive with all students and I under

counselors work with all students
 
02:04:01.229 --> 02:04:01.239 align:start position:0%
equitably in three domains academic

programming deliver it in a systematic
 
02:04:11.310 --> 02:04:11.320 align:start position:0%
manner with the outcome-based goal of
 
02:04:14.149 --> 02:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
improving the achievement attendance and
 
02:04:17.430 --> 02:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
discipline of all students with this
 
02:04:19.830 --> 02:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
context set it is perhaps most important
 
02:04:22.030 --> 02:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
for this Gathering to understand that
 
02:04:24.189 --> 02:04:24.199 align:start position:0%
school counselors are the profession in
 
02:04:27.030 --> 02:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
our educational system that has its eye

first to students as people and to
 
02:04:33.430 --> 02:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
people as students this Bears repeating
 
02:04:36.310 --> 02:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
school counselors are charged first to
 
02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
work intentionally and holistically with
 
02:04:41.990 --> 02:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
each individual child and each
 
02:04:45.790 --> 02:04:45.800 align:start position:0%

02:04:58.510 --> 02:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
work with students as people the lens
 
02:05:00.510 --> 02:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
with which we enter the building is
 
02:05:03.870 --> 02:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily different simplistically
 
02:05:05.870 --> 02:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
administrators are charged with systems
 
02:05:08.709 --> 02:05:08.719 align:start position:0%

as a person and each person as a student
 
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
indeed as the inevitable pedul of
 
02:05:30.910 --> 02:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
Education swings and we know it does the
 
02:05:33.030 --> 02:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
school counselor Works to steady its
 
02:05:36.350 --> 02:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
impact on students never diminishing one
 
02:05:39.149 --> 02:05:39.159 align:start position:0%
domain for the other when an increase in
 
02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
graduation rate is the state's Focus we
 
02:05:43.229 --> 02:05:43.239 align:start position:0%
rally the troops while still providing
 
02:05:45.790 --> 02:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
social emotional programming in career

exploration when the state shines the
 
02:05:49.390 --> 02:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
light on Mental Health Health we
 
02:05:51.350 --> 02:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
continue career exploration and
 
02:05:54.030 --> 02:05:54.040 align:start position:0%
facilitate achievement toward graduation
 
02:05:55.549 --> 02:05:55.559 align:start position:0%
and when the pendulum swings toward
 
02:05:57.629 --> 02:05:57.639 align:start position:0%
revitalizing New Hampshire's Workforce
 
02:05:59.790 --> 02:05:59.800 align:start position:0%
we jump on board without taking our eye
 
02:06:01.830 --> 02:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
off academic achievement and while still
 
02:06:04.669 --> 02:06:04.679 align:start position:0%
beating the mental health drum to this
 
02:06:07.549 --> 02:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
end it is undeniably crucial that just
 
02:06:09.350 --> 02:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
as our students need the role of the
 
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
school counselor in the schools school
 
02:06:13.709 --> 02:06:13.719 align:start position:0%
counselors need their voice represented
 
02:06:15.589 --> 02:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
at the discussion and decision-making
 
02:06:18.910 --> 02:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
table at the New Hampshire doe further
 
02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
it is critical that our students
 
02:06:22.589 --> 02:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
graduate as healthy individuals prepared
 
02:06:24.709 --> 02:06:24.719 align:start position:0%
to be positive contributing members of
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
our society in order to do this we must
 
02:06:29.790 --> 02:06:29.800 align:start position:0%
the students must develop tenacity and
 
02:06:32.109 --> 02:06:32.119 align:start position:0%
confidence they must have the fortitude
 
02:06:34.109 --> 02:06:34.119 align:start position:0%
to feel all their layered and evolving
 
02:06:36.350 --> 02:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
emotions and self-regulate and display
 
02:06:38.830 --> 02:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
behaviors appropriate to changing
 
02:06:40.870 --> 02:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
situations they must be able to problem
 
02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
solve collaborate and navigate
 
02:06:43.990 --> 02:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
challenging relationships and they must
 
02:06:46.030 --> 02:06:46.040 align:start position:0%
be able to set and Achieve short and
 
02:06:48.229 --> 02:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
long-term goals they must be able to
 
02:06:50.270 --> 02:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
self reflect articulate and self-
 
02:06:52.229 --> 02:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
Advocate and develop and practice the
 
02:06:55.149 --> 02:06:55.159 align:start position:0%
soft skills every eventual employer
 
02:06:58.589 --> 02:06:58.599 align:start position:0%
demands even during a pandemic and as
 
02:07:00.750 --> 02:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
you know this is just a a partial list
 
02:07:02.790 --> 02:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
of what we need from our New Hampshire
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
graduates students have teachers that
 
02:07:06.870 --> 02:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
typically are with them for one year and
 
02:07:08.430 --> 02:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire teachers do amazing
 
02:07:10.270 --> 02:07:10.280 align:start position:0%
with our students in classrooms weaving
 
02:07:11.709 --> 02:07:11.719 align:start position:0%
these skills into their work with
 
02:07:14.109 --> 02:07:14.119 align:start position:0%
students however this work is too
 
02:07:16.069 --> 02:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
important to leave its acquisition to
 
02:07:18.669 --> 02:07:18.679 align:start position:0%
chance most often counselors are with
 
02:07:20.910 --> 02:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
the same student year after year after
 
02:07:22.629 --> 02:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
year supporting their developmental
 
02:07:25.350 --> 02:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
growth not only that does this allow for
 
02:07:27.189 --> 02:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
consistency and accountability and
 
02:07:29.589 --> 02:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
programming but relationship building
 
02:07:32.350 --> 02:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
between counselor and student as well
 
02:07:34.109 --> 02:07:34.119 align:start position:0%
strong relationships after all are the
 
02:07:37.669 --> 02:07:37.679 align:start position:0%

02:07:39.790 --> 02:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
decisions that impact our youth in
 
02:07:41.310 --> 02:07:41.320 align:start position:0%

you mentioned you're in several uh
 
02:08:47.790 --> 02:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
associations um do does every state have
 
02:08:50.109 --> 02:08:50.119 align:start position:0%
this type of positioned you know or or
 
02:08:53.069 --> 02:08:53.079 align:start position:0%
not uh just I have no idea would this be
 
02:08:55.470 --> 02:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
peculiar to New Hampshire or are we like
 
02:08:57.629 --> 02:08:57.639 align:start position:0%
the only state that does not have this
 
02:09:00.629 --> 02:09:00.639 align:start position:0%
uh that that's my my
 
02:09:03.390 --> 02:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
question so we have school counselors
 
02:09:05.549 --> 02:09:05.559 align:start position:0%
are in every state and whether they have
 
02:09:07.510 --> 02:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
a position at the board level I would
 
02:09:09.510 --> 02:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
assume so but I don't know that the
 
02:09:11.350 --> 02:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
American School counsel Association is
 
02:09:14.030 --> 02:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
across the state but I do believe from
 
02:09:16.470 --> 02:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
my experience that every professional in
 
02:09:18.709 --> 02:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
the school has a representative voice
 
02:09:20.709 --> 02:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
and their doe but somebody may be able
 
02:09:23.549 --> 02:09:23.559 align:start position:0%

department of Ed that hears our

02:11:46.030 --> 02:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
unique position in the school we serve
 
02:11:49.270 --> 02:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
all students social emotional

categorized with teachers and special ed
 
02:12:03.589 --> 02:12:03.599 align:start position:0%
Educators currently at our state

02:12:08.229 --> 02:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
would talk to someone in the student
 
02:12:08.239 --> 02:12:10.350 align:start position:0%
would talk to someone in the student
services

02:12:10.350 --> 02:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:12:13.470 --> 02:12:13.480 align:start position:0%

under student services only service a
 
02:12:34.430 --> 02:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
small percentage of students in school
 
02:12:36.589 --> 02:12:36.599 align:start position:0%
before the co epidemic school counselors
 
02:12:38.830 --> 02:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
were at the Forefront of our state
 
02:12:40.189 --> 02:12:40.199 align:start position:0%

counselors have stood with families and
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
students as the Mental Health crisis

school counselors have been called upon
 
02:12:53.830 --> 02:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
to help students remotely and in person
 
02:12:56.350 --> 02:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
cope with the daily struggles of life in
 
02:12:57.950 --> 02:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
the everyday of the
 
02:13:01.350 --> 02:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
pandemic in my own experience the daily
 
02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
job this year has been so much
 
02:13:07.830 --> 02:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
harder it's hard to watch a child you
 
02:13:10.270 --> 02:13:10.280 align:start position:0%
know um who has an intensive Mental
 
02:13:11.790 --> 02:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
Health Care crisis with her while they
 
02:13:14.310 --> 02:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:17.589 --> 02:13:17.599 align:start position:0%
bed it also I have also watched this
 
02:13:19.229 --> 02:13:19.239 align:start position:0%
this year as families
 
02:13:21.030 --> 02:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
disintegrated as a seventh and eighth
 
02:13:22.589 --> 02:13:22.599 align:start position:0%
grade school counselor I've had to sit
 
02:13:25.109 --> 02:13:25.119 align:start position:0%
with students in grief over the loss of
 
02:13:28.069 --> 02:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
social connections and Independence they
 
02:13:29.830 --> 02:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
thought they would gain in eighth grade
 
02:13:31.189 --> 02:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
and seventh
 
02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
grade also during this critical time
 
02:13:35.629 --> 02:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
while I'm dealing with Children's Mental
 
02:13:35.639 --> 02:13:36.870 align:start position:0%
while I'm dealing with Children's Mental
Health

02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:36.880 align:start position:0%

needs I have had to also make seven
Master

02:13:41.189 --> 02:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
Master
 
02:13:45.950 --> 02:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
schedules and coordinate the niwa and
 
02:13:48.830 --> 02:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
SAS the reality is there's I only have
 
02:13:50.750 --> 02:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
so much time and I have to prioritize
 
02:13:55.390 --> 02:13:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:57.669 --> 02:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
undone at the end of the day when you
 
02:14:00.350 --> 02:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
reach out to the Department of Ed in our
 
02:14:03.069 --> 02:14:03.079 align:start position:0%
state often our questions are left
 
02:14:05.430 --> 02:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
unanswered and that silence is deafening
 
02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:07.270 align:start position:0%
unanswered and that silence is deafening
and

02:14:07.270 --> 02:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:08.830 align:start position:0%
and
disheartening

02:14:08.830 --> 02:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
disheartening
 
02:14:11.229 --> 02:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
we uh it's not surprising that the
 
02:14:13.109 --> 02:14:13.119 align:start position:0%
person can't answer our questions as
 
02:14:15.669 --> 02:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
student services is a wide variety of
 
02:14:18.030 --> 02:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
professions and they probably can't
 
02:14:21.430 --> 02:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
possibly know the ethics and laws under
 
02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:23.390 align:start position:0%

hear me now I'll be very brief I know
 
02:16:28.430 --> 02:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
that you are are tied tied on time so my
 
02:16:30.790 --> 02:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
name is Amar Banfield I'm an advocate
 
02:16:33.070 --> 02:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
for parental rights and academic EXC
 
02:16:35.509 --> 02:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
excellence and education today I
 
02:16:37.950 --> 02:16:37.960 align:start position:0%
actually come here in opposition of HB
 
02:16:40.549 --> 02:16:40.559 align:start position:0%
96 so why would someone who supports
 
02:16:42.070 --> 02:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
parental rights and excellence and
 
02:16:43.790 --> 02:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
education oppose funding for
 
02:16:45.750 --> 02:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
establishing a school counselor
 
02:16:48.110 --> 02:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the office of School
 
02:16:49.190 --> 02:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
counseling and
 
02:16:51.389 --> 02:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
psychology primarily because there are
 
02:16:52.950 --> 02:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
more important mental health needs that
 
02:16:54.509 --> 02:16:54.519 align:start position:0%
children have and I want to share that
 
02:16:55.589 --> 02:16:55.599 align:start position:0%
with you
 
02:16:58.030 --> 02:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
today mental health needs of children
 
02:16:59.669 --> 02:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
are probably more important today than
 
02:17:02.349 --> 02:17:02.359 align:start position:0%
at any other time Co shutdowns of
 
02:17:04.190 --> 02:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
schools and the lack of socialization
 
02:17:06.429 --> 02:17:06.439 align:start position:0%
are having a terrible impact on many
 
02:17:08.469 --> 02:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
children throughout New Hampshire I
 
02:17:09.990 --> 02:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
interact with New Hampshire parents
 
02:17:11.790 --> 02:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
daily whose children are having mental
 
02:17:13.669 --> 02:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
breakdowns because of the isolation from
 
02:17:16.110 --> 02:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
school closures it is important to
 
02:17:17.709 --> 02:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
mention that there are some who are
 
02:17:19.910 --> 02:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
still thriving but that is not the case
 
02:17:22.389 --> 02:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
for many of the children in our state
 
02:17:24.669 --> 02:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
and fortunate fortunately many of these
 
02:17:26.790 --> 02:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
cases do not rise to the level of
 
02:17:28.950 --> 02:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
desperation but I'm here to talk about
 
02:17:31.830 --> 02:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
the ones that do when children suffer
 
02:17:33.549 --> 02:17:33.559 align:start position:0%
emotionally sometimes that results in
 
02:17:36.870 --> 02:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
depression anger and even worse suicidal
 
02:17:39.190 --> 02:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
attempts Health Care Professionals are
 
02:17:40.469 --> 02:17:40.479 align:start position:0%
the ones who have to deal with those
 
02:17:42.830 --> 02:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
situations and often times the first
 
02:17:45.709 --> 02:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
responder is the local emergency room
 
02:17:47.110 --> 02:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
once those children are admitted there
 
02:17:49.549 --> 02:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
is a call the Hamstead Hospital the only
 
02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
Treatment Facility in New Hampshire that
 
02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:52.830 align:start position:0%
Treatment Facility in New Hampshire that
admits

02:17:52.830 --> 02:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
admits
 
02:17:54.990 --> 02:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
adolescence it would be nice to report
 
02:17:56.709 --> 02:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
to you that when this happens children
 
02:17:59.270 --> 02:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
are admitted immediately and treated by
 
02:18:01.270 --> 02:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
a specialist in mental health
 
02:18:03.790 --> 02:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that is not the case if
 
02:18:05.950 --> 02:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
there is no space available the child
 
02:18:07.830 --> 02:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
can sit in the hospital your local
 
02:18:10.349 --> 02:18:10.359 align:start position:0%
hospital for days and sometimes a week
 
02:18:13.429 --> 02:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
or longer can you imagine the cost to
 
02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
the state when day after day these kids
 
02:18:17.669 --> 02:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
are sitting in the local hospital
 
02:18:19.509 --> 02:18:19.519 align:start position:0%
untreated by a mental health
 
02:18:22.349 --> 02:18:22.359 align:start position:0%
professional HB 96 creates a new
 
02:18:23.950 --> 02:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic position within the
 
02:18:26.309 --> 02:18:26.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Education this position
 
02:18:27.790 --> 02:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
does not in any way meet the
 
02:18:29.870 --> 02:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
psychological needs of children that
 
02:18:32.910 --> 02:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
require Services right now it does not
 
02:18:35.870 --> 02:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
Elevate the wait time alleviate the wait
 
02:18:37.790 --> 02:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
time that would offer some relief to the
 
02:18:39.309 --> 02:18:39.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and it certainly does not
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
offer relief to Children Sitting In
 
02:18:43.990 --> 02:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
Limbo so I share the concerns that
 
02:18:46.270 --> 02:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
everyone has expressed so far but I
 
02:18:47.709 --> 02:18:47.719 align:start position:0%
believe that there are better ways to
 
02:18:49.669 --> 02:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
allocate These funds to address the much
 
02:18:52.110 --> 02:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
needed issues of treating the mental
 
02:18:54.190 --> 02:18:54.200 align:start position:0%
health of children who need that right
 
02:18:57.750 --> 02:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
now so I ask you to ex vote to
 
02:18:59.870 --> 02:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate and then look
 
02:19:01.990 --> 02:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
at ways to address the desperate need
 
02:19:04.790 --> 02:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
for accessibility Hamstead Hospital how
 
02:19:06.190 --> 02:19:06.200 align:start position:0%
can we work to meet the needs of
 
02:19:08.230 --> 02:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
children so that they do not end up in
 
02:19:10.950 --> 02:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
the ER how can we provide immediate care
 
02:19:12.750 --> 02:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
and allocate funding to cover those
 
02:19:15.030 --> 02:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
costs in the end it would save the state
 
02:19:17.030 --> 02:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
money if children have immediate access
 
02:19:19.230 --> 02:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
to ham Hospital instead of sitting in
 
02:19:21.629 --> 02:19:21.639 align:start position:0%
our local hospital waiting room or
 
02:19:24.270 --> 02:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
waiting for a room let's prioritize
 
02:19:26.309 --> 02:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
spending on mental health for children
 
02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
adding another bureaucratic position at
 
02:19:29.910 --> 02:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education may be a
 
02:19:32.549 --> 02:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
nice want but there are too many needs
 
02:19:34.030 --> 02:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
right now to move this legislation
 
02:19:36.790 --> 02:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
forward and I'll just add that speaking
 
02:19:39.589 --> 02:19:39.599 align:start position:0%
personally on a personal um personal
 
02:19:42.190 --> 02:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
issue with a friend whose son did end up
 
02:19:45.070 --> 02:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
in the hospital for a suicide attempt
 
02:19:47.669 --> 02:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
just a short time ago um I I believe
 
02:19:50.429 --> 02:19:50.439 align:start position:0%
there was 58 people in front in line
 
02:19:52.910 --> 02:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
waiting to get into Hamstead hospital
 
02:19:55.429 --> 02:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
before that before he could be admitted
 
02:19:58.349 --> 02:19:58.359 align:start position:0%
uh and if they're speaking with um
 
02:20:00.309 --> 02:20:00.319 align:start position:0%
Hamstead Hospital a representative there
 
02:20:02.990 --> 02:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
I mean that that differs from day to day
 
02:20:04.750 --> 02:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
but I just think that when I look at
 
02:20:06.429 --> 02:20:06.439 align:start position:0%
this position and and I know that the
 
02:20:08.110 --> 02:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
school counselors are doing their best
 
02:20:09.670 --> 02:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
and and I think you know we are hearing
 
02:20:11.630 --> 02:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
from some that are that are doing you
 
02:20:15.150 --> 02:20:15.160 align:start position:0%
know phenomenal work I just see this as
 
02:20:17.030 --> 02:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking these kids are sitting in
 
02:20:18.870 --> 02:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
the hospital sometimes for a week I
 
02:20:20.910 --> 02:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
can't even even imagine what the cost is
 
02:20:22.349 --> 02:20:22.359 align:start position:0%
so anyway I want to thank you for taking
 
02:20:24.389 --> 02:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
my testimony I don't mean to be the only
 
02:20:26.710 --> 02:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
person who you know opposes something
 
02:20:28.190 --> 02:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
good but I just think that we need to
 
02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
prioritize and I think that this is
 
02:20:31.990 --> 02:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
something that the the funds could be
 
02:20:35.150 --> 02:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
used in a better way so thank you thank
 
02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
you very much amarie are there any
 
02:20:39.830 --> 02:20:39.840 align:start position:0%

02:23:53.429 --> 02:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
and then the Senate did some of their um
 
02:23:57.309 --> 02:23:57.319 align:start position:0%
their uh interesting tricks by adding uh
 
02:23:59.830 --> 02:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
this popular Bill to another bill in
 
02:24:02.670 --> 02:24:02.680 align:start position:0%
order to have the house um approve both
 
02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
of them and uh and the house didn't take
 
02:24:08.630 --> 02:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
the bait and non-c concurred and so uh
 
02:24:12.110 --> 02:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
this this was the victim um this is a
 
02:24:15.550 --> 02:24:15.560 align:start position:0%
bill um actually charter schools have
 
02:24:17.590 --> 02:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
have had quite a long history I'll give
 
02:24:19.230 --> 02:24:19.240 align:start position:0%
you a brief background originally
 
02:24:21.150 --> 02:24:21.160 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools were not allowed to
 
02:24:25.750 --> 02:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
incur long-term debt to um to have their
 
02:24:29.070 --> 02:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
own facility um that was signed by
 
02:24:32.110 --> 02:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
Governor Lynch and changed and uh then
 
02:24:34.630 --> 02:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
we went to governor sonunu who changed
 
02:24:38.070 --> 02:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
it further um and allowed uh them to
 
02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
have long-term debt without having to uh
 
02:24:42.830 --> 02:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
go first through their fiveyear
 
02:24:47.070 --> 02:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
certification program and um and now uh
 
02:24:51.630 --> 02:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
this is a bill to um increase the um the
 
02:24:55.469 --> 02:24:55.479 align:start position:0%
efficiency of taxpayer money um this is
 
02:24:58.389 --> 02:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
uh to allow charter schools to utilize
 
02:25:00.710 --> 02:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
some of that funding that they currently
 
02:25:06.150 --> 02:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
get uh to um either purchase or lease um
 
02:25:08.269 --> 02:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
unused school
 
02:25:11.110 --> 02:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
facilities from directly from the uh
 
02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:12.110 align:start position:0%
facilities from directly from the uh
school

02:25:12.110 --> 02:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:25:16.590 --> 02:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
district and to allow them um to have a
 
02:25:20.389 --> 02:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh better suited building for them um
 
02:25:24.269 --> 02:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
and and not have to rely on items like
 
02:25:27.510 --> 02:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh renting space in in Supermarket malls
 
02:25:31.990 --> 02:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
or anything like that um at at some
 
02:25:35.030 --> 02:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
point here we have only uh 30 three of
 
02:25:37.030 --> 02:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
our 30 Charter Schools currently have
 
02:25:40.469 --> 02:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
their own building that's uh my current
 
02:25:44.510 --> 02:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
belief um most lease or rent space from
 
02:25:46.910 --> 02:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
other public school districts or
 
02:25:46.920 --> 02:25:48.269 align:start position:0%
other public school districts or
for-profit

02:25:48.269 --> 02:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
for-profit
 
02:25:50.950 --> 02:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
landlords um an important point is that
 
02:25:55.030 --> 02:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of per pupil dollar
 
02:25:58.230 --> 02:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
goes to building expenses and additional
 
02:26:00.630 --> 02:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
money is often used to make the property
 
02:26:03.230 --> 02:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
suitable for Charter School students as
 
02:26:04.429 --> 02:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
a learning
 
02:26:07.950 --> 02:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
environment um not only do they pay for
 
02:26:10.469 --> 02:26:10.479 align:start position:0%
the um if they go to a for-profit
 
02:26:12.870 --> 02:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
landlord some of their money would
 
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
actually be going towards real estate
 
02:26:20.870 --> 02:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
taxes in fact so um our goal here um is
 
02:26:26.429 --> 02:26:26.439 align:start position:0%
to provide um charter schools and and um
 
02:26:29.110 --> 02:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
public school districts the ability to
 
02:26:31.990 --> 02:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
be married together and create a willing
 
02:26:35.870 --> 02:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
seller willing buyer um scenario the
 
02:26:37.830 --> 02:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
only thing there's two things that are
 
02:26:40.510 --> 02:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
different in this legislation uh versus
 
02:26:42.630 --> 02:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
what the house education has seen in the
 
02:26:47.230 --> 02:26:47.240 align:start position:0%
past and that's uh to address um um
 
02:26:50.830 --> 02:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
objectives uh or objections from um uh
 
02:26:54.510 --> 02:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
our Democrat colleagues in the past one
 
02:26:56.990 --> 02:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
um there is an amendment that I have had
 
02:27:00.150 --> 02:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
drafted I think it's amendment
 
02:27:03.630 --> 02:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
0199 that should be in your in your box
 
02:27:07.030 --> 02:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere there um and that deals with
 
02:27:12.110 --> 02:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
um page two line 11 I think um where it
 
02:27:13.750 --> 02:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
talks about
 
02:27:17.630 --> 02:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
91a um I too thought the original
 
02:27:20.950 --> 02:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
drafting of this bill was a little
 
02:27:24.349 --> 02:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
confusing um this is dealing when two
 
02:27:27.469 --> 02:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools both are applying for
 
02:27:29.349 --> 02:27:29.359 align:start position:0%
the same
 
02:27:33.030 --> 02:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
property um what we were hoping to do
 
02:27:36.830 --> 02:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
was have the um the criteria that the
 
02:27:40.950 --> 02:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
school district would use to determine
 
02:27:42.990 --> 02:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
which charter school should have the
 
02:27:45.790 --> 02:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
right of first refusal we wanted that
 
02:27:49.110 --> 02:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
criteria discussion to be public we did
 
02:27:51.150 --> 02:27:51.160 align:start position:0%
not want the
 
02:27:55.349 --> 02:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
individual um discussion of any of the
 
02:27:58.830 --> 02:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
details of the of the two applicants to
 
02:28:01.030 --> 02:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
be made public so we don't need to talk
 
02:28:03.750 --> 02:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
about their bank statements or anything
 
02:28:07.429 --> 02:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
like that in public session but in in
 
02:28:10.429 --> 02:28:10.439 align:start position:0%
Prior language it it mentioned 91a and
 
02:28:14.309 --> 02:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
it said it was not subject to 91a and to
 
02:28:18.269 --> 02:28:18.279 align:start position:0%
me anytime in information is public that
 
02:28:22.230 --> 02:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
makes it subject to 91a so I've had um
 
02:28:28.750 --> 02:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
OS scrub that section on um 91a
 
02:28:31.510 --> 02:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
adherence and so the the sentence would
 
02:28:34.590 --> 02:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
end at um public
 
02:28:37.269 --> 02:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
information then uh the second item that
 
02:28:41.110 --> 02:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
I had uh removed or changed in this
 
02:28:44.429 --> 02:28:44.439 align:start position:0%
legislation um we had originally uh
 
02:28:47.389 --> 02:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
asked individual School District
 
02:28:49.870 --> 02:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
when they had property that was
 
02:28:52.750 --> 02:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
available for lease or for sale we had
 
02:28:55.550 --> 02:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
asked them to uh that they would have to
 
02:28:58.510 --> 02:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
contact each Charter School by
 
02:29:01.710 --> 02:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
registered letter um notifying them that
 
02:29:04.550 --> 02:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
they had this property available and and
 
02:29:06.389 --> 02:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
our Democrat colleagues correctly
 
02:29:09.150 --> 02:29:09.160 align:start position:0%
pointed out that was an honorous task
 
02:29:12.309 --> 02:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
and perhaps uh violated
 
02:29:16.870 --> 02:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
28a I agree so um the only thing that we
 
02:29:19.110 --> 02:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
have changed here is to require the
 
02:29:23.790 --> 02:29:23.800 align:start position:0%
districts to contact UM the doe once um
 
02:29:27.469 --> 02:29:27.479 align:start position:0%
with the uh that information and the
 
02:29:29.950 --> 02:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
charter school coordinator would be the
 
02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
one that would contact each of the um of
 
02:29:35.750 --> 02:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
the charter schools making them aware of
 
02:29:39.309 --> 02:29:39.319 align:start position:0%
the availability of this property um and
 
02:29:42.790 --> 02:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
with that I think um I will just pretty
 
02:29:46.870 --> 02:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
much say that uh for the the mail that I
 
02:29:49.710 --> 02:29:49.720 align:start position:0%
received uh from taxpayers um who
 
02:29:53.429 --> 02:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
question why their child is on a charge
 
02:29:57.030 --> 02:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
of school waiting list um and uh and
 
02:30:01.110 --> 02:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
can't find suitable property to um to
 
02:30:04.190 --> 02:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
handle more children um meanwhile their
 
02:30:06.870 --> 02:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
neighborhood school is empty and and
 
02:30:09.550 --> 02:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
their tax money is going to maintain an
 
02:30:12.469 --> 02:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
empty building um they seem slightly
 
02:30:15.309 --> 02:30:15.319 align:start position:0%
confused and um and so I think this
 
02:30:18.710 --> 02:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
would uh I think this would be a um a
 
02:30:20.910 --> 02:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
good step in the direction of uh of
 
02:30:22.950 --> 02:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
being more efficient and as a financial
 
02:30:26.150 --> 02:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
advisor I'm always looking for financial
 
02:30:28.469 --> 02:30:28.479 align:start position:0%
efficiency um with that I'll end my
 
02:30:30.230 --> 02:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm happy to answer any
 
02:30:33.510 --> 02:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
questions and I appreciate your time
 
02:30:34.910 --> 02:30:34.920 align:start position:0%

0199 uh was that forwarded to uh leg
 
02:30:47.389 --> 02:30:47.399 align:start position:0%

were just trying to get a system set up
 
02:31:36.230 --> 02:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
where amendments would go out to
 
02:31:38.150 --> 02:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
committee members as well to expedite
 
02:31:41.590 --> 02:31:41.600 align:start position:0%

bringing this um this forward um
 
02:31:58.110 --> 02:31:58.120 align:start position:0%
representative Hill um so are you aware
 
02:32:00.389 --> 02:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
that um that several local school boards
 
02:32:03.030 --> 02:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
have already leased or sold um School
 
02:32:06.030 --> 02:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
District property to uh to Charter
 
02:32:11.269 --> 02:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
Schools um I am aware of at least one um
 
02:32:13.750 --> 02:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
I I think that's a great idea um I have
 
02:32:17.269 --> 02:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
no no problem with the with the process
 
02:32:21.030 --> 02:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh working when it works that way um my
 
02:32:23.670 --> 02:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
understanding from um from others is
 
02:32:26.110 --> 02:32:26.120 align:start position:0%
that uh it doesn't always work that way
 
02:32:30.269 --> 02:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
so follow up on that yes um uh so you
 
02:32:34.110 --> 02:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
use the um the term this would allow uh
 
02:32:36.469 --> 02:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
those sorts of transactions to um to
 
02:32:38.790 --> 02:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
take place is is using that term
 
02:32:38.800 --> 02:32:41.870 align:start position:0%
take place is is using that term
somewhat

02:32:41.870 --> 02:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:45.630 --> 02:32:45.640 align:start position:0%
misleading um if if you would like to um
 
02:32:48.389 --> 02:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
change that and and formulate it your
 
02:32:51.590 --> 02:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
own way I'm happy to let you do that
 
02:32:53.950 --> 02:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
well what you really meant is require
 
02:32:56.269 --> 02:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
require local school boards not allow
 
02:32:58.389 --> 02:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
local school boards is that
 
02:32:58.399 --> 02:33:00.269 align:start position:0%
local school boards is that
correct

02:33:00.269 --> 02:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:33:04.750 --> 02:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
um I am I am requiring districts to make
 
02:33:08.389 --> 02:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
sure that the property is listed um I'm
 
02:33:08.399 --> 02:33:09.349 align:start position:0%
sure that the property is listed um I'm
not

02:33:09.349 --> 02:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:33:13.349 --> 02:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
forcing um charter schools and a public
 
02:33:16.269 --> 02:33:16.279 align:start position:0%
school to to make the transaction happen
 
02:33:20.349 --> 02:33:20.359 align:start position:0%
happen I'm I'm merely um requiring the
 
02:33:25.070 --> 02:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
district to um to list the property um
 
02:33:29.469 --> 02:33:29.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:32.790 --> 02:33:32.800 align:start position:0%

members I am uh speaking today on uh
 
02:34:41.030 --> 02:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
behalf of the members of nhsaa to oppose
 
02:34:44.429 --> 02:34:44.439 align:start position:0%
uh 278 uh in its current form uh we
 
02:34:46.550 --> 02:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate uh representative
 
02:34:49.349 --> 02:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
Hill's interest in securing facilities
 
02:34:51.150 --> 02:34:51.160 align:start position:0%
to house students and provide
 
02:34:54.429 --> 02:34:54.439 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities for them we
 
02:34:56.469 --> 02:34:56.479 align:start position:0%
find the legislation to be troubling
 
02:34:58.630 --> 02:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
however uh in that it really erodes
 
02:35:01.750 --> 02:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
local control um and can create an
 
02:35:04.309 --> 02:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
additional burden on local taxpayers for
 
02:35:06.150 --> 02:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
students who do not necessarily live in
 
02:35:08.590 --> 02:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
that community and imposes state
 
02:35:10.309 --> 02:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
requirements where a local community
 
02:35:14.230 --> 02:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
should have the opportunity uh for
 
02:35:16.710 --> 02:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
self-determination there already exists
 
02:35:19.190 --> 02:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
as representative luno mentioned uh
 
02:35:21.309 --> 02:35:21.319 align:start position:0%
opportunities in a pathway for a local
 
02:35:23.030 --> 02:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
school district to sponsor Charter
 
02:35:27.429 --> 02:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
Schools or to lease or sell uh property
 
02:35:30.670 --> 02:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
uh as they see fit um but there are many
 
02:35:33.349 --> 02:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
districts who are either planning or
 
02:35:36.510 --> 02:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
have uh accomplished repurposing school
 
02:35:38.790 --> 02:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
facilities for other community use
 
02:35:40.230 --> 02:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're used as community
 
02:35:43.630 --> 02:35:43.640 align:start position:0%
centers senior centers uh this proposal
 
02:35:46.389 --> 02:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
would seem to Omit that uh as an an
 
02:35:49.510 --> 02:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
option um several other districts have
 
02:35:52.150 --> 02:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
sold their school district property to
 
02:35:56.150 --> 02:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
bring about taxpayer relief uh so this
 
02:35:58.630 --> 02:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
would also seem to Omit that
 
02:36:01.269 --> 02:36:01.279 align:start position:0%
possibility um all of the building
 
02:36:03.269 --> 02:36:03.279 align:start position:0%
purchases and subsequent maintenance
 
02:36:05.950 --> 02:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
were made with local taxpayer dollars
 
02:36:09.510 --> 02:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
and approval should be the local um
 
02:36:12.349 --> 02:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
community that determines the use of the
 
02:36:15.110 --> 02:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
property uh that they've been uh pouring
 
02:36:19.550 --> 02:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:22.670 --> 02:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
into we uh we frequently hear that
 
02:36:25.150 --> 02:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools uh speak of a wide
 
02:36:26.910 --> 02:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
catchment area of students who they
 
02:36:29.110 --> 02:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
attract yet when they're all gathered
 
02:36:31.590 --> 02:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
Under One Roof can create a tax impact
 
02:36:34.070 --> 02:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
on the community where they're located
 
02:36:36.150 --> 02:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
um demands for goods and services from
 
02:36:38.190 --> 02:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
the local police fire or general
 
02:36:39.550 --> 02:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
services are
 
02:36:42.429 --> 02:36:42.439 align:start position:0%
impacted requiring communities to accept
 
02:36:46.190 --> 02:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools um and their leases uh
 
02:36:48.630 --> 02:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
or purchases uh could impose an
 
02:36:50.990 --> 02:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
additional tax burden on local
 
02:36:53.030 --> 02:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers they should be allowed to have
 
02:36:54.990 --> 02:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
a voice and accepting that additional
 
02:36:57.790 --> 02:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
expense and not be told that they shall
 
02:36:58.990 --> 02:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
accept those
 
02:37:01.830 --> 02:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
schools to force communities to accept
 
02:37:05.830 --> 02:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
lease or P proposals purchase proposals
 
02:37:08.910 --> 02:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
um is simply wrong um and not in a
 
02:37:11.269 --> 02:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
community's best interest uh local
 
02:37:13.070 --> 02:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
citizens should be allowed to make the
 
02:37:14.830 --> 02:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
determination of what happens with their
 
02:37:18.349 --> 02:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
buildings um through existing Pathways
 
02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh and the preservation of local control
 
02:37:23.710 --> 02:37:23.720 align:start position:0%
uh and with that U Mr chairman I know
 
02:37:25.710 --> 02:37:25.720 align:start position:0%
you're pressed for time I'd be glad to
 
02:37:28.030 --> 02:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
take any questions uh thank you very
 
02:37:31.269 --> 02:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
much Dr Lad um are there questions for
 
02:37:34.230 --> 02:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
the school administrators
 
02:37:36.750 --> 02:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
association yes representative luno
 
02:37:38.630 --> 02:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair thank you
 
02:37:41.630 --> 02:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
very much Mr lad for um uh for being
 
02:37:45.389 --> 02:37:45.399 align:start position:0%
with us this morning um is it possible
 
02:37:47.590 --> 02:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
that that some School District property
 
02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
may be subject to um to covenants um
 
02:37:53.750 --> 02:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
particularly if um if the if maybe the
 
02:37:56.030 --> 02:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
land that the school was on was was
 
02:37:58.349 --> 02:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
donated to the district by a
 
02:38:00.590 --> 02:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
family thank you representative luno
 
02:38:03.269 --> 02:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
that's a great question because um I
 
02:38:05.830 --> 02:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
know of several school districts uh that
 
02:38:10.070 --> 02:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
do have schools uh that are um on land
 
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
that is owned by a private family
 
02:38:16.309 --> 02:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
foundation in fact Stratford
 
02:38:18.590 --> 02:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
Public School uh in Stratford New
 
02:38:21.950 --> 02:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um is owned by the Baldwin
 
02:38:25.150 --> 02:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
family um and that property is under a
 
02:38:28.269 --> 02:38:28.279 align:start position:0%
covenant um and it is only to be used
 
02:38:32.070 --> 02:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
for uh public education purposes uh
 
02:38:34.150 --> 02:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
certainly an argument could be made that
 
02:38:35.830 --> 02:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire charter schools are
 
02:38:38.309 --> 02:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
public schools uh but there may be other
 
02:38:44.429 --> 02:38:44.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:47.750 --> 02:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
usage for other
 
02:38:50.670 --> 02:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much Dr Lad
 
02:38:52.230 --> 02:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
02:38:55.630 --> 02:38:55.640 align:start position:0%

come up next yep he has been promoted he
 
02:39:04.830 --> 02:39:04.840 align:start position:0%

02:39:09.110 --> 02:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
chairman lad uh good morning members of
 
02:39:10.750 --> 02:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for allowing me
 
02:39:13.510 --> 02:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
to speak um again for the record Barett
 
02:39:15.070 --> 02:39:15.080 align:start position:0%
Christina executive director of the New
 
02:39:17.469 --> 02:39:17.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school Wards Association we
 
02:39:21.469 --> 02:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
are opposed to House Bill uh 278 um
 
02:39:23.950 --> 02:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
first we certainly Echo um the comments
 
02:39:25.389 --> 02:39:25.399 align:start position:0%
made by the school administrators
 
02:39:27.110 --> 02:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
Association about you know these were
 
02:39:29.630 --> 02:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
local buildings paid for by local um
 
02:39:31.550 --> 02:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayers seems that the local voters
 
02:39:32.950 --> 02:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
should have a say in what happens with
 
02:39:35.910 --> 02:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
their facility um but policy aspect
 
02:39:38.510 --> 02:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
aside um the the language of the bill is
 
02:39:40.510 --> 02:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
concerning because in a lot of places I
 
02:39:42.510 --> 02:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
just I think it's too vague and doesn't
 
02:39:45.269 --> 02:39:45.279 align:start position:0%
make a lot of sense um you know first
 
02:39:47.389 --> 02:39:47.399 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about unused facility
 
02:39:49.550 --> 02:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
in which 10% of the square footage of
 
02:39:53.030 --> 02:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
the building is you is is is being used
 
02:39:55.070 --> 02:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
I I don't know how many buildings we
 
02:39:58.349 --> 02:39:58.359 align:start position:0%
have statewide in which less than 10% of
 
02:40:00.309 --> 02:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
the of the building is being used for
 
02:40:03.110 --> 02:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
direct um student instruction maybe the
 
02:40:04.870 --> 02:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has some numbers
 
02:40:06.550 --> 02:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
on that but I mean if we're talking
 
02:40:09.469 --> 02:40:09.479 align:start position:0%
about less than 10% full my experience
 
02:40:11.309 --> 02:40:11.319 align:start position:0%
is that that building has been shuttered
 
02:40:15.150 --> 02:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
long ago um you know also um direct
 
02:40:16.590 --> 02:40:16.600 align:start position:0%
student instruction I don't know what
 
02:40:18.950 --> 02:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
that necessarily means um in conjunction
 
02:40:21.230 --> 02:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
with the phrase unus facility I mean
 
02:40:23.190 --> 02:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
does that include a gymnasium an
 
02:40:25.230 --> 02:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
auditorium um office space for
 
02:40:28.349 --> 02:40:28.359 align:start position:0%
administrators custodial closets um I
 
02:40:30.150 --> 02:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
just you know the auditorium in the
 
02:40:32.349 --> 02:40:32.359 align:start position:0%
gymnasium at times may be used for some
 
02:40:34.510 --> 02:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
student instruction and at other times
 
02:40:36.349 --> 02:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
not used for student instruction so I'm
 
02:40:38.190 --> 02:40:38.200 align:start position:0%
not sure how we're going to calculate
 
02:40:41.070 --> 02:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
the square footage requirement um also
 
02:40:43.469 --> 02:40:43.479 align:start position:0%
the second criteria um says for which
 
02:40:45.230 --> 02:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
the school district has no school board
 
02:40:47.150 --> 02:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
approv approved written plan for future
 
02:40:49.670 --> 02:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
use um if that's going to be the Lynch
 
02:40:52.150 --> 02:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
pin you know nhba can certainly Advocate
 
02:40:53.750 --> 02:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
to our school boards if they have any of
 
02:40:57.150 --> 02:40:57.160 align:start position:0%
these facilities to develop a plan um
 
02:41:00.150 --> 02:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
between now and and July 1st of of
 
02:41:02.950 --> 02:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
2021 um and also the date this is on
 
02:41:05.429 --> 02:41:05.439 align:start position:0%
page one of the bill line 10 this bill
 
02:41:07.550 --> 02:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
becomes effective July 1st
 
02:41:10.469 --> 02:41:10.479 align:start position:0%
2021 um many if not all of our schools
 
02:41:11.950 --> 02:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
across the state have had a lot of
 
02:41:15.670 --> 02:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
unused um school um uh square footage
 
02:41:18.070 --> 02:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
this past year um as kidss have been
 
02:41:20.309 --> 02:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
either home or remote or a hybrid
 
02:41:22.469 --> 02:41:22.479 align:start position:0%
capacity so I'm not sure if this bill
 
02:41:23.870 --> 02:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
were to pass and become effective I'm
 
02:41:25.269 --> 02:41:25.279 align:start position:0%
not sure how we're going to get through
 
02:41:28.630 --> 02:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
calculating um that uh that that 10% of
 
02:41:31.710 --> 02:41:31.720 align:start position:0%
unused square footage um and the last
 
02:41:33.510 --> 02:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
point that I'll make that I I think is a
 
02:41:36.830 --> 02:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
little unclear on page two lines 22
 
02:41:36.840 --> 02:41:37.590 align:start position:0%
little unclear on page two lines 22
through

02:41:37.590 --> 02:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:41:40.309 --> 02:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
24 um during the term of a lease a
 
02:41:41.750 --> 02:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
Charter Public School shall be
 
02:41:44.190 --> 02:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
responsible for direct expenses I don't
 
02:41:46.590 --> 02:41:46.600 align:start position:0%
know what that means um related to the
 
02:41:49.070 --> 02:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
facility um or any part of the facility
 
02:41:51.750 --> 02:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
least including utilities Insurance
 
02:41:54.110 --> 02:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
maintenance property taxes and repairs I
 
02:41:55.550 --> 02:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
guess my question is what would happen
 
02:41:57.710 --> 02:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
if the if the school district has to
 
02:42:00.910 --> 02:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
take out a bond for repairs to to the
 
02:42:03.750 --> 02:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
facility um whether or not that's a a
 
02:42:06.110 --> 02:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
new roof or an HVAC system or perhaps a
 
02:42:08.110 --> 02:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
new Wing or something significantly
 
02:42:11.070 --> 02:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
substantial um is the charter school
 
02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
then responsible for part of those Bond
 
02:42:16.150 --> 02:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
payments I mean I suppose you could put
 
02:42:18.309 --> 02:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
that in a in a contract or a lease or
 
02:42:20.750 --> 02:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
whatnot but the way the way the language
 
02:42:22.389 --> 02:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
is written all it says is direct
 
02:42:24.710 --> 02:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
expenses and without clarifying exactly
 
02:42:27.070 --> 02:42:27.080 align:start position:0%
what that means um we think that's
 
02:42:28.630 --> 02:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
significantly vague and it's only going
 
02:42:30.790 --> 02:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
to cause you know further problems down
 
02:42:33.670 --> 02:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
the line um so with that uh that
 
02:42:35.950 --> 02:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
concludes my testimony again nhba is
 
02:42:38.950 --> 02:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to House Bill uh 278 the the
 
02:42:41.910 --> 02:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
language is vague I'm not sure um how
 
02:42:43.630 --> 02:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
workable it really is and I'm not sure
 
02:42:45.710 --> 02:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
how many schools actually have have less
 
02:42:47.590 --> 02:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
than 10% of their square footage
 
02:42:49.910 --> 02:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
actually being used and with that I'm
 
02:42:51.349 --> 02:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions from the
 
02:42:53.670 --> 02:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
committee thank you thank you very much
 
02:42:55.349 --> 02:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
uh Barrett are there questions for the
 
02:42:57.150 --> 02:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
school boards Association uh
 
02:42:59.469 --> 02:42:59.479 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett thank you Mr
 
02:43:02.590 --> 02:43:02.600 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Mr Christina um I'm just
 
02:43:04.389 --> 02:43:04.399 align:start position:0%
G to pass on a question that just came
 
02:43:07.230 --> 02:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
to me from a former uh Manchester School
 
02:43:10.469 --> 02:43:10.479 align:start position:0%
Board member uh and she just wanted us
 
02:43:13.389 --> 02:43:13.399 align:start position:0%
to ask uh she points out the city of
 
02:43:16.550 --> 02:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester owns uh the schools in
 
02:43:19.469 --> 02:43:19.479 align:start position:0%
Manchester but in the event of closure
 
02:43:22.110 --> 02:43:22.120 align:start position:0%
the cities can sell the the uh the
 
02:43:24.550 --> 02:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
school properties and the schools and
 
02:43:27.510 --> 02:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
realize a profit so her question is why
 
02:43:29.630 --> 02:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't charter schools have the first
 
02:43:31.990 --> 02:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to purchase an existing
 
02:43:34.110 --> 02:43:34.120 align:start position:0%
school and keep the schools in the
 
02:43:37.710 --> 02:43:37.720 align:start position:0%
education business as opposed to uh
 
02:43:37.720 --> 02:43:38.910 align:start position:0%
education business as opposed to uh
something

02:43:38.910 --> 02:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:43:40.830 --> 02:43:40.840 align:start position:0%
else thank you for the question
 
02:43:42.550 --> 02:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
representative Moffet I mean I certainly
 
02:43:44.510 --> 02:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
can't speak to every facility issue
 
02:43:45.950 --> 02:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
that's occurred in the State the last
 
02:43:48.230 --> 02:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
number of years um the schools that I
 
02:43:51.990 --> 02:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
know that have closed down um and I I I
 
02:43:53.710 --> 02:43:53.720 align:start position:0%
understand this may not be pertinent to
 
02:43:54.990 --> 02:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester I understand they're going
 
02:43:56.670 --> 02:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
through a review of looking at their
 
02:43:58.150 --> 02:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
their spacing and their high schools and
 
02:44:01.550 --> 02:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps consolidation um I suppose you
 
02:44:03.990 --> 02:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
know to the point earlier nothing would
 
02:44:05.469 --> 02:44:05.479 align:start position:0%
stop the school district from
 
02:44:07.830 --> 02:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
approaching a charter school to see if
 
02:44:10.030 --> 02:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
if if they wanted to lease or perhaps
 
02:44:13.150 --> 02:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
purchase um a facility but mandating it
 
02:44:14.910 --> 02:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
is a completely is completely different
 
02:44:17.630 --> 02:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
issue a completely different question um
 
02:44:19.950 --> 02:44:19.960 align:start position:0%
you know so long as there can be that
 
02:44:22.150 --> 02:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
collaboration you know ideally that
 
02:44:24.870 --> 02:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
would be wonderful um but again back to
 
02:44:26.910 --> 02:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
the other issue the the the I'm thinking
 
02:44:29.349 --> 02:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
of one school in my area that closed
 
02:44:32.110 --> 02:44:32.120 align:start position:0%
about 10 years ago um it wasn't because
 
02:44:33.630 --> 02:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
the school was empty it was because the
 
02:44:35.070 --> 02:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
fire chiefs said we're not allowing
 
02:44:37.590 --> 02:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
children in that building anymore so you
 
02:44:39.469 --> 02:44:39.479 align:start position:0%
know I think a lot of these get to do
 
02:44:41.830 --> 02:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
with the age of our facilities you know
 
02:44:43.309 --> 02:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
I think I read a report the other day
 
02:44:45.469 --> 02:44:45.479 align:start position:0%
the average age of a facility a school
 
02:44:47.389 --> 02:44:47.399 align:start position:0%
facility in New Hampshire is like 60 or
 
02:44:49.670 --> 02:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
70 years old at some point it just
 
02:44:51.429 --> 02:44:51.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't become safe anymore at some
 
02:44:54.070 --> 02:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
point um you know the repairs that would
 
02:44:56.150 --> 02:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
be needed to keep that school up to code
 
02:44:58.670 --> 02:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
and keep children safe it doesn't it
 
02:45:01.190 --> 02:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't become financially possible to
 
02:45:03.710 --> 02:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
do that and I guess the bigger issue is
 
02:45:06.750 --> 02:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
um you know I understand that the
 
02:45:09.110 --> 02:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
charter schools May from time to time
 
02:45:12.830 --> 02:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
have trouble finding um finding space
 
02:45:14.510 --> 02:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps the answer is re-implementation
 
02:45:15.630 --> 02:45:15.640 align:start position:0%
of a building
 
02:45:17.469 --> 02:45:17.479 align:start position:0%
um program in New Hampshire rather than
 
02:45:18.950 --> 02:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
mandating that local school districts
 
02:45:20.910 --> 02:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
sell their facilities to educate
 
02:45:22.910 --> 02:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
children from other
 
02:45:25.590 --> 02:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
communities thank you sir thank you very

gonna have a very busy day so I won't

take too much of your time
 
02:46:17.510 --> 02:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh we we truly believe that this is a
 
02:46:19.790 --> 02:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
common sense bill for New Hampshire we
 
02:46:20.990 --> 02:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
believe that it would benefit both
 
02:46:23.269 --> 02:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
Public Schools uh public charter schools
 
02:46:25.230 --> 02:46:25.240 align:start position:0%
and school districts that maintain
 
02:46:27.269 --> 02:46:27.279 align:start position:0%
public facility space that's unoccupied
 
02:46:29.309 --> 02:46:29.319 align:start position:0%
or no longer in
 
02:46:32.870 --> 02:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
use uh as you've as you've heard before
 
02:46:35.269 --> 02:46:35.279 align:start position:0%
if this bill is passed it would give New
 
02:46:36.710 --> 02:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Charter Schools the right of
 
02:46:39.990 --> 02:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
first refusal in the event that a public
 
02:46:42.269 --> 02:46:42.279 align:start position:0%
school district elects we're not forcing
 
02:46:44.990 --> 02:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
anyone if they elect to sell or lease on
 
02:46:47.349 --> 02:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
unused schools district facility
 
02:46:49.630 --> 02:46:49.640 align:start position:0%
space uh Public Schools they're unique
 
02:46:52.750 --> 02:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
entities they're unique structures and
 
02:46:54.990 --> 02:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
uh they're dear to all of us Public
 
02:46:57.349 --> 02:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
Schools were built using public funds
 
02:46:59.389 --> 02:46:59.399 align:start position:0%
with the intention of educating public
 
02:46:59.399 --> 02:47:00.349 align:start position:0%
with the intention of educating public
school

02:47:00.349 --> 02:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:47:02.309 --> 02:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
students uh their public school
 
02:47:04.550 --> 02:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
buildings are uniquely configured making
 
02:47:07.030 --> 02:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
them most suited to function as public
 
02:47:09.910 --> 02:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
schools we therefore believe that if an
 
02:47:11.990 --> 02:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
unused school facility is destined to be
 
02:47:14.750 --> 02:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
leased or sold that it only makes sense
 
02:47:17.030 --> 02:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
that it should go to well it should go
 
02:47:19.309 --> 02:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
first to a public school such as a
 
02:47:20.950 --> 02:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
charter school or even another public
 
02:47:23.469 --> 02:47:23.479 align:start position:0%
school that is interested um Charter
 
02:47:25.710 --> 02:47:25.720 align:start position:0%
Schools struggle struggle to access F
 
02:47:28.030 --> 02:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
facility space because unlike your
 
02:47:29.750 --> 02:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
traditional public school they do not
 
02:47:31.790 --> 02:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
receive uh financial assistance to
 
02:47:35.070 --> 02:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
purchase or build facility space uh I
 
02:47:37.070 --> 02:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
think I'd like to take a moment to
 
02:47:40.070 --> 02:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
address some of the issues that that I
 
02:47:43.950 --> 02:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
heard brought up uh with regard to
 
02:47:43.960 --> 02:47:45.469 align:start position:0%
heard brought up uh with regard to
districts

02:47:45.469 --> 02:47:45.479 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:47:49.670 --> 02:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
offering lease space I'm only aware of
 
02:47:51.990 --> 02:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
three charter schools that were
 
02:47:55.590 --> 02:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
offered School District lease space uh
 
02:47:57.590 --> 02:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
one of those being SEO charter school
 
02:47:59.510 --> 02:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
and that was that school was
 
02:48:03.790 --> 02:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
actually um removed from their
 
02:48:06.030 --> 02:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
facility uh and they had to find Space
 
02:48:08.910 --> 02:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
of their own I'm only aware of three
 
02:48:11.070 --> 02:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
charter schools in New Hampshire that
 
02:48:13.150 --> 02:48:13.160 align:start position:0%
own their own facility space and none of
 
02:48:14.990 --> 02:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
those schools purchased the facility
 
02:48:18.230 --> 02:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
space from the district so I'm not sure
 
02:48:19.990 --> 02:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
what Charter what other Charter Schools
 
02:48:22.230 --> 02:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
lease facility space from the districts
 
02:48:23.750 --> 02:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
or and I'm certainly not aware of any
 
02:48:25.429 --> 02:48:25.439 align:start position:0%
charter schools that purchase facility
 
02:48:26.910 --> 02:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
space from
 
02:48:29.830 --> 02:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
districts um in terms of what would
 
02:48:33.670 --> 02:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
happen should a charter school lease a
 
02:48:37.110 --> 02:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
facility and uh certain expenses come up
 
02:48:39.190 --> 02:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
I imagine that it would be the
 
02:48:42.030 --> 02:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
same as what would happen with any other
 
02:48:46.510 --> 02:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
lease all of those expenses would be um
 
02:48:48.150 --> 02:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
contained within the terms and
 
02:48:50.790 --> 02:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
conditions of a contract as would be the
 
02:48:53.590 --> 02:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
same case with any other leasy and I'm
 
02:48:55.750 --> 02:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
02:48:57.990 --> 02:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much uh Mr
 
02:49:02.750 --> 02:49:02.760 align:start position:0%

well if they've already sent in their
 
03:43:46.670 --> 03:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
testimony um I don't understand why they
 
03:43:49.630 --> 03:43:49.640 align:start position:0%
need to to because I recognize a lot of
 
03:43:52.389 --> 03:43:52.399 align:start position:0%
these names on here as because I wrote
 
03:43:55.550 --> 03:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
down every single name last night that I
 
03:43:58.710 --> 03:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
had testimony of on
 
03:44:02.030 --> 03:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
my so I don't know it's gonna be well
 
03:44:05.189 --> 03:44:05.199 align:start position:0%
whatever I'll do my best to expedite
 
03:44:08.309 --> 03:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
this as much as we can uh we're not
 
03:44:10.510 --> 03:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
going to have anybody repeating what has
 
03:44:12.750 --> 03:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
been said by somebody else they can say
 
03:44:15.030 --> 03:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
they support what the other person has
 
03:44:18.910 --> 03:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
said but there's no need to just repeat
 
03:44:22.269 --> 03:44:22.279 align:start position:0%
repeat repeat repeat uh we all will be
 
03:44:22.279 --> 03:44:23.110 align:start position:0%
repeat repeat repeat uh we all will be
here

03:44:23.110 --> 03:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:44:28.229 --> 03:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
forever um and so um it's also we will
 
03:44:30.429 --> 03:44:30.439 align:start position:0%
be careful with the amount of time that
 
03:44:33.269 --> 03:44:33.279 align:start position:0%
we allow um there will be some
 
03:44:34.990 --> 03:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
situations where we need to spend a
 
03:44:38.389 --> 03:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
little bit more time on but uh uh we we
 
03:44:40.870 --> 03:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
need to get away from you all the
 
03:44:43.189 --> 03:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
storytelling and we need to get down to
 
03:44:45.710 --> 03:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
addressing specifics within the
 
03:44:45.720 --> 03:44:47.950 align:start position:0%
addressing specifics within the
bill

03:44:47.950 --> 03:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:44:50.750 --> 03:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
right I will I will mention that at the
 
03:44:53.110 --> 03:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
beginning of of the
 
03:44:55.389 --> 03:44:55.399 align:start position:0%
hearing yeah we don't need somebody's
 
03:44:55.399 --> 03:44:56.670 align:start position:0%
hearing yeah we don't need somebody's
life

03:44:56.670 --> 03:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
life
 
03:44:59.269 --> 03:44:59.279 align:start position:0%
history exactly you don't need to hear
 
03:45:02.389 --> 03:45:02.399 align:start position:0%
another nurse's report for 15 minutes
 
03:45:04.870 --> 03:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
either right yeah that's what I meant
 
03:45:08.149 --> 03:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
it's not just that any any particular
 
03:45:10.710 --> 03:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
person it's all the people that we we're
 
03:45:15.630 --> 03:45:15.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to just state that
 
03:45:18.630 --> 03:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
stay to the content the intent of this
 
03:45:22.670 --> 03:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
bill re respond to the bill uh and the
 
03:45:25.149 --> 03:45:25.159 align:start position:0%
language within the bill and I think we
 
03:45:27.990 --> 03:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
will be able to move this thing along
 
03:45:30.510 --> 03:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
and we don't need to go into the history
 
03:45:32.750 --> 03:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
of all the folks that are you know
 
03:45:35.110 --> 03:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
testifying here so that that just
 
03:45:37.110 --> 03:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
absorbs time and really doesn't net us
 
03:45:38.710 --> 03:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
anything that's going to help us in
 
03:45:40.590 --> 03:45:40.600 align:start position:0%
deciding where to go with the the
 
03:45:44.110 --> 03:45:44.120 align:start position:0%
bill can we just want the facts ma'am
 
03:45:46.870 --> 03:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
the facts is what we want yes can we
 
03:45:50.229 --> 03:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
limit them can we Rec they stay between
 
03:45:53.830 --> 03:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
three to five minutes um I would prefer
 
03:45:55.910 --> 03:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
as the chair has that discretion we have
 
03:45:58.630 --> 03:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
some folks which will have that'll be
 
03:46:00.830 --> 03:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
technical advice for us which have
 
03:46:03.950 --> 03:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
specifics and new factual information
 
03:46:07.229 --> 03:46:07.239 align:start position:0%
and um those people may need uh a little
 
03:46:09.990 --> 03:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
bit more time the prime sponsors us need
 
03:46:12.510 --> 03:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit more time to get the thing
 
03:46:15.670 --> 03:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
initiated I figured that I blocked off
 
03:46:19.870 --> 03:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
six hours and uh so I'll Stick Around
 
03:46:22.309 --> 03:46:22.319 align:start position:0%

of dessert on the other one I put a blue
 
03:46:34.229 --> 03:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
tie on and and there's nothing wrong
 
03:46:36.550 --> 03:46:36.560 align:start position:0%

03:46:39.189 --> 03:46:39.199 align:start position:0%

there thank you Mr chair my apologies
 
03:48:45.950 --> 03:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
for being late I was plowing and just
 
03:48:48.309 --> 03:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
about made it back in time I am
 
03:48:50.030 --> 03:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
Representative Steven Smith Sullivan
 
03:48:52.429 --> 03:48:52.439 align:start position:0%
County District 11 aworth Charlestown
 
03:48:54.910 --> 03:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
Goan langden lempster and
 
03:48:57.670 --> 03:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
Washington uh this bill is a simple
 
03:48:59.830 --> 03:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
transparency Bill shouldn't cost anybody
 
03:49:02.030 --> 03:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
any money and it resolves some
 
03:49:04.469 --> 03:49:04.479 align:start position:0%
transparency and trust issues so when
 
03:49:07.710 --> 03:49:07.720 align:start position:0%
adequacy payments are sent to towns they
 
03:49:09.110 --> 03:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
don't get sent to towns they go to the
 
03:49:11.670 --> 03:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
school District the school district
 
03:49:14.030 --> 03:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
takes account of the grants that they've
 
03:49:16.349 --> 03:49:16.359 align:start position:0%
received and then the town gets a bill
 
03:49:17.309 --> 03:49:17.319 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:49:19.750 --> 03:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
balance you may be surprised to know
 
03:49:21.429 --> 03:49:21.439 align:start position:0%
that there are some municipalities that
 
03:49:23.870 --> 03:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
have a contentious relationship with the
 
03:49:27.110 --> 03:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
school districts and this isn't helping
 
03:49:29.630 --> 03:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
um so it's an unnecessary situation
 
03:49:32.070 --> 03:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
here's a practical application Mr chair
 
03:49:34.070 --> 03:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
let's say that you retained me to
 
03:49:36.670 --> 03:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
provide some services for you and I go
 
03:49:38.830 --> 03:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
okay your bill representative lad's
 
03:49:40.389 --> 03:49:40.399 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
03:49:42.790 --> 03:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
$100,000 and then it comes time to pay
 
03:49:44.750 --> 03:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
the bill and I go good news I got some
 
03:49:47.110 --> 03:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
grants so your Bill's only going to be
 
03:49:49.990 --> 03:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
$80,000 you're happy you may not request
 
03:49:52.149 --> 03:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
any documentation but then the following
 
03:49:54.670 --> 03:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
year I go yeah you know those grants
 
03:49:56.750 --> 03:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
didn't come in as a matter of fact they
 
03:49:58.870 --> 03:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
tacked on some fees and now you're going
 
03:50:00.630 --> 03:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
to have to pay me
 
03:50:03.309 --> 03:50:03.319 align:start position:0%
$110,000 knowing you as I do Mr chair
 
03:50:04.870 --> 03:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
your head will explode and you're going
 
03:50:07.110 --> 03:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
to demand documentation from me and
 
03:50:10.070 --> 03:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
rightfully so so you have the
 
03:50:12.229 --> 03:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
municipality and a school district which
 
03:50:13.750 --> 03:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
might not be getting along and the
 
03:50:15.670 --> 03:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
municipality is dependent on the
 
03:50:18.630 --> 03:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
district to tell them what money came in
 
03:50:21.349 --> 03:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
how much they owe um so it causes some
 
03:50:23.389 --> 03:50:23.399 align:start position:0%
problems this bill will send the
 
03:50:25.750 --> 03:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
adequacy payments to the municipality
 
03:50:27.510 --> 03:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
the municipality will receive a bill
 
03:50:29.309 --> 03:50:29.319 align:start position:0%
from the district for the full amount of
 
03:50:31.429 --> 03:50:31.439 align:start position:0%
whatever it is they're supposed to pay
 
03:50:33.110 --> 03:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
and then they just write the check like
 
03:50:35.389 --> 03:50:35.399 align:start position:0%
they always do but it'll be the full
 
03:50:38.110 --> 03:50:38.120 align:start position:0%
amount and they will know exactly what
 
03:50:40.269 --> 03:50:40.279 align:start position:0%
their state aid is is in the town will
 
03:50:43.070 --> 03:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
be able to easily see it go up down is
 
03:50:45.750 --> 03:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
what whatever we do this year you know
 
03:50:47.630 --> 03:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
without having to rely on a third person
 
03:50:49.469 --> 03:50:49.479 align:start position:0%
that's all I all I hope to accomplish
 
03:50:52.070 --> 03:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
with this bill and I hope that it get
 
03:50:53.910 --> 03:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
gets the uh committee's support thank
 
03:50:56.070 --> 03:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
you for listening thank you very much
 
03:50:57.469 --> 03:50:57.479 align:start position:0%
representative Smith are you willing to
 
03:51:00.389 --> 03:51:00.399 align:start position:0%
take questions absolutely are there any
 
03:51:02.750 --> 03:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
03:51:05.550 --> 03:51:05.560 align:start position:0%
committee representa luno thank you very
 
03:51:07.149 --> 03:51:07.159 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair and thank you very much
 
03:51:08.830 --> 03:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
representative Smith for bringing this
 
03:51:11.870 --> 03:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
one forward this afternoon um what you
 
03:51:16.670 --> 03:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
just said um um the the the the up what
 
03:51:19.309 --> 03:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
is the town adjusting here what do they
 
03:51:19.319 --> 03:51:20.870 align:start position:0%
is the town adjusting here what do they
have

03:51:20.870 --> 03:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:51:25.189 --> 03:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
um discretionary
 
03:51:28.389 --> 03:51:28.399 align:start position:0%
um or discretion to
 
03:51:30.750 --> 03:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
adjust oh no I think you misunderstood
 
03:51:33.349 --> 03:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
me the the town doesn't adjust anything
 
03:51:36.149 --> 03:51:36.159 align:start position:0%
the district does okay so what what is
 
03:51:38.030 --> 03:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
the district adjusting then what's the
 
03:51:40.429 --> 03:51:40.439 align:start position:0%
discretion right so there's the the
 
03:51:42.309 --> 03:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
adequacy payment that's in statute and
 
03:51:44.990 --> 03:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
then as as you know sometimes we send
 
03:51:46.990 --> 03:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
them some money back or there are some
 
03:51:49.070 --> 03:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
other grants uh there was actually a
 
03:51:50.950 --> 03:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
fairly substantial one a couple years
 
03:51:54.670 --> 03:51:54.680 align:start position:0%
ago and the town only sees the net not
 
03:51:57.189 --> 03:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
the process so that's what the district
 
03:52:00.269 --> 03:52:00.279 align:start position:0%
does on a regular basis the um here
 
03:52:03.149 --> 03:52:03.159 align:start position:0%
where I live the uh we're subject to
 
03:52:05.469 --> 03:52:05.479 align:start position:0%
these stabilization Grant reductions
 
03:52:08.110 --> 03:52:08.120 align:start position:0%
which you would think would be a set
 
03:52:10.030 --> 03:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
amount every year but that number
 
03:52:11.790 --> 03:52:11.800 align:start position:0%
bounces all over the place due to
 
03:52:14.870 --> 03:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
adjustments made by the state and the
 
03:52:17.189 --> 03:52:17.199 align:start position:0%
town doesn't understand it this way they
 
03:52:19.349 --> 03:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
would just see hey my check's lower and
 
03:52:21.870 --> 03:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
rather than fight with the district ask
 
03:52:24.030 --> 03:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
me how come they got less money and take
 
03:52:26.590 --> 03:52:26.600 align:start position:0%
that whole you know uh relationship
 
03:52:31.389 --> 03:52:31.399 align:start position:0%
thing out of it so follow up on that yes
 
03:52:34.590 --> 03:52:34.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair so um so
 
03:52:39.110 --> 03:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
the T if I've got this right the um um
 
03:52:41.830 --> 03:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
the town collects the local education
 
03:52:44.790 --> 03:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
property tax and the state property tax
 
03:52:48.030 --> 03:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
is that correct yes and the state
 
03:52:51.870 --> 03:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:55.750 --> 03:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
Education okay correct so
 
03:52:59.349 --> 03:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
so all of that collected money on behalf
 
03:53:01.349 --> 03:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
of the school district which is the
 
03:53:03.630 --> 03:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
political subdivision is due to the
 
03:53:05.630 --> 03:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
school district is it
 
03:53:07.950 --> 03:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
not oh
 
03:53:11.630 --> 03:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
sure so I I guess I don't see what the
 
03:53:14.550 --> 03:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
um what the what the what the mystery is
 
03:53:16.670 --> 03:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
here well you would think it would be
 
03:53:19.349 --> 03:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
that simple but um districts report it
 
03:53:21.429 --> 03:53:21.439 align:start position:0%
to the towns in all different manners
 
03:53:24.750 --> 03:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's just a typed up statement
 
03:53:27.670 --> 03:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
sheet and the town is not always aware
 
03:53:29.870 --> 03:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
of the adjustments that happened if
 
03:53:32.349 --> 03:53:32.359 align:start position:0%
instead we sent the money to the town
 
03:53:33.990 --> 03:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
they would be aware of it it would be
 
03:53:34.000 --> 03:53:34.870 align:start position:0%
they would be aware of it it would be
more

03:53:34.870 --> 03:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:53:37.469 --> 03:53:37.479 align:start position:0%
transparent DOA said that Department of
 
03:53:40.030 --> 03:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
Education sorry I've got an act ISM itis
 
03:53:41.590 --> 03:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
they uh they said that this is actually
 
03:53:44.950 --> 03:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
save will save them a little overhead as
 
03:53:48.070 --> 03:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
well okay let's any other questions from
 
03:53:51.750 --> 03:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
the committee to uh representative
 
03:53:54.750 --> 03:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
Smith not seeing any we will move on to
 
03:53:57.790 --> 03:53:57.800 align:start position:0%
the next person who has to
 
03:54:01.070 --> 03:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
testify representative Tanner uh
 
03:54:03.189 --> 03:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
representative lad representative Tanner
 
03:54:06.469 --> 03:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
um is waving yeah I see that
 
03:54:09.630 --> 03:54:09.640 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead represent Tanner thank you
 
03:54:12.110 --> 03:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you representative Smith
 
03:54:15.790 --> 03:54:15.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I I guess I'm
 
03:54:18.710 --> 03:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
a little confused too because um I serve
 
03:54:20.790 --> 03:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
on both the the budget committees for
 
03:54:23.429 --> 03:54:23.439 align:start position:0%
the town and the school district in
 
03:54:28.269 --> 03:54:28.279 align:start position:0%
Sunapee and I don't understand
 
03:54:31.630 --> 03:54:31.640 align:start position:0%
how it seems like what you're saying is
 
03:54:35.670 --> 03:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
the school district somehow Alters the
 
03:54:38.910 --> 03:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
money that they spend or need and then
 
03:54:40.550 --> 03:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
the town has
 
03:54:44.550 --> 03:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
no indication of why or how that happens
 
03:54:48.349 --> 03:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
and so we should give all the money to
 
03:54:52.189 --> 03:54:52.199 align:start position:0%
the town so that they can figure
 
03:54:54.910 --> 03:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
out where the school is spending it is
 
03:54:56.790 --> 03:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
that is that what you're saying I'm I'm
 
03:54:59.710 --> 03:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
really confused by it too nope I'm
 
03:55:02.910 --> 03:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
saying that we the legislature changed
 
03:55:04.790 --> 03:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that is sent out
 
03:55:07.830 --> 03:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
right so the stabilization grants are on
 
03:55:10.110 --> 03:55:10.120 align:start position:0%
a steady progression decreased the
 
03:55:13.309 --> 03:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
impact of Charles toown is $100,000 a
 
03:55:15.950 --> 03:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
year I can tell you that it has never
 
03:55:18.870 --> 03:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
been $100,000 a year it's usually a
 
03:55:22.349 --> 03:55:22.359 align:start position:0%
little less and nobody ever Knows Why um
 
03:55:24.309 --> 03:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
and they they take their word for it so
 
03:55:26.149 --> 03:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
no the district isn't like making up
 
03:55:27.990 --> 03:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
numbers that is absolutely not what I'm
 
03:55:30.149 --> 03:55:30.159 align:start position:0%
saying I'm saying that we make up
 
03:55:32.110 --> 03:55:32.120 align:start position:0%
numbers based on the legislation that we
 
03:55:34.110 --> 03:55:34.120 align:start position:0%
pass and that that isn't a bad thing we
 
03:55:36.670 --> 03:55:36.680 align:start position:0%
are trying to help in most cases now if
 
03:55:39.030 --> 03:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
we're successful and there have been
 
03:55:42.229 --> 03:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
reductions and the reduction if you
 
03:55:44.710 --> 03:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
follow that all along if we're we're
 
03:55:46.990 --> 03:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
ever in a position where we can't do
 
03:55:48.790 --> 03:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
that all of a sudden the bill will go up
 
03:55:50.790 --> 03:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
and the municipality will probably think
 
03:55:53.389 --> 03:55:53.399 align:start position:0%
the district did it or they'll call you
 
03:55:55.389 --> 03:55:55.399 align:start position:0%
or they'll call me and by the time they
 
03:55:58.229 --> 03:55:58.239 align:start position:0%
dial that phone they're angry um I don't
 
03:56:00.389 --> 03:56:00.399 align:start position:0%
know if you know about the Charlestown
 
03:56:03.349 --> 03:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
withdrawal process that just happened
 
03:56:06.389 --> 03:56:06.399 align:start position:0%
neighbor turning on neighbor um the
 
03:56:09.950 --> 03:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
biggest issue was of transparency
 
03:56:11.990 --> 03:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
because when they said well how much did
 
03:56:15.349 --> 03:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
the state send the answer is ask Jim Fen
 
03:56:17.229 --> 03:56:17.239 align:start position:0%
the um Chief Financial Officer for the
 
03:56:19.590 --> 03:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
district that's not helpful because some
 
03:56:22.429 --> 03:56:22.439 align:start position:0%
of these folks view them as the enemy
 
03:56:25.309 --> 03:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
and they shouldn't he's an accountant so
 
03:56:27.630 --> 03:56:27.640 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get away from all that the
 
03:56:29.750 --> 03:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh if the town's mad it's because
 
03:56:33.830 --> 03:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
they'll literally see the check go down
 
03:56:37.830 --> 03:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh may I have a followup Mr chair yes so
 
03:56:39.750 --> 03:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
I taught at kir sge which is also a
 
03:56:41.429 --> 03:56:41.439 align:start position:0%
district that you know
 
03:56:45.870 --> 03:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
has um seven towns in it and I remember
 
03:56:47.790 --> 03:56:47.800 align:start position:0%
when I was teaching that there were a
 
03:56:49.349 --> 03:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
couple of instances
 
03:56:53.229 --> 03:56:53.239 align:start position:0%
where some of the towns delayed the
 
03:56:55.389 --> 03:56:55.399 align:start position:0%
payment that they were that they were
 
03:56:57.790 --> 03:56:57.800 align:start position:0%
supposed to give to the school
 
03:57:00.710 --> 03:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
district is this kind of what's
 
03:57:03.510 --> 03:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
Happening that that there's a delayment
 
03:57:06.110 --> 03:57:06.120 align:start position:0%
of delayment delay of
 
03:57:09.229 --> 03:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
payment um from the town to the school
 
03:57:11.189 --> 03:57:11.199 align:start position:0%
district of money that's actually theirs
 
03:57:12.990 --> 03:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
because the they think the school
 
03:57:16.510 --> 03:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
district is uh withholding some of the
 
03:57:20.469 --> 03:57:20.479 align:start position:0%
money that um I I know that has happened
 
03:57:24.110 --> 03:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
I'm hope that this bill alleviates that
 
03:57:26.510 --> 03:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
because I know in our case it was based
 
03:57:28.269 --> 03:57:28.279 align:start position:0%
on a misunderstanding of what the
 
03:57:30.469 --> 03:57:30.479 align:start position:0%
district had received and the town does
 
03:57:32.429 --> 03:57:32.439 align:start position:0%
still have money that they pay the
 
03:57:35.229 --> 03:57:35.239 align:start position:0%
district they can withhold that check
 
03:57:37.710 --> 03:57:37.720 align:start position:0%
right now and the process is it goes to
 
03:57:40.229 --> 03:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
court and then the town pays the money
 
03:57:41.990 --> 03:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
it would be nice if that never happened
 
03:57:44.630 --> 03:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
anymore and if we can make this process
 
03:57:46.670 --> 03:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
more transparent and decrease the
 
03:57:49.269 --> 03:57:49.279 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding my sincere hope is that
 
03:57:51.950 --> 03:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't get to that um that instead
 
03:57:54.309 --> 03:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
the towns are dialing our phones and
 
03:57:58.189 --> 03:57:58.199 align:start position:0%
yelling at us one more followup well can
 
03:58:01.070 --> 03:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
we we do have several other folks uh
 
03:58:03.030 --> 03:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh represent Tanner if you have
 
03:58:04.750 --> 03:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
a followup to that you might be asking
 
03:58:07.630 --> 03:58:07.640 align:start position:0%
one of the other uh persons that's
 
03:58:10.229 --> 03:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
coming up on Deck
 
03:58:12.870 --> 03:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
here um I'd like to move ahead if
 
03:58:16.110 --> 03:58:16.120 align:start position:0%
there's no more te uh questions from
 
03:58:18.750 --> 03:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
other reps to uh representative Smith
 
03:58:23.189 --> 03:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call next um Carl lad Dr Lad
 
03:58:29.149 --> 03:58:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:31.550 --> 03:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
Association morning Mr chairman or good
 
03:58:33.389 --> 03:58:33.399 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chairman I didn't get a
 
03:58:34.670 --> 03:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
chance to have lunch because I was
 
03:58:37.590 --> 03:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
shoveling my driveway but um great to
 
03:58:38.870 --> 03:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
see everyone thank you than you very
 
03:58:42.110 --> 03:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
much um the I understand the the
 
03:58:44.790 --> 03:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
concerns that the representative uh
 
03:58:46.790 --> 03:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
brings forward but I think there are a
 
03:58:49.349 --> 03:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
few uh concerns here with this
 
03:58:52.990 --> 03:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
particular bill um Cooperative school
 
03:58:56.510 --> 03:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
districts um have especially with
 
03:59:00.030 --> 03:59:00.040 align:start position:0%
multi um multi- communities within their
 
03:59:02.149 --> 03:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school district for example
 
03:59:06.590 --> 03:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
conal has upwards of a dozen um and many
 
03:59:09.830 --> 03:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
others have uh multiple towns in which
 
03:59:13.349 --> 03:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
they deal um they would have to try to
 
03:59:16.309 --> 03:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
get payments from each one of these
 
03:59:16.319 --> 03:59:17.630 align:start position:0%
get payments from each one of these
towns

03:59:17.630 --> 03:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
towns
 
03:59:19.830 --> 03:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
individually and send out a payment
 
03:59:23.830 --> 03:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
rather than get one uh check from the
 
03:59:26.590 --> 03:59:26.600 align:start position:0%
state to their Cooperative School
 
03:59:29.349 --> 03:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
District That Could That Could seriously
 
03:59:32.269 --> 03:59:32.279 align:start position:0%
impact uh their ability uh to have a
 
03:59:34.990 --> 03:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
decent cash flow uh in order to pay
 
03:59:37.830 --> 03:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
bills you know a lot of small districts
 
03:59:39.870 --> 03:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
they have very very limited Town Offices
 
03:59:43.309 --> 03:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
they may be in once or twice a month in
 
03:59:46.990 --> 03:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
order to process uh payments um or to
 
03:59:50.990 --> 03:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
collect checks uh this could um this
 
03:59:54.830 --> 03:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
could really um impact the uh the time
 
03:59:57.870 --> 03:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
frame uh for districts to get their
 
04:00:01.830 --> 04:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
funds um I'm not sure that this bill
 
04:00:04.429 --> 04:00:04.439 align:start position:0%
solves the problem that the sponsor is
 
04:00:08.830 --> 04:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
looking to solve um it's sounds as
 
04:00:11.910 --> 04:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
though it's a it's a communication issue
 
04:00:14.590 --> 04:00:14.600 align:start position:0%
um between a particular school district
 
04:00:19.429 --> 04:00:19.439 align:start position:0%
and a particular Community um I I just
 
04:00:21.510 --> 04:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
think it adds an additional bureaucratic
 
04:00:24.389 --> 04:00:24.399 align:start position:0%
layer um that really isn't
 
04:00:27.070 --> 04:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
necessary um so with that um Mr chairman
 
04:00:28.630 --> 04:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
I know you've got bigger fish to fry
 
04:00:31.830 --> 04:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
this afternoon so um I will uh stop
 
04:00:34.790 --> 04:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
there and um be certainly be open to any
 
04:00:37.630 --> 04:00:37.640 align:start position:0%
questions uh thank you uh Dr Lad are
 
04:00:41.670 --> 04:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
there any questions questions from the
 
04:00:46.349 --> 04:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:51.189 --> 04:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you Mr chair thank you um
 
04:00:51.199 --> 04:00:51.990 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you Mr chair thank you um
Dr

04:00:51.990 --> 04:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
Dr
 
04:00:54.750 --> 04:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
lad uh so my question that I was going
 
04:00:56.590 --> 04:00:56.600 align:start position:0%
to follow up on the last one I'll follow
 
04:01:00.189 --> 04:01:00.199 align:start position:0%
up with you so at karge like I explained
 
04:01:02.590 --> 04:01:02.600 align:start position:0%
with our seven towns some of them quite
 
04:01:05.389 --> 04:01:05.399 align:start position:0%
small one town uh decided they weren't
 
04:01:08.030 --> 04:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
going to give us payment I on several
 
04:01:11.030 --> 04:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
different occasions this happened and as
 
04:01:13.229 --> 04:01:13.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative Smith had said you
 
04:01:15.750 --> 04:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
know then they go to court and it delays
 
04:01:17.550 --> 04:01:17.560 align:start position:0%
payment and there's a whole lot of
 
04:01:19.389 --> 04:01:19.399 align:start position:0%
problems with the school functioning
 
04:01:22.429 --> 04:01:22.439 align:start position:0%
keep functioning do you think that this
 
04:01:24.790 --> 04:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
bill would make that situation even
 
04:01:27.389 --> 04:01:27.399 align:start position:0%
worse because the all the money now is
 
04:01:29.510 --> 04:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
going to go to the town so if one town
 
04:01:32.550 --> 04:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
just decided to you know yank the chain
 
04:01:34.870 --> 04:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
of the public school they could with
 
04:01:37.790 --> 04:01:37.800 align:start position:0%
withhold the funds and all the funds
 
04:01:40.309 --> 04:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
that come to them and then it would the
 
04:01:42.189 --> 04:01:42.199 align:start position:0%
school would have to go to court to get
 
04:01:44.990 --> 04:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
the funds yes absolutely I think that
 
04:01:47.469 --> 04:01:47.479 align:start position:0%
that's um that's certainly a possibility
 
04:01:49.630 --> 04:01:49.640 align:start position:0%
and it is certainly something that that
 
04:01:52.429 --> 04:01:52.439 align:start position:0%
could happen hopefully it wouldn't um
 
04:01:56.030 --> 04:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
but it's you know just in my community
 
04:01:58.710 --> 04:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
here in in gron uh when I was
 
04:02:01.269 --> 04:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
superintendent you know the the town
 
04:02:03.429 --> 04:02:03.439 align:start position:0%
really had to struggle at times
 
04:02:05.429 --> 04:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
especially when the mill Clos in order
 
04:02:08.870 --> 04:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
to send those payments um but they did
 
04:02:12.149 --> 04:02:12.159 align:start position:0%
do it um the school district is its own
 
04:02:15.950 --> 04:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
political sub entity um and it does uh
 
04:02:18.710 --> 04:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
does have the force of law uh behind it
 
04:02:21.750 --> 04:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
and payments have to be made and I think
 
04:02:24.990 --> 04:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
that um I again I think that this just
 
04:02:27.990 --> 04:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
adds another layer of bureaucracy that's
 
04:02:28.000 --> 04:02:31.429 align:start position:0%
adds another layer of bureaucracy that's
not

04:02:31.429 --> 04:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:34.870 --> 04:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
necessary thank you very much uh again
 
04:02:37.149 --> 04:02:37.159 align:start position:0%

Association thank you again chairman lad
 
04:02:55.870 --> 04:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon um members of the
 
04:02:57.469 --> 04:02:57.479 align:start position:0%
committee again bar Christina from the
 
04:02:59.710 --> 04:02:59.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire school boards Association
 
04:03:03.309 --> 04:03:03.319 align:start position:0%
um we're opposed to House Bill 110 um my
 
04:03:04.950 --> 04:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
initial opposition was because I wasn't
 
04:03:07.349 --> 04:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
quite sure what the what the purpose was
 
04:03:09.830 --> 04:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
so thank representative Smith for Le
 
04:03:13.229 --> 04:03:13.239 align:start position:0%
sharing why this bill was brought forth
 
04:03:16.710 --> 04:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
um two concerns that nhba has most of
 
04:03:18.790 --> 04:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
them have already been addressed if if
 
04:03:20.229 --> 04:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
there's an issue between a school
 
04:03:22.590 --> 04:03:22.600 align:start position:0%
district in a town relative to
 
04:03:25.070 --> 04:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
allegations of transparency I I that's a
 
04:03:27.110 --> 04:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
local issue and there needs to be there
 
04:03:28.510 --> 04:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be communication between the
 
04:03:29.950 --> 04:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
school district and the town and the
 
04:03:33.309 --> 04:03:33.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um and second um the original
 
04:03:34.830 --> 04:03:34.840 align:start position:0%
point I was going to make representative
 
04:03:36.710 --> 04:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
Tanner you brought it up about towns
 
04:03:41.910 --> 04:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
delaying payment under RSA 198 colon 5
 
04:03:44.149 --> 04:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
um those are your local payments your
 
04:03:46.229 --> 04:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
the money raised through local taxes to
 
04:03:47.590 --> 04:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
support the school district not your
 
04:03:50.870 --> 04:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax but um
 
04:03:53.269 --> 04:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
in any given year nsba gets phone calls
 
04:03:57.030 --> 04:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
from two three sometimes four or five um
 
04:03:58.469 --> 04:03:58.479 align:start position:0%
school districts saying the town is
 
04:04:00.110 --> 04:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
refusing to hand over the money the town
 
04:04:02.030 --> 04:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
is handing to refuse over the money
 
04:04:04.030 --> 04:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
despite the language being you know
 
04:04:06.750 --> 04:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
shall and being a directive so the
 
04:04:08.469 --> 04:04:08.479 align:start position:0%
school dist test to get on the BN with
 
04:04:09.870 --> 04:04:09.880 align:start position:0%
their attorney the attorney has to write
 
04:04:11.790 --> 04:04:11.800 align:start position:0%
a strongly worded letter they send it
 
04:04:13.870 --> 04:04:13.880 align:start position:0%
over to the town and then eventually the
 
04:04:16.630 --> 04:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
payment gets PA made but um at times
 
04:04:18.309 --> 04:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of rigoll it's a lot of
 
04:04:19.910 --> 04:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
unnecessary hassle for the school
 
04:04:21.630 --> 04:04:21.640 align:start position:0%
district to have to go sort of Chase
 
04:04:23.510 --> 04:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
down this money that is legally and
 
04:04:26.229 --> 04:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
rightfully there as per the statute um
 
04:04:29.309 --> 04:04:29.319 align:start position:0%
and we would have concerns that um that
 
04:04:32.590 --> 04:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
could certainly be um maybe Amplified if
 
04:04:34.389 --> 04:04:34.399 align:start position:0%
if this bill were going to go were to go
 
04:04:37.110 --> 04:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
through so um those are my comments
 
04:04:38.429 --> 04:04:38.439 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any question questions
 
04:04:39.950 --> 04:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
but again we're we're in opposition to
 
04:04:42.149 --> 04:04:42.159 align:start position:0%
House Bill 110 thank you very much
 
04:04:44.189 --> 04:04:44.199 align:start position:0%
Barrett uh are there any questions of
 
04:04:46.870 --> 04:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
the school boards association yes
 
04:04:51.990 --> 04:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:57.429 --> 04:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
us are you unmuted I am now um it took
 
04:05:00.030 --> 04:05:00.040 align:start position:0%
me a bit to get back on I would have
 
04:05:03.469 --> 04:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
liked to have asked this previously but
 
04:05:06.110 --> 04:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
my question is since we are looking for
 
04:05:09.990 --> 04:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:14.110 --> 04:05:14.120 align:start position:0%
um dislike whatever between the school
 
04:05:17.950 --> 04:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
board the school and the municipality
 
04:05:20.630 --> 04:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if rather than sending
 
04:05:23.309 --> 04:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
them money to the municipality if we
 
04:05:28.229 --> 04:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
just send a uh notification of how much
 
04:05:31.429 --> 04:05:31.439 align:start position:0%
money um then there wouldn't be this
 
04:05:34.229 --> 04:05:34.239 align:start position:0%
well why is it this or whatever they
 
04:05:37.990 --> 04:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
would get that report sure thank thank
 
04:05:40.269 --> 04:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative um
 
04:05:42.550 --> 04:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean certainly forwarding some
 
04:05:44.990 --> 04:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
notice from either Department of Revenue
 
04:05:46.189 --> 04:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
Administration or the Department of
 
04:05:48.030 --> 04:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
Education to the the town or the
 
04:05:50.790 --> 04:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
municipality that wouldn't hurt um
 
04:05:52.870 --> 04:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
they're they public records anyway you
 
04:05:54.790 --> 04:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
know obviously if the doe is sending
 
04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
something like that to the to the local
 
04:05:57.830 --> 04:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
school district I mean that's going to
 
04:05:59.830 --> 04:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
be a public record and and just to the
 
04:06:02.750 --> 04:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
transparency piece I I want to be
 
04:06:04.870 --> 04:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
careful with that word you know school
 
04:06:06.830 --> 04:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
boards are accountable for every dime
 
04:06:08.389 --> 04:06:08.399 align:start position:0%
that they raise and that they and that
 
04:06:10.670 --> 04:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
they spend I understand there may be
 
04:06:12.910 --> 04:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
questions or concerns and sometimes you
 
04:06:15.349 --> 04:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
know members of community might not
 
04:06:16.710 --> 04:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
understand how the taxes work or where
 
04:06:18.670 --> 04:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
the money goes and flows in that's not
 
04:06:22.189 --> 04:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
so much a transparency issue um so as
 
04:06:25.590 --> 04:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
much as maybe just a a misunderstanding
 
04:06:27.070 --> 04:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
as to how the system works because let's
 
04:06:30.070 --> 04:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
face it it's complex it's not that easy
 
04:06:32.830 --> 04:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
um but um
 
04:06:35.030 --> 04:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
so I guess that would be my answer to
 
04:06:37.349 --> 04:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
that representative thank you thank you
 
04:06:41.269 --> 04:06:41.279 align:start position:0%

my question to you Caitlyn is that
 
04:07:46.109 --> 04:07:46.119 align:start position:0%
currently you send quarterly payments
 
04:07:49.030 --> 04:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
out to the school districts uh in in
 
04:07:52.229 --> 04:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
forms of 20% 20% 30%
 
04:07:56.790 --> 04:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
30% um does that how soon after you that
 
04:07:59.189 --> 04:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
is released does the school district or
 
04:08:02.510 --> 04:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
the district have a possession of that
 
04:08:05.349 --> 04:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
dollar uh could you please explain that
 
04:08:07.710 --> 04:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
and also there have been some questions
 
04:08:10.389 --> 04:08:10.399 align:start position:0%
regarding is it more effective to send
 
04:08:12.790 --> 04:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
the money via the municipality and then
 
04:08:14.349 --> 04:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:08:17.229 --> 04:08:17.239 align:start position:0%
districts um so as far as your first
 
04:08:18.429 --> 04:08:18.439 align:start position:0%
question how quickly do the school
 
04:08:19.670 --> 04:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
districts have the money in their
 
04:08:21.510 --> 04:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
possession assuming a school district
 
04:08:23.870 --> 04:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
has signed up for a payments from the
 
04:08:25.910 --> 04:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
treasury Department um they have the
 
04:08:28.309 --> 04:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
money in their bank account that day um
 
04:08:30.710 --> 04:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
the treasury just processes um the
 
04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
payment what our processes is we send
 
04:08:34.550 --> 04:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
the information to treasury about two
 
04:08:36.670 --> 04:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
weeks early they process the payment and
 
04:08:38.910 --> 04:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
have the a remitted on the day that is
 
04:08:41.149 --> 04:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
in law that the payment is due um school
 
04:08:42.510 --> 04:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
districts that have elected to get a
 
04:08:44.670 --> 04:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
papercheck obviously have a little bit
 
04:08:46.830 --> 04:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
of a de delay there's maybe about 10 of
 
04:08:48.790 --> 04:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
those across the state um because they
 
04:08:50.590 --> 04:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
have to deal with the traditional US
 
04:08:53.269 --> 04:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
Mail system um so but they have the
 
04:08:54.910 --> 04:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
payment on the days that are due that
 
04:08:57.630 --> 04:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
which are September 1st November 1st
 
04:08:59.710 --> 04:08:59.720 align:start position:0%
January 1 and April 1st those are the
 
04:09:01.510 --> 04:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
days that are in law that the payment is
 
04:09:05.149 --> 04:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
required um as far as Administration um
 
04:09:07.750 --> 04:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
from the Department's perspective um pay
 
04:09:09.990 --> 04:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
the school district or paying a
 
04:09:13.109 --> 04:09:13.119 align:start position:0%
municipality um there is no difference
 
04:09:15.469 --> 04:09:15.479 align:start position:0%
um because it's just a field in the way
 
04:09:18.510 --> 04:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
that we pull the data as far as um
 
04:09:20.950 --> 04:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness or efficiency um the
 
04:09:23.510 --> 04:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
department doesn't have any opinion on
 
04:09:26.630 --> 04:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
that thank thank you very much uh while
 
04:09:29.229 --> 04:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
we have uh Miss Davis on the on on the
 
04:09:31.750 --> 04:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
horn here on the screen are there any
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
other questions from the
 
04:09:36.510 --> 04:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
committee uh represent
 
04:09:36.520 --> 04:09:39.030 align:start position:0%
committee uh represent
luno

04:09:39.030 --> 04:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
luno
 
04:09:39.040 --> 04:09:42.229 align:start position:0%
luno
you're

04:09:42.229 --> 04:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:44.750 --> 04:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
muted thank you Mr chair I should know
 
04:09:47.830 --> 04:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
better than that um and thank you thank
 
04:09:50.030 --> 04:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
you Miss Davis for joining us this
 
04:09:53.510 --> 04:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
afternoon um are are there are there any
 
04:09:56.950 --> 04:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh instances where the um where the
 
04:09:59.830 --> 04:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
where the state treasury is remitting
 
04:10:03.229 --> 04:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
the um the the portion of the adequacy
 
04:10:06.149 --> 04:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
grant due to a school district remitting
 
04:10:10.070 --> 04:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
that directly to the um the member towns
 
04:10:13.349 --> 04:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
instead we pay that money to a school
 
04:10:16.030 --> 04:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
district so a school district could in
 
04:10:18.149 --> 04:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
theory elect that a Fiscal Agent for the
 
04:10:20.870 --> 04:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
school district be the be a town um but
 
04:10:22.670 --> 04:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have that information at the
 
04:10:24.349 --> 04:10:24.359 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
04:10:28.870 --> 04:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
Education okay and um and yeah followup
 
04:10:32.070 --> 04:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks Mr chair and um and
 
04:10:36.229 --> 04:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
how so so going back to to what we look
 
04:10:39.469 --> 04:10:39.479 align:start position:0%
at you know money that goes to operate
 
04:10:42.990 --> 04:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
schools comes from the state property
 
04:10:46.830 --> 04:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
tax collected by the um municipalities
 
04:10:48.910 --> 04:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
yes local education property tax
 
04:10:52.429 --> 04:10:52.439 align:start position:0%
collected by the municipalities yes um
 
04:10:56.070 --> 04:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh any remaining education grant dollars
 
04:10:57.870 --> 04:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
coming from the
 
04:11:02.429 --> 04:11:02.439 align:start position:0%
state and federal um federal dollars and
 
04:11:05.910 --> 04:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
um and do those flow through where how
 
04:11:10.389 --> 04:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
do those flow to the district so um
 
04:11:12.269 --> 04:11:12.279 align:start position:0%
adequacy goes to to the district which
 
04:11:14.149 --> 04:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
this bill obviously would change um the
 
04:11:16.550 --> 04:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
local tax dollars go through the local
 
04:11:19.070 --> 04:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities um as we've discussed
 
04:11:23.389 --> 04:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
federal grants um assuming so federal
 
04:11:25.070 --> 04:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
grants for the most part go directly to
 
04:11:27.149 --> 04:11:27.159 align:start position:0%
the school district because the
 
04:11:29.630 --> 04:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
recipient of the Federal grant per the
 
04:11:31.950 --> 04:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
federal law is in fact the school
 
04:11:34.910 --> 04:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
district not a municipality um so some
 
04:11:37.349 --> 04:11:37.359 align:start position:0%
federal grants could certainly be
 
04:11:39.269 --> 04:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
changed but the majority of our large
 
04:11:40.750 --> 04:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
federal grants that we receive and
 
04:11:43.550 --> 04:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
process on a regular basis like idea
 
04:11:46.469 --> 04:11:46.479 align:start position:0%
Title One um all of the new s money
 
04:11:48.149 --> 04:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
specifically says in the federal law
 
04:11:50.389 --> 04:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
that it should be allocated to a school
 
04:11:51.870 --> 04:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
district and that's why the funding goes
 
04:11:54.750 --> 04:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
directly to a school district okay okay
 
04:11:56.269 --> 04:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank you very much Miss
 
04:12:00.670 --> 04:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
Davis thank you very much uh uh
 
04:12:00.680 --> 04:12:03.510 align:start position:0%
Davis thank you very much uh uh
represent

04:12:03.510 --> 04:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:05.670 --> 04:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
tanor thank you chairman thank you
 
04:12:09.349 --> 04:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
chairman lad um thank you uh Miss Davis
 
04:12:11.950 --> 04:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
um just to make sure that I heard it
 
04:12:14.030 --> 04:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
right that the federal funds actually go
 
04:12:16.590 --> 04:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
to the doe and that the doe then
 
04:12:18.710 --> 04:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
distributes those federal funds to the
 
04:12:20.710 --> 04:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
directly to the school districts is that
 
04:12:23.030 --> 04:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
what I understood um I mean in
 
04:12:25.670 --> 04:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
technically speaking the treasury is
 
04:12:27.269 --> 04:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
actually the person that cuts the check
 
04:12:28.710 --> 04:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education doesn't have
 
04:12:31.429 --> 04:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
any cut check check cutting Authority um
 
04:12:33.990 --> 04:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
so similar to adequacy but the the
 
04:12:36.870 --> 04:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
treasury is processing the payments um
 
04:12:38.269 --> 04:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
as directed by the Department of
 
04:12:40.149 --> 04:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
Education so we are directing that the
 
04:12:42.429 --> 04:12:42.439 align:start position:0%
treasury process the payments to a
 
04:12:44.630 --> 04:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
school district for the purposes of
 
04:12:47.469 --> 04:12:47.479 align:start position:0%
adequacy and for federal grants may I
 
04:12:49.750 --> 04:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
have a followup on that yes you may
 
04:12:52.510 --> 04:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so when you say process it uh
 
04:12:54.309 --> 04:12:54.319 align:start position:0%
that means that you kind of take in the
 
04:12:57.349 --> 04:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
money and then decide uh based on the
 
04:12:59.229 --> 04:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
criteria that the of the local school
 
04:13:01.510 --> 04:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
district how that's going to go to the
 
04:13:03.830 --> 04:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
treasury and then to the local school
 
04:13:06.269 --> 04:13:06.279 align:start position:0%
district yes so for example for the
 
04:13:08.469 --> 04:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
process of adequacy so the funding
 
04:13:11.070 --> 04:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
formula is in law so we collect the data
 
04:13:13.349 --> 04:13:13.359 align:start position:0%
and processes as as needed so we
 
04:13:15.950 --> 04:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
determine how much um adequacy that we
 
04:13:17.870 --> 04:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
are going to pay for each school
 
04:13:20.030 --> 04:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
district and then school districts and
 
04:13:21.309 --> 04:13:21.319 align:start position:0%
all vendors in the state of New
 
04:13:23.309 --> 04:13:23.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire whether it's a municipality a
 
04:13:25.830 --> 04:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
school district a private contractor um
 
04:13:27.309 --> 04:13:27.319 align:start position:0%
work with the treasury Department and
 
04:13:29.469 --> 04:13:29.479 align:start position:0%
they have vendor codes and the vendor
 
04:13:31.269 --> 04:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
codes that the Department of Education
 
04:13:34.309 --> 04:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
codes and bills to are in fact who the
 
04:13:36.950 --> 04:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
treasury will disperse the money to um
 
04:13:39.990 --> 04:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
so so in order to um accommodate this
 
04:13:41.750 --> 04:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
change as proposed in this bill the
 
04:13:43.870 --> 04:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Education would just
 
04:13:47.630 --> 04:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
change the vendor codes um for the for
 
04:13:52.189 --> 04:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
the payments for this process thank you
 
04:13:54.229 --> 04:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh I have one followup question for you
 
04:13:58.870 --> 04:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn before you disappear um uh the
 
04:14:02.309 --> 04:14:02.319 align:start position:0%
this bill speaks spe specifically to
 
04:14:04.710 --> 04:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
adequacy Grant
 
04:14:09.349 --> 04:14:09.359 align:start position:0%
distribution yes um so it would not be
 
04:14:12.269 --> 04:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
uh uh controlling how Federal grant
 
04:14:15.269 --> 04:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
money is distributed that would be done
 
04:14:17.630 --> 04:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
in accordance with federal law working
 
04:14:20.269 --> 04:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
through the Department of Education so
 
04:14:22.149 --> 04:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
the grants would be coming down whenever
 
04:14:23.149 --> 04:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
that money
 
04:14:25.830 --> 04:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
arrives Esser money for
 
04:14:29.990 --> 04:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
example um so the other question is when
 
04:14:32.670 --> 04:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking adequacy education grant
 
04:14:34.630 --> 04:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
are we talking about the fiscal capacity
 
04:14:36.149 --> 04:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid as well which is a
 
04:14:38.349 --> 04:14:38.359 align:start position:0%
separate Grant above them Beyond
 
04:14:40.670 --> 04:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
adequacy um it is the Department's
 
04:14:41.790 --> 04:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
understanding that this would be
 
04:14:42.950 --> 04:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
everything that would be coming through
 
04:14:44.309 --> 04:14:44.319 align:start position:0%
the grant so this would mean
 
04:14:45.950 --> 04:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
stabilization this would mean fiscal
 
04:14:47.550 --> 04:14:47.560 align:start position:0%
capacity this would mean the cost of an
 
04:14:49.990 --> 04:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
adequate education um everything through
 
04:14:54.349 --> 04:14:54.359 align:start position:0%
the um RSA 198 38 through 42 would be
 
04:14:55.710 --> 04:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
the distribution that we would be
 
04:14:58.910 --> 04:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
talking about and I do want to I do want
 
04:15:00.750 --> 04:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
to clarify just based on your statement
 
04:15:03.510 --> 04:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
previously um our understanding is that
 
04:15:05.630 --> 04:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
this bill would not affect any federal
 
04:15:07.349 --> 04:15:07.359 align:start position:0%
funding and it would not affect other
 
04:15:10.349 --> 04:15:10.359 align:start position:0%
state aid as well so catastrophic Aid
 
04:15:13.109 --> 04:15:13.119 align:start position:0%
and building aid for example uh career

04:16:02.189 --> 04:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:05.910 --> 04:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
panelist WN Winfred fenberg Winfred
 
04:16:10.309 --> 04:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
fenberg afternoon can you hear me yes
 
04:16:11.870 --> 04:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you very much for taking
 
04:16:13.990 --> 04:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
my testimony I will not take your time
 
04:16:17.070 --> 04:16:17.080 align:start position:0%
because I know you have a a big hearing
 
04:16:19.590 --> 04:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
this afternoon um the points that I
 
04:16:21.710 --> 04:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to make were made by others
 
04:16:24.070 --> 04:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
before me I think as a superintendent I
 
04:16:25.710 --> 04:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
just did the numbers quickly after
 
04:16:27.950 --> 04:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
talking with my business administrator
 
04:16:29.950 --> 04:16:29.960 align:start position:0%
and essentially where we currently have
 
04:16:33.149 --> 04:16:33.159 align:start position:0%
four uh transactions four times during
 
04:16:36.269 --> 04:16:36.279 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year we get uh the payments
 
04:16:39.349 --> 04:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education uh that
 
04:16:42.469 --> 04:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
would be replaced by really 56 um
 
04:16:44.710 --> 04:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
transactions they go to seven towns in
 
04:16:47.870 --> 04:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
our districts and then seven towns have
 
04:16:49.670 --> 04:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
to process the checks and bring them to
 
04:16:52.429 --> 04:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
us might not seem as much effort in the
 
04:16:54.790 --> 04:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
electronic age but I think what Barry
 
04:16:56.630 --> 04:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
Christina was saying I share that
 
04:16:59.670 --> 04:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
concern as well that um even if there's
 
04:17:02.670 --> 04:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
just a delay of of a month or or a few
 
04:17:06.469 --> 04:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
weeks or um to process the check that
 
04:17:09.389 --> 04:17:09.399 align:start position:0%
comes from the towns to the school it
 
04:17:11.510 --> 04:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
requires our business administrator to
 
04:17:14.109 --> 04:17:14.119 align:start position:0%
devote time and attention to that I do
 
04:17:16.790 --> 04:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
not see any improvement over the current
 
04:17:20.030 --> 04:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
practice um and I would ask to oppose
 
04:17:23.269 --> 04:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
the bill and and not put that forward uh
 
04:17:26.229 --> 04:17:26.239 align:start position:0%

04:17:29.109 --> 04:17:29.119 align:start position:0%

to add other than it's creating another
 
04:18:53.269 --> 04:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
layer of inefficiency to a system where
 
04:18:55.149 --> 04:18:55.159 align:start position:0%
it's not needed and there's no advantage
 
04:18:57.590 --> 04:18:57.600 align:start position:0%

emotion those watching can come to their
own

04:27:53.229 --> 04:27:53.239 align:start position:0%
own
 
04:27:55.790 --> 04:27:55.800 align:start position:0%

committee will have to come to our own
 
04:28:00.269 --> 04:28:00.279 align:start position:0%
decision and then we'll have to vote on
 
04:28:03.950 --> 04:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
this legislation and I'll start by going
 
04:28:06.630 --> 04:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
through uh the bill
 
04:28:10.309 --> 04:28:10.319 align:start position:0%

have it in front of them and uh
 
04:28:15.070 --> 04:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully it will be uh somewhat clear
 
04:28:18.109 --> 04:28:18.119 align:start position:0%
to everyone else uh
 
04:28:23.109 --> 04:28:23.119 align:start position:0%
watching um hb20 starts with the

definitions and probably the most
 
04:28:28.550 --> 04:28:28.560 align:start position:0%

04:39:16.910 --> 04:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
to mention a legislative oversight
 
04:39:19.029 --> 04:39:19.039 align:start position:0%
committee uh that is
 
04:39:22.869 --> 04:39:22.879 align:start position:0%
established um so there is legislative
 
04:39:27.070 --> 04:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
review on an ongoing basis uh to monitor
 
04:39:30.869 --> 04:39:30.879 align:start position:0%
the program and recommend any uh changes
 
04:39:34.670 --> 04:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
to the program um that are needed and I
 
04:39:37.430 --> 04:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
just just wanted to um that's pretty
 
04:39:40.510 --> 04:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
much the bill um but since I won't be
 
04:39:44.948 --> 04:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
able to um question other um
 
04:39:47.190 --> 04:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
participants I just want to mention two
 
04:39:49.430 --> 04:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
things U
 
04:39:52.670 --> 04:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
independently um we've had a number of
 
04:39:56.628 --> 04:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
uh emails uh talking about increases in
 
04:40:01.590 --> 04:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
local taxes because of this uh bill um
 
04:40:05.270 --> 04:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
but I'll point out that it's Pro Ed that
 
04:40:06.910 --> 04:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
over the next 10
 
04:40:09.550 --> 04:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
years enrollment is going to decline by
 
04:40:14.910 --> 04:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
over 20,000 students this bill aside so
 
04:40:17.788 --> 04:40:17.798 align:start position:0%
schools are going to have to learn to
 
04:40:17.798 --> 04:40:19.430 align:start position:0%
schools are going to have to learn to
adjust

04:40:19.430 --> 04:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
adjust
 
04:40:23.190 --> 04:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
um will tax increases be made based on
 
04:40:27.868 --> 04:40:27.878 align:start position:0%
the normal um enrollment uh decline um
 
04:40:30.510 --> 04:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
it seems though with bills like this
 
04:40:34.110 --> 04:40:34.120 align:start position:0%
suddenly all costs are fixed when there
 
04:40:39.470 --> 04:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
is a decline due to a choice bill um and
 
04:40:39.480 --> 04:40:41.190 align:start position:0%
is a decline due to a choice bill um and
secondly

04:40:41.190 --> 04:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
04:40:44.628 --> 04:40:44.638 align:start position:0%
um we've heard the argument that private
 
04:40:47.350 --> 04:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
schools discriminate while public
 
04:40:50.470 --> 04:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
schools have to accept all students but
 
04:40:53.310 --> 04:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
it's not true it's not
 
04:40:53.320 --> 04:40:54.948 align:start position:0%
it's not true it's not
true

04:40:54.948 --> 04:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
true
 
04:40:58.230 --> 04:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
um kids in Manchester cannot go to
 
04:41:01.948 --> 04:41:01.958 align:start position:0%
school in Bedford there's zip code
 
04:41:05.070 --> 04:41:05.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination uh many families can't
 
04:41:07.830 --> 04:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
for to live in molten Boro for instance
 
04:41:09.670 --> 04:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
there's wealth
 
04:41:11.470 --> 04:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
discrimination uh we have an open
 
04:41:13.868 --> 04:41:13.878 align:start position:0%
enrollment School statute that says
 
04:41:15.230 --> 04:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
specifically it's
 
04:41:18.510 --> 04:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
194d schools May select pupils on the
 
04:41:22.868 --> 04:41:22.878 align:start position:0%
basis of aptitude acade or academic
 
04:41:25.190 --> 04:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
achievement and finally I've been
 
04:41:27.708 --> 04:41:27.718 align:start position:0%
working with a a mother who's not even
 
04:41:30.430 --> 04:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
in my district who has a special needs
 
04:41:32.550 --> 04:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
child who was
 
04:41:35.948 --> 04:41:35.958 align:start position:0%
bullied uh severely in her school uh
 
04:41:39.590 --> 04:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
because of her disability called names
 
04:41:42.150 --> 04:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
um after repeated attempts to resolve
 
04:41:45.190 --> 04:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
the problem the school board under the
 
04:41:47.350 --> 04:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
best interest manifest education
 
04:41:51.390 --> 04:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
hardship said go ahead find another
 
04:41:53.430 --> 04:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
public school to
 
04:41:57.190 --> 04:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
attend she was denied access to two
 
04:42:00.230 --> 04:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
local public school systems denied
 
04:42:03.310 --> 04:42:03.320 align:start position:0%

04:42:05.550 --> 04:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
remote learning where she is is and
 
04:42:08.590 --> 04:42:08.600 align:start position:0%

04:42:13.040 --> 04:42:14.708 align:start position:0%
started to cut herself and has talked
about

04:42:14.708 --> 04:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:42:18.190 --> 04:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
suicide so the fact that public schools
 
04:42:22.230 --> 04:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
accept all children it's not true it's
 
04:42:26.430 --> 04:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
not true um and I think um the testimony
 
04:42:28.590 --> 04:42:28.600 align:start position:0%
that we'll have from parents will be
 
04:42:31.708 --> 04:42:31.718 align:start position:0%
very telling this afternoon and with
 
04:42:34.990 --> 04:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
that I'd be glad to take any questions
 
04:42:36.868 --> 04:42:36.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
 
04:42:38.910 --> 04:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
cordelli are there any questions
 
04:42:41.708 --> 04:42:41.718 align:start position:0%
representative Miler thank you Mr
 
04:42:44.430 --> 04:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Mr represent
 
04:42:46.590 --> 04:42:46.600 align:start position:0%
cordelli for taking my questions uh
 
04:42:49.190 --> 04:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
let's be real clear here the intent of
 
04:42:52.708 --> 04:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
this hearing is to get
 
04:42:55.910 --> 04:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
clarification of this particular bill it
 
04:42:58.510 --> 04:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
is not the intent of the hearing to
 
04:43:00.670 --> 04:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
debate the bill at this point in time
 
04:43:02.948 --> 04:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
that will come forward when we deal with
 
04:43:05.070 --> 04:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
it in executive session so I want to
 
04:43:07.670 --> 04:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
just be clear on that as we go
 
04:43:10.910 --> 04:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
forward this bill on uh will probably be
 
04:43:12.628 --> 04:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
one of the most significant bills that
 
04:43:16.070 --> 04:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
this committee will look at uh this year
 
04:43:18.708 --> 04:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
so Mr chairman I I I've got numerous
 
04:43:20.628 --> 04:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
questions here but I want to just focus
 
04:43:23.390 --> 04:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
on three questions at this point in
 
04:43:27.470 --> 04:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
time uh representative cordelli um this
 
04:43:31.270 --> 04:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
bill basically takes taxpayer dollars
 
04:43:33.628 --> 04:43:33.638 align:start position:0%
and provides for vouchers for parents as
 
04:43:36.990 --> 04:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
unlike the deferred business tax program
 
04:43:38.708 --> 04:43:38.718 align:start position:0%
that we have and another program where
 
04:43:41.510 --> 04:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
kids can get scholarships from that
 
04:43:43.788 --> 04:43:43.798 align:start position:0%
that's not taxpayer money this is
 
04:43:43.798 --> 04:43:44.948 align:start position:0%
that's not taxpayer money this is
taxpayer

04:43:44.948 --> 04:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
04:43:47.990 --> 04:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
money so would you concur that I as I
 
04:43:49.150 --> 04:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
look at this
 
04:43:51.390 --> 04:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
bill I checked with
 
04:43:53.948 --> 04:43:53.958 align:start position:0%
ECS which is the education Commission of
 
04:43:55.628 --> 04:43:55.638 align:start position:0%
the state which is a non-party
 
04:43:57.830 --> 04:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan group that basically tracks
 
04:43:57.840 --> 04:43:59.030 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan group that basically tracks
education

04:43:59.030 --> 04:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:44:01.230 --> 04:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
policies and I found that there are
 
04:44:06.750 --> 04:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
about about 12 States that have voucher
 
04:44:10.708 --> 04:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
programs but each of these states has a
 
04:44:13.510 --> 04:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
qualifier might be the student might
 
04:44:16.750 --> 04:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
have to have an IEP maybe a disability
 
04:44:19.708 --> 04:44:19.718 align:start position:0%
maybe from an impoverished community may
 
04:44:22.550 --> 04:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
have a problem and struggling with h
 
04:44:25.190 --> 04:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
with the school but there's a
 
04:44:27.788 --> 04:44:27.798 align:start position:0%
qualifier very similar to the qualifiers
 
04:44:30.270 --> 04:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
that were in Senate Bill
 
04:44:32.628 --> 04:44:32.638 align:start position:0%
193 now if I understand this right
 
04:44:34.990 --> 04:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli this bill has no
 
04:44:35.000 --> 04:44:37.270 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli this bill has no
qualifier

04:44:37.270 --> 04:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
qualifier
 
04:44:40.550 --> 04:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
whatsoever and as a result of that this
 
04:44:42.948 --> 04:44:42.958 align:start position:0%
would be the first
 
04:44:46.788 --> 04:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
Universal Voucher Program if if adopted
 
04:44:49.070 --> 04:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
this would be the first Universal
 
04:44:50.990 --> 04:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
Voucher Program without any
 
04:44:52.948 --> 04:44:52.958 align:start position:0%
qualifications in the country would you
 
04:44:54.868 --> 04:44:54.878 align:start position:0%
would agree with
 
04:44:56.830 --> 04:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question and a
 
04:44:59.990 --> 04:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
couple of points uh first of all um this
 
04:45:02.750 --> 04:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
is an education savings account bill
 
04:45:04.750 --> 04:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
it's there areow no vouchers provided
 
04:45:07.350 --> 04:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
for in this bill so I think you have to
 
04:45:10.150 --> 04:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
compare it to the five states with
 
04:45:12.708 --> 04:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
education savings accounts bills we're
 
04:45:15.030 --> 04:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
not talking vouchers here even though
 
04:45:17.708 --> 04:45:17.718 align:start position:0%
that's uh a term that uh opponents like
 
04:45:21.910 --> 04:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
to throw around uh there are five states
 
04:45:24.788 --> 04:45:24.798 align:start position:0%
with education savings account bill as I
 
04:45:27.390 --> 04:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned um and it would be the
 
04:45:31.270 --> 04:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
broadest of of any of those um there are
 
04:45:35.390 --> 04:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
approximately 15 other states currently
 
04:45:36.470 --> 04:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
that have
 
04:45:40.350 --> 04:45:40.360 align:start position:0%
legislation um related to providing uh
 
04:45:43.830 --> 04:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
funding to follow the child um rather
 
04:45:46.510 --> 04:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
than go to directly to the school system
 
04:45:48.470 --> 04:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
I have not looked at all of those and I
 
04:45:51.070 --> 04:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
do not know what the qualifications are
 
04:45:53.310 --> 04:45:53.320 align:start position:0%
u in those uh current pieces of
 
04:45:57.030 --> 04:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you well we you know I
 
04:45:58.628 --> 04:45:58.638 align:start position:0%
you can call it whatever you want to but
 
04:46:00.430 --> 04:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
for me if it walks like a duck quacks
 
04:46:02.910 --> 04:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
like a duck it's a duck and I'm going to
 
04:46:04.510 --> 04:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
continue to I'm going to continue call
 
04:46:08.190 --> 04:46:08.200 align:start position:0%
it a voucher the second question is this
 
04:46:11.390 --> 04:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
and this is very serious question oh
 
04:46:13.030 --> 04:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
actually all my questions are serious
 
04:46:16.550 --> 04:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
but uh but this bill doesn't have any
 
04:46:19.390 --> 04:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination language in it
 
04:46:22.910 --> 04:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
whatsoever so if for example I had a
 
04:46:25.510 --> 04:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
child if I wanted to send my child to
 
04:46:27.310 --> 04:46:27.320 align:start position:0%
let's say a Christian
 
04:46:31.350 --> 04:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
school but my child was gay or
 
04:46:34.670 --> 04:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
transgender it's my understanding that
 
04:46:37.750 --> 04:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
my child with that kind of designation
 
04:46:41.270 --> 04:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
would not be able to attend a Christian
 
04:46:44.910 --> 04:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
School if in fact they had policies
 
04:46:48.868 --> 04:46:48.878 align:start position:0%
around uh gender identity is that
 
04:46:55.548 --> 04:46:55.558 align:start position:0%
correct um excuse me um uh first of all
 
04:46:58.868 --> 04:46:58.878 align:start position:0%
um the uh there are federal
 
04:47:02.708 --> 04:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws that apply to
 
04:47:04.910 --> 04:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
private schools as as well as public
 
04:47:08.510 --> 04:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
schools so there are discrimination laws
 
04:47:12.510 --> 04:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
that do apply um in terms of uh I know
 
04:47:14.788 --> 04:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
I've talked to um Catholic School
 
04:47:17.030 --> 04:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
Headmasters and I think um we'll hear
 
04:47:22.430 --> 04:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
from some uh today uh about that um but
 
04:47:26.230 --> 04:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh I believe that they all try to take
 
04:47:31.230 --> 04:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
uh children um uh of all uh races uh
 
04:47:35.990 --> 04:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
Creeds um I do not know of uh any
 
04:47:40.110 --> 04:47:40.120 align:start position:0%
instances um for discrimination about uh
 
04:47:44.430 --> 04:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
um gay students um and you know perhaps
 
04:47:46.670 --> 04:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
you do but but I do not yeah well
 
04:47:48.230 --> 04:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
currently there are there are there is a
 
04:47:52.270 --> 04:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
history of of transgender and gay
 
04:47:54.548 --> 04:47:54.558 align:start position:0%
students being denied from particular
 
04:47:57.110 --> 04:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
schools so the next question I have and
 
04:47:58.670 --> 04:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
this will be the final one then I'll let
 
04:48:01.670 --> 04:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
others ask questions is it correct that
 
04:48:04.548 --> 04:48:04.558 align:start position:0%
once the treasurer has to OS ited the
 
04:48:07.590 --> 04:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
state funds into the student account and
 
04:48:09.548 --> 04:48:09.558 align:start position:0%
then those funds are allocated to the
 
04:48:12.708 --> 04:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
education institution of choice that the
 
04:48:15.948 --> 04:48:15.958 align:start position:0%
state has no further obligation to
 
04:48:18.628 --> 04:48:18.638 align:start position:0%
ensure that the student is receiving an
 
04:48:20.948 --> 04:48:20.958 align:start position:0%
adequate education according to the
 
04:48:23.590 --> 04:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
state laws and standards that we have
 
04:48:25.590 --> 04:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
and there's no obligation for the
 
04:48:28.310 --> 04:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
student to take any uh Statewide
 
04:48:31.390 --> 04:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
assessment test that other students take
 
04:48:34.150 --> 04:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
in public schools that basically track
 
04:48:36.230 --> 04:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
student performance is that
 
04:48:39.470 --> 04:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
correct um once the money is deposited
 
04:48:41.548 --> 04:48:41.558 align:start position:0%
in the account it does not have to be
 
04:48:43.948 --> 04:48:43.958 align:start position:0%
spent at any particular school it can be
 
04:48:48.548 --> 04:48:48.558 align:start position:0%
used as a a vehicle to customize the uh
 
04:48:52.110 --> 04:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
education of a child uh there is no
 
04:48:54.750 --> 04:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
requirement to take a state assessment
 
04:48:58.230 --> 04:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
um in this bill um it has better means
 
04:49:03.030 --> 04:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
of assessment and that's uh uh that's
 
04:49:03.040 --> 04:49:05.030 align:start position:0%
of assessment and that's uh uh that's
parental

04:49:05.030 --> 04:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
parental
 
04:49:05.040 --> 04:49:06.190 align:start position:0%
parental
um

04:49:06.190 --> 04:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:10.390 --> 04:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
accountability a par a parent uh can
 
04:49:13.670 --> 04:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
walk take their dollars with them if
 
04:49:15.990 --> 04:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
their child is not getting the proper
 
04:49:18.868 --> 04:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
education I think that's a better means
 
04:49:21.230 --> 04:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
of accountability than it we have in the
 
04:49:24.070 --> 04:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
public schools where and for the most
 
04:49:27.670 --> 04:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
part uh parents are unable to leave if
 
04:49:29.948 --> 04:49:29.958 align:start position:0%
they're child is not getting uh
 
04:49:29.958 --> 04:49:31.350 align:start position:0%
they're child is not getting uh
satisfactory

04:49:31.350 --> 04:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
satisfactory
 
04:49:34.110 --> 04:49:34.120 align:start position:0%
education the scre so the so the answer
 
04:49:36.430 --> 04:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
answer can I continue could I finish
 
04:49:41.230 --> 04:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
sure thank you um if in a public school
 
04:49:45.990 --> 04:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
if the uh school is not
 
04:49:48.390 --> 04:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
performing the only accountability is
 
04:49:50.470 --> 04:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
that they get more
 
04:49:53.708 --> 04:49:53.718 align:start position:0%
money so I think that there is a a large
 
04:49:57.230 --> 04:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
myth around the subject of
 
04:49:58.910 --> 04:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
accountability I'm I'm sorry to
 
04:50:00.030 --> 04:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
interrupt you I thought you were I
 
04:50:02.230 --> 04:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
thought you had includ that's okay so so
 
04:50:04.430 --> 04:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
the answer to my question is yes
 
04:50:05.948 --> 04:50:05.958 align:start position:0%
that that although the state is
 
04:50:08.990 --> 04:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
responsible so to provide an adequate
 
04:50:11.628 --> 04:50:11.638 align:start position:0%
education for students in the state an
 
04:50:14.150 --> 04:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
individual who chooses to do this the
 
04:50:16.910 --> 04:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
state then has no further obligation nor
 
04:50:19.590 --> 04:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
tracking of where that student is that
 
04:50:21.510 --> 04:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
the answer to that question is yes then
 
04:50:25.110 --> 04:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
correct the um scholar yes or no
 
04:50:27.788 --> 04:50:27.798 align:start position:0%
question uh I don't think it's a yes or
 
04:50:30.270 --> 04:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
no question the scholarship organization
 
04:50:33.510 --> 04:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
tracks that student tracks the expenses
 
04:50:36.230 --> 04:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh of that student and reports back to
 
04:50:39.590 --> 04:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
the uh State on an annual basis that the
 
04:50:41.948 --> 04:50:41.958 align:start position:0%
accountability is with the parents as it
 
04:50:45.270 --> 04:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
should be for child's education I yield
 
04:50:47.670 --> 04:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
my time thank
 
04:50:49.830 --> 04:50:49.840 align:start position:0%

couple of them that you spurred by
 
04:51:04.230 --> 04:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
listening to your talk I have hard time
 
04:51:07.030 --> 04:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
falling on my computer and the the uh
 
04:51:08.470 --> 04:51:08.480 align:start position:0%

04:51:13.310 --> 04:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
chairman three times now but beyond that
 
04:51:15.548 --> 04:51:15.558 align:start position:0%
if I could resp if I could answer that I
 
04:51:18.990 --> 04:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
we we did get an email um or I'm not
 
04:51:20.948 --> 04:51:20.958 align:start position:0%
sure about an email but I know I've had
 
04:51:24.470 --> 04:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
conversations they have had delays with
 
04:51:26.948 --> 04:51:26.958 align:start position:0%
the printing of the bills um but they
 
04:51:29.590 --> 04:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
are trying as best they can to get bills
 
04:51:31.270 --> 04:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
out to everybody well that's that's
 
04:51:33.390 --> 04:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
irrelevant to everybody let's try to sck
 
04:51:37.470 --> 04:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
to the Bill and and do Mr chairman thank
 
04:51:39.948 --> 04:51:39.958 align:start position:0%
you in in your dialogue a few minutes
 
04:51:42.868 --> 04:51:42.878 align:start position:0%
ago you mentioned that that some of the
 
04:51:47.830 --> 04:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:52.510 --> 04:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
therapies is that correct yes okay so if
 
04:51:55.750 --> 04:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
if I can follow that up with this so do
 
04:51:57.270 --> 04:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
the therapies have to be predicated
 
04:52:00.708 --> 04:52:00.718 align:start position:0%
early on by having a an IEP or some
 
04:52:02.470 --> 04:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
other some other program in the public
 
04:52:04.590 --> 04:52:04.600 align:start position:0%
school that said that they need
 
04:52:09.030 --> 04:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
thies uh the bills um specifies
 
04:52:12.270 --> 04:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
therapies um including occupational
 
04:52:15.230 --> 04:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
Physical Therapy therapies like that I
 
04:52:16.230 --> 04:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
understand that was my question my
 
04:52:18.548 --> 04:52:18.558 align:start position:0%
question was do I have to have had any
 
04:52:21.030 --> 04:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
any prior recommendation of therapies
 
04:52:24.470 --> 04:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
out of an IEP or anything no so if I am
 
04:52:27.788 --> 04:52:27.798 align:start position:0%
a parent and I have a hyperactive child
 
04:52:30.070 --> 04:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
for say and I believe that they could
 
04:52:33.708 --> 04:52:33.718 align:start position:0%
use um mediation meditation therapy or
 
04:52:36.270 --> 04:52:36.280 align:start position:0%
yoga therapy or swimming therapy I think
 
04:52:38.470 --> 04:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
he said equin when I heard it so I could
 
04:52:41.270 --> 04:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
enroll my students my child in any of
 
04:52:42.948 --> 04:52:42.958 align:start position:0%
these programs to help them with a high
 
04:52:45.548 --> 04:52:45.558 align:start position:0%
activity if I thought that might work on
 
04:52:49.110 --> 04:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers from this account um I think
 
04:52:52.948 --> 04:52:52.958 align:start position:0%
if um a uh
 
04:52:56.750 --> 04:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
School excuse me has a child who has uh
 
04:52:59.270 --> 04:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
suffered from hyperactivity or things
 
04:53:01.868 --> 04:53:01.878 align:start position:0%
like that they might try uh various
 
04:53:04.470 --> 04:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
remedies themselves I think uh in this
 
04:53:07.110 --> 04:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
case the parent can look at remedies
 
04:53:09.788 --> 04:53:09.798 align:start position:0%
also so my qu so the answer to my
 
04:53:11.750 --> 04:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
question is if a parent thinks the child
 
04:53:13.750 --> 04:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
is hyperactive and they're involved in
 
04:53:15.910 --> 04:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
this program then they can they can have
 
04:53:18.910 --> 04:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
them do any program they feel is
 
04:53:18.920 --> 04:53:20.470 align:start position:0%
them do any program they feel is
adequate

04:53:20.470 --> 04:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
04:53:23.150 --> 04:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if I'd agree about any
 
04:53:25.750 --> 04:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
program but certainly from the allowable
 
04:53:29.430 --> 04:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
expenses yes and they will be uh ongoing
 
04:53:31.670 --> 04:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
monitoring um of those allowable
 
04:53:36.150 --> 04:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
expenses and report by expense well okay
 
04:53:37.628 --> 04:53:37.638 align:start position:0%
if I may just a follow so I don't waste
 
04:53:39.948 --> 04:53:39.958 align:start position:0%
everybody else's time um just the
 
04:53:41.230 --> 04:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
question you you indicated I want to
 
04:53:43.270 --> 04:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm clear you said that under
 
04:53:46.548 --> 04:53:46.558 align:start position:0%
these funding a student could be in a
 
04:53:49.708 --> 04:53:49.718 align:start position:0%
public school and exit the public school
 
04:53:53.310 --> 04:53:53.320 align:start position:0%
uh receive these funds and then reenroll
 
04:53:57.150 --> 04:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
in a different Public School using the
 
04:53:58.868 --> 04:53:58.878 align:start position:0%
fund if they chose to is that correct
 
04:54:00.670 --> 04:54:00.680 align:start position:0%
understand what you said not reenroll
 
04:54:02.948 --> 04:54:02.958 align:start position:0%
but they could enroll in an out of
 
04:54:05.830 --> 04:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
District school okay gu a minute so my
 
04:54:07.910 --> 04:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
question goes back to actually some of
 
04:54:10.430 --> 04:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
your bullying pieces there does the
 
04:54:13.430 --> 04:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
other public school is our district are
 
04:54:17.868 --> 04:54:17.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:22.310 --> 04:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
youngster excuse me um I I think um with
 
04:54:25.548 --> 04:54:25.558 align:start position:0%
within reason um and within space
 
04:54:29.670 --> 04:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
limitations um they should be uh taking
 
04:54:34.230 --> 04:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
that that child um uh if someone moves
 
04:54:35.788 --> 04:54:35.798 align:start position:0%
into your District
 
04:54:40.230 --> 04:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
now um there is no provision for not
 
04:54:43.830 --> 04:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
enrolling them in the school so with
 
04:54:45.708 --> 04:54:45.718 align:start position:0%
within space limitations I think they
 
04:54:46.750 --> 04:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
they should be
 
04:54:51.190 --> 04:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
enrolled if I may just for so Mr reell
 
04:54:53.788 --> 04:54:53.798 align:start position:0%
so your answer is no because there's no
 
04:54:55.510 --> 04:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
you're saying they should they may they
 
04:54:57.628 --> 04:54:57.638 align:start position:0%
possibly the reality is there's no
 
04:55:00.030 --> 04:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
requirement for them to go to another
 
04:55:02.788 --> 04:55:02.798 align:start position:0%
school district and be accepted there
 
04:55:04.150 --> 04:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the says that is that
 
04:55:05.990 --> 04:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
correct even though you just said that
 
04:55:10.470 --> 04:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
they could um there are several inst
 
04:55:12.910 --> 04:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
several locations in the bill where we
 
04:55:16.670 --> 04:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
have to um uh have clarifying language
 
04:55:19.190 --> 04:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
about um enrolling in and out of
 
04:55:22.070 --> 04:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
District uh public
 
04:55:25.030 --> 04:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
school okay so the answer is
 
04:55:28.070 --> 04:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
no okay so my my final question the
 
04:55:29.948 --> 04:55:29.958 align:start position:0%
final question at this point for me
 
04:55:31.390 --> 04:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
representative representative how many
 
04:55:33.390 --> 04:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
questions you gonna have because we got
 
04:55:36.070 --> 04:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
set three Mr chairman well from now on
 
04:55:37.868 --> 04:55:37.878 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep everything to two
 
04:55:39.910 --> 04:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
Okay a followup and that's it so that we
 
04:55:42.190 --> 04:55:42.200 align:start position:0%
can share the wealth okay well this is a
 
04:55:45.670 --> 04:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
pretty important bill uh Mr chairman um
 
04:55:47.990 --> 04:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
brother just just my own my own learn
 
04:55:49.990 --> 04:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
identification I'm reading about the
 
04:55:50.000 --> 04:55:51.190 align:start position:0%
identification I'm reading about the
scholarship

04:55:51.190 --> 04:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
04:55:52.910 --> 04:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
organization that is going to be
 
04:55:55.470 --> 04:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
overseeing the distribution and the
 
04:55:57.948 --> 04:55:57.958 align:start position:0%
accountability of the distribution not
 
04:55:59.548 --> 04:55:59.558 align:start position:0%
necessarily the accountability of the
 
04:56:01.670 --> 04:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
economic success but the accountability
 
04:56:03.670 --> 04:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
of the distribution of the funds as they
 
04:56:06.350 --> 04:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
align with the requirements of the bill
 
04:56:09.708 --> 04:56:09.718 align:start position:0%
um so and I think I I read that or that
 
04:56:11.788 --> 04:56:11.798 align:start position:0%
it was a they have up an up to and I
 
04:56:12.990 --> 04:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
don't know what the minimum is but up to
 
04:56:16.150 --> 04:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
a 10% uh cut back on that for the
 
04:56:19.510 --> 04:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
administrative cost to do that so is
 
04:56:22.628 --> 04:56:22.638 align:start position:0%
that is that am I right so far yes okay
 
04:56:26.270 --> 04:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
so my question is then this since this
 
04:56:27.830 --> 04:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
if this bill goes through and this is
 
04:56:30.190 --> 04:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
going to this is going to be uh huge
 
04:56:32.910 --> 04:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
money so is it going to be an open
 
04:56:35.868 --> 04:56:35.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity for for other vendors to
 
04:56:38.230 --> 04:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
petition to get a chance at this this
 
04:56:40.230 --> 04:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
grant to oversee this to oversee this
 
04:56:43.110 --> 04:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
funding piece um within the state are
 
04:56:46.110 --> 04:56:46.120 align:start position:0%
other are other uh private uh wealth
 
04:56:48.030 --> 04:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
management people uh meets the
 
04:56:49.948 --> 04:56:49.958 align:start position:0%
requirements or this just a closed op
 
04:56:53.510 --> 04:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
close shop uh scholarship
 
04:56:56.310 --> 04:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
organizations um are validated by the
 
04:56:59.470 --> 04:56:59.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue uh under current
 
04:57:01.628 --> 04:57:01.638 align:start position:0%
statute I understand that I'm saying but
 
04:57:04.430 --> 04:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
since it's a new organization does it
 
04:57:07.070 --> 04:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
guess the question is I there's no
 
04:57:11.110 --> 04:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
there's no restriction in this bill on
 
04:57:13.030 --> 04:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
um the number of scholarship
 
04:57:16.150 --> 04:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
organizations um or anything like that
 
04:57:18.350 --> 04:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I yield after my
 
04:57:19.628 --> 04:57:19.638 align:start position:0%
three questions there appreciate your
 
04:57:25.910 --> 04:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:30.830 --> 04:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
questions repr none no no
 
04:57:35.030 --> 04:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
noes thank you Mr chair um I have two
 
04:57:37.750 --> 04:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
questions uh my first question to you
 
04:57:39.430 --> 04:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative cordelli
 
04:57:42.150 --> 04:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
for taking these questions sure um does
 
04:57:44.990 --> 04:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
this bill include students who are
 
04:57:46.910 --> 04:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
currently being
 
04:57:51.070 --> 04:57:51.080 align:start position:0%
homeschooled yes um and under this bill
 
04:57:53.270 --> 04:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
could a homeschool
 
04:57:57.350 --> 04:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
parent apply for the voucher um receive
 
04:58:01.708 --> 04:58:01.718 align:start position:0%
the voucher uh homeschool the child and
 
04:58:04.070 --> 04:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
then decide that it things aren't
 
04:58:07.948 --> 04:58:07.958 align:start position:0%
working well send them back send them to
 
04:58:10.070 --> 04:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
the sunding
 
04:58:12.948 --> 04:58:12.958 align:start position:0%
district uh but that money that's in the
 
04:58:16.750 --> 04:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
voucher this the fund the voucher fund
 
04:58:18.670 --> 04:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
never gets replaced to the school is
 
04:58:20.628 --> 04:58:20.638 align:start position:0%
that correct it gets held with the
 
04:58:24.708 --> 04:58:24.718 align:start position:0%
parent um the account suspended but if
 
04:58:27.350 --> 04:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
the parent wants to use that future uh
 
04:58:29.628 --> 04:58:29.638 align:start position:0%
time they can with the same child is
 
04:58:33.110 --> 04:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
that true um with the education safe
 
04:58:36.750 --> 04:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
savings account um a homeschooler um
 
04:58:40.670 --> 04:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
would be eligible for funds um we'll
 
04:58:42.430 --> 04:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
probably have discussion about it um a
 
04:58:45.030 --> 04:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
little later but um it's it's really a a
 
04:58:49.230 --> 04:58:49.240 align:start position:0%
new category they're the EFA student um
 
04:58:52.590 --> 04:58:52.600 align:start position:0%
and they are eligible to use those funds
 
04:58:55.670 --> 04:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
um how they wish which would include um
 
04:58:59.270 --> 04:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
enrolling um in a public school but use
 
04:59:02.470 --> 04:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
those funds um for the tuition at that
 
04:59:03.548 --> 04:59:03.558 align:start position:0%
public school
 
04:59:05.150 --> 04:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
and that would be monitored by the
 
04:59:07.628 --> 04:59:07.638 align:start position:0%
department just just a clarifying I
 
04:59:10.708 --> 04:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
asked if if they re if that homeschooler
 
04:59:13.270 --> 04:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
went to their sending district and
 
04:59:16.070 --> 04:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
didn't actually go to an an another
 
04:59:18.628 --> 04:59:18.638 align:start position:0%
District but uh the parent let's say in
 
04:59:21.190 --> 04:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
Newport decided that they couldn't
 
04:59:24.190 --> 04:59:24.200 align:start position:0%
handle the homeschooling and decide even
 
04:59:25.830 --> 04:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
after they received this voucher and
 
04:59:28.430 --> 04:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
then decided to send the child to the
 
04:59:30.868 --> 04:59:30.878 align:start position:0%
Newport school system which has already
 
04:59:33.590 --> 04:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
lost the money uh that was given to the
 
04:59:35.708 --> 04:59:35.718 align:start position:0%
through the voucher uh but that money
 
04:59:38.270 --> 04:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
never comes back to Newport schools it
 
04:59:39.910 --> 04:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
remains in the account so that the
 
04:59:42.390 --> 04:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
parent if they choose to take them back
 
04:59:45.190 --> 04:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
out of Newport school for some reason um
 
04:59:47.070 --> 04:59:47.080 align:start position:0%
and homeschool them again they can use
 
04:59:49.190 --> 04:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
that money that's in that account is
 
04:59:51.708 --> 04:59:51.718 align:start position:0%
that true if if the student was
 
04:59:55.350 --> 04:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
homeschooling in the Newport area um the
 
04:59:57.628 --> 04:59:57.638 align:start position:0%
district wouldn't lose any money for
 
05:00:00.070 --> 05:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
that uh student because they wouldn't be
 
05:00:01.590 --> 05:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
receiving any money for that student
 
05:00:02.948 --> 05:00:02.958 align:start position:0%
since they're hom school they're not in
 
05:00:04.150 --> 05:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
enrolled in that
 
05:00:06.670 --> 05:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
school but would they I'm I'm sorry but
 
05:00:09.070 --> 05:00:09.080 align:start position:0%
would they receive if the student then
 
05:00:11.788 --> 05:00:11.798 align:start position:0%
enrolled for a short period of time
 
05:00:13.868 --> 05:00:13.878 align:start position:0%
let's say four months because the
 
05:00:16.230 --> 05:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
homeschooling wasn't working
 
05:00:19.910 --> 05:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
out um then they that account would
 
05:00:24.470 --> 05:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
still be in the parents purview and uh
 
05:00:26.030 --> 05:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
could be used let's say for summer
 
05:00:29.830 --> 05:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
school if when that that school year was
 
05:00:32.510 --> 05:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
over um I believe so if I understand
 
05:00:35.470 --> 05:00:35.480 align:start position:0%
your question correctly
 
05:00:40.590 --> 05:00:40.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:43.470 --> 05:00:43.480 align:start position:0%
Mullen thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:00:45.470 --> 05:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
you representative cordelli for taking
 
05:00:49.708 --> 05:00:49.718 align:start position:0%
my questions um I am looking at the
 
05:00:51.830 --> 05:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
section of the bill towards the end that
 
05:00:55.110 --> 05:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
is entitled independence of Education
 
05:00:55.120 --> 05:00:56.548 align:start position:0%
is entitled independence of Education
Service

05:00:56.548 --> 05:00:56.558 align:start position:0%
Service
 
05:00:59.230 --> 05:00:59.240 align:start position:0%
Providers there are two statements in
 
05:01:02.510 --> 05:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
that section that um I I I want to get
 
05:01:04.470 --> 05:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
some clarification
 
05:01:09.670 --> 05:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
on one is uh section two that says
 
05:01:12.350 --> 05:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
Education Service Providers shall be
 
05:01:14.910 --> 05:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
given maximum freedom to provide for the
 
05:01:18.548 --> 05:01:18.558 align:start position:0%
educational needs of educ EFA students
 
05:01:21.548 --> 05:01:21.558 align:start position:0%
without governmental control and I'm
 
05:01:24.830 --> 05:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could Define for me
 
05:01:27.390 --> 05:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
what you mean or what the bill means not
 
05:01:29.548 --> 05:01:29.558 align:start position:0%
that you're the author of the bill but
 
05:01:32.070 --> 05:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh what the bill means by governmental
 
05:01:32.080 --> 05:01:33.990 align:start position:0%
uh what the bill means by governmental
control

05:01:33.990 --> 05:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
control
 
05:01:39.030 --> 05:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
um uh I think the intent there is um uh
 
05:01:41.750 --> 05:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
not to over regulate uh Education
 
05:01:45.230 --> 05:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
Service Providers um whether that is a
 
05:01:50.590 --> 05:01:50.600 align:start position:0%
uh a tutor or a private uh education
 
05:01:53.470 --> 05:01:53.480 align:start position:0%
institution so when you talk about so
 
05:01:56.310 --> 05:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
just for clarity sake um governmental
 
05:01:56.320 --> 05:01:57.548 align:start position:0%
just for clarity sake um governmental
control

05:01:57.548 --> 05:01:57.558 align:start position:0%
control
 
05:02:01.350 --> 05:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
meaning state laws law that kind of
 
05:02:05.470 --> 05:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
thing well um if if there are federal
 
05:02:08.948 --> 05:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
laws um related to or state laws related
 
05:02:11.310 --> 05:02:11.320 align:start position:0%
to the service that they're providing um
 
05:02:13.708 --> 05:02:13.718 align:start position:0%
this is not a um get out of jail free
 
05:02:16.310 --> 05:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
card in terms of abiding by those laws
 
05:02:19.030 --> 05:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
as we talked about with uh State uh
 
05:02:21.510 --> 05:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
privacy laws for instance for
 
05:02:25.110 --> 05:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
students is there could if I could uh
 
05:02:27.230 --> 05:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
representative is there a mechanism in
 
05:02:31.510 --> 05:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
the bill to delineate between those
 
05:02:33.548 --> 05:02:33.558 align:start position:0%
state and federal laws that somebody
 
05:02:35.470 --> 05:02:35.480 align:start position:0%
would have to follow and those state and
 
05:02:37.150 --> 05:02:37.160 align:start position:0%
federal laws that somebody
 
05:02:39.910 --> 05:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I I don't think that there is
 
05:02:41.910 --> 05:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
anything in the bill saying that there
 
05:02:45.510 --> 05:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
are any state and federal laws um that
 
05:02:48.750 --> 05:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
uh you do not have to AB abide
 
05:02:52.070 --> 05:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
by okay yeah that was my that that was
 
05:02:53.948 --> 05:02:53.958 align:start position:0%
my own personal interpretation of
 
05:02:56.670 --> 05:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
without governmental control my second
 
05:02:59.628 --> 05:02:59.638 align:start position:0%
uh the second statement that I uh was if
 
05:03:02.070 --> 05:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
I could if I could just follow up I I
 
05:03:04.350 --> 05:03:04.360 align:start position:0%
think it's more in terms of Regulation
 
05:03:06.510 --> 05:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
rather than uh state or federal law at
 
05:03:06.520 --> 05:03:07.948 align:start position:0%
rather than uh state or federal law at
that

05:03:07.948 --> 05:03:07.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:03:10.510 --> 05:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
point okay well I'm sure we'll there'll
 
05:03:12.990 --> 05:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
be much more discussion about that as
 
05:03:16.430 --> 05:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
the bill moves forward uh section five
 
05:03:20.788 --> 05:03:20.798 align:start position:0%
of that same uh that same area no
 
05:03:23.750 --> 05:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
education service provider shall be
 
05:03:27.910 --> 05:03:27.920 align:start position:0%

from the
 
05:03:40.430 --> 05:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
EFA um I was struck by your discussion
 
05:03:40.440 --> 05:03:41.788 align:start position:0%
EFA um I was struck by your discussion
about

05:03:41.788 --> 05:03:41.798 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:03:45.030 --> 05:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
eligibility because it sounds to me like
 
05:03:48.110 --> 05:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
this section of the independence of Ed
 
05:03:50.670 --> 05:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
service providers
 
05:03:53.788 --> 05:03:53.798 align:start position:0%
um allows these Educational Service
 
05:03:56.708 --> 05:03:56.718 align:start position:0%
Providers to determine who they're going
 
05:04:00.350 --> 05:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
to admit and not admit and I'm wondering
 
05:04:03.548 --> 05:04:03.558 align:start position:0%
if you could explain to me what role
 
05:04:06.590 --> 05:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
somebody's Creed would have in whether
 
05:04:11.590 --> 05:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
or not um a student was eligible or
 
05:04:13.350 --> 05:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
enrolled in their
 
05:04:16.750 --> 05:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
program for instance a religious school
 
05:04:20.948 --> 05:04:20.958 align:start position:0%
is not going to have to um uh change
 
05:04:25.190 --> 05:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
their um their whole concept or uh uh
 
05:04:29.430 --> 05:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
way of doing business or um uh religious
 
05:04:33.350 --> 05:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
views um based on uh accepting a student
 
05:04:37.270 --> 05:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
um with an EFA account
 
05:04:40.590 --> 05:04:40.600 align:start position:0%
um they have they will maintain their
 
05:04:42.470 --> 05:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
religious freedoms for instance and
 
05:04:45.430 --> 05:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
their uh religious
 
05:04:50.788 --> 05:04:50.798 align:start position:0%

Hampshire um I expect that you will have
 
05:07:48.230 --> 05:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
a h a thorough and uh and a very
 
05:07:50.788 --> 05:07:50.798 align:start position:0%
spirited um Committee hearing today and
 
05:07:53.750 --> 05:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
get lots of good input into this um I
 
05:07:56.670 --> 05:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
encourage everyone to uh consider that
 
05:07:59.910 --> 05:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
we share a common goal of Bright Futures
 
05:08:02.628 --> 05:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
for all of our students so whatever your
 
05:08:04.868 --> 05:08:04.878 align:start position:0%
perspective is on this particular piece
 
05:08:07.390 --> 05:08:07.400 align:start position:0%
of legislation we all know that we want
 
05:08:09.788 --> 05:08:09.798 align:start position:0%
all New Hampshire students to be able to
 
05:08:14.430 --> 05:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
succeed in life and grow up to be strong
 
05:08:15.670 --> 05:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:08:18.190 --> 05:08:18.200 align:start position:0%
citizens I just will share a couple of
 
05:08:20.708 --> 05:08:20.718 align:start position:0%
thoughts um before if you want I can
 
05:08:22.750 --> 05:08:22.760 align:start position:0%
switch into some questions but I think
 
05:08:26.628 --> 05:08:26.638 align:start position:0%
it's important um for everyone to
 
05:08:30.190 --> 05:08:30.200 align:start position:0%
understand the context for this uh this
 
05:08:32.190 --> 05:08:32.200 align:start position:0%
P particular piece of legislation so we
 
05:08:35.390 --> 05:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
we've got RSA 1931 which is our truancy
 
05:08:38.390 --> 05:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
law and that enumerates that students or
 
05:08:40.190 --> 05:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
children in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:08:44.190 --> 05:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
between the ages of six and 18 are
 
05:08:47.990 --> 05:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
required to be enrolled in an education
 
05:08:51.470 --> 05:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
program here in New Hampshire today we
 
05:08:55.310 --> 05:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
have three such education programs we
 
05:08:58.350 --> 05:08:58.360 align:start position:0%
have our public school system and that
 
05:09:00.270 --> 05:09:00.280 align:start position:0%
includes our traditional Public Schools
 
05:09:03.230 --> 05:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
as well as our Charter Public Schools
 
05:09:06.150 --> 05:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
we have non-public schools and those are
 
05:09:07.670 --> 05:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
non-public schools that are
 
05:09:09.190 --> 05:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
programmatically approved by the
 
05:09:11.230 --> 05:09:11.240 align:start position:0%
department or they're approved for
 
05:09:13.910 --> 05:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
attendance and we have a third category
 
05:09:17.070 --> 05:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
of home education student a student
 
05:09:20.390 --> 05:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
today between ages of six and 18 is
 
05:09:22.750 --> 05:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
required to be enrolled in one of these
 
05:09:26.310 --> 05:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
types of education programs and by doing
 
05:09:28.910 --> 05:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
so they are not considered
 
05:09:31.628 --> 05:09:31.638 align:start position:0%
truant as I understand this particular
 
05:09:35.230 --> 05:09:35.240 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation you are creating a
 
05:09:39.470 --> 05:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
fourth category of Education option for
 
05:09:42.310 --> 05:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
a student and that is an education
 
05:09:45.350 --> 05:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
Freedom account student and I think it's
 
05:09:49.270 --> 05:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
important to understand that context
 
05:09:52.150 --> 05:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
because it really becomes responsive to
 
05:09:54.948 --> 05:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
many of the questions that I have heard
 
05:09:56.990 --> 05:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
um you know out there and individuals
 
05:10:00.270 --> 05:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
who have reached out to me because of a
 
05:10:04.030 --> 05:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
lack of understanding of this governance
 
05:10:07.948 --> 05:10:07.958 align:start position:0%
structure around the education system we
 
05:10:10.708 --> 05:10:10.718 align:start position:0%
ask questions that really are not gerine
 
05:10:13.390 --> 05:10:13.400 align:start position:0%
to the bill itself because the way that
 
05:10:17.030 --> 05:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
this is structured many of our laws then
 
05:10:19.390 --> 05:10:19.400 align:start position:0%
cover those areas that are otherwise
 
05:10:21.150 --> 05:10:21.160 align:start position:0%
areas of
 
05:10:23.868 --> 05:10:23.878 align:start position:0%
concern I would now just as well like to
 
05:10:25.270 --> 05:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
spend a little bit of time the
 
05:10:28.070 --> 05:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
department put out a fiscal analysis
 
05:10:31.990 --> 05:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
relative to this bill uh the conclusion
 
05:10:34.670 --> 05:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
ion of that fiscal analysis is that
 
05:10:37.868 --> 05:10:37.878 align:start position:0%
there is significant cost savings to New
 
05:10:40.788 --> 05:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers as a result of the
 
05:10:43.948 --> 05:10:43.958 align:start position:0%
enactment of this particular piece of
 
05:10:48.150 --> 05:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
legislation now at a very high level and
 
05:10:50.150 --> 05:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
really in a in a simplified version of
 
05:10:52.548 --> 05:10:52.558 align:start position:0%
trying to understand how it could be
 
05:10:54.470 --> 05:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire taxpayers would
 
05:10:56.910 --> 05:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
benefit from the passage of this bill we
 
05:10:59.910 --> 05:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
need to understand that a typical the
 
05:11:02.670 --> 05:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
the cost of educating a typical student
 
05:11:04.670 --> 05:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
today is about
 
05:11:09.190 --> 05:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
$20,000 per year an EFA student on the
 
05:11:11.910 --> 05:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
other hand order Mr

05:11:19.590 --> 05:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
through a um a fiscal note shouldn't
 
05:11:22.350 --> 05:11:22.360 align:start position:0%

assistant we're going to have in this
 
05:11:29.030 --> 05:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
particular situation that done through
 
05:11:31.150 --> 05:11:31.160 align:start position:0%
the department the department is the one
 
05:11:32.670 --> 05:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
who developed
 
05:11:35.150 --> 05:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
the financial reports which go over to
 
05:11:38.390 --> 05:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
the LBA so the department is responsible
 
05:11:39.910 --> 05:11:39.920 align:start position:0%

commissioner is providing go ahead Mr

commissioner thank you um so again just
 
05:11:50.548 --> 05:11:50.558 align:start position:0%
to reiterate the typical cost to educate
 
05:11:52.670 --> 05:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
a student in New Hampshire is about
 
05:11:56.628 --> 05:11:56.638 align:start position:0%
$20,000 per year an EFA student when a
 
05:11:59.110 --> 05:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
parent chooses this option for their
 
05:12:02.868 --> 05:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
children will crost approximately $5,000
 
05:12:05.868 --> 05:12:05.878 align:start position:0%
per year so again on a simplified basis
 
05:12:08.430 --> 05:12:08.440 align:start position:0%
every student currently attending a
 
05:12:11.350 --> 05:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
public school who adopts an EFA the
 
05:12:13.910 --> 05:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers have the opportunity to save
 
05:12:16.708 --> 05:12:16.718 align:start position:0%
$155,000 per student now I recognize
 
05:12:19.470 --> 05:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
that that is a highlevel uh analysis but
 
05:12:22.310 --> 05:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
it is a simple way to kind of wrap our
 
05:12:24.788 --> 05:12:24.798 align:start position:0%
heads around the idea that taxpayers can
 
05:12:27.590 --> 05:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
be the beneficiaries of an Innovative
 
05:12:30.628 --> 05:12:30.638 align:start position:0%
program like this in the analysis that
 
05:12:33.030 --> 05:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
we released there were a number of
 
05:12:34.830 --> 05:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
different assumptions and I would like
 
05:12:38.190 --> 05:12:38.200 align:start position:0%
to just uh explain or weigh in on a
 
05:12:40.788 --> 05:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
couple of those um one of the first key
 
05:12:44.230 --> 05:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
assumptions that we have really is that
 
05:12:47.390 --> 05:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
when a student leaves uh the public
 
05:12:49.910 --> 05:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
school they know the school itself no
 
05:12:52.708 --> 05:12:52.718 align:start position:0%
longer has the obligation to educate
 
05:12:57.310 --> 05:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
that child it does not mean that um
 
05:13:00.230 --> 05:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
immediately uh everybody is going to be
 
05:13:03.190 --> 05:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
able to uh change their budgets and so
 
05:13:05.230 --> 05:13:05.240 align:start position:0%
we have balanced that because that's one
 
05:13:07.110 --> 05:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
of the objections that we often hear
 
05:13:09.150 --> 05:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
simply because a student leaves a
 
05:13:10.910 --> 05:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
traditional public school doesn't mean
 
05:13:13.110 --> 05:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
that the uh school system has the
 
05:13:15.868 --> 05:13:15.878 align:start position:0%
ability to immediately adjust its budget
 
05:13:18.628 --> 05:13:18.638 align:start position:0%
so in our analys we have afforded
 
05:13:21.590 --> 05:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
schools generous amounts of time up to
 
05:13:24.150 --> 05:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
three years to be able to adjust their
 
05:13:26.510 --> 05:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
cost structures to reflect the fact that
 
05:13:29.230 --> 05:13:29.240 align:start position:0%
some students may decide that they want
 
05:13:32.868 --> 05:13:32.878 align:start position:0%
to adopt one of these uh education
 
05:13:32.878 --> 05:13:34.030 align:start position:0%
to adopt one of these uh education
Freedom

05:13:34.030 --> 05:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
Freedom
 
05:13:37.270 --> 05:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
accounts another key driver in the model
 
05:13:40.190 --> 05:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
is really how many of our students might
 
05:13:43.868 --> 05:13:43.878 align:start position:0%
actually adopt these types of programs
 
05:13:47.510 --> 05:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh there is a an argument that is made
 
05:13:50.548 --> 05:13:50.558 align:start position:0%
that I think does a disservice to our
 
05:13:52.708 --> 05:13:52.718 align:start position:0%
strong public schools here in New
 
05:13:57.030 --> 05:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that argument is that
 
05:13:59.270 --> 05:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
there will be students fleeing from our
 
05:14:02.510 --> 05:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
systems when in fact this is not what we
 
05:14:05.788 --> 05:14:05.798 align:start position:0%
anticipate to be the case because our
 
05:14:08.110 --> 05:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
traditional Public Schools our public
 
05:14:11.430 --> 05:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
charter schools offer students many
 
05:14:14.150 --> 05:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities to receive an excellent
 
05:14:16.548 --> 05:14:16.558 align:start position:0%
education so when we modeled this
 
05:14:19.070 --> 05:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
program what we did is we went out to a
 
05:14:21.590 --> 05:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
state that had the most similar program
 
05:14:25.350 --> 05:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
Arizona and we used their adoption rates
 
05:14:27.670 --> 05:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of how their program played out
 
05:14:30.548 --> 05:14:30.558 align:start position:0%
when it was first adopted um and
 
05:14:33.750 --> 05:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes when you look at those numbers
 
05:14:37.310 --> 05:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
it it seems contradictory um I had one
 
05:14:39.868 --> 05:14:39.878 align:start position:0%
person ask me about the adoption rates
 
05:14:43.470 --> 05:14:43.480 align:start position:0%
well why wouldn't more students adopt an
 
05:14:46.070 --> 05:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
EFA and in fact I think this is a very
 
05:14:48.430 --> 05:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
important sociological question why
 
05:14:50.708 --> 05:14:50.718 align:start position:0%
wouldn't someone take advantage of some
 
05:14:53.190 --> 05:14:53.200 align:start position:0%
perceived benefit that is being offered
 
05:14:57.430 --> 05:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
to them and why indeed if we take a look
 
05:15:00.990 --> 05:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
in at uh one of our snap programs
 
05:15:03.830 --> 05:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
nationally only 29% of eligible
 
05:15:05.628 --> 05:15:05.638 align:start position:0%
participants in their lowest benefit
 
05:15:05.638 --> 05:15:06.628 align:start position:0%
participants in their lowest benefit
level

05:15:06.628 --> 05:15:06.638 align:start position:0%
level
 
05:15:10.548 --> 05:15:10.558 align:start position:0%
participate if I take for example my
 
05:15:13.070 --> 05:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
temporary Aid to needy families or my
 
05:15:15.708 --> 05:15:15.718 align:start position:0%
TANF on a national level we only have
 
05:15:18.270 --> 05:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
25% participation and these are cash
 
05:15:22.670 --> 05:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
benefit programs if I look at all of the
 
05:15:25.708 --> 05:15:25.718 align:start position:0%
uh Choice programs across the state
 
05:15:28.670 --> 05:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
there are 21 million students who are
 
05:15:31.590 --> 05:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
eligible to participate in these very
 
05:15:33.670 --> 05:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
various Choice programs in if in other
 
05:15:37.110 --> 05:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
states and yet only 1.3 million students
 
05:15:40.350 --> 05:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
or 6% ultimately participate and you
 
05:15:41.670 --> 05:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
have to understand that these are
 
05:15:43.430 --> 05:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
programs that have been around in many
 
05:15:46.070 --> 05:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
cases for decades and then if I look
 
05:15:48.510 --> 05:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
closer to home here in New Hampshire in
 
05:15:50.390 --> 05:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
our scholarship program which has been
 
05:15:51.670 --> 05:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
in place since
 
05:15:55.190 --> 05:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
2012 we have 48,000 students who are
 
05:15:58.510 --> 05:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
eligible to participate in that program
 
05:16:01.150 --> 05:16:01.160 align:start position:0%
and yet we have around 500 students who
 
05:16:04.150 --> 05:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
parti ipate in that program and so I
 
05:16:07.110 --> 05:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
think it's important to consider that we
 
05:16:10.030 --> 05:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
in the process of debating this bill we
 
05:16:13.628 --> 05:16:13.638 align:start position:0%
don't disparage our public schools by
 
05:16:16.590 --> 05:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
indicating that somehow because we
 
05:16:20.310 --> 05:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
create an option for students who For
 
05:16:22.110 --> 05:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
Whom the current system is not meeting
 
05:16:24.750 --> 05:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
their needs are going to see significant
 
05:16:27.350 --> 05:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
losses we offer a strong education
 
05:16:29.350 --> 05:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
system here in New Hampshire and this is
 
05:16:31.310 --> 05:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
a program that will help meet the needs
 
05:16:34.110 --> 05:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
of of students for whom that system is
 
05:16:37.070 --> 05:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
not working and there's another factor
 
05:16:40.150 --> 05:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
that I just want to uh mention here and
 
05:16:42.110 --> 05:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
I see representative luno and
 
05:16:45.350 --> 05:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative Miler on the call and uh
 
05:16:47.948 --> 05:16:47.958 align:start position:0%
both of these gentlemen were involved in
 
05:16:49.788 --> 05:16:49.798 align:start position:0%
much of the work around the school
 
05:16:53.030 --> 05:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
funding commission and one of the themes
 
05:16:55.788 --> 05:16:55.798 align:start position:0%
that came out of that commission was for
 
05:16:58.628 --> 05:16:58.638 align:start position:0%
the state to play a greater role in
 
05:17:01.708 --> 05:17:01.718 align:start position:0%
contributing to the cost of Education
 
05:17:04.350 --> 05:17:04.360 align:start position:0%
and provide local property taxpayers
 
05:17:08.548 --> 05:17:08.558 align:start position:0%
relief and in fact that is a concentric
 
05:17:12.030 --> 05:17:12.040 align:start position:0%
circle and a overlap relative to this
 
05:17:14.510 --> 05:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
program where you will see the state
 
05:17:19.230 --> 05:17:19.240 align:start position:0%
leaning in and providing support to
 
05:17:21.350 --> 05:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
public education for our students here
 
05:17:24.948 --> 05:17:24.958 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and providing broad
 
05:17:28.110 --> 05:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
really taxpayer savings um at the local
 
05:17:30.628 --> 05:17:30.638 align:start position:0%
property tax level and so I think that
 
05:17:32.230 --> 05:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
we should look at at all of the
 
05:17:33.788 --> 05:17:33.798 align:start position:0%
activities that are taking place in the
 
05:17:37.470 --> 05:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
state how these various initiatives are
 
05:17:40.390 --> 05:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
contributing and uh moving in some of
 
05:17:43.110 --> 05:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
the same directions maybe not everything
 
05:17:45.390 --> 05:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
exactly alignment but there is certainly
 
05:17:47.350 --> 05:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh overlap there that's important to
 
05:17:49.590 --> 05:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
consider so again I thank you for
 
05:17:51.868 --> 05:17:51.878 align:start position:0%
allowing me to join you today I know
 
05:17:53.350 --> 05:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
that you will be receiving much
 
05:17:55.708 --> 05:17:55.718 align:start position:0%
testimony today from a lot of different
 
05:17:58.070 --> 05:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
individuals um and I hope that you are
 
05:18:00.030 --> 05:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
able to get all of the information that
 
05:18:02.548 --> 05:18:02.558 align:start position:0%
you need so that again we can continue
 
05:18:05.190 --> 05:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
forward with our shared common goal of
 
05:18:06.990 --> 05:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
making sure that we offer all of our
 
05:18:08.590 --> 05:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
students here in New Hampshire Bright
 
05:18:11.270 --> 05:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
Futures and so thank you representative
 
05:18:13.430 --> 05:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
lad for allowing me to come and spend
 
05:18:15.548 --> 05:18:15.558 align:start position:0%
some time with you thank you very much
 
05:18:17.708 --> 05:18:17.718 align:start position:0%
commissioner are there any questions for
 
05:18:20.670 --> 05:18:20.680 align:start position:0%
the commissioner uh represent
 
05:18:23.430 --> 05:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
lean uh thank you very much Mr chair and
 
05:18:26.510 --> 05:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr commissioner for coming to
 
05:18:28.868 --> 05:18:28.878 align:start position:0%
speak to us um before you join the call
 
05:18:30.910 --> 05:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
there was a question on what happens if
 
05:18:32.510 --> 05:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
a student returns to their local public
 
05:18:33.910 --> 05:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
school and I didn't know if you might
 
05:18:36.110 --> 05:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
provide any guidance on how quickly the
 
05:18:37.830 --> 05:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
adequacy funds would return to that
 
05:18:39.910 --> 05:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
school for the
 
05:18:43.868 --> 05:18:43.878 align:start position:0%
student um certainly so um if a student
 
05:18:45.390 --> 05:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the way that this
 
05:18:48.390 --> 05:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
bill is structured if a student elects
 
05:18:51.708 --> 05:18:51.718 align:start position:0%
to have an education Freedom account at
 
05:18:53.750 --> 05:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
the department we would be required to
 
05:18:56.548 --> 05:18:56.558 align:start position:0%
fund that using the same schule that we
 
05:18:59.350 --> 05:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
fund our adequacy payments to our
 
05:19:01.470 --> 05:19:01.480 align:start position:0%
traditional public schools and that
 
05:19:03.750 --> 05:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
means that we make four payments during
 
05:19:07.070 --> 05:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
the year so if a student were to elect
 
05:19:10.430 --> 05:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
an education Freedom account and they
 
05:19:13.350 --> 05:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
were to leave partway through that year
 
05:19:16.390 --> 05:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
so they don't finish out the year and
 
05:19:19.030 --> 05:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
then my understanding is that those
 
05:19:21.070 --> 05:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account dollars would
 
05:19:24.030 --> 05:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
be returned to the education trust fund
 
05:19:26.750 --> 05:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to be used for other
 
05:19:29.708 --> 05:19:29.718 align:start position:0%
educational options that student who
 
05:19:32.110 --> 05:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
returns to the public school school what
 
05:19:34.708 --> 05:19:34.718 align:start position:0%
we have to understand is when a student
 
05:19:38.030 --> 05:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
adop we pay in AAR for students in our
 
05:19:40.510 --> 05:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
public education system so if a student
 
05:19:44.270 --> 05:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
is attending a public school in year one
 
05:19:47.830 --> 05:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
and in year two they adopt an EFA during
 
05:19:51.430 --> 05:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
year two this public school is being
 
05:19:53.310 --> 05:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
paid for that student even though they
 
05:19:55.390 --> 05:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
are not responsible for the education of
 
05:19:58.110 --> 05:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
that student when that student leaves
 
05:20:01.750 --> 05:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
and takes an EFA in that next and then
 
05:20:03.510 --> 05:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
and then they reenroll then in that
 
05:20:05.310 --> 05:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
subsequent year they would again be paid
 
05:20:07.910 --> 05:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
for that student because we pay iners it
 
05:20:09.430 --> 05:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
would only be if they stayed out for the
 
05:20:11.628 --> 05:20:11.638 align:start position:0%
entire period uh that the school would
 
05:20:13.708 --> 05:20:13.718 align:start position:0%
not receive funding for
 
05:20:16.470 --> 05:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
them thank you very much uh are there
 
05:20:23.548 --> 05:20:23.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:26.310 --> 05:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair and
 
05:20:29.030 --> 05:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you commissioner um uh first
 
05:20:31.750 --> 05:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
of all uh make no mistake that that this
 
05:20:33.350 --> 05:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
voucher Bill does not flow from the
 
05:20:35.910 --> 05:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
findings nor the recommendations of the
 
05:20:37.670 --> 05:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
school funding commission so I think
 
05:20:40.590 --> 05:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
that has to be U stated right up front
 
05:20:42.548 --> 05:20:42.558 align:start position:0%
and any sort of representation that this
 
05:20:44.670 --> 05:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
is this is a result of that work would
 
05:20:48.110 --> 05:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
be uh would be totally inaccurate so um
 
05:20:50.990 --> 05:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
my uh my my first question to you um Mr
 
05:20:53.150 --> 05:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner is um is where does New
 
05:20:56.230 --> 05:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire stand right now in terms of
 
05:20:58.470 --> 05:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
nationally in terms of uh student
 
05:21:01.430 --> 05:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
outcomes yeah so let me just clarify my
 
05:21:04.390 --> 05:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
point representative luno I was not
 
05:21:07.310 --> 05:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
stating in the beginning that the school
 
05:21:11.190 --> 05:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
funding commission itself was either
 
05:21:13.350 --> 05:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
making a statement about this bill or
 
05:21:16.110 --> 05:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
endorsing it but simply observing having
 
05:21:18.510 --> 05:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
read both documents that there are
 
05:21:21.030 --> 05:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
similarities in terms of the objectives
 
05:21:22.510 --> 05:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
whether it is through the school funding
 
05:21:24.788 --> 05:21:24.798 align:start position:0%
commission or through this bill and I
 
05:21:26.750 --> 05:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
just was pointing out that overlap
 
05:21:28.830 --> 05:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
between those two items well I want to
 
05:21:30.868 --> 05:21:30.878 align:start position:0%
get to those objectives in a minute but
 
05:21:32.750 --> 05:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
but um but let let's start with where
 
05:21:34.750 --> 05:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire stands right now
 
05:21:36.390 --> 05:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
nationally in terms of student outcomes
 
05:21:38.750 --> 05:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
if we could yeah so I will I'm happy to
 
05:21:41.350 --> 05:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
weigh in on that so New Hampshire is one
 
05:21:43.310 --> 05:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
of the stronger
 
05:21:45.750 --> 05:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
performing education systems there are a
 
05:21:47.510 --> 05:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
number of different measures but we
 
05:21:50.350 --> 05:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
generally rank in three to five in terms
 
05:21:54.628 --> 05:21:54.638 align:start position:0%
of the the status of what we see but New
 
05:21:57.830 --> 05:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire also has what is a troubling
 
05:22:00.390 --> 05:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
development and a troubling Trend that
 
05:22:02.788 --> 05:22:02.798 align:start position:0%
is not just unique to New Hampshire but
 
05:22:05.670 --> 05:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
is unique across the country it has been
 
05:22:08.470 --> 05:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
observed in States across the country as
 
05:22:11.628 --> 05:22:11.638 align:start position:0%
well as in the BAGI and the nape
 
05:22:15.030 --> 05:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
assessment and what you find is that our
 
05:22:18.510 --> 05:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
high performing students are increasing
 
05:22:20.548 --> 05:22:20.558 align:start position:0%
in their educational attainment so that
 
05:22:23.628 --> 05:22:23.638 align:start position:0%
may be the top 10% or the top quartile
 
05:22:25.868 --> 05:22:25.878 align:start position:0%
and the students at the bottom quartile
 
05:22:28.590 --> 05:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
are F falling further behind so what we
 
05:22:31.470 --> 05:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
are doing is we're creating an education
 
05:22:35.310 --> 05:22:35.320 align:start position:0%
Gap and it is principally driven around
 
05:22:38.350 --> 05:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
those the students ability to perform
 
05:22:40.830 --> 05:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
and what we know from the research in
 
05:22:43.310 --> 05:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
particular is that economically
 
05:22:45.190 --> 05:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged students are falling
 
05:22:47.750 --> 05:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
further behind in New Hampshire but we
 
05:22:50.470 --> 05:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
also know from research that when we
 
05:22:52.590 --> 05:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
create alternative Pathways for
 
05:22:54.910 --> 05:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
education for those students they have
 
05:22:57.750 --> 05:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to close those
 
05:23:00.350 --> 05:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
educational attainment gaps and so when
 
05:23:03.708 --> 05:23:03.718 align:start position:0%
I look at this particular Bill what I
 
05:23:07.868 --> 05:23:07.878 align:start position:0%
see is an opportunity to create options
 
05:23:11.070 --> 05:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
for those students to find to seek out
 
05:23:13.270 --> 05:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
to find an educational environment in
 
05:23:15.628 --> 05:23:15.638 align:start position:0%
which they can Thrive and in which they
 
05:23:18.750 --> 05:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
can succeed and that will allow us and
 
05:23:22.070 --> 05:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
help us to close this disparity Gap that
 
05:23:23.948 --> 05:23:23.958 align:start position:0%
we see growing in New Hampshire and
 
05:23:26.350 --> 05:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
should be troubling for all of
 
05:23:29.750 --> 05:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
us so uh follow I've got there's a few
 
05:23:31.830 --> 05:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
that are all connected here Mr chair
 
05:23:34.030 --> 05:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
thanks so in that bottom quartile that
 
05:23:35.868 --> 05:23:35.878 align:start position:0%
you referenced Mr commissioner where
 
05:23:39.150 --> 05:23:39.160 align:start position:0%
would the largest um um group of those
 
05:23:41.390 --> 05:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
um students um be coming from I mean
 
05:23:44.070 --> 05:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
you've seen the student outcome data so
 
05:23:46.070 --> 05:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
right so when you say grouping I just
 
05:23:48.110 --> 05:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that I
 
05:23:50.868 --> 05:23:50.878 align:start position:0%
understand um so at the state we report
 
05:23:54.070 --> 05:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
what we call subgroup information um and
 
05:23:56.390 --> 05:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
is that the type of information no
 
05:23:58.990 --> 05:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
talking about school district in terms
 
05:24:01.030 --> 05:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
of school districts what the group is
 
05:24:03.470 --> 05:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
outcome right yeah so what you find is
 
05:24:06.548 --> 05:24:06.558 align:start position:0%
it's not a school district phenomena in
 
05:24:09.030 --> 05:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
fact what you will find is that there is
 
05:24:10.830 --> 05:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
very little
 
05:24:13.390 --> 05:24:13.400 align:start position:0%
correlation um relative to the school
 
05:24:15.788 --> 05:24:15.798 align:start position:0%
district so much as educational
 
05:24:19.948 --> 05:24:19.958 align:start position:0%
attainment is correlated to economic
 
05:24:22.830 --> 05:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
status principally in New Hampshire what
 
05:24:25.430 --> 05:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
we find is that our economically
 
05:24:30.548 --> 05:24:30.558 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged students perform less well
 
05:24:33.868 --> 05:24:33.878 align:start position:0%
if in our education system and that is
 
05:24:38.270 --> 05:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
true for a student that is in the in a
 
05:24:40.910 --> 05:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
wealthy District or a student in a not
 
05:24:43.868 --> 05:24:43.878 align:start position:0%
wealthy District the common factor the
 
05:24:47.910 --> 05:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
common theme is that students who come
 
05:24:51.230 --> 05:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
from economically disadvantaged
 
05:24:54.070 --> 05:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
circumstances have difficulty accessing
 
05:24:56.110 --> 05:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
the education system as we have
 
05:24:56.120 --> 05:24:58.070 align:start position:0%
the education system as we have
architected

05:24:58.070 --> 05:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
architected
 
05:25:00.990 --> 05:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
it thank you very much commissioner are
 
05:25:04.030 --> 05:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
I'm Mr chair no I I would like to see
 
05:25:06.750 --> 05:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
some other questions Mr chair the the
 
05:25:08.430 --> 05:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
the commissioner actually specifically
 
05:25:13.670 --> 05:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:15.990 --> 05:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
me because both of
 
05:25:19.788 --> 05:25:19.798 align:start position:0%
you good work you did in the and and you
 
05:25:22.230 --> 05:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
know and obviously where I'm where I'm
 
05:25:26.190 --> 05:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
going with this is um is the um
 
05:25:29.670 --> 05:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:29.680 --> 05:25:32.030 align:start position:0%
 
District

05:25:32.030 --> 05:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
District
 
05:25:34.868 --> 05:25:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:38.110 --> 05:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
there I'm here representative I I I
 
05:25:40.310 --> 05:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
don't hear repr
 
05:25:44.628 --> 05:25:44.638 align:start position:0%
luno yeah yeah so sorry my connection's
 
05:25:45.948 --> 05:25:45.958 align:start position:0%
cutting in and
 
05:25:45.958 --> 05:25:51.190 align:start position:0%
cutting in and
out

05:25:51.190 --> 05:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:55.350 --> 05:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:59.510 --> 05:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
so so my my question is is what is this
 
05:26:02.430 --> 05:26:02.440 align:start position:0%
program going to be doing for the 13,000
 
05:26:04.230 --> 05:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
students that attend the Manchester
 
05:26:06.110 --> 05:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
School District which is among the
 
05:26:08.628 --> 05:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
lowest performing student outcomes in
 
05:26:13.350 --> 05:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
the state and um highest um uh highest
 
05:26:15.948 --> 05:26:15.958 align:start position:0%
uh free and reduced price lunch
 
05:26:18.230 --> 05:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
eligibility in the state which is
 
05:26:21.590 --> 05:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
obviously a proxy for um for low um
 
05:26:24.310 --> 05:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
economic means and uh and some of the
 
05:26:29.190 --> 05:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
lowest um uh per student um um uh school
 
05:26:30.990 --> 05:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
funding in the state what what is this
 
05:26:34.030 --> 05:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
going to do for those 13,000 kids yes so
 
05:26:34.910 --> 05:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
05:26:36.590 --> 05:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
representative luno and I think even in
 
05:26:39.430 --> 05:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
your question you point out the issue so
 
05:26:41.788 --> 05:26:41.798 align:start position:0%
it is true that we have over 13,000
 
05:26:45.190 --> 05:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
students in Manchester some of whom are
 
05:26:47.270 --> 05:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
thriving and some of whom are performing
 
05:26:50.830 --> 05:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
very well and reaching really strong
 
05:26:53.110 --> 05:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
educational attainment through their
 
05:26:55.270 --> 05:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
efforts in that school system and
 
05:26:58.030 --> 05:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
they're receiving an excellent education
 
05:27:00.708 --> 05:27:00.718 align:start position:0%
but we also know that there are a number
 
05:27:02.830 --> 05:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
of economically disadvantaged students
 
05:27:05.070 --> 05:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
in that system and as you point out in
 
05:27:07.868 --> 05:27:07.878 align:start position:0%
your question M you've I think you if
 
05:27:09.470 --> 05:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
I'm articulating this correctly you
 
05:27:11.750 --> 05:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
described manchest Manchester as one of
 
05:27:14.788 --> 05:27:14.798 align:start position:0%
the lowest performing academically uh in
 
05:27:17.788 --> 05:27:17.798 align:start position:0%
the state and having the highest you
 
05:27:19.788 --> 05:27:19.798 align:start position:0%
know economically disadvantaged student
 
05:27:22.390 --> 05:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
ratio and so what I would tell you is
 
05:27:24.548 --> 05:27:24.558 align:start position:0%
that that is the factor it's not the
 
05:27:27.110 --> 05:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
geography of Manchester it is the
 
05:27:29.910 --> 05:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
economically disadvantaged factor that
 
05:27:31.788 --> 05:27:31.798 align:start position:0%
affects it but there if you take that
 
05:27:33.830 --> 05:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
same economically disadvantaged student
 
05:27:35.948 --> 05:27:35.958 align:start position:0%
and you place them in Bedford they too
 
05:27:37.628 --> 05:27:37.638 align:start position:0%
will struggle with the current
 
05:27:40.110 --> 05:27:40.120 align:start position:0%
educational system that we have and so
 
05:27:43.470 --> 05:27:43.480 align:start position:0%
what this program will do is where those
 
05:27:45.830 --> 05:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
students are not able to attain success
 
05:27:50.110 --> 05:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
in Manchester we are allowing them the
 
05:27:53.030 --> 05:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
option to be able to seek out an
 
05:27:55.548 --> 05:27:55.558 align:start position:0%
educational setting in which they can
 
05:27:58.948 --> 05:27:58.958 align:start position:0%
succeed and in which they can Thrive and
 
05:28:00.830 --> 05:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
that is really again going back back to
 
05:28:03.510 --> 05:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
my first statement about the common goal
 
05:28:05.150 --> 05:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
that we all share about Bright Futures
 
05:28:08.190 --> 05:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
for our students so that is really how
 
05:28:11.270 --> 05:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
this will help those students to be able
 
05:28:13.948 --> 05:28:13.958 align:start position:0%
to reach those
 
05:28:16.070 --> 05:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
attainments thank thank you very much
 
05:28:17.750 --> 05:28:17.760 align:start position:0%

05:28:53.150 --> 05:28:53.160 align:start position:0%

you Mr chairman thank you representative

for taking qu I have two questions that
 
05:29:03.230 --> 05:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
I think will be answered very quickly uh
 
05:29:05.510 --> 05:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
one relates to the separation of church
 
05:29:08.868 --> 05:29:08.878 align:start position:0%
and state uh will a constitutional
 
05:29:10.590 --> 05:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
amendment to the New Hampshire
 
05:29:13.030 --> 05:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution have to be in place in
 
05:29:15.948 --> 05:29:15.958 align:start position:0%
order for funds from an EFA to go to a
 
05:29:18.510 --> 05:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
religious school uh thank you for the
 
05:29:22.430 --> 05:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
question uh no is the answer uh in June
 
05:29:24.750 --> 05:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
there was a US Supreme Court case
 
05:29:27.150 --> 05:29:27.160 align:start position:0%
Espinosa versus Montana Department of
 
05:29:29.628 --> 05:29:29.638 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh which settled that question
 
05:29:30.868 --> 05:29:30.878 align:start position:0%
and basically
 
05:29:35.030 --> 05:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
invalidated uh State um no Aid or Blain
 
05:29:37.270 --> 05:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
amendments as they are called and you'll
 
05:29:39.510 --> 05:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
be having further testimony from an
 
05:29:42.070 --> 05:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
expert on that I do
 
05:29:44.430 --> 05:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
believe second question this is a
 
05:29:46.788 --> 05:29:46.798 align:start position:0%
hypothetical if a family's earning
 
05:29:49.510 --> 05:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
$300,000 a year they have a student at
 
05:29:52.230 --> 05:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
Philip Philips exitor Academy where the
 
05:29:55.070 --> 05:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
tuition is $58,000 a year are they
 
05:29:58.310 --> 05:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
eligible for the $5,000 Grant under this
 
05:30:01.310 --> 05:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
program um would be eligible the
 
05:30:02.670 --> 05:30:02.680 align:start position:0%
question is whether they're going to be
 
05:30:04.868 --> 05:30:04.878 align:start position:0%
bothered taking it I think in all the
 
05:30:07.910 --> 05:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
programs you've seen around the country
 
05:30:11.390 --> 05:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
um it is not U the wealthy families but
 
05:30:14.110 --> 05:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
the lower and middle inome families that
 
05:30:16.708 --> 05:30:16.718 align:start position:0%
are taking advantage of these programs
 
05:30:17.948 --> 05:30:17.958 align:start position:0%
because of their
 
05:30:22.190 --> 05:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
need followup Mr chairman yes so if they
 
05:30:24.470 --> 05:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
requested the money they would get
 
05:30:28.390 --> 05:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
it uh there would be nothing um to uh
 
05:30:30.788 --> 05:30:30.798 align:start position:0%
prevent that thank you
 
05:30:32.548 --> 05:30:32.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you very
 
05:30:35.590 --> 05:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
much Mr Ellis represent Ellison uh
 
05:30:39.070 --> 05:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
represent LE thank you Mr chairman and
 
05:30:40.670 --> 05:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative cordelli for
 
05:30:42.430 --> 05:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
taking the questions before I proceed I
 
05:30:44.868 --> 05:30:44.878 align:start position:0%
just want to State my Declaration of
 
05:30:47.708 --> 05:30:47.718 align:start position:0%
intent which is that I do intend to
 
05:30:50.830 --> 05:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
participate in the discussion on
 
05:30:55.270 --> 05:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
hb20 as based upon uh my compliance with
 
05:30:57.030 --> 05:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
the ethics committee's informal
 
05:31:01.788 --> 05:31:01.798 align:start position:0%
resolution of complaint 2019 d
 
05:31:04.868 --> 05:31:04.878 align:start position:0%
02 thank you um I have just the
 
05:31:06.510 --> 05:31:06.520 align:start position:0%
questions are very specific here and
 
05:31:08.708 --> 05:31:08.718 align:start position:0%
it's just a small two or three of them
 
05:31:12.510 --> 05:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
that's it um on lines 28 to 29 on page
 
05:31:16.190 --> 05:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
six um I think it states that the um
 
05:31:18.510 --> 05:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization can accept
 
05:31:22.948 --> 05:31:22.958 align:start position:0%
gifts and grants Etc and um I don't
 
05:31:24.628 --> 05:31:24.638 align:start position:0%
believe there's any restriction on that
 
05:31:26.070 --> 05:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
is is that
 
05:31:30.590 --> 05:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
correct correct okay thank you um and
 
05:31:33.230 --> 05:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
then on page eight lines six and seven
 
05:31:36.350 --> 05:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
it states that the scholarship
 
05:31:39.670 --> 05:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
organization um May approve Education
 
05:31:41.788 --> 05:31:41.798 align:start position:0%
Service Providers on its own initiative
 
05:31:43.830 --> 05:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
so does the scholarship organization
 
05:31:45.910 --> 05:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
then am I reading it correctly that they
 
05:31:48.708 --> 05:31:48.718 align:start position:0%
are the organization that approves of an
 
05:31:50.548 --> 05:31:50.558 align:start position:0%
education service
 
05:31:52.390 --> 05:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
provider uh
 
05:31:56.390 --> 05:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
yes uh but there are uh reviews on that
 
05:32:00.910 --> 05:32:00.920 align:start position:0%
and uh if there is any um uh misuse
 
05:32:03.270 --> 05:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
um funds for instance um they would be
 
05:32:04.830 --> 05:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
reported to the department and the
 
05:32:08.190 --> 05:32:08.200 align:start position:0%
Attorney General right but just to just
 
05:32:10.430 --> 05:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
to clarify um is there anybody else
 
05:32:12.548 --> 05:32:12.558 align:start position:0%
involved in the decision as to whether
 
05:32:15.270 --> 05:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
or not an education Service Pro provider
 
05:32:18.070 --> 05:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
is an eligible ESP under this program is
 
05:32:19.350 --> 05:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
it just simply in the hands of the
 
05:32:21.910 --> 05:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization uh within the
 
05:32:23.750 --> 05:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
constraints of the bill it is within
 
05:32:25.948 --> 05:32:25.958 align:start position:0%
their hands and then just one other
 
05:32:29.030 --> 05:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
question then so given that um they can
 
05:32:30.750 --> 05:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
accept gifts and grants grants including
 
05:32:33.670 --> 05:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
gifts and grants from potential esps who
 
05:32:35.910 --> 05:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
are in front of the organization
 
05:32:39.070 --> 05:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
applying um is there provision is there
 
05:32:42.548 --> 05:32:42.558 align:start position:0%
any provision for an independent audit
 
05:32:45.270 --> 05:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
of the scholarship organization not an
 
05:32:46.708 --> 05:32:46.718 align:start position:0%
audit done by the scholarship
 
05:32:49.750 --> 05:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
organization but an independent audit
 
05:32:51.868 --> 05:32:51.878 align:start position:0%
yes there is a independent audit
 
05:32:57.788 --> 05:32:57.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:05.990 --> 05:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:07.990 --> 05:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
so if you want to go on to the next
 
05:33:09.750 --> 05:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
question no that's actually it that's
 
05:33:11.548 --> 05:33:11.558 align:start position:0%
all I had that's all I had it was just
 
05:33:13.510 --> 05:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to know where that was that's
 
05:33:16.548 --> 05:33:16.558 align:start position:0%
all so perhaps uh representative
 
05:33:18.868 --> 05:33:18.878 align:start position:0%
cordellia can be finding that so we can
 
05:33:20.110 --> 05:33:20.120 align:start position:0%

photo great I can't can't see me but
 
05:35:32.990 --> 05:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
hello chairman and representatives thank
 
05:35:34.750 --> 05:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
you for giving me the opportunity to
 
05:35:37.510 --> 05:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
speak today my name is Jenny Clark I am
 
05:35:40.070 --> 05:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
the mother of five children four of whom
 
05:35:42.548 --> 05:35:42.558 align:start position:0%
currently utilize an Arizona empowerment
 
05:35:44.948 --> 05:35:44.958 align:start position:0%
scholarship account and have for three
 
05:35:47.830 --> 05:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
years this program has been in place in
 
05:35:51.788 --> 05:35:51.798 align:start position:0%
Arizona for 10 years I've been home
 
05:35:53.910 --> 05:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
educating my children for seven years
 
05:35:55.750 --> 05:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm absolutely thrilled at the
 
05:35:58.110 --> 05:35:58.120 align:start position:0%
chance to share with you just how this
 
05:36:00.070 --> 05:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
program has changed our children 's
 
05:36:03.230 --> 05:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
lives and why efas are the educational
 
05:36:05.510 --> 05:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity that families so desperately
 
05:36:08.070 --> 05:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
need a little over four years ago after
 
05:36:10.070 --> 05:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
realizing that our oldest son Scout was
 
05:36:12.150 --> 05:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
struggling more than typical children
 
05:36:14.310 --> 05:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
his age we got him evaluated in our
 
05:36:16.510 --> 05:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
local school district we had our Second
 
05:36:19.350 --> 05:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
Son Brooks evaluated at the same time
 
05:36:21.070 --> 05:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
now Brooks had already been in private
 
05:36:23.110 --> 05:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
speech and occupational therapy for
 
05:36:25.990 --> 05:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
years at our expense even though our
 
05:36:28.548 --> 05:36:28.558 align:start position:0%
insurance did not cover most of his
 
05:36:31.230 --> 05:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
therapy at after many meetings with the
 
05:36:32.750 --> 05:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
district and through independent
 
05:36:34.990 --> 05:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
evaluation our oldest two boys were
 
05:36:38.190 --> 05:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
actually diagnosed with severe dyslexia
 
05:36:40.670 --> 05:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
and disg graphia among other things now
 
05:36:42.548 --> 05:36:42.558 align:start position:0%
our district which is one of the best in
 
05:36:44.990 --> 05:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
the state told us that Unfortunately
 
05:36:47.390 --> 05:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
they did not offer the specific
 
05:36:49.628 --> 05:36:49.638 align:start position:0%
structured literacy dyslexia remediation
 
05:36:51.470 --> 05:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
programs that our children would need
 
05:36:53.628 --> 05:36:53.638 align:start position:0%
now these programs must be done several
 
05:36:55.430 --> 05:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
days a week and the curriculum is not
 
05:36:57.868 --> 05:36:57.878 align:start position:0%
that expensive for a school still there
 
05:37:00.070 --> 05:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
were no options you can probably guessed
 
05:37:01.628 --> 05:37:01.638 align:start position:0%
that there were no options for disg
 
05:37:04.270 --> 05:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
graphia remediation either how is a
 
05:37:06.390 --> 05:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
child supposed to learn when they cannot
 
05:37:09.750 --> 05:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
read or write but thankfully we learned
 
05:37:13.628 --> 05:37:13.638 align:start position:0%
about Esa similar to efas this program
 
05:37:15.990 --> 05:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
allows parents like me to direct the
 
05:37:17.430 --> 05:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
funding that is allocated for our
 
05:37:20.030 --> 05:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
child's education to the curriculums
 
05:37:22.548 --> 05:37:22.558 align:start position:0%
programs tutors and therapists that we
 
05:37:25.670 --> 05:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
as parents decide are best for our child
 
05:37:28.750 --> 05:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
the best way to describe this program is
 
05:37:32.070 --> 05:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
life changing our family was no longer
 
05:37:34.830 --> 05:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
limited by our finances or Insurance
 
05:37:37.270 --> 05:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
when it came to important educational in
 
05:37:38.990 --> 05:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
interventions that we couldn't
 
05:37:41.310 --> 05:37:41.320 align:start position:0%
effectively get in our local school we
 
05:37:43.670 --> 05:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
now had the resources to get new
 
05:37:45.830 --> 05:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
educational evaluations hired the best
 
05:37:48.390 --> 05:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
tutors purchased specific dyslexia
 
05:37:50.990 --> 05:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
curriculum Math Science Social Studies
 
05:37:54.390 --> 05:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
and more that worked for our kids we
 
05:37:56.110 --> 05:37:56.120 align:start position:0%
even had the flexibility to utilize
 
05:37:57.548 --> 05:37:57.558 align:start position:0%
online learning platforms like
 
05:37:59.070 --> 05:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
keyboarding without tears and other
 
05:38:00.470 --> 05:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
dyslexia your
 
05:38:03.350 --> 05:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
resources further families like ours and
 
05:38:06.030 --> 05:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
thousands of others were able to better
 
05:38:07.910 --> 05:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
weather the educational challenges that
 
05:38:10.310 --> 05:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
came as a result of covid we were able
 
05:38:13.270 --> 05:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
to effectively add new programs and new
 
05:38:15.548 --> 05:38:15.558 align:start position:0%
classes during covid when other schools
 
05:38:19.350 --> 05:38:19.360 align:start position:0%
were closed and zoom was the only option
 
05:38:21.590 --> 05:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
efas do not conflict with existing
 
05:38:23.270 --> 05:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
options like homeschooling they simply
 
05:38:26.390 --> 05:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
add a new option for the families that
 
05:38:28.470 --> 05:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
choose them based on the needs and
 
05:38:31.430 --> 05:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
desires of their family no one just like
 
05:38:33.868 --> 05:38:33.878 align:start position:0%
in Arizona is forced to apply or even
 
05:38:36.548 --> 05:38:36.558 align:start position:0%
accept one in a time when so many
 
05:38:38.590 --> 05:38:38.600 align:start position:0%
families and students are struggling
 
05:38:41.468 --> 05:38:41.478 align:start position:0%
everywhere let's give them more options
 
05:38:43.270 --> 05:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
so that all students have access to the
 
05:38:45.030 --> 05:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
educational environment in which they
 
05:38:47.910 --> 05:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
can Thrive without this scholarship I
 
05:38:50.150 --> 05:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
know my kids would still be struggling
 
05:38:52.628 --> 05:38:52.638 align:start position:0%
and thankfully that is not the case they
 
05:38:54.430 --> 05:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
love learning they love trying new
 
05:38:56.510 --> 05:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
things and they love the educational
 
05:38:58.990 --> 05:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities they have because of this
 
05:39:01.788 --> 05:39:01.798 align:start position:0%
scholarship ship they aren't limited by
 
05:39:05.030 --> 05:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
our income or their zip code it is with
 
05:39:07.110 --> 05:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
all the sincerity I can share as a mom
 
05:39:09.510 --> 05:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
that this program will change the lives
 
05:39:11.670 --> 05:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire kids in ways that may
 
05:39:14.390 --> 05:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
be hard to even imagine right now this
 
05:39:16.390 --> 05:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
could be such a historic vote for the
 
05:39:18.230 --> 05:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
lives of students and one that crosses
 
05:39:20.670 --> 05:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
party lines and social divides I've
 
05:39:22.510 --> 05:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
certainly seen that as a parent with the
 
05:39:24.788 --> 05:39:24.798 align:start position:0%
parents that are involved in our program
 
05:39:29.110 --> 05:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
because it puts our kids first thank you
 
05:39:31.190 --> 05:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
so so much for your time and if anyone
 
05:39:33.868 --> 05:39:33.878 align:start position:0%
has any questions about the esa program
 
05:39:35.510 --> 05:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
and how it's worked in Arizona more
 
05:39:38.990 --> 05:39:39.000 align:start position:0%

special education teacher in Manchester
 
05:41:02.510 --> 05:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if the bill passes the
 
05:41:04.350 --> 05:41:04.360 align:start position:0%
freedom education account program could
 
05:41:06.190 --> 05:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
open the door to so many beneficial
 
05:41:07.830 --> 05:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities to families and children
 
05:41:10.590 --> 05:41:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:13.230 --> 05:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
disability as a parent living with a
 
05:41:15.750 --> 05:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
child who has a disability things have
 
05:41:17.670 --> 05:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
not always been easy however given my
 
05:41:19.270 --> 05:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
profession as a special education
 
05:41:21.468 --> 05:41:21.478 align:start position:0%
teacher that made the process a little
 
05:41:23.468 --> 05:41:23.478 align:start position:0%
less stressful can you imagine the
 
05:41:25.830 --> 05:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
families that feel lost and have no clue
 
05:41:27.788 --> 05:41:27.798 align:start position:0%
where to begin let alone know the
 
05:41:29.708 --> 05:41:29.718 align:start position:0%
resources that are available able to
 
05:41:31.590 --> 05:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
them and their
 
05:41:35.830 --> 05:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
children EFA can help with additional
 
05:41:37.948 --> 05:41:37.958 align:start position:0%
Services supplies tutoring online
 
05:41:40.910 --> 05:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
resources Etc this is
 
05:41:43.948 --> 05:41:43.958 align:start position:0%
huge public versus private school I
 
05:41:46.030 --> 05:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
chose to send my child to a private
 
05:41:49.590 --> 05:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
school knowing he had a disability and
 
05:41:51.110 --> 05:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
it honestly has been one of the best
 
05:41:52.670 --> 05:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
decisions I have made my son is
 
05:41:54.830 --> 05:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
supported he receives services and is so
 
05:41:57.628 --> 05:41:57.638 align:start position:0%
happy to go to school each and every day
 
05:41:59.708 --> 05:41:59.718 align:start position:0%
my son also attends private spee therapy
 
05:42:02.190 --> 05:42:02.200 align:start position:0%
session sessions once a week and has for
 
05:42:03.990 --> 05:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
four and a half
 
05:42:06.948 --> 05:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
years our insurance only allots certain
 
05:42:09.150 --> 05:42:09.160 align:start position:0%
amount of sessions per year in the rest
 
05:42:11.310 --> 05:42:11.320 align:start position:0%
of those sessions we are responsible for
 
05:42:13.990 --> 05:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
paying out of pocket with this EFA
 
05:42:16.510 --> 05:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
account we could be using these funds to
 
05:42:18.910 --> 05:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
pay for extra speech and uh Speech
 
05:42:21.150 --> 05:42:21.160 align:start position:0%
Therapy Services which would be
 
05:42:23.468 --> 05:42:23.478 align:start position:0%
huge and I'll let you know that some of
 
05:42:26.070 --> 05:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
those session well every session is $100
 
05:42:29.390 --> 05:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
out of pocket so this would be huge um
 
05:42:31.150 --> 05:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
and speaking just for my family but
 
05:42:34.150 --> 05:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
there are several families that have to
 
05:42:36.750 --> 05:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
pay for speech and OT or several
 
05:42:38.948 --> 05:42:38.958 align:start position:0%
Services um depending on the certain
 
05:42:42.310 --> 05:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
disability of their children or CH child
 
05:42:45.788 --> 05:42:45.798 align:start position:0%
um so with that being said I really hope
 
05:42:49.070 --> 05:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
that everyone listens to the testimonies
 
05:42:51.150 --> 05:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
of each and every person speaking
 
05:42:53.510 --> 05:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
because truly it comes from parents that
 
05:42:55.590 --> 05:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
are living in this and not just people
 
05:42:58.150 --> 05:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
that don't know the full story so I want
 
05:42:59.868 --> 05:42:59.878 align:start position:0%
those people to take into consideration
 
05:43:01.510 --> 05:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
that if you do not have a special ed
 
05:43:03.390 --> 05:43:03.400 align:start position:0%
child to think about all the certain
 
05:43:05.430 --> 05:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
things that we are speaking on um
 
05:43:07.750 --> 05:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
services and additional supports because
 
05:43:10.110 --> 05:43:10.120 align:start position:0%
it can be extremely difficult if there's
 
05:43:12.708 --> 05:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
nothing um and let alone just living in
 
05:43:16.270 --> 05:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
the pandemic has been
 
05:43:19.030 --> 05:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
hard thank you very much Elizabeth um
 
05:43:22.110 --> 05:43:22.120 align:start position:0%

05:43:26.110 --> 05:43:26.120 align:start position:0%

participant room asking about whether or
 
05:43:42.390 --> 05:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
not um there's a specific order of
 
05:43:45.548 --> 05:43:45.558 align:start position:0%
selection or where they are on the on
 
05:43:45.558 --> 05:43:46.510 align:start position:0%
selection or where they are on the on

list uh representa Hopson if we have
 
05:43:51.788 --> 05:43:51.798 align:start position:0%
Representatives on that list we should
 
05:43:53.628 --> 05:43:53.638 align:start position:0%
really try to address the
 
05:43:56.350 --> 05:43:56.360 align:start position:0%
representatives first in case they have
 
05:43:58.708 --> 05:43:58.718 align:start position:0%

chairman and members of the education
 
05:46:32.788 --> 05:46:32.798 align:start position:0%
committee I'm representative cat McGee
 
05:46:36.468 --> 05:46:36.478 align:start position:0%
from Hillsboro 27 uh Hollis and I come
 
05:46:38.628 --> 05:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
to you today to testify against the
 
05:46:40.708 --> 05:46:40.718 align:start position:0%
establishment of the dick hinch Freedom
 
05:46:44.150 --> 05:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
education account program as outlined in
 
05:46:47.030 --> 05:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
hb20 in my town and in the three others
 
05:46:49.788 --> 05:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
I have had the honor to serve taxpayer
 
05:46:52.230 --> 05:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
money is a very precious commodity at
 
05:46:54.990 --> 05:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
school meetings um we see Property
 
05:46:57.310 --> 05:46:57.320 align:start position:0%
Owners being pitted against their local
 
05:46:59.390 --> 05:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
schools in a competition for those ever
 
05:47:03.430 --> 05:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
Rising property tax dollars and I am I
 
05:47:05.270 --> 05:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
am concerned that this bill will raise
 
05:47:07.708 --> 05:47:07.718 align:start position:0%
those taxes by siphoning more money away
 
05:47:10.788 --> 05:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
from struggling Community Schools so I
 
05:47:13.990 --> 05:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
see this as a lose lose proposition I am
 
05:47:16.230 --> 05:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
very aware of the issues that have been
 
05:47:19.190 --> 05:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
brought up so far in terms of uh parents
 
05:47:22.030 --> 05:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
having choice and having other
 
05:47:23.830 --> 05:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities in terms of Education
 
05:47:26.390 --> 05:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
Innovation I just look at this bill and
 
05:47:27.868 --> 05:47:27.878 align:start position:0%
the way that it's been written and the
 
05:47:30.990 --> 05:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
way that it appears to be uh implemented
 
05:47:33.430 --> 05:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
as being uh not the right solution
 
05:47:35.230 --> 05:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
certainly at this
 
05:47:38.310 --> 05:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
time uh hb20 says that property taxes
 
05:47:41.070 --> 05:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
will not only be used for public school
 
05:47:42.830 --> 05:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
but that those scarce dollars will now
 
05:47:45.150 --> 05:47:45.160 align:start position:0%
follow the student out of the building
 
05:47:47.270 --> 05:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
and this bill lets our tax dollars be
 
05:47:49.910 --> 05:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
used for previously uncovered forms of
 
05:47:52.590 --> 05:47:52.600 align:start position:0%
Education when we are we just finished a
 
05:47:54.670 --> 05:47:54.680 align:start position:0%
report that said that adequacy funding
 
05:47:57.468 --> 05:47:57.478 align:start position:0%
for public education was inadequate so
 
05:47:58.910 --> 05:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
my question is where does that money
 
05:47:58.920 --> 05:47:59.868 align:start position:0%
my question is where does that money
come

05:47:59.868 --> 05:47:59.878 align:start position:0%
come
 
05:48:02.868 --> 05:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
from we always had school choice but we
 
05:48:04.670 --> 05:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
never pretended that our tax dollars
 
05:48:07.150 --> 05:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
could support both public and non-public
 
05:48:09.548 --> 05:48:09.558 align:start position:0%
education at the same time that was
 
05:48:11.830 --> 05:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
never the deal and I don't think we have
 
05:48:14.750 --> 05:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
any more money than we did before so
 
05:48:16.190 --> 05:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
this bill changes the deal in a
 
05:48:18.468 --> 05:48:18.478 align:start position:0%
dangerous way because our local schools
 
05:48:20.948 --> 05:48:20.958 align:start position:0%
do have fixed costs and if our public
 
05:48:22.910 --> 05:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
schools close because our taxes are
 
05:48:24.830 --> 05:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
being scattered to the Four Winds then
 
05:48:27.868 --> 05:48:27.878 align:start position:0%
school choice becomes less not more the
 
05:48:29.990 --> 05:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
bill removes moves accountability from
 
05:48:31.628 --> 05:48:31.638 align:start position:0%
the use of taxpayer dollars by
 
05:48:33.990 --> 05:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
increasing inequality in special ed
 
05:48:36.150 --> 05:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
Transportation required subjects for an
 
05:48:38.548 --> 05:48:38.558 align:start position:0%
adequate education and even grade level
 
05:48:38.558 --> 05:48:39.670 align:start position:0%
adequate education and even grade level
achievement

05:48:39.670 --> 05:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
achievement
 
05:48:41.948 --> 05:48:41.958 align:start position:0%
standards this bill raises property
 
05:48:44.230 --> 05:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
taxes while lowering support for public
 
05:48:46.788 --> 05:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
schools and creates a hodgepodge of
 
05:48:48.510 --> 05:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
accountability and tracking so that New
 
05:48:50.830 --> 05:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will lose its reputation and
 
05:48:52.468 --> 05:48:52.478 align:start position:0%
possibly even Federal
 
05:48:54.910 --> 05:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
funding this race to the bottom means we
 
05:48:57.670 --> 05:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
will also lose our best people over time
 
05:48:59.708 --> 05:48:59.718 align:start position:0%
because lack of support for public
 
05:49:02.070 --> 05:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
schools has a domino effect and when
 
05:49:04.868 --> 05:49:04.878 align:start position:0%
schools close property values plummet so
 
05:49:06.468 --> 05:49:06.478 align:start position:0%
this bill has implications for our
 
05:49:10.030 --> 05:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
economy as well uh it asks us to pay for
 
05:49:12.230 --> 05:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
destabilizing a system that we paid to
 
05:49:15.750 --> 05:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
build without a plan for what comes next
 
05:49:17.548 --> 05:49:17.558 align:start position:0%
U we need local control of our schools
 
05:49:19.830 --> 05:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
and this bill really does the opposite
 
05:49:23.468 --> 05:49:23.478 align:start position:0%
we uh have no auditing mechanisms to say
 
05:49:25.830 --> 05:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
how well or how poorly those T those
 
05:49:27.510 --> 05:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
precious tax dollars are going to be
 
05:49:31.030 --> 05:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
spent to educate our children so it
 
05:49:33.350 --> 05:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
appears to be a a giveaway of taxpayer
 
05:49:36.310 --> 05:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
dollars to private companies that will
 
05:49:38.830 --> 05:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
then have an intersection here in our
 
05:49:43.070 --> 05:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
public education system without um
 
05:49:45.628 --> 05:49:45.638 align:start position:0%
measures for the outcome or assurances
 
05:49:48.670 --> 05:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
of benefits so I ask you to vote no on
 
05:49:51.230 --> 05:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
hb20 our schools our communities and our
 
05:49:53.590 --> 05:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers deserve better thank

05:50:19.190 --> 05:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
um I ask that anybody that's listening
 
05:50:23.310 --> 05:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
to us out there that um uh that if you
 
05:50:25.430 --> 05:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
have questions about the bill uh you can
 
05:50:27.468 --> 05:50:27.478 align:start position:0%
say whether you support or against it if
 
05:50:29.548 --> 05:50:29.558 align:start position:0%
you have specific questions dealing with
 
05:50:31.390 --> 05:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
a page and a line number as we've heard
 
05:50:32.910 --> 05:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
some of the Reps on the committee
 
05:50:36.190 --> 05:50:36.200 align:start position:0%
address line and uh page number that
 
05:50:40.190 --> 05:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
will greatly help us understand um where
 
05:50:43.270 --> 05:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
where we're going with this um rather
 
05:50:45.150 --> 05:50:45.160 align:start position:0%
than you know saying well I'm just
 
05:50:46.868 --> 05:50:46.878 align:start position:0%
oppositional and it's your your position
 
05:50:49.270 --> 05:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
to say that but it'd be great to have a
 
05:50:50.628 --> 05:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
little bit more in
 
05:50:53.030 --> 05:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
specifics okay represent can we make
 
05:50:55.468 --> 05:50:55.478 align:start position:0%
sure that the presenters State their
 
05:50:57.990 --> 05:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
name who they represent and and where
 
05:51:00.990 --> 05:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
they're um that's that's fine the record
 
05:51:03.830 --> 05:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you y okay uh representative
 
05:51:07.030 --> 05:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
bville um were you intending to speak or
 
05:51:15.390 --> 05:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:19.150 --> 05:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
in okay we will move on and Hobson we
 
05:51:22.150 --> 05:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
were given a list this morning which
 
05:51:24.708 --> 05:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
showed those that want to speak do we
 
05:51:27.030 --> 05:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
have from that list now let's just go
 
05:51:28.830 --> 05:51:28.840 align:start position:0%
back to that list because that list
 
05:51:32.070 --> 05:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
shows a whole slug of people that want
 
05:51:34.868 --> 05:51:34.878 align:start position:0%
to testify yeah and those are not
 
05:51:37.628 --> 05:51:37.638 align:start position:0%
Representatives I have I have um several
 
05:51:40.628 --> 05:51:40.638 align:start position:0%
lists and the lists are not
 
05:51:43.468 --> 05:51:43.478 align:start position:0%
alphabetical um so that leaves me at a
 
05:51:46.270 --> 05:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
disadvantage so what we we need to do is
 
05:51:48.190 --> 05:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
just start whittling down through it
 
05:51:49.830 --> 05:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
those that support those that don't
 
05:51:51.830 --> 05:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
support and sort of bang it back and
 
05:51:55.430 --> 05:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
forth um and integrate uh
 
05:51:58.430 --> 05:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
any that have technical understandings
 
05:52:00.830 --> 05:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
bill in there and that's how we'll do it
 
05:52:02.190 --> 05:52:02.200 align:start position:0%
okay well I'm going to need everyone
 
05:52:04.948 --> 05:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
who's got their hand raised right now to
 
05:52:07.390 --> 05:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
take their hand and uh lower it so that
 
05:52:09.070 --> 05:52:09.080 align:start position:0%
I can go by the list and only the
 
05:52:13.390 --> 05:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
speaker that I call is able to speak
 
05:52:15.750 --> 05:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
before we go forward uh one one other
 
05:52:19.910 --> 05:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
point I'd like to make uh uh chairman uh
 
05:52:23.070 --> 05:52:23.080 align:start position:0%
lad we did have an individual from
 
05:52:26.830 --> 05:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
Arizona speak uh in favor based upon her
 
05:52:30.468 --> 05:52:30.478 align:start position:0%
experience there are also is a person in
 
05:52:35.708 --> 05:52:35.718 align:start position:0%
our attendee list a Charles Syer s i l r
 
05:52:38.910 --> 05:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
who also is from Arizona who I believe
 
05:52:42.030 --> 05:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
can give a contrary perspective to the
 
05:52:44.868 --> 05:52:44.878 align:start position:0%
Arizona experience so I would hope that
 
05:52:47.590 --> 05:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
at some point in time Mr chairman you
 
05:52:50.830 --> 05:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
would call on Mr Syler so he can also
 
05:52:53.468 --> 05:52:53.478 align:start position:0%
provide a contrary look to the Arizona
 
05:52:55.948 --> 05:52:55.958 align:start position:0%
experience thank you thank you I think
 
05:52:57.948 --> 05:52:57.958 align:start position:0%
that's fair we'll look down through that
 
05:53:00.548 --> 05:53:00.558 align:start position:0%
list and and find that individual he
 
05:53:03.070 --> 05:53:03.080 align:start position:0%
will have to raise his hand yeah and
 
05:53:05.548 --> 05:53:05.558 align:start position:0%
then he'll shoot right to the top the
 
05:53:10.070 --> 05:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
list is really hug here he is I think uh
 
05:53:16.070 --> 05:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:18.708 --> 05:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
all okay you should be you should be all
 
05:53:21.708 --> 05:53:21.718 align:start position:0%
set you have to unmute yourself
 
05:53:24.990 --> 05:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
fantastic thank you so much all right
 
05:53:26.708 --> 05:53:26.718 align:start position:0%
looks like everybody can hear me so with
 
05:53:28.110 --> 05:53:28.120 align:start position:0%
that Mr chairman members of the Comm
 
05:53:30.190 --> 05:53:30.200 align:start position:0%
committee I appreciate you all having me
 
05:53:32.230 --> 05:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
my name is Charles Syer and I actually
 
05:53:35.390 --> 05:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
come to you from Arizona but uh as a
 
05:53:38.628 --> 05:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
former proa voucher lobbyist I actually
 
05:53:41.510 --> 05:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
helped defend uh the esas in Florida I
 
05:53:44.270 --> 05:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
helped pitch some of the esas in
 
05:53:46.910 --> 05:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
Tennessee Nevada uh expansions that
 
05:53:48.430 --> 05:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
we've had in Arizona I've worked with
 
05:53:50.868 --> 05:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
folks in Mississippi I used to work at
 
05:53:53.910 --> 05:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
the Goldwater Institute uh where esas as
 
05:53:56.350 --> 05:53:56.360 align:start position:0%
a concept were developed uh which would
 
05:53:59.628 --> 05:53:59.638 align:start position:0%
also be kind of like a Josiah Bartlett
 
05:54:02.548 --> 05:54:02.558 align:start position:0%
kind of equivalent um but I left there
 
05:54:04.830 --> 05:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
because I saw that the real impact that
 
05:54:06.510 --> 05:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
these vouchers and other programs are
 
05:54:08.548 --> 05:54:08.558 align:start position:0%
having to the communities that I lived
 
05:54:11.628 --> 05:54:11.638 align:start position:0%
in and uh since then I've committed to
 
05:54:13.750 --> 05:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
working to make policy makers aware of
 
05:54:16.390 --> 05:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
the pitfalls of these Concepts and so
 
05:54:18.390 --> 05:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
for all of you this presently is a
 
05:54:20.948 --> 05:54:20.958 align:start position:0%
conceptual like idea and I assume
 
05:54:23.030 --> 05:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
everybody has the best intentions so
 
05:54:24.670 --> 05:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
I've seen the reality and I'm pretty
 
05:54:26.110 --> 05:54:26.120 align:start position:0%
well positioned to give you guys some
 
05:54:28.788 --> 05:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
practical Insight so the Arizona
 
05:54:30.830 --> 05:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
legislature passed the universal voucher
 
05:54:33.430 --> 05:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
program so after having small
 
05:54:35.670 --> 05:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
incremental uh expansions of it we
 
05:54:37.590 --> 05:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
eventually went to a universal one that
 
05:54:39.830 --> 05:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
had more oversight transparency and
 
05:54:42.628 --> 05:54:42.638 align:start position:0%
controls than hb20 does and this was
 
05:54:43.510 --> 05:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
back in
 
05:54:46.430 --> 05:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
2017 that Universal voucher Bill led to
 
05:54:49.070 --> 05:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
a massive public Uprising that forced
 
05:54:50.548 --> 05:54:50.558 align:start position:0%
the bill to be placed on a ballot in
 
05:54:52.310 --> 05:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
Arizona where it was rejected by voters
 
05:54:54.670 --> 05:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
by more than a 2 to1 margin and in its
 
05:54:56.868 --> 05:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
wake it created a pro-public education
 
05:54:58.430 --> 05:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
ground swell that led to the state
 
05:55:00.750 --> 05:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
shifting blue and its federal Offices
 
05:55:02.270 --> 05:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
and it diminished our Republican
 
05:55:04.788 --> 05:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
majority in the legislature and has led
 
05:55:06.708 --> 05:55:06.718 align:start position:0%
to Citizens further passing tax
 
05:55:09.230 --> 05:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
increases directed uh towards Public
 
05:55:11.468 --> 05:55:11.478 align:start position:0%
Schools as well as just being mobilized
 
05:55:13.110 --> 05:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
generally in the political process so
 
05:55:15.590 --> 05:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
all of that is in uh some ways great for
 
05:55:18.230 --> 05:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
the political engagement but um but has
 
05:55:20.910 --> 05:55:20.920 align:start position:0%
definitely shifted uh the balance in
 
05:55:24.030 --> 05:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
Arizona uh I've also seen statements
 
05:55:26.150 --> 05:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
about like whether or not this will cost
 
05:55:29.310 --> 05:55:29.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayers more or less um there's uh
 
05:55:31.030 --> 05:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
there's different things to consider so
 
05:55:33.150 --> 05:55:33.160 align:start position:0%
for your State uh the state of New
 
05:55:35.548 --> 05:55:35.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire pays about what $3,600 I
 
05:55:37.830 --> 05:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
believe per student and a vast majority
 
05:55:39.670 --> 05:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
of those funds uh for the students are
 
05:55:42.110 --> 05:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
made up then by property taxes but for
 
05:55:43.590 --> 05:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
the state it will definitely cost the
 
05:55:44.910 --> 05:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
state budget extra because you're going
 
05:55:46.830 --> 05:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
to be paying for current private school
 
05:55:48.910 --> 05:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
and homeschool students uh the program
 
05:55:51.948 --> 05:55:51.958 align:start position:0%
is open to all of them also uh it will
 
05:55:53.910 --> 05:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
cost new hampster taxpayers for each
 
05:55:56.468 --> 05:55:56.478 align:start position:0%
voucher student as uh none of those
 
05:55:57.910 --> 05:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
students will be eligible for any
 
05:55:59.750 --> 05:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
Federal funding talking about your title
 
05:56:03.548 --> 05:56:03.558 align:start position:0%
one any uh uh pre and reduced uh school
 
05:56:05.948 --> 05:56:05.958 align:start position:0%
lunch monies any other Federal funding
 
05:56:07.590 --> 05:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
so what that means is that New Hampshire
 
05:56:09.150 --> 05:56:09.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are going to continue paying
 
05:56:11.628 --> 05:56:11.638 align:start position:0%
those taxes to DC but those tax dollars
 
05:56:13.350 --> 05:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
won't be coming back to invest in New
 
05:56:15.350 --> 05:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's infrastructure so that's
 
05:56:17.190 --> 05:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
going to disproportionately impact Rural
 
05:56:19.830 --> 05:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
and property poor communities also we've
 
05:56:21.990 --> 05:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
recently seen a push in other states to
 
05:56:24.468 --> 05:56:24.478 align:start position:0%
start levying property taxes to help
 
05:56:27.270 --> 05:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
fund and boost uh Esa voucher expenses
 
05:56:29.430 --> 05:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
so you you might see that um on the
 
05:56:32.270 --> 05:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
horizon for your EFA but what really is
 
05:56:35.230 --> 05:56:35.240 align:start position:0%
scary about your bill hb20 it's the most
 
05:56:36.548 --> 05:56:36.558 align:start position:0%
extreme bill that I've seen in the
 
05:56:38.030 --> 05:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
entire country when it comes to these
 
05:56:40.510 --> 05:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
vouchers is that the allowable expenses
 
05:56:42.910 --> 05:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
in hb20 are so broad someone could
 
05:56:45.190 --> 05:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
legally pay for Netflix and Disney plus
 
05:56:47.628 --> 05:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
is uh technological services or
 
05:56:50.070 --> 05:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
educational software and applications to
 
05:56:51.830 --> 05:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
meet educational needs they could also
 
05:56:55.270 --> 05:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
buy big screen TVs iPads um Arizona's
 
05:56:57.310 --> 05:56:57.320 align:start position:0%
auditor general we've uncovered hundreds
 
05:56:58.990 --> 05:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
of thousands of dollars of fraud in our
 
05:57:01.948 --> 05:57:01.958 align:start position:0%
ESA program which serves just 1% of our
 
05:57:03.868 --> 05:57:03.878 align:start position:0%
students and those audits have only
 
05:57:05.830 --> 05:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
examined a small portion of the accounts
 
05:57:07.750 --> 05:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
they found like jet skis TVs which
 
05:57:09.548 --> 05:57:09.558 align:start position:0%
aren't allowed here iPads which would
 
05:57:11.270 --> 05:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
aren't allowed here uh they've even
 
05:57:13.230 --> 05:57:13.240 align:start position:0%
found someone paid for an abortion with
 
05:57:15.070 --> 05:57:15.080 align:start position:0%
those funds and regardless of your
 
05:57:16.788 --> 05:57:16.798 align:start position:0%
stance on abortion I think that all of
 
05:57:17.990 --> 05:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
us can agree that we don't want our
 
05:57:19.948 --> 05:57:19.958 align:start position:0%
Public School tax dollars paying for
 
05:57:22.390 --> 05:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
that um but also since there's no
 
05:57:24.708 --> 05:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
restriction on out ofate private schools
 
05:57:27.510 --> 05:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
or services in hb20 you could have New
 
05:57:29.788 --> 05:57:29.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers paying to fund
 
05:57:32.070 --> 05:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
private schools or tutors in Switzerland
 
05:57:33.948 --> 05:57:33.958 align:start position:0%
or Orlando Florida and with the
 
05:57:35.990 --> 05:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
allowable Transportation expenses
 
05:57:37.788 --> 05:57:37.798 align:start position:0%
parents could then play to fly their
 
05:57:40.070 --> 05:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
kids down to Orlando maybe they take a
 
05:57:42.788 --> 05:57:42.798 align:start position:0%
trip to Disney World um and use their
 
05:57:45.190 --> 05:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
EFA to pay for it meet a tutor down
 
05:57:47.070 --> 05:57:47.080 align:start position:0%
there and then spend the rest of the
 
05:57:49.628 --> 05:57:49.638 align:start position:0%
time um going on rides and eating lots
 
05:57:52.868 --> 05:57:52.878 align:start position:0%
of food um so these things happen all
 
05:57:54.868 --> 05:57:54.878 align:start position:0%
the time we see that even if they spend
 
05:57:56.750 --> 05:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
the money unwisely unfortunately that
 
05:57:58.468 --> 05:57:58.478 align:start position:0%
comes to an expense of the child's
 
05:58:00.750 --> 05:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
learning the state won't know about it
 
05:58:02.350 --> 05:58:02.360 align:start position:0%
because there's no metric for measuring
 
05:58:05.750 --> 05:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
students academic process in hb20 so if
 
05:58:07.430 --> 05:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
you want parents to be the last stop of
 
05:58:09.190 --> 05:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
accountability really generally most
 
05:58:10.468 --> 05:58:10.478 align:start position:0%
people would expect that they would pay
 
05:58:12.788 --> 05:58:12.798 align:start position:0%
for it if the public is expected to pay
 
05:58:14.590 --> 05:58:14.600 align:start position:0%
then you would expect that the public
 
05:58:17.830 --> 05:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
would hold the program accountable um so
 
05:58:19.390 --> 05:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
really one of the other problems for
 
05:58:21.910 --> 05:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
students besides the disincentive for
 
05:58:23.670 --> 05:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes for parents to abuse this
 
05:58:25.910 --> 05:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
program is that um students might be
 
05:58:28.070 --> 05:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
able to take their backpack full of cash
 
05:58:30.310 --> 05:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
but then what do they leave behind when
 
05:58:31.948 --> 05:58:31.958 align:start position:0%
they do that parents are going to wave
 
05:58:33.830 --> 05:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
their idea rights so that's Federal
 
05:58:34.868 --> 05:58:34.878 align:start position:0%
protections for students with
 
05:58:36.670 --> 05:58:36.680 align:start position:0%
disabilities and because private
 
05:58:38.468 --> 05:58:38.478 align:start position:0%
institutions aren't interested in
 
05:58:40.590 --> 05:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
educating costly students which is the
 
05:58:42.868 --> 05:58:42.878 align:start position:0%
main reason voucher programs exacerbate
 
05:58:44.948 --> 05:58:44.958 align:start position:0%
discrimination gender race and other
 
05:58:47.468 --> 05:58:47.478 align:start position:0%
reasons um where are those protections I
 
05:58:50.070 --> 05:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
don't see any of that in the bill in
 
05:58:51.670 --> 05:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
Arizona we do have some excellent
 
05:58:53.750 --> 05:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
private schools and some that even serve
 
05:58:55.270 --> 05:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
um disabled students we have a great
 
05:58:57.390 --> 05:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
autism school here but I also personally
 
05:58:59.548 --> 05:58:59.558 align:start position:0%
know multiple special needs families and
 
05:59:01.270 --> 05:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
students have been denied access to
 
05:59:03.150 --> 05:59:03.160 align:start position:0%
private schools and some have even been
 
05:59:05.590 --> 05:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
kicked out and really uh what we see
 
05:59:07.190 --> 05:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
these vouchers aren't so much school
 
05:59:08.948 --> 05:59:08.958 align:start position:0%
choice programs as much as they are
 
05:59:11.430 --> 05:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
school's choice so again this is the
 
05:59:13.708 --> 05:59:13.718 align:start position:0%
most extreme version I've seen of any
 
05:59:15.910 --> 05:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
kind of Bill like this in the country
 
05:59:17.830 --> 05:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
and it really will stain the legacy of
 
05:59:19.390 --> 05:59:19.400 align:start position:0%
anyone who helps pass this bill
 
05:59:20.990 --> 05:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
especially when the light starts to
 
05:59:23.390 --> 05:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
shine on the fraud misspending
 
05:59:24.948 --> 05:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
discrimination and other failures of
 
05:59:26.910 --> 05:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
this program and so with that I'd be
 
05:59:28.910 --> 05:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions from you Mr
 
05:59:30.990 --> 05:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
chair or the rest of the
 
05:59:33.430 --> 05:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
committee uh thank you the chair has
 
05:59:35.990 --> 05:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
stepped away for a moment so uh I'll ask
 
05:59:38.190 --> 05:59:38.200 align:start position:0%
if there are any questions from uh the
 
05:59:42.030 --> 05:59:42.040 align:start position:0%
committee members representative leay uh
 
05:59:44.430 --> 05:59:44.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you uh for
 
05:59:48.110 --> 05:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you stated that
 
05:59:50.150 --> 05:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
there have been audits now done on some
 
05:59:52.150 --> 05:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
of these uh expenditures according to
 
05:59:55.150 --> 05:59:55.160 align:start position:0%
the bill here um in front of us it
 
05:59:56.830 --> 05:59:56.840 align:start position:0%
states the scholarship organization
 
05:59:58.468 --> 05:59:58.478 align:start position:0%
shall have authority to conduct or
 
06:00:00.830 --> 06:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
contract for the auditing of individual
 
06:00:03.750 --> 06:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
efas shall at a minimum conduct random
 
06:00:07.788 --> 06:00:07.798 align:start position:0%
independent of efas um so there's no
 
06:00:11.150 --> 06:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
obviously clear uh requirement of audits
 
06:00:13.270 --> 06:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
just that they might happen and can
 
06:00:15.510 --> 06:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
happen um what was the situation in
 
06:00:17.548 --> 06:00:17.558 align:start position:0%
Arizona were there audits from the start
 
06:00:20.510 --> 06:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
of these uh uh of the vouchers or
 
06:00:22.868 --> 06:00:22.878 align:start position:0%
esas not when were they implemented and
 
06:00:25.708 --> 06:00:25.718 align:start position:0%
what did they find yes Mr chair and
 
06:00:27.750 --> 06:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um excellent
 
06:00:30.190 --> 06:00:30.200 align:start position:0%
question um so we do have auditing from
 
06:00:32.070 --> 06:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
an auditor general and there is some
 
06:00:33.910 --> 06:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
oversight of the program from our
 
06:00:35.948 --> 06:00:35.958 align:start position:0%
department of education and it's
 
06:00:39.548 --> 06:00:39.558 align:start position:0%
actually um not a very robust auditing
 
06:00:41.628 --> 06:00:41.638 align:start position:0%
program and it's actually been um
 
06:00:43.708 --> 06:00:43.718 align:start position:0%
underfunded by our legislature
 
06:00:45.910 --> 06:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
intentionally uh the these programs I
 
06:00:47.708 --> 06:00:47.718 align:start position:0%
know from having worked on the inside
 
06:00:50.830 --> 06:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
are intentionally designed to be um uh
 
06:00:54.628 --> 06:00:54.638 align:start position:0%
opaque and not have a lot of scrutiny
 
06:00:57.788 --> 06:00:57.798 align:start position:0%
some of it is this a spirit of not in
 
06:00:59.830 --> 06:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
government fingers in private
 
06:01:02.628 --> 06:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
institutions like trying to um impose
 
06:01:04.310 --> 06:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
government regulations on private
 
06:01:06.510 --> 06:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
institutions um but unfortunately when
 
06:01:07.948 --> 06:01:07.958 align:start position:0%
you're spending public dollars you
 
06:01:09.310 --> 06:01:09.320 align:start position:0%
really want to know what it's been used
 
06:01:11.910 --> 06:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
for um so one of the scariest parts of
 
06:01:13.830 --> 06:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is an absolute lack of
 
06:01:15.670 --> 06:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
accountability and a huge conflict of
 
06:01:18.310 --> 06:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
interest in the small accountability
 
06:01:21.948 --> 06:01:21.958 align:start position:0%
measure that you do have so um one is
 
06:01:25.070 --> 06:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
that uh you have a required audit um and
 
06:01:27.670 --> 06:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be annual in hb20 and
 
06:01:28.948 --> 06:01:28.958 align:start position:0%
it's performed by the private
 
06:01:31.670 --> 06:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization but it doesn't
 
06:01:33.390 --> 06:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
uh specify what percentage of accounts
 
06:01:35.310 --> 06:01:35.320 align:start position:0%
or anything to be randomly audited so
 
06:01:37.030 --> 06:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
they could legitimately pick one or two
 
06:01:39.390 --> 06:01:39.400 align:start position:0%
accounts to audit per year and be in
 
06:01:42.230 --> 06:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
compliance with the bill and since the
 
06:01:44.750 --> 06:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh scholarship organization takes a 10%
 
06:01:47.868 --> 06:01:47.878 align:start position:0%
cut uh up to a 10% cut of every EFA they
 
06:01:49.510 --> 06:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
also have a direct Financial incentive
 
06:01:51.190 --> 06:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
to keep as many parents and students in
 
06:01:54.310 --> 06:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
the program and not uncover misuse um so
 
06:01:55.590 --> 06:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
each student they kick out they could
 
06:01:59.430 --> 06:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
lose anywhere between 340 to $850 is
 
06:02:03.590 --> 06:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
dollar um and I would even say that um
 
06:02:06.468 --> 06:02:06.478 align:start position:0%
the 10% is a pretty incredulous amount
 
06:02:09.708 --> 06:02:09.718 align:start position:0%
um uh one uh moving this program's
 
06:02:11.830 --> 06:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
Administration to a private organization
 
06:02:14.788 --> 06:02:14.798 align:start position:0%
makes transparency even harder and so it
 
06:02:16.350 --> 06:02:16.360 align:start position:0%
would be really difficult for people to
 
06:02:18.430 --> 06:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
foil the program because it's a private
 
06:02:20.590 --> 06:02:20.600 align:start position:0%
institution so it's even less
 
06:02:22.230 --> 06:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
transparent than a normal Voucher
 
06:02:24.628 --> 06:02:24.638 align:start position:0%
Program would be but also 10% is
 
06:02:26.628 --> 06:02:26.638 align:start position:0%
incredibly High especially since there
 
06:02:28.190 --> 06:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
aren't really any accountability
 
06:02:30.628 --> 06:02:30.638 align:start position:0%
measures so don't have to expend a lot
 
06:02:33.708 --> 06:02:33.718 align:start position:0%
of um uh resources to provide that
 
06:02:36.548 --> 06:02:36.558 align:start position:0%
service in Arizona we allow the
 
06:02:38.270 --> 06:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Education who administers
 
06:02:42.430 --> 06:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
our um uh voucher program to have 5% by
 
06:02:44.350 --> 06:02:44.360 align:start position:0%
law but it's only ever been funded at
 
06:02:46.150 --> 06:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
about half that for about two and a half
 
06:02:49.230 --> 06:02:49.240 align:start position:0%
percent so we take a quarter of what
 
06:02:50.750 --> 06:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
you're offering to administer the
 
06:02:53.990 --> 06:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
program and we do a lot more with that
 
06:02:56.230 --> 06:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
Administration so the I would definitely
 
06:02:59.190 --> 06:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
say that the scary thing is the conflict
 
06:03:01.150 --> 06:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
of interest and also that this is kind
 
06:03:03.110 --> 06:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
of like an attack on local control as
 
06:03:04.590 --> 06:03:04.600 align:start position:0%
much as it is an attack on public
 
06:03:06.468 --> 06:03:06.478 align:start position:0%
education because it consolidates all
 
06:03:08.830 --> 06:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
the management and oversight of this
 
06:03:10.990 --> 06:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
program that's publicly funded but with
 
06:03:13.990 --> 06:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
a private entity so your taxpayers
 
06:03:15.590 --> 06:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
aren't going like it's not something
 
06:03:16.910 --> 06:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to be governed by local
 
06:03:19.230 --> 06:03:19.240 align:start position:0%
school board or have input through their
 
06:03:22.390 --> 06:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
um representative um it really takes
 
06:03:24.070 --> 06:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
this about as far away from the public
 
06:03:26.270 --> 06:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
as possible thank
 
06:03:28.990 --> 06:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much Charles uh are
 
06:03:31.708 --> 06:03:31.718 align:start position:0%
there any
 
06:03:34.868 --> 06:03:34.878 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
06:03:37.788 --> 06:03:37.798 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:03:40.590 --> 06:03:40.600 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Siller for taking my question um
 
06:03:44.070 --> 06:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
our last um education tax scholarships
 
06:03:46.910 --> 06:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh went 85% to uh religious schools and
 
06:03:49.868 --> 06:03:49.878 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if you had an idea of
 
06:03:54.230 --> 06:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
how what percentage of the um Arizona um
 
06:03:56.310 --> 06:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
voucher system went to the monies went
 
06:03:58.430 --> 06:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
to religious schools
 
06:04:00.510 --> 06:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair members of the committee I
 
06:04:02.270 --> 06:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
honestly don't have information about
 
06:04:04.150 --> 06:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
how much money has gone to private
 
06:04:06.190 --> 06:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
schools from our program because as I
 
06:04:08.030 --> 06:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
had briefly mentioned a moment ago these
 
06:04:09.910 --> 06:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
programs are designed intentionally to
 
06:04:12.830 --> 06:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
be opaque and so it is very difficult to
 
06:04:15.270 --> 06:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
get data on them but one thing we have
 
06:04:17.430 --> 06:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
seen and it is interesting I I heard a
 
06:04:20.190 --> 06:04:20.200 align:start position:0%
point made to the contrary uh before but
 
06:04:21.788 --> 06:04:21.798 align:start position:0%
uh looking at all of these programs
 
06:04:22.990 --> 06:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
across the country it's almost
 
06:04:24.788 --> 06:04:24.798 align:start position:0%
universally wealthier families who
 
06:04:27.750 --> 06:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
utilize them because uh uh unless a
 
06:04:30.270 --> 06:04:30.280 align:start position:0%
program has a strict income cap in place
 
06:04:32.628 --> 06:04:32.638 align:start position:0%
which this does not um wealthy families
 
06:04:34.430 --> 06:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
are the ones that can afford to pay the
 
06:04:37.270 --> 06:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
gap between the vouchers and the expense
 
06:04:39.390 --> 06:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
of the tuition or whatever Education
 
06:04:41.628 --> 06:04:41.638 align:start position:0%
Service they're utilizing but even more
 
06:04:43.788 --> 06:04:43.798 align:start position:0%
critically than that um they usually
 
06:04:46.910 --> 06:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
have the time and luxury and resources
 
06:04:49.230 --> 06:04:49.240 align:start position:0%
to search out for programs like this and
 
06:04:51.788 --> 06:04:51.798 align:start position:0%
for the educational options that are
 
06:04:53.990 --> 06:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
before them if you have a family where
 
06:04:56.628 --> 06:04:56.638 align:start position:0%
both parents are working uh two jobs
 
06:04:58.110 --> 06:04:58.120 align:start position:0%
they don't have a lot of time to look
 
06:04:59.948 --> 06:04:59.958 align:start position:0%
into different public programs they
 
06:05:02.030 --> 06:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of time to explore what
 
06:05:04.350 --> 06:05:04.360 align:start position:0%
schools may be around and whether or not
 
06:05:06.110 --> 06:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
those schools provide the services that
 
06:05:08.750 --> 06:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
would best suit their kid or even um
 
06:05:11.350 --> 06:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
look at other options as well beyond
 
06:05:15.868 --> 06:05:15.878 align:start position:0%
that so we see about 75% of the usage in
 
06:05:19.990 --> 06:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
Arizona is uh uh higher income uh
 
06:05:21.830 --> 06:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
families using the program and that's
 
06:05:24.510 --> 06:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
pretty consistent with Esa and uh
 
06:05:26.590 --> 06:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
voucher programs that would mirror what
 
06:05:29.270 --> 06:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
you have here in hb20 so I would expect
 
06:05:32.430 --> 06:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
to see something similar in your state
 
06:05:35.110 --> 06:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh further
 
06:05:37.708 --> 06:05:37.718 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative luno thank
 
06:05:39.468 --> 06:05:39.478 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair and thanks very
 
06:05:42.030 --> 06:05:42.040 align:start position:0%
much Mr Syler for for joining us this
 
06:05:44.750 --> 06:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon um in the fiscal note that
 
06:05:47.548 --> 06:05:47.558 align:start position:0%
that came over uh this morning on House
 
06:05:50.708 --> 06:05:50.718 align:start position:0%
Bill 20 the um legislative budget
 
06:05:54.070 --> 06:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
assistant um estimates there's there's
 
06:05:54.080 --> 06:05:55.590 align:start position:0%
assistant um estimates there's there's
approximately

06:05:55.590 --> 06:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
06:06:00.430 --> 06:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
16,000 new your students um uh attending
 
06:06:03.948 --> 06:06:03.958 align:start position:0%
private schools so would would you know
 
06:06:05.510 --> 06:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
seeing that these these students
 
06:06:08.110 --> 06:06:08.120 align:start position:0%
according to representative cordelli are
 
06:06:12.230 --> 06:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
are eligible for this program um would
 
06:06:14.190 --> 06:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
would I guess you expect there to be a
 
06:06:17.750 --> 06:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
be a fairly High takeup rate um U from
 
06:06:20.510 --> 06:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
these families U Mr chair members of the
 
06:06:22.750 --> 06:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
committee um I imagine that you would
 
06:06:26.310 --> 06:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
see an almost immediate rush uh of
 
06:06:29.110 --> 06:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
families to to uh utilize this program
 
06:06:31.350 --> 06:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
who are already either homeschooling or
 
06:06:34.628 --> 06:06:34.638 align:start position:0%
in a private school situation as it is
 
06:06:38.270 --> 06:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh I mean uh subsidizing their education
 
06:06:40.628 --> 06:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
by a few thousand do means they get to
 
06:06:42.830 --> 06:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
keep a few thousand dolls more and while
 
06:06:45.230 --> 06:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
there may be a a few families a handful
 
06:06:47.150 --> 06:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
of families in New Hampshire where a
 
06:06:49.590 --> 06:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
couple thousand dollars is is absolutely
 
06:06:53.030 --> 06:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
meaningless to them um I am quite
 
06:06:56.510 --> 06:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
confident that that would uh be a very
 
06:06:56.520 --> 06:06:57.548 align:start position:0%
confident that that would uh be a very
small

06:06:57.548 --> 06:06:57.558 align:start position:0%
small
 
06:07:02.750 --> 06:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
percentage uh and so um yeah I we see in
 
06:07:05.270 --> 06:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
every situation that we've uh
 
06:07:08.270 --> 06:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
encountered uh where a voucher program
 
06:07:11.190 --> 06:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
or an Esa program has the opportunity
 
06:07:14.990 --> 06:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
for a uh a family to um utilize the
 
06:07:17.670 --> 06:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
subsidy uh they do in Arizona we don't
 
06:07:19.230 --> 06:07:19.240 align:start position:0%
have that because we have a requirement
 
06:07:21.670 --> 06:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
that students have to have attended um
 
06:07:24.110 --> 06:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
Public School beforehand and a number of
 
06:07:27.868 --> 06:07:27.878 align:start position:0%
other uh of these Esa programs have a
 
06:07:30.430 --> 06:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
provision that's similar uh written into
 
06:07:32.350 --> 06:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
their bills as
 
06:07:36.628 --> 06:07:36.638 align:start position:0%

educational Choice all across the
 
06:08:40.110 --> 06:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
country uh I got my start on this issue
 
06:08:42.708 --> 06:08:42.718 align:start position:0%
actually Back in the New Hampshire house
 
06:08:46.390 --> 06:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh I was I served in 2007 and 2008 uh
 
06:08:48.708 --> 06:08:48.718 align:start position:0%
and now I live in Arizona uh so we have
 
06:08:52.270 --> 06:08:52.280 align:start position:0%
a trifect of Arizona residents today I
 
06:08:55.230 --> 06:08:55.240 align:start position:0%
actually I submitted uh testimony that I
 
06:08:57.548 --> 06:08:57.558 align:start position:0%
emailed to the committee
 
06:08:59.310 --> 06:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm not just going to read it word
 
06:09:02.430 --> 06:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
for word uh you have all that uh what I
 
06:09:04.390 --> 06:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
would like to do is actually address uh
 
06:09:06.030 --> 06:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that were raised
 
06:09:08.190 --> 06:09:08.200 align:start position:0%
before and some of the issues that were
 
06:09:11.190 --> 06:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
raised uh by the previous uh gentleman
 
06:09:12.468 --> 06:09:12.478 align:start position:0%
uh one of the questions that was raised
 
06:09:15.190 --> 06:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
before was about what if a student were
 
06:09:18.590 --> 06:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
to uh enroll in the esa or EFA program
 
06:09:20.270 --> 06:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
as you call it in Arizona sorry in New
 
06:09:21.910 --> 06:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if they were to take an
 
06:09:24.468 --> 06:09:24.478 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account uh and then
 
06:09:27.230 --> 06:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
they were to leave it and return to
 
06:09:31.230 --> 06:09:31.240 align:start position:0%
their Public School uh so the EFA
 
06:09:33.590 --> 06:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
accounts uh the the treasurer makes
 
06:09:37.350 --> 06:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
deposits on a quarterly basis uh and the
 
06:09:39.310 --> 06:09:39.320 align:start position:0%
online version I have doesn't have page
 
06:09:42.468 --> 06:09:42.478 align:start position:0%
numbers uh but there is a section uh
 
06:09:45.590 --> 06:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
that says that uh the EFA shall remain
 
06:09:48.070 --> 06:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
in force and any unused funds roll over
 
06:09:49.670 --> 06:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
from quarter to quarter and from year to
 
06:09:52.190 --> 06:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
year until the parent withdraws from the
 
06:09:54.510 --> 06:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
EFA withdraws the EFA student from the
 
06:09:56.750 --> 06:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
EFA program or until the EFA student
 
06:09:58.350 --> 06:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
graduates from high school unless the EA
 
06:10:00.190 --> 06:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
is closed because of a substantial
 
06:10:02.510 --> 06:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
misuse of funds and then here's the key
 
06:10:04.750 --> 06:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
part any unused fund shall revert to the
 
06:10:06.510 --> 06:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
State Treasury and be allocated to fund
 
06:10:10.468 --> 06:10:10.478 align:start position:0%
other efas so if a student were to leave
 
06:10:12.788 --> 06:10:12.798 align:start position:0%
the program those funds do end up
 
06:10:16.030 --> 06:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
reverting back to the
 
06:10:19.350 --> 06:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
state uh now I want to address there
 
06:10:20.910 --> 06:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
were a number of issues that were were
 
06:10:22.548 --> 06:10:22.558 align:start position:0%
raised by the previous gentleman who who
 
06:10:25.190 --> 06:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
did not actually identify himself as a a
 
06:10:27.670 --> 06:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
lobbyist for a union funded anti-school
 
06:10:29.468 --> 06:10:29.478 align:start position:0%
Choice group out here in Arizona called
 
06:10:33.270 --> 06:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
save our schools uh and you know he was
 
06:10:35.390 --> 06:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
talking about local control the the most
 
06:10:38.150 --> 06:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
local form of control is actually the
 
06:10:41.310 --> 06:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
family and what this bill recognizes is
 
06:10:44.708 --> 06:10:44.718 align:start position:0%
that there is no one school that best
 
06:10:47.070 --> 06:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
meets the needs of every single child
 
06:10:49.708 --> 06:10:49.718 align:start position:0%
who just happens to live nearby and it
 
06:10:49.718 --> 06:10:50.590 align:start position:0%
who just happens to live nearby and it
is

06:10:50.590 --> 06:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:10:54.350 --> 06:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
properly moving the locus of control uh
 
06:10:57.030 --> 06:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
from the state or from other elected
 
06:11:01.628 --> 06:11:01.638 align:start position:0%
officials to families to uh customize
 
06:11:04.110 --> 06:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
their child's education based on their
 
06:11:06.310 --> 06:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
intimate personal knowledge of their
 
06:11:09.670 --> 06:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
child's specific uh educational needs
 
06:11:13.230 --> 06:11:13.240 align:start position:0%
and uh interests and aptitude uh now he
 
06:11:15.390 --> 06:11:15.400 align:start position:0%
he he talked about the auditor General's
 
06:11:18.150 --> 06:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
report uh of course yes he says you know
 
06:11:19.708 --> 06:11:19.718 align:start position:0%
there were jet skis and all sorts of
 
06:11:22.510 --> 06:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
things uh the auditor General's report
 
06:11:25.070 --> 06:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
which I included a link to it uh in my
 
06:11:27.830 --> 06:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
testimony found that
 
06:11:31.190 --> 06:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
99% of the funds were spent for
 
06:11:35.350 --> 06:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate eligible uses about 1% of
 
06:11:38.190 --> 06:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
the funds uh in Arizona were spent for
 
06:11:41.110 --> 06:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
inappropriate uses uh now how did that
 
06:11:43.350 --> 06:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
happen well what they have in Arizona is
 
06:11:46.150 --> 06:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
they they were using uh debit cards now
 
06:11:47.750 --> 06:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
if the program had been large enough
 
06:11:49.628 --> 06:11:49.638 align:start position:0%
they could have used product codes but
 
06:11:51.510 --> 06:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't they were using vendor
 
06:11:54.788 --> 06:11:54.798 align:start position:0%
codes with the vendor codes you know you
 
06:11:56.628 --> 06:11:56.638 align:start position:0%
just you can't take it and R to Disney
 
06:11:58.548 --> 06:11:58.558 align:start position:0%
world or Caesar's Palace you can only
 
06:12:01.708 --> 06:12:01.718 align:start position:0%
use the card at a vendor that sells
 
06:12:04.990 --> 06:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
approved products and services uh and
 
06:12:07.150 --> 06:12:07.160 align:start position:0%
then you have to submit your quarterly
 
06:12:09.070 --> 06:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
receipts you cannot get your next
 
06:12:11.390 --> 06:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
quarter's allocation of funding until
 
06:12:14.670 --> 06:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
you have submitted your receipts the
 
06:12:17.430 --> 06:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the misspending was
 
06:12:19.350 --> 06:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
actually just uh families who were new
 
06:12:20.708 --> 06:12:20.718 align:start position:0%
to the program that were a little bit
 
06:12:23.030 --> 06:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
confused that purchase things like uh
 
06:12:25.788 --> 06:12:25.798 align:start position:0%
pens paper uh consumable you know
 
06:12:28.230 --> 06:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
educational products that the department
 
06:12:29.788 --> 06:12:29.798 align:start position:0%
then had to tell them no you know that's
 
06:12:32.628 --> 06:12:32.638 align:start position:0%
not an eligible expense they then had to
 
06:12:35.190 --> 06:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
refund that money back into the account
 
06:12:36.590 --> 06:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
and they couldn't get their next
 
06:12:38.590 --> 06:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
dispersement until they did that there
 
06:12:40.628 --> 06:12:40.638 align:start position:0%
were however some cases that's where you
 
06:12:43.510 --> 06:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
get the jet ski the jet ski stories
 
06:12:46.830 --> 06:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
where a card had been lost or stolen or
 
06:12:49.670 --> 06:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
or otherwise compromised uh some in some
 
06:12:51.910 --> 06:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
cases from hackers that break into the
 
06:12:54.070 --> 06:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh the card readers uh and in those
 
06:12:56.030 --> 06:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
cases there were people who were able to
 
06:12:56.040 --> 06:12:57.070 align:start position:0%
cases there were people who were able to
purch

06:12:57.070 --> 06:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
purch
 
06:13:00.628 --> 06:13:00.638 align:start position:0%
inappropriate items uh in many of those
 
06:13:01.948 --> 06:13:01.958 align:start position:0%
cases they were able to track those
 
06:13:04.868 --> 06:13:04.878 align:start position:0%
people down and they were accused of uh
 
06:13:07.548 --> 06:13:07.558 align:start position:0%
you know of theft and fraud uh as is
 
06:13:10.270 --> 06:13:10.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate but again uh that's fewer
 
06:13:14.468 --> 06:13:14.478 align:start position:0%
than 1% far actually fewer than 1% uh
 
06:13:16.110 --> 06:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
were were the the cases of actual
 
06:13:19.070 --> 06:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
outright fraud compare this by the way
 
06:13:21.430 --> 06:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
to other government programs that
 
06:13:23.910 --> 06:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
according to uh the the US general
 
06:13:25.548 --> 06:13:25.558 align:start position:0%
accountability office there's about a
 
06:13:28.708 --> 06:13:28.718 align:start position:0%
five rate 5% rate of of misspending
 
06:13:31.110 --> 06:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
across government programs uh and and
 
06:13:33.990 --> 06:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
some of the most beloved programs like
 
06:13:35.670 --> 06:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
the uh school lunch and School breakfast
 
06:13:37.910 --> 06:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
program have a fraud and misspending
 
06:13:40.390 --> 06:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
rates uh you know that are about 16 and
 
06:13:44.628 --> 06:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
23% respectively uh Arizona though has
 
06:13:47.070 --> 06:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
also learned from their experience with
 
06:13:50.110 --> 06:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
the cards they are now moving to a
 
06:13:52.150 --> 06:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
system called class wallet which is an
 
06:13:55.030 --> 06:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
online portal and the only way that you
 
06:13:57.030 --> 06:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
can make purchases
 
06:14:00.190 --> 06:14:00.200 align:start position:0%
is through the online portal the only uh
 
06:14:02.628 --> 06:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
vendors that are in the online portal
 
06:14:04.430 --> 06:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
are vendors that have that are selling
 
06:14:06.270 --> 06:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
approved goods and services and that's
 
06:14:08.548 --> 06:14:08.558 align:start position:0%
all you can purchase through the online
 
06:14:11.910 --> 06:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
portal so this new class wallet system
 
06:14:13.190 --> 06:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
which is very similar to things like
 
06:14:14.548 --> 06:14:14.558 align:start position:0%
benefit wallet and whatnot that you
 
06:14:15.910 --> 06:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
might use for your health savings
 
06:14:18.750 --> 06:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
account uh this should be taking fraud
 
06:14:20.548 --> 06:14:20.558 align:start position:0%
basically down to zero so this is
 
06:14:23.190 --> 06:14:23.200 align:start position:0%
actually a far more accountable program
 
06:14:24.190 --> 06:14:24.200 align:start position:0%
and when we're talking about
 
06:14:26.430 --> 06:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
accountability really the best form form
 
06:14:26.440 --> 06:14:27.430 align:start position:0%
accountability really the best form form
of

06:14:27.430 --> 06:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:14:30.190 --> 06:14:30.200 align:start position:0%
accountability is directly to the people
 
06:14:32.910 --> 06:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
who bear the consequences of your
 
06:14:35.670 --> 06:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
performance so when it comes to we can
 
06:14:37.910 --> 06:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
break down accountability into two parts
 
06:14:39.708 --> 06:14:39.718 align:start position:0%
Financial accountability and academic
 
06:14:41.868 --> 06:14:41.878 align:start position:0%
accountability Financial accountability
 
06:14:43.788 --> 06:14:43.798 align:start position:0%
that's where the state has to ensure
 
06:14:45.430 --> 06:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
that these funds are used for the
 
06:14:48.310 --> 06:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
purpose for which they were allocated uh
 
06:14:51.150 --> 06:14:51.160 align:start position:0%
the online portal system accomplishes
 
06:14:54.230 --> 06:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
that goal uh secondly the academic
 
06:14:57.030 --> 06:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
accountability is appropriately uh to
 
06:14:58.468 --> 06:14:58.478 align:start position:0%
the parents and this is something I
 
06:15:01.590 --> 06:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
think we've lost sight of which is that
 
06:15:05.150 --> 06:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh in many cases uh the Local District
 
06:15:07.430 --> 06:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
school is is really not uh directly
 
06:15:08.948 --> 06:15:08.958 align:start position:0%
accountable to parents it's accountable
 
06:15:10.868 --> 06:15:10.878 align:start position:0%
to elected officials it's accountabil
 
06:15:11.910 --> 06:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's accountable to unelected
 
06:15:13.788 --> 06:15:13.798 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats but not directly to the
 
06:15:15.830 --> 06:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
parents and we do this as a sort of
 
06:15:18.390 --> 06:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
second best form of accountability
 
06:15:20.868 --> 06:15:20.878 align:start position:0%
because especially for uh lowincome
 
06:15:22.708 --> 06:15:22.718 align:start position:0%
areas where they can't afford to move to
 
06:15:24.788 --> 06:15:24.798 align:start position:0%
a better District uh or to pay for
 
06:15:26.510 --> 06:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
private school tuition then they're not
 
06:15:28.788 --> 06:15:28.798 align:start position:0%
directly accountable to the parents uh
 
06:15:31.110 --> 06:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
over time we have come to confuse these
 
06:15:33.548 --> 06:15:33.558 align:start position:0%
sorts of government regulations uh with
 
06:15:35.070 --> 06:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
accountability but the real
 
06:15:37.030 --> 06:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
accountability is when you have a family
 
06:15:39.270 --> 06:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
with multiple options and they are
 
06:15:40.990 --> 06:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
empowered with the ability to choose
 
06:15:42.948 --> 06:15:42.958 align:start position:0%
among those options so if something is
 
06:15:45.190 --> 06:15:45.200 align:start position:0%
not working for their child they can
 
06:15:48.230 --> 06:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
leave now yes Arizona New Hampshire does
 
06:15:50.270 --> 06:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
have some great schools on the product
 
06:15:53.070 --> 06:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
of both uh New Hampshire's uh public
 
06:15:55.868 --> 06:15:55.878 align:start position:0%
school system I spent eight years in in
 
06:15:57.270 --> 06:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
a public school that I loved and I'm
 
06:15:58.948 --> 06:15:58.958 align:start position:0%
glad that my parents were able to afford
 
06:16:01.150 --> 06:16:01.160 align:start position:0%
to live in Windham uh we didn't have a
 
06:16:02.708 --> 06:16:02.718 align:start position:0%
high school and I'm glad that they were
 
06:16:04.910 --> 06:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh able to afford to send me to Bishop
 
06:16:07.150 --> 06:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
girton Catholic High School uh which by
 
06:16:09.910 --> 06:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
the way I'm a Jewish student uh or I was
 
06:16:11.590 --> 06:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
I am Jewish and I was a student at a
 
06:16:14.030 --> 06:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
Catholic High School uh uh some of my
 
06:16:16.628 --> 06:16:16.638 align:start position:0%
friends were gay uh there was a teacher
 
06:16:18.230 --> 06:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
there that I had who everybody knew was
 
06:16:21.070 --> 06:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
gay they uh were very warm and welcoming
 
06:16:23.868 --> 06:16:23.878 align:start position:0%
to all people uh so on this question of
 
06:16:26.430 --> 06:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
discrimination uh yes there will be some
 
06:16:29.310 --> 06:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
schools that are going to say uh we are
 
06:16:31.910 --> 06:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
open only to members of our particular
 
06:16:34.030 --> 06:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
faith community and you have to adhere
 
06:16:37.910 --> 06:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
to uh our particular uh ideas and
 
06:16:40.110 --> 06:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
beliefs but there are also schools that
 
06:16:42.230 --> 06:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
are open to everyone uh there are there
 
06:16:44.190 --> 06:16:44.200 align:start position:0%
was also a case I can send the committee
 
06:16:46.150 --> 06:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
a recent story that came out of Florida
 
06:16:48.150 --> 06:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
where there was a gay student who was
 
06:16:50.030 --> 06:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
horrifically bullied in his public
 
06:16:52.548 --> 06:16:52.558 align:start position:0%
school which failed to uh adequately
 
06:16:56.390 --> 06:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
protect him he was then able to take a
 
06:16:57.990 --> 06:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
scholarship through the state's tax
 
06:16:59.590 --> 06:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
credit scholarship program similar to
 
06:17:01.548 --> 06:17:01.558 align:start position:0%
what you have in New Hampshire and find
 
06:17:04.430 --> 06:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
a private school where he is thriving uh
 
06:17:07.990 --> 06:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
so uh there are there's no system that's
 
06:17:10.150 --> 06:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
going to open every single option up to
 
06:17:13.030 --> 06:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
everybody but what this bill does is it
 
06:17:16.110 --> 06:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
opens so many doors for so many children
 
06:17:18.510 --> 06:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
the idea is you want to maximize the
 
06:17:20.708 --> 06:17:20.718 align:start position:0%
ability of families to have as many
 
06:17:23.628 --> 06:17:23.638 align:start position:0%
options as they possibly can uh one last
 
06:17:26.788 --> 06:17:26.798 align:start position:0%
note uh this idea of uh wealthy families
 
06:17:29.468 --> 06:17:29.478 align:start position:0%
it's simply inaccurate uh there is no
 
06:17:31.670 --> 06:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
data in Arizona they're not collecting
 
06:17:34.350 --> 06:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
income data but what we can say is that
 
06:17:35.510 --> 06:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
when you look at the districts that
 
06:17:37.868 --> 06:17:37.878 align:start position:0%
they're coming from uh the participants
 
06:17:39.510 --> 06:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
in the esa program are coming from
 
06:17:42.150 --> 06:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
higher and lower poverty districts uh
 
06:17:44.110 --> 06:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
areas in in similar proportion to the
 
06:17:46.830 --> 06:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
public school students and actually the
 
06:17:48.708 --> 06:17:48.718 align:start position:0%
uh the 10 districts that have the
 
06:17:51.628 --> 06:17:51.638 align:start position:0%
highest concentrations of Esa students
 
06:17:53.430 --> 06:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
actually also have some of the highest
 
06:17:56.990 --> 06:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
child poverty rates in the state and uh
 
06:17:58.868 --> 06:17:58.878 align:start position:0%
I was a part of a a group that did a
 
06:18:01.868 --> 06:18:01.878 align:start position:0%
survey uh of the program in its first
 
06:18:05.510 --> 06:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
year uh the students that entered the
 
06:18:07.708 --> 06:18:07.718 align:start position:0%
program uh when they were asked about
 
06:18:10.430 --> 06:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
their previous Public School uh fewer
 
06:18:12.350 --> 06:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
than half said that they uh were
 
06:18:13.868 --> 06:18:13.878 align:start position:0%
satisfied with the education they
 
06:18:15.390 --> 06:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
received at the previous public school
 
06:18:17.590 --> 06:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
and it was the lowest income quintile
 
06:18:20.150 --> 06:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
that expressed the most
 
06:18:22.750 --> 06:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
dissatisfaction however uh when we asked
 
06:18:24.750 --> 06:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
them about the uh education they were
 
06:18:26.590 --> 06:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
able to acquire for their their child
 
06:18:29.548 --> 06:18:29.558 align:start position:0%
through the esa program uh there was
 
06:18:33.390 --> 06:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
actually Universal um uh support uh
 
06:18:35.468 --> 06:18:35.478 align:start position:0%
satisfaction and it was the lowest
 
06:18:37.868 --> 06:18:37.878 align:start position:0%
income quintile that said that they were
 
06:18:40.070 --> 06:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
the they were the most likely to say
 
06:18:42.110 --> 06:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
that they were very satisfied 9 out of
 
06:18:44.350 --> 06:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
10 said that they were very satisfied so
 
06:18:46.070 --> 06:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
it was the lowest income families in
 
06:18:47.310 --> 06:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
other words those that are the most
 
06:18:49.868 --> 06:18:49.878 align:start position:0%
Choice deprived that had the most to
 
06:18:52.590 --> 06:18:52.600 align:start position:0%

uncovering um um I guess misuse of um of
 
06:20:53.150 --> 06:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
of these voucher
 
06:20:56.868 --> 06:20:56.878 align:start position:0%
funds yeah the esa funds in AR Iona uh
 
06:20:59.510 --> 06:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
have to be audited on a regular basis uh
 
06:21:01.350 --> 06:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
and they are audited by the department
 
06:21:03.670 --> 06:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
and also by the auditor General's office
 
06:21:05.190 --> 06:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
who audits not only the department
 
06:21:07.070 --> 06:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
itself uh sorry not only the the
 
06:21:09.230 --> 06:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
accounts but the department itself and
 
06:21:12.310 --> 06:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
how it is managing uh the the
 
06:21:15.628 --> 06:21:15.638 align:start position:0%
program okay so that's in statute that
 
06:21:17.910 --> 06:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
is in statute okay do you see is there
 
06:21:20.948 --> 06:21:20.958 align:start position:0%
anything like that in in House Bill 20
 
06:21:23.548 --> 06:21:23.558 align:start position:0%
uh no there is not okay thank
 
06:21:26.990 --> 06:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much represent Miler
 
06:21:29.948 --> 06:21:29.958 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh Mr chairman uh and thank
 
06:21:32.110 --> 06:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
you for being here Mr bedrick uh
 
06:21:35.030 --> 06:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
question for you uh New Hampshire ranks
 
06:21:37.708 --> 06:21:37.718 align:start position:0%
in the top three top five in student
 
06:21:40.868 --> 06:21:40.878 align:start position:0%
achievement in the nation are you aware
 
06:21:43.350 --> 06:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
of uh Arizona's
 
06:21:45.868 --> 06:21:45.878 align:start position:0%
rank I I don't have Arizona's ranking
 
06:21:48.468 --> 06:21:48.478 align:start position:0%
Arizona is a middling state right now uh
 
06:21:50.310 --> 06:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
although I would say over the last two
 
06:21:54.110 --> 06:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
decades Arizona has had the greatest um
 
06:21:58.150 --> 06:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
leaps in terms of of uh growth uh so uh
 
06:22:00.628 --> 06:22:00.638 align:start position:0%
in both the 2015 and
 
06:22:03.750 --> 06:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
2017 nape that's the national assessment
 
06:22:06.468 --> 06:22:06.478 align:start position:0%
of educational progress Arizona had the
 
06:22:10.390 --> 06:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
most gains uh Arizona also if you look
 
06:22:13.190 --> 06:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
at just Arizona's Charter School sector
 
06:22:15.230 --> 06:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
Arizona's Charter School sector is
 
06:22:16.990 --> 06:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
number one in the country compared to
 
06:22:20.110 --> 06:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
any other state uh so what we have found
 
06:22:22.670 --> 06:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
in Arizona is that Arizona went from
 
06:22:26.110 --> 06:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
near the bottom uh to Middle
 
06:22:28.150 --> 06:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh and that we think is to a great
 
06:22:32.750 --> 06:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
extent because of uh the uh the variety
 
06:22:35.270 --> 06:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
of uh educational options that you here
 
06:22:37.868 --> 06:22:37.878 align:start position:0%
that you have here in Arizona the the
 
06:22:40.190 --> 06:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
last I saw on US News and World Report
 
06:22:41.948 --> 06:22:41.958 align:start position:0%
is that Arizona ranked 40th in the
 
06:22:43.910 --> 06:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
nation thank you very
 
06:22:46.750 --> 06:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
much not on the nape uh and and part of
 
06:22:49.070 --> 06:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
what Newsweek uh sorry uh US News and
 
06:22:51.990 --> 06:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
World Report does is that uh they look
 
06:22:55.110 --> 06:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
at a lot of inputs as well and not just
 
06:22:56.910 --> 06:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
output puts and so I think it's more
 
06:22:59.310 --> 06:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
important both to look at outputs and
 
06:23:01.468 --> 06:23:01.478 align:start position:0%
also to look at trajectory because a
 
06:23:04.310 --> 06:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
part of the idea of educational choice
 
06:23:07.590 --> 06:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
is that over time you are going to have
 
06:23:09.390 --> 06:23:09.400 align:start position:0%
improvements uh that is certainly what
 
06:23:11.670 --> 06:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
we've seen with uh there's been about 30
 
06:23:14.670 --> 06:23:14.680 align:start position:0%
studies um by top universities in the
 
06:23:16.948 --> 06:23:16.958 align:start position:0%
country that have looked at the effect
 
06:23:21.310 --> 06:23:21.320 align:start position:0%
of educational Choice programs uh on on
 
06:23:22.830 --> 06:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
the performance of public school
 
06:23:24.510 --> 06:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
students uh in other words the the
 
06:23:26.670 --> 06:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
students who remain in the public school
 
06:23:30.590 --> 06:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
system uh all but one of them uh found
 
06:23:32.390 --> 06:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh neutral to positive effects actually
 
06:23:34.350 --> 06:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
the vast majority found small but
 
06:23:35.990 --> 06:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
statistically significant positive
 
06:23:37.910 --> 06:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
effects uh there were few that did not
 
06:23:40.948 --> 06:23:40.958 align:start position:0%
find any effect and only one that found
 
06:23:42.708 --> 06:23:42.718 align:start position:0%
a negative effect uh and that was in
 
06:23:44.430 --> 06:23:44.440 align:start position:0%
Florida but there were several other
 
06:23:46.110 --> 06:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
studies in Florida that had detected
 
06:23:49.070 --> 06:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
positive effects uh so what we do see is
 
06:23:53.468 --> 06:23:53.478 align:start position:0%
that over time the um availability of
 
06:23:56.510 --> 06:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
multiple choices for families actually
 
06:23:59.390 --> 06:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh creates an incentive for the entire
 
06:24:02.390 --> 06:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
system to improve thank you very much uh
 
06:24:04.830 --> 06:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
Mr bedrick uh are there further
 
06:24:07.190 --> 06:24:07.200 align:start position:0%

family to help pay for their tuition
 
06:25:29.510 --> 06:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 20 is an intrusion into the
 
06:25:31.830 --> 06:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
futures of public school children and
 
06:25:33.548 --> 06:25:33.558 align:start position:0%
the imposition of a financial burden on
 
06:25:35.628 --> 06:25:35.638 align:start position:0%
taxpayers across the state this bill has
 
06:25:37.868 --> 06:25:37.878 align:start position:0%
no place in the granite state three
 
06:25:39.510 --> 06:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
years ago this committee sent a similar
 
06:25:41.030 --> 06:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
Bill onto the finance committee that
 
06:25:43.270 --> 06:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
contain so many issues the finance
 
06:25:45.150 --> 06:25:45.160 align:start position:0%
committee simply could not fix them I
 
06:25:46.548 --> 06:25:46.558 align:start position:0%
urge the members of this committee not
 
06:25:48.390 --> 06:25:48.400 align:start position:0%

06:25:50.030 --> 06:25:50.040 align:start position:0%

hello good afternoon and thank you for
 
06:27:08.910 --> 06:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony today I'm glad we're
 
06:27:10.788 --> 06:27:10.798 align:start position:0%
doing Zoom it would have been difficult
 
06:27:13.350 --> 06:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
out there and all this snow my name is
 
06:27:15.350 --> 06:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
shelmer caneso and I'm a mom from
 
06:27:17.830 --> 06:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester and I'm in support of Bill
 
06:27:20.468 --> 06:27:20.478 align:start position:0%
hb20 I am the co-chair of the Manchester
 
06:27:23.430 --> 06:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
NAACP education committee but I am here
 
06:27:26.150 --> 06:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
representing myself as a Hispanic leader
 
06:27:28.030 --> 06:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
of color in my community I've seen
 
06:27:29.910 --> 06:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
firsthand how many of our communities
 
06:27:32.230 --> 06:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
don't have equal access to educational
 
06:27:34.190 --> 06:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
resources this is about leveling the
 
06:27:35.750 --> 06:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
playing field and making the best
 
06:27:38.510 --> 06:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
education accessible to everyone in this
 
06:27:39.910 --> 06:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
day and age we talk a lot about
 
06:27:42.150 --> 06:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
diversity you know equity and inclusion
 
06:27:43.590 --> 06:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
and those need to be the goals in our
 
06:27:45.910 --> 06:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
educational system as well it's clear to
 
06:27:47.628 --> 06:27:47.638 align:start position:0%
me that education Freedom accounts are a
 
06:27:49.230 --> 06:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
huge step forward that would help
 
06:27:50.868 --> 06:27:50.878 align:start position:0%
achieve these goals this is about
 
06:27:52.750 --> 06:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
removing barriers to help our kids reach
 
06:27:55.110 --> 06:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
their potential this is about individual
 
06:27:56.830 --> 06:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students to succeed
 
06:27:59.590 --> 06:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
academically by allowing resources to
 
06:28:02.110 --> 06:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
help meet their individual learning my
 
06:28:03.830 --> 06:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
path for parent advocacy in this area
 
06:28:05.628 --> 06:28:05.638 align:start position:0%
started when my children were having
 
06:28:07.548 --> 06:28:07.558 align:start position:0%
difficulty in school though all three of
 
06:28:09.430 --> 06:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
my children have had childhood ill
 
06:28:11.948 --> 06:28:11.958 align:start position:0%
illnesses such as multiple sclerosis and
 
06:28:14.270 --> 06:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
cancer I want to talk about my youngest
 
06:28:16.750 --> 06:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
his name is Angel who incidentally just
 
06:28:19.788 --> 06:28:19.798 align:start position:0%
happens to also have dark skin Angel was
 
06:28:21.670 --> 06:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
always struggling he's very high
 
06:28:23.990 --> 06:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
functioning on the Autism Spectrum which
 
06:28:26.548 --> 06:28:26.558 align:start position:0%
went un un diagnosed until 9 years of
 
06:28:29.390 --> 06:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
age he's also ADHD as well and he's
 
06:28:31.590 --> 06:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
prone to severe migraines he started
 
06:28:34.230 --> 06:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
with an individualized education plan in
 
06:28:36.110 --> 06:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
third grade and was later downgraded to
 
06:28:39.110 --> 06:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
a 504 plan in high school in sixth grade
 
06:28:40.868 --> 06:28:40.878 align:start position:0%
he was having lots of difficulty at our
 
06:28:42.868 --> 06:28:42.878 align:start position:0%
local public school when he started at
 
06:28:44.230 --> 06:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
the middle school we did tell him about
 
06:28:45.868 --> 06:28:45.878 align:start position:0%
the situation and ask him if they could
 
06:28:47.830 --> 06:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
accommodate him but they said no to a
 
06:28:49.350 --> 06:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
lot of our requests and they refused
 
06:28:51.468 --> 06:28:51.478 align:start position:0%
many of the ideas that would align with
 
06:28:53.830 --> 06:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
his IEP repeatedly he would always end
 
06:28:55.468 --> 06:28:55.478 align:start position:0%
up having problems with the teachers and
 
06:28:57.350 --> 06:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
the environment and stress would trigger
 
06:28:59.030 --> 06:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
his migraines and cause him lots of
 
06:29:00.948 --> 06:29:00.958 align:start position:0%
anxiety and would have him just acting
 
06:29:02.788 --> 06:29:02.798 align:start position:0%
out of sorts to which the school's
 
06:29:04.750 --> 06:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
repeated response was to put him to in
 
06:29:07.430 --> 06:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
in-house suspensions so we pulled him
 
06:29:08.948 --> 06:29:08.958 align:start position:0%
from that school and we were able to put
 
06:29:10.948 --> 06:29:10.958 align:start position:0%
him at St cmir thanks to the scholarship
 
06:29:12.868 --> 06:29:12.878 align:start position:0%
from the children's scholarship fund he
 
06:29:14.628 --> 06:29:14.638 align:start position:0%
was there all of eighth grade and he did
 
06:29:15.910 --> 06:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
amazing it was to the point where the
 
06:29:18.110 --> 06:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
teachers were just saying they didn't
 
06:29:19.990 --> 06:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
even see what was it that was in his
 
06:29:21.468 --> 06:29:21.478 align:start position:0%
file that had come over from the school
 
06:29:23.708 --> 06:29:23.718 align:start position:0%
he was at it was basically night and day
 
06:29:25.590 --> 06:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
for him he begged says to never send
 
06:29:27.548 --> 06:29:27.558 align:start position:0%
them back to the public school but after
 
06:29:28.948 --> 06:29:28.958 align:start position:0%
his father took on a new job with a
 
06:29:30.788 --> 06:29:30.798 align:start position:0%
higher income we no longer qualified for
 
06:29:32.548 --> 06:29:32.558 align:start position:0%
the amount of scholarship Monies to make
 
06:29:34.030 --> 06:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
it possible to move them into the
 
06:29:36.390 --> 06:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
private high school if the education
 
06:29:37.750 --> 06:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
Freedom account were around then we
 
06:29:39.190 --> 06:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
would have been able to use these funds
 
06:29:40.590 --> 06:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
to make up the difference to send them
 
06:29:42.230 --> 06:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
to a high school that would meet his
 
06:29:44.830 --> 06:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
needs today Angel is back in the public
 
06:29:46.468 --> 06:29:46.478 align:start position:0%
school system and he's repeating his
 
06:29:48.910 --> 06:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
senior year and he's still
 
06:29:50.910 --> 06:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
struggling I like saying that these
 
06:29:52.910 --> 06:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
things don't have to be looked at as an
 
06:29:54.430 --> 06:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
either or we should look for the
 
06:29:56.948 --> 06:29:56.958 align:start position:0%
solution from a both and perspective
 
06:29:59.150 --> 06:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
Public Schools don't work for everyone
 
06:30:00.670 --> 06:30:00.680 align:start position:0%
the same way private schools don't work
 
06:30:03.868 --> 06:30:03.878 align:start position:0%
for everyone we do have to look at it as
 
06:30:06.628 --> 06:30:06.638 align:start position:0%
from a both and perspective everywhere
 
06:30:08.910 --> 06:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
you turn there's so many choices yet K
 
06:30:11.270 --> 06:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
through2 education isn't one of them we
 
06:30:12.750 --> 06:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
should make it possible for the parents
 
06:30:14.670 --> 06:30:14.680 align:start position:0%
to choose what works best for their
 
06:30:17.070 --> 06:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
child after all don't the parents know
 
06:30:18.510 --> 06:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
their children's need more than anyone
 
06:30:20.948 --> 06:30:20.958 align:start position:0%
else I've spoken with multiple families
 
06:30:22.948 --> 06:30:22.958 align:start position:0%
who say that education Freedom accounts
 
06:30:25.070 --> 06:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
would help them a lot I know families
 
06:30:26.628 --> 06:30:26.638 align:start position:0%
that are paying for school out of pocket
 
06:30:28.750 --> 06:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
who don't qualify for Scholarships in
 
06:30:30.750 --> 06:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
many instances any bit helps and
 
06:30:33.150 --> 06:30:33.160 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts go a long way
 
06:30:34.590 --> 06:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
I did hear earlier that somebody
 
06:30:36.670 --> 06:30:36.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned well if a family is earning
 
06:30:38.868 --> 06:30:38.878 align:start position:0%
300,000 then would they still be able to
 
06:30:40.548 --> 06:30:40.558 align:start position:0%
apply well yes they would but really how
 
06:30:43.270 --> 06:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
many families do you know earn 300,000 I
 
06:30:46.230 --> 06:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
don't uh so basically this is mostly the
 
06:30:49.430 --> 06:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
parents that probably earn in the low um
 
06:30:51.670 --> 06:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
hundreds or higher double
 
06:30:55.708 --> 06:30:55.718 align:start position:0%
digits this is for the children that
 
06:30:57.070 --> 06:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
and we have to remember that that this
 
06:30:58.990 --> 06:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
is for the individual child don't be
 
06:31:01.070 --> 06:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
mistaken this is about equity and
 
06:31:02.788 --> 06:31:02.798 align:start position:0%
inclusion for all especially for
 
06:31:04.750 --> 06:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
students from communities of color and
 
06:31:06.670 --> 06:31:06.680 align:start position:0%
that lens should be used as well when
 
06:31:08.750 --> 06:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
determining the outcome for this Bill
 
06:31:11.190 --> 06:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much shmer I
 
06:31:13.310 --> 06:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
think I met Angel one day up in the
 
06:31:16.788 --> 06:31:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:20.070 --> 06:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
you so you met him well are there any

06:31:40.910 --> 06:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative Heath I'm sorry I didn't

recognize you uh I was looking for
 
06:31:45.510 --> 06:31:45.520 align:start position:0%

representative Cornell for pointing me
 
06:31:59.990 --> 06:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
out in the list um I'm for the record my
 
06:32:01.830 --> 06:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
name is Mary Sullivan Heath and I
 
06:32:05.310 --> 06:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
represent district 14 um in Manchester
 
06:32:10.150 --> 06:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um I'm speaking against
 
06:32:14.388 --> 06:32:14.398 align:start position:0%
House Bill 20 I believe it undermines
 
06:32:18.670 --> 06:32:18.680 align:start position:0%
our public school system I also am
 
06:32:21.270 --> 06:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
deeply troubled by the fact that it
 
06:32:24.310 --> 06:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
takes money from our public schools now
 
06:32:26.910 --> 06:32:26.920 align:start position:0%
we are already have a source of revenue
 
06:32:31.948 --> 06:32:31.958 align:start position:0%
for children who are seeking scholarship
 
06:32:35.590 --> 06:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
programs let's look at how we can Shore
 
06:32:38.430 --> 06:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
that up but don't take money from our
 
06:32:42.670 --> 06:32:42.680 align:start position:0%
Public School System our dollars are so
 
06:32:45.628 --> 06:32:45.638 align:start position:0%
scarce as it is just on the simple
 
06:32:47.750 --> 06:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
calculations that I've done just sitting
 
06:32:48.708 --> 06:32:48.718 align:start position:0%
here and
 
06:32:52.150 --> 06:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
listening homeschoolers are eligible for
 
06:32:55.150 --> 06:32:55.160 align:start position:0%
this program private school students are
 
06:32:59.310 --> 06:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
eligible so we have 6,000 homeschoolers
 
06:33:02.670 --> 06:33:02.680 align:start position:0%
and that's a low number 16,000 private
 
06:33:04.788 --> 06:33:04.798 align:start position:0%
school students that's the potential of
 
06:33:08.310 --> 06:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
22,000 students so that's about $77
 
06:33:10.590 --> 06:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
million that would be new dollars added
 
06:33:13.070 --> 06:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
to our tax burden for the state but I
 
06:33:15.548 --> 06:33:15.558 align:start position:0%
want to go to my city of Manchester so
 
06:33:18.110 --> 06:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
my city of Manchester if we take 100
 
06:33:21.190 --> 06:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
students away from our public
 
06:33:23.548 --> 06:33:23.558 align:start position:0%
schools that will be about
 
06:33:28.350 --> 06:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
$550,000 now we already have are seen a
 
06:33:31.510 --> 06:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
huge drop in enrollment due to covid
 
06:33:33.990 --> 06:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
plus we have a number of charter schools
 
06:33:36.750 --> 06:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
in our city so our numbers have dwindled
 
06:33:39.350 --> 06:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
by a thousand plus the costs that go
 
06:33:42.468 --> 06:33:42.478 align:start position:0%
along with um services for students with
 
06:33:44.030 --> 06:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities within those Charter
 
06:33:46.030 --> 06:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
Schools that's probably about another
 
06:33:48.510 --> 06:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars so those are the the
 
06:33:50.548 --> 06:33:50.558 align:start position:0%
major Financial concerns I have and I
 
06:33:51.990 --> 06:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
just briefly want to talk to the
 
06:33:54.590 --> 06:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
financial note the fiscal note rather
 
06:33:56.590 --> 06:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
now when I looked at the fiscal
 
06:34:00.310 --> 06:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
note the dollars were looked at by the
 
06:34:03.388 --> 06:34:03.398 align:start position:0%
total amount per student and then the
 
06:34:05.350 --> 06:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
adequacy amount was subtracted and the
 
06:34:07.548 --> 06:34:07.558 align:start position:0%
leftover was considered that would
 
06:34:11.388 --> 06:34:11.398 align:start position:0%
benefit the local taxpayers when in fact
 
06:34:14.868 --> 06:34:14.878 align:start position:0%
that really isn't the way it works and I
 
06:34:16.670 --> 06:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
just with all due respect to the
 
06:34:18.788 --> 06:34:18.798 align:start position:0%
commissioner I think his thinking is a
 
06:34:22.548 --> 06:34:22.558 align:start position:0%
little bit flawed on this and I have to
 
06:34:25.230 --> 06:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
say I am so
 
06:34:29.350 --> 06:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
disappointed that in fact we would take
 
06:34:32.230 --> 06:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
the number of dollars away from our
 
06:34:35.150 --> 06:34:35.160 align:start position:0%
public schools that would be considered
 
06:34:38.590 --> 06:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
coming out of this bill especially I was
 
06:34:41.548 --> 06:34:41.558 align:start position:0%
a member of the school um uh Finance
 
06:34:44.070 --> 06:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
funding committee from this Summer that
 
06:34:46.548 --> 06:34:46.558 align:start position:0%
we worked on we saw the inequities
 
06:34:49.150 --> 06:34:49.160 align:start position:0%
across our state that our school
 
06:34:52.948 --> 06:34:52.958 align:start position:0%
districts are faced with with the co the
 
06:34:55.990 --> 06:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
effects of covid with the effects of of
 
06:34:57.948 --> 06:34:57.958 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing with
 
06:35:01.430 --> 06:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
inequities adding the burden of
 
06:35:06.510 --> 06:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
hb20 to our taxpayers base is just
 
06:35:09.468 --> 06:35:09.478 align:start position:0%
unconscionable and I would ask from the
 
06:35:13.628 --> 06:35:13.638 align:start position:0%
bottom of my heart that you please itl
 
06:35:17.150 --> 06:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
this seriously seriously flawed bill I
 
06:35:19.030 --> 06:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to
 
06:35:20.670 --> 06:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
testify thank you very much
 
06:35:22.868 --> 06:35:22.878 align:start position:0%
representative Heath uh are there are
 
06:35:25.750 --> 06:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
there questions for the representative
 
06:35:25.760 --> 06:35:26.830 align:start position:0%
there questions for the representative
thank

06:35:26.830 --> 06:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
06:35:30.430 --> 06:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
you uh next uh indiv oh wait a minute
 
06:35:32.910 --> 06:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
wait a minute represent Leon you have a
 
06:35:35.590 --> 06:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
question um yes thank you Mr chair I did
 
06:35:36.948 --> 06:35:36.958 align:start position:0%
have a question for you representative
 
06:35:39.468 --> 06:35:39.478 align:start position:0%
Heath um I know that you spoke to the
 
06:35:41.270 --> 06:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
challenges that Manchester is facing
 
06:35:43.310 --> 06:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
right now with the declining enrollments
 
06:35:45.270 --> 06:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh is there an issue about not being
 
06:35:48.150 --> 06:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
able to address the um the fixed costs
 
06:35:49.948 --> 06:35:49.958 align:start position:0%
because it seems that the declining
 
06:35:52.468 --> 06:35:52.478 align:start position:0%
student enrollment is an ongoing issue
 
06:35:53.910 --> 06:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
that the taxpayers are going to need to
 
06:35:53.920 --> 06:35:55.830 align:start position:0%
that the taxpayers are going to need to
face

06:35:55.830 --> 06:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
face
 
06:35:59.990 --> 06:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:04.070 --> 06:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
agree and is the I guess um as as we
 
06:36:05.788 --> 06:36:05.798 align:start position:0%
looked to the analysis I actually looked
 
06:36:08.030 --> 06:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Education white
 
06:36:09.670 --> 06:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
paper that they had provided and gone
 
06:36:12.110 --> 06:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
through um have you looked at it and
 
06:36:13.948 --> 06:36:13.958 align:start position:0%
seen that if the schools take three
 
06:36:16.548 --> 06:36:16.558 align:start position:0%
years in order to decrease the amount of
 
06:36:18.350 --> 06:36:18.360 align:start position:0%
spending that they have per student I
 
06:36:20.590 --> 06:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
apologize for my helper um if they spend
 
06:36:22.110 --> 06:36:22.120 align:start position:0%
three years it decrease the amount of
 
06:36:23.788 --> 06:36:23.798 align:start position:0%
time that they have per the amount
 
06:36:25.590 --> 06:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
they're spending per student that this
 
06:36:27.750 --> 06:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
actually will save taxpayers over 10
 
06:36:29.910 --> 06:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
years appro local taxpayers
 
06:36:33.628 --> 06:36:33.638 align:start position:0%
approximately $274 million it is my
 
06:36:37.430 --> 06:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
belief that it will seriously undermine
 
06:36:40.030 --> 06:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
public education further in the city of
 
06:36:42.350 --> 06:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
Manchester I am sorry but I don't agree
 
06:36:44.150 --> 06:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
with your
 
06:36:46.190 --> 06:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
analysis I'm looking for equity for
 
06:36:47.830 --> 06:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
these children I appreciate your your
 
06:36:49.750 --> 06:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
Insight thank you thank thank you very
 
06:36:51.990 --> 06:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
much any further
 
06:36:54.270 --> 06:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
questions represent Hopson next
 
06:36:57.868 --> 06:36:57.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:00.990 --> 06:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
speak next individual is Erica Smith
 
06:37:04.030 --> 06:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
from The Institute of Justice thank
 
06:37:07.590 --> 06:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
you welcome Erica thank you Mr chair
 
06:37:09.868 --> 06:37:09.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me my name is Erica
 
06:37:11.750 --> 06:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
Smith and I'm a senior Attorney At The
 
06:37:13.708 --> 06:37:13.718 align:start position:0%
Institute for justice we are a national
 
06:37:16.310 --> 06:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization and one of my
 
06:37:18.030 --> 06:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
areas of expertise is the
 
06:37:20.110 --> 06:37:20.120 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of school choice
 
06:37:22.270 --> 06:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
programs uh I was also one of the lead
 
06:37:24.430 --> 06:37:24.440 align:start position:0%
attorneys on the US Supreme Court court
 
06:37:26.388 --> 06:37:26.398 align:start position:0%
case that was mentioned earlier espanosa
 
06:37:28.670 --> 06:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
versus Montana Department of Revenue and
 
06:37:31.430 --> 06:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
I could talk about that uh today I could
 
06:37:33.670 --> 06:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
testify that there are no constitutional
 
06:37:36.670 --> 06:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
issues with hb20 either under the
 
06:37:39.230 --> 06:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution or the State
 
06:37:41.830 --> 06:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution and this is especially true
 
06:37:43.788 --> 06:37:43.798 align:start position:0%
after the Espinosa
 
06:37:46.868 --> 06:37:46.878 align:start position:0%
decision in previous sessions there has
 
06:37:49.830 --> 06:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
been some concern that article 83 in the
 
06:37:52.788 --> 06:37:52.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution would operate
 
06:37:55.750 --> 06:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
as a bar to a publicly funded school
 
06:37:58.788 --> 06:37:58.798 align:start position:0%
choice program uh what article 83 pretty
 
06:38:01.510 --> 06:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
much says is that public funds can't go
 
06:38:04.750 --> 06:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
to religious schools now we would argue
 
06:38:06.388 --> 06:38:06.398 align:start position:0%
that there are no public funds going to
 
06:38:08.110 --> 06:38:08.120 align:start position:0%
religious schools under this program
 
06:38:10.190 --> 06:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
instead all the public funds are going
 
06:38:13.548 --> 06:38:13.558 align:start position:0%
to is to parents and not a drop of money
 
06:38:15.910 --> 06:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
winds up at any religious School absent
 
06:38:18.350 --> 06:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
the free and independent choice of
 
06:38:20.670 --> 06:38:20.680 align:start position:0%
families uh but in case there is any
 
06:38:23.468 --> 06:38:23.478 align:start position:0%
doubt about article 83 that doubt has
 
06:38:25.628 --> 06:38:25.638 align:start position:0%
now been resed olved with the Espinosa
 
06:38:29.868 --> 06:38:29.878 align:start position:0%
decision and what Espinosa says is that
 
06:38:32.110 --> 06:38:32.120 align:start position:0%
you cannot interpret a state
 
06:38:34.788 --> 06:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
constitutional provision including the
 
06:38:37.110 --> 06:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
Blain Amendment like in New Hampshire's
 
06:38:39.750 --> 06:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution to exclude religious
 
06:38:42.910 --> 06:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
schools in a school choice program now
 
06:38:44.350 --> 06:38:44.360 align:start position:0%
if some of you here are a little
 
06:38:46.150 --> 06:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
familiar with that decision I can just
 
06:38:49.708 --> 06:38:49.718 align:start position:0%
go into a little more detail on that so
 
06:38:52.750 --> 06:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
Espinosa all started with one woman and
 
06:38:55.868 --> 06:38:55.878 align:start position:0%
that was a mom named Kendra Espinosa
 
06:38:58.270 --> 06:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
she's one of the strongest women that I
 
06:39:00.788 --> 06:39:00.798 align:start position:0%
know uh a few years ago she was
 
06:39:04.270 --> 06:39:04.280 align:start position:0%
homeschooling her two daughters in rural
 
06:39:06.868 --> 06:39:06.878 align:start position:0%
Montana uh everything was going fine
 
06:39:09.310 --> 06:39:09.320 align:start position:0%
until her life was turned upside down
 
06:39:12.388 --> 06:39:12.398 align:start position:0%
when her husband unexpectedly left her
 
06:39:15.868 --> 06:39:15.878 align:start position:0%
and her daughters uh she lost her house
 
06:39:18.510 --> 06:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
she lost everything she had to move into
 
06:39:20.670 --> 06:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
town uh she put her daughters into
 
06:39:23.548 --> 06:39:23.558 align:start position:0%
public school and things were not going
 
06:39:26.270 --> 06:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
good her oldest daughter was getting
 
06:39:28.708 --> 06:39:28.718 align:start position:0%
bullied in school her youngest daughter
 
06:39:31.548 --> 06:39:31.558 align:start position:0%
was falling behind she wasn't able to
 
06:39:34.990 --> 06:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
pay attention her classes but Kendra was
 
06:39:36.830 --> 06:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
barely able to make ends meet she was
 
06:39:39.150 --> 06:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
cleaning houses just to make her pay her
 
06:39:41.750 --> 06:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
bills and she had no idea how she could
 
06:39:44.708 --> 06:39:44.718 align:start position:0%
possibly afford anything besides the
 
06:39:44.718 --> 06:39:45.670 align:start position:0%
possibly afford anything besides the
public

06:39:45.670 --> 06:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
public
 
06:39:49.070 --> 06:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
school uh but one day just on a whim she
 
06:39:52.030 --> 06:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
decided to take a a tour of a Stillwater
 
06:39:53.548 --> 06:39:53.558 align:start position:0%
Christian it was a private school near
 
06:39:54.510 --> 06:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
her home
 
06:39:56.628 --> 06:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
and she fell in love with the school and
 
06:40:00.070 --> 06:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
she desperately wanted her children to
 
06:40:03.190 --> 06:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
be able to attend um
 
06:40:05.510 --> 06:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
she she tried to think of whatever she
 
06:40:07.510 --> 06:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
could to to make extra money to pay the
 
06:40:10.230 --> 06:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
tuition she took on EX oh I'm apologize
 
06:40:13.388 --> 06:40:13.398 align:start position:0%
about my phone uh she took on extra jobs
 
06:40:15.230 --> 06:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
trying to clean houses her daughters
 
06:40:17.948 --> 06:40:17.958 align:start position:0%
were chipping in mowing lawns shoveling
 
06:40:20.350 --> 06:40:20.360 align:start position:0%
snow she even had a fundraiser with
 
06:40:22.708 --> 06:40:22.718 align:start position:0%
handmade quilts to raise the tuition
 
06:40:24.910 --> 06:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
money and Fin finally after all of this
 
06:40:26.750 --> 06:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
she was able to raise just enough to
 
06:40:29.548 --> 06:40:29.558 align:start position:0%
make up half of the tuition uh
 
06:40:31.510 --> 06:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
fortunately the school was able to pay
 
06:40:34.910 --> 06:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
for the rest um but and she was able to
 
06:40:39.030 --> 06:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
put her children into the school but as
 
06:40:40.868 --> 06:40:40.878 align:start position:0%
Kendra was going to sleep that night
 
06:40:42.708 --> 06:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
think like thinking how am I going to be
 
06:40:45.070 --> 06:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
able to afford this every single
 
06:40:47.030 --> 06:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
semester this is crazy what if my car
 
06:40:49.430 --> 06:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
breaks down and that's when Montana
 
06:40:52.548 --> 06:40:52.558 align:start position:0%
passed their first school choice program
 
06:40:54.270 --> 06:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
and this program was going to be the
 
06:40:56.510 --> 06:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
Lifesaver for Kendra and so many other
 
06:40:58.310 --> 06:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
families across the state that didn't
 
06:41:00.388 --> 06:41:00.398 align:start position:0%
have the money to pay for the private
 
06:41:02.110 --> 06:41:02.120 align:start position:0%
school that they so desperately wanted
 
06:41:06.628 --> 06:41:06.638 align:start position:0%
to go to this uh this program was
 
06:41:09.670 --> 06:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
designed to help exactly those families
 
06:41:13.388 --> 06:41:13.398 align:start position:0%
but politics got in the way and the
 
06:41:14.868 --> 06:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
agency that was in charge of
 
06:41:16.708 --> 06:41:16.718 align:start position:0%
administrating the program decided to
 
06:41:18.628 --> 06:41:18.638 align:start position:0%
exclude religious schools from the
 
06:41:21.030 --> 06:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
program uh and they Justified that on
 
06:41:22.868 --> 06:41:22.878 align:start position:0%
Montana's Blain Amendment which is very
 
06:41:24.670 --> 06:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
similar to New Hampshire
 
06:41:26.788 --> 06:41:26.798 align:start position:0%
so we challenged this in court it went
 
06:41:29.270 --> 06:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
all the way up to the US Supreme Court
 
06:41:32.150 --> 06:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
and the Court ruled unequivocally that
 
06:41:35.548 --> 06:41:35.558 align:start position:0%
you cannot interpret Blain amendments uh
 
06:41:36.590 --> 06:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
whether you're talking about the one in
 
06:41:38.670 --> 06:41:38.680 align:start position:0%
Montana or in New Hampshire or anywhere
 
06:41:41.150 --> 06:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
else to exclude religious schools from a
 
06:41:43.548 --> 06:41:43.558 align:start position:0%
program to do that would violate the
 
06:41:46.868 --> 06:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
free exercise rights of families and
 
06:41:49.270 --> 06:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
schools it violates the free exercise
 
06:41:50.868 --> 06:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
rights of families because you're
 
06:41:52.948 --> 06:41:52.958 align:start position:0%
putting parents in a position to choose
 
06:41:55.230 --> 06:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
between following the religious beliefs
 
06:41:58.310 --> 06:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
on one hand and choosing to obtain a
 
06:42:00.310 --> 06:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
government benefit and you can't make
 
06:42:01.830 --> 06:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
parents choose between their beliefs and
 
06:42:03.350 --> 06:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
a benefit so that's
 
06:42:05.670 --> 06:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and it's Al also would
 
06:42:07.990 --> 06:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
discriminate against religious schools
 
06:42:09.670 --> 06:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
because you are excluding them from
 
06:42:11.990 --> 06:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
participating in a program based solely
 
06:42:15.190 --> 06:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
on their religious status so after
 
06:42:17.190 --> 06:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
espanosa uh New Hampshire's Blain
 
06:42:18.910 --> 06:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
amendment can no longer be interpreted
 
06:42:21.190 --> 06:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
to Bar religious schools from
 
06:42:23.350 --> 06:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
participating in this program I
 
06:42:25.590 --> 06:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
encourage you to pass this bill I think
 
06:42:27.628 --> 06:42:27.638 align:start position:0%
it's an excellent Bill and it would help
 
06:42:30.070 --> 06:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
thousands of kids across the state so
 
06:42:32.750 --> 06:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much Miss Smith
 
06:42:34.708 --> 06:42:34.718 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
06:42:34.718 --> 06:42:37.070 align:start position:0%
are there any
questions

06:42:37.070 --> 06:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:42:37.080 --> 06:42:40.590 align:start position:0%
questions
yes

06:42:40.590 --> 06:42:40.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:40.600 --> 06:42:42.430 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:42:42.430 --> 06:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:42:44.788 --> 06:42:44.798 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chairman and
 
06:42:47.230 --> 06:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Smith for your testimony
 
06:42:48.750 --> 06:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind I might ask you a
 
06:42:50.510 --> 06:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
legal question it sounds like you have
 
06:42:54.030 --> 06:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
some background in that area um whether
 
06:42:56.110 --> 06:42:56.120 align:start position:0%
or not some version of this eventually
 
06:42:58.590 --> 06:42:58.600 align:start position:0%
moves forward or not say something did
 
06:43:01.548 --> 06:43:01.558 align:start position:0%
move forward uh I think most of us
 
06:43:02.830 --> 06:43:02.840 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
06:43:06.670 --> 06:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
Espinosa that precedent uh is going to
 
06:43:09.510 --> 06:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
eventually negate the article 83 issu
 
06:43:13.548 --> 06:43:13.558 align:start position:0%
new Hamp but that said uh say something
 
06:43:16.350 --> 06:43:16.360 align:start position:0%
passed uh at some point along these
 
06:43:19.230 --> 06:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
lines uh that would not preclude a
 
06:43:22.030 --> 06:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
lawsuit uh citing article
 
06:43:25.150 --> 06:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
83 uh it in challenging this measure is
 
06:43:26.910 --> 06:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
that fair to say that even though
 
06:43:30.910 --> 06:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
espanosa is is is happened uh there
 
06:43:34.468 --> 06:43:34.478 align:start position:0%
could very well still be uh a suit
 
06:43:36.030 --> 06:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
against this in New Hampshire citing
 
06:43:37.670 --> 06:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
article 83
 
06:43:40.230 --> 06:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
correct it's certainly possible but that
 
06:43:42.388 --> 06:43:42.398 align:start position:0%
lawsuit would be frivolous and if that
 
06:43:45.788 --> 06:43:45.798 align:start position:0%
lawsuit were to occur uh my Law Firm
 
06:43:48.230 --> 06:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
would step up to help defend the program
 
06:43:50.708 --> 06:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
we operate free of charge we actually uh
 
06:43:53.030 --> 06:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
helped protect uh New Hampshire's tax
 
06:43:55.310 --> 06:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
credit program back in 2014 when that
 
06:43:57.750 --> 06:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
program was challenged so we would be
 
06:44:00.548 --> 06:44:00.558 align:start position:0%
there to help defend this program in one
 
06:44:04.430 --> 06:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
followup yes you may uh so let me ask
 
06:44:06.510 --> 06:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
you this because you you
 
06:44:10.070 --> 06:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
know much more than most of us uh if
 
06:44:13.230 --> 06:44:13.240 align:start position:0%
there was a lawsuit could there be some
 
06:44:16.110 --> 06:44:16.120 align:start position:0%
sort of an injunction that would uh that
 
06:44:18.510 --> 06:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
would stall the program while the suit
 
06:44:21.548 --> 06:44:21.558 align:start position:0%
was being heard I think that would be
 
06:44:25.230 --> 06:44:25.240 align:start position:0%
extremely unlikely um because to impo
 
06:44:27.150 --> 06:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
for a court to impose an injunction they
 
06:44:29.388 --> 06:44:29.398 align:start position:0%
would have to be the court would have to
 
06:44:32.310 --> 06:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
be going against Supreme Court president
 
06:44:33.948 --> 06:44:33.958 align:start position:0%
and I don't think any trial court is
 
06:44:36.670 --> 06:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
going to want to do that uh if in the
 
06:44:38.548 --> 06:44:38.558 align:start position:0%
unlikely event that were to happen we
 
06:44:40.750 --> 06:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
would immediately appeal and the
 
06:44:43.110 --> 06:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
injunction would be very
 
06:44:45.590 --> 06:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
short-lived thank you very
 
06:44:50.948 --> 06:44:50.958 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much uh uh uh let me
 
06:44:54.788 --> 06:44:54.798 align:start position:0%
get this Erica Smith I know my computer
 
06:44:57.430 --> 06:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
was messing me up Erica appreciate are
 
06:44:58.868 --> 06:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
there further
 
06:45:02.430 --> 06:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
questions oh oh yep represent like
 
06:45:06.030 --> 06:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
us yes am I to understand that if this
 
06:45:12.230 --> 06:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
bill were to be amended such that um we
 
06:45:14.590 --> 06:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
disqualified religious schools from it
 
06:45:16.430 --> 06:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
that it would be unconstitutional at
 
06:45:18.628 --> 06:45:18.638 align:start position:0%
that point yes that's
 
06:45:22.468 --> 06:45:22.478 align:start position:0%
correct thank you thank you further
 
06:45:25.270 --> 06:45:25.280 align:start position:0%

speaking in opposition to
 
06:47:03.948 --> 06:47:03.958 align:start position:0%
hb20 uh I have many issues with the bill
 
06:47:06.150 --> 06:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh but for personal knowledge I want to
 
06:47:09.670 --> 06:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
speak about the uh discrimination
 
06:47:11.590 --> 06:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
issue in
 
06:47:15.070 --> 06:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
2017 a transgender student was expelled
 
06:47:17.750 --> 06:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
from a local religious school the
 
06:47:19.628 --> 06:47:19.638 align:start position:0%
student had attended the school since
 
06:47:21.670 --> 06:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
kindergarten and was on track to
 
06:47:24.990 --> 06:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
graduate as valedictorian of his class
 
06:47:26.708 --> 06:47:26.718 align:start position:0%
when he talked to the Headmaster about
 
06:47:28.830 --> 06:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
some of his issues he was immediately
 
06:47:32.350 --> 06:47:32.360 align:start position:0%
banned from campus and thrown out um
 
06:47:33.868 --> 06:47:33.878 align:start position:0%
fortunately he was able to go to a
 
06:47:35.590 --> 06:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
public high school and graduate and go
 
06:47:38.750 --> 06:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
on to college this was very upsetting to
 
06:47:41.548 --> 06:47:41.558 align:start position:0%
me and my constituents and so I followed
 
06:47:44.830 --> 06:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
up I contacted the uh commissioner's
 
06:47:48.788 --> 06:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
office I contacted the Dr Dr and so on
 
06:47:50.388 --> 06:47:50.398 align:start position:0%
and the response was there was nothing
 
06:47:52.388 --> 06:47:52.398 align:start position:0%
that could be done that there was no
 
06:47:54.750 --> 06:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over these schools and that
 
06:47:58.430 --> 06:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
they could receive uh public funds uh
 
06:47:58.440 --> 06:47:59.310 align:start position:0%
they could receive uh public funds uh
since

06:47:59.310 --> 06:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
since
 
06:48:02.030 --> 06:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
2017 this local religious school has
 
06:48:06.070 --> 06:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:09.270 --> 06:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
year so I'm very concerned that schools
 
06:48:11.468 --> 06:48:11.478 align:start position:0%
that get state aid do not have to follow
 
06:48:14.868 --> 06:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
any anti-discrimination laws I know that
 
06:48:17.548 --> 06:48:17.558 align:start position:0%
not all of the private religious schools
 
06:48:19.510 --> 06:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh will discriminate there are many
 
06:48:22.510 --> 06:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
great schools in both categories um but
 
06:48:25.628 --> 06:48:25.638 align:start position:0%
I just don't see how we can pass a bill
 
06:48:28.548 --> 06:48:28.558 align:start position:0%
um that allows schools to discriminate
 
06:48:31.590 --> 06:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
and give them funds uh previous people
 
06:48:33.030 --> 06:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
have already mentioned some of the
 
06:48:34.830 --> 06:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
sections in the bill that seem to
 
06:48:38.070 --> 06:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
protect religious schools and um I think
 
06:48:40.510 --> 06:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
it was that line 27 on page eight a
 
06:48:43.910 --> 06:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
couple of them um but I know uh uh time
 
06:48:45.830 --> 06:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
is brief so I'll end with that
 
06:48:45.840 --> 06:48:48.030 align:start position:0%
is brief so I'll end with that
particular

06:48:48.030 --> 06:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
particular
 
06:48:50.270 --> 06:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
piece thank you very much uh
 
06:48:52.468 --> 06:48:52.478 align:start position:0%

Hopson and thank you Mr chair I just
 
06:49:25.548 --> 06:49:25.558 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak on behalf of my
 
06:49:27.708 --> 06:49:27.718 align:start position:0%
constituents I represent C Brook and
 
06:49:30.030 --> 06:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
Hampton Falls and I want to speak in
 
06:49:32.030 --> 06:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
support of
 
06:49:35.190 --> 06:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
hb20 um you know I've heard Universal
 
06:49:37.590 --> 06:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
support and it's one of um if not the
 
06:49:39.750 --> 06:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
issue I've heard the most feedback from
 
06:49:43.708 --> 06:49:43.718 align:start position:0%
so far um and from all kinds of
 
06:49:45.750 --> 06:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
different families from families at home
 
06:49:47.628 --> 06:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
school to public school to private
 
06:49:49.868 --> 06:49:49.878 align:start position:0%
school and and really what I'm hearing
 
06:49:52.590 --> 06:49:52.600 align:start position:0%
is this is about the individual child
 
06:49:54.548 --> 06:49:54.558 align:start position:0%
this isn't about the institution it
 
06:49:57.270 --> 06:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
isn't about the system of public versus
 
06:49:59.948 --> 06:49:59.958 align:start position:0%
private but families just want the best
 
06:50:02.070 --> 06:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
education for their child and in
 
06:50:03.628 --> 06:50:03.638 align:start position:0%
particular Seabrook New Hampshire which
 
06:50:05.910 --> 06:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
makes up the brunt of my district is a
 
06:50:08.548 --> 06:50:08.558 align:start position:0%
disproportionately lowincome community
 
06:50:11.150 --> 06:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
where really hp20 what it's designed to
 
06:50:14.590 --> 06:50:14.600 align:start position:0%
do is to provide um equality to provide
 
06:50:17.750 --> 06:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
inclusion to give um these families and
 
06:50:21.230 --> 06:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately these kids um more options um
 
06:50:23.590 --> 06:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
to pick whatever school choice
 
06:50:25.990 --> 06:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
whatever system is best for them whether
 
06:50:27.990 --> 06:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
it is homeschooling private public it
 
06:50:29.910 --> 06:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter it's about giving them
 
06:50:32.510 --> 06:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
more options that lowincome students
 
06:50:35.510 --> 06:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't always have in um in CBR New
 
06:50:37.468 --> 06:50:37.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that's what I've heard from
 
06:50:39.310 --> 06:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
my community and I just wanted to speak
 
06:50:41.830 --> 06:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
up on behalf of my constituents and I'm
 
06:50:44.070 --> 06:50:44.080 align:start position:0%

committee

06:51:24.708 --> 06:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:51:28.310 --> 06:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
are you there you're
 
06:51:28.320 --> 06:51:30.990 align:start position:0%

muted

06:51:30.990 --> 06:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
muted
 
06:51:33.868 --> 06:51:33.878 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much uh Mr chair
 
06:51:36.548 --> 06:51:36.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative uh
 
06:51:39.110 --> 06:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
res resent Hobson I'm not sure which
 
06:51:40.270 --> 06:51:40.280 align:start position:0%
what office you're actually holding in
 
06:51:41.990 --> 06:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
the committee today which is the clerk
 
06:51:44.310 --> 06:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
whatever anyway so I saw some of this on
 
06:51:46.150 --> 06:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
YouTube and then I popped on the zoom
 
06:51:47.708 --> 06:51:47.718 align:start position:0%
right after my own committee Judiciary
 
06:51:49.750 --> 06:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
finished its hearing so I wish to
 
06:51:54.190 --> 06:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
testify against hb20 um and I know I'm
 
06:51:56.310 --> 06:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
kind of jumping the four again you know
 
06:51:58.948 --> 06:51:58.958 align:start position:0%
the some kind of jumping out of the four
 
06:52:03.070 --> 06:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
against four against pattern so I um um
 
06:52:04.948 --> 06:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
this is a repeat as you probably heard
 
06:52:08.230 --> 06:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
from many people of SB 193 which we
 
06:52:11.270 --> 06:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
dealt with back in 2007 and 2018 even
 
06:52:12.830 --> 06:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
though they changed a lot of it it's the
 
06:52:15.788 --> 06:52:15.798 align:start position:0%
same basic idea it's the same basic uh
 
06:52:19.510 --> 06:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
bad idea and um actually I should take a
 
06:52:21.270 --> 06:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
second to say there's actually a good
 
06:52:23.270 --> 06:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
idea hidden in this which is might not
 
06:52:25.750 --> 06:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
be a terrible it might would be might
 
06:52:28.708 --> 06:52:28.718 align:start position:0%
not be a terrible idea to give every
 
06:52:30.990 --> 06:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
family that's in public or private
 
06:52:33.548 --> 06:52:33.558 align:start position:0%
school like a uh you know small amount
 
06:52:35.468 --> 06:52:35.478 align:start position:0%
of money they can use for additional
 
06:52:37.110 --> 06:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
educational expenses because even if
 
06:52:40.388 --> 06:52:40.398 align:start position:0%
you're in a public school there's things
 
06:52:42.670 --> 06:52:42.680 align:start position:0%
uh parents have to pay for which aren't
 
06:52:44.110 --> 06:52:44.120 align:start position:0%
paid for by the taxpayer but that would
 
06:52:46.868 --> 06:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
be really expensive like do even if you
 
06:52:50.150 --> 06:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
gave everybody like a thousand every kid
 
06:52:52.788 --> 06:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
um you know just $500 a year that's like
 
06:52:56.910 --> 06:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
$ 87.5 million um that's
 
06:52:59.190 --> 06:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
obviously terribly huge amount of money
 
06:53:00.430 --> 06:53:00.440 align:start position:0%
we'd probably even end up with a
 
06:53:02.628 --> 06:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
broad-based income tax we try to do it
 
06:53:05.270 --> 06:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
but this and actually the get back to
 
06:53:06.510 --> 06:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
this idea that's pretty much the same
 
06:53:07.628 --> 06:53:07.638 align:start position:0%
thing we're doing here we're taking all
 
06:53:09.230 --> 06:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
this money away from the public school
 
06:53:09.240 --> 06:53:10.468 align:start position:0%
this money away from the public school
district

06:53:10.468 --> 06:53:10.478 align:start position:0%
district
 
06:53:14.468 --> 06:53:14.478 align:start position:0%
some um so this uh one the biggest
 
06:53:16.990 --> 06:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
problems this program is is that uh it's
 
06:53:19.270 --> 06:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh what I'm picking on is and I hope
 
06:53:21.110 --> 06:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
apologize if I'm repeating it's these
 
06:53:23.628 --> 06:53:23.638 align:start position:0%
two scholarship organizations has
 
06:53:28.948 --> 06:53:28.958 align:start position:0%
approved into RSA 77g 7 RSA 77g is a
 
06:53:30.948 --> 06:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
somewhat simpler much different program
 
06:53:34.388 --> 06:53:34.398 align:start position:0%
than what this uh hb20 envisions and
 
06:53:37.030 --> 06:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
hb77 forg already offers very little
 
06:53:38.230 --> 06:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
oversight of these scholarship
 
06:53:41.388 --> 06:53:41.398 align:start position:0%
organization so they I don't think they
 
06:53:42.750 --> 06:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
are even covered by the usual
 
06:53:45.750 --> 06:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
boilerplate language about giving the uh
 
06:53:47.590 --> 06:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
joint legislative committee on rules
 
06:53:49.350 --> 06:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over the rules for it so
 
06:53:52.750 --> 06:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
these uh you know we these organizations
 
06:53:54.030 --> 06:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
are pretty much operating totally on
 
06:53:55.190 --> 06:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
their own which
 
06:53:57.468 --> 06:53:57.478 align:start position:0%
is uh well it's bad enough just with
 
06:53:59.670 --> 06:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
this the existing tax redit program but
 
06:54:01.430 --> 06:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
that's a very tiny program which by the
 
06:54:03.910 --> 06:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
way entirely goes almost entirely
 
06:54:05.868 --> 06:54:05.878 align:start position:0%
towards religious schools which I still
 
06:54:08.708 --> 06:54:08.718 align:start position:0%
think is unconstitutional so those
 
06:54:10.628 --> 06:54:10.638 align:start position:0%
organization current those organizations
 
06:54:12.150 --> 06:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
their current form are really not
 
06:54:13.628 --> 06:54:13.638 align:start position:0%
equipped to run a very complicated
 
06:54:15.510 --> 06:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
program which that might serve tens of
 
06:54:17.468 --> 06:54:17.478 align:start position:0%
thousands of families I believe there's
 
06:54:20.030 --> 06:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
175,000 kids in school I think possibly
 
06:54:21.670 --> 06:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
a very large percentage of the families
 
06:54:24.590 --> 06:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
might be interested in that which that
 
06:54:27.708 --> 06:54:27.718 align:start position:0%
sounds like um to name you know to name
 
06:54:29.190 --> 06:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
just one of many complications The
 
06:54:31.190 --> 06:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
Proposal hb20 would
 
06:54:34.468 --> 06:54:34.478 align:start position:0%
require uh someone and it's not exactly
 
06:54:36.948 --> 06:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
clear who to issue EBT cards or the
 
06:54:39.150 --> 06:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
equivalent to every participating family
 
06:54:41.190 --> 06:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
um and that'll be very similar to
 
06:54:45.628 --> 06:54:45.638 align:start position:0%
existing um cash benefits and S U SNAP
 
06:54:47.910 --> 06:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
program or better known as food stamps
 
06:54:50.830 --> 06:54:50.840 align:start position:0%
which is something that we
 
06:54:53.510 --> 06:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
occasionally often becomes a controversy
 
06:54:56.030 --> 06:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
here in conquered or right now virtual
 
06:55:00.030 --> 06:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
conquered um they're overseen by a whole
 
06:55:01.468 --> 06:55:01.478 align:start position:0%
at least I assume these people are
 
06:55:03.110 --> 06:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
working remotely but normally they
 
06:55:05.190 --> 06:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
there's an entire floor at the DHS
 
06:55:06.590 --> 06:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
headquarters full of state public
 
06:55:08.830 --> 06:55:08.840 align:start position:0%
servants who administer that program
 
06:55:11.070 --> 06:55:11.080 align:start position:0%
there's a whole another floor full a few
 
06:55:13.510 --> 06:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
blocks away a very nice office which is
 
06:55:17.110 --> 06:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
a uh contractor which helps administer
 
06:55:18.628 --> 06:55:18.638 align:start position:0%
the program and then there's federal
 
06:55:21.830 --> 06:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
employees there like you know there's
 
06:55:23.788 --> 06:55:23.798 align:start position:0%
probably dozen about hundreds of people
 
06:55:26.708 --> 06:55:26.718 align:start position:0%
who administer program so uh last time
 
06:55:28.948 --> 06:55:28.958 align:start position:0%
around far as I could tell and I listen
 
06:55:31.670 --> 06:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
to lots of testimony um the house
 
06:55:33.708 --> 06:55:33.718 align:start position:0%
finance committee had many many hearings
 
06:55:36.510 --> 06:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
about it uh which I sat on on some of
 
06:55:37.830 --> 06:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
they were apparently planning to account
 
06:55:39.388 --> 06:55:39.398 align:start position:0%
handle their accounts payable and
 
06:55:40.788 --> 06:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
receivable function by using intern with
 
06:55:43.468 --> 06:55:43.478 align:start position:0%
a spreadsheet so if you have a
 
06:55:44.990 --> 06:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
meaningful program like this that's
 
06:55:48.270 --> 06:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
going to take a very large uh it's going
 
06:55:49.590 --> 06:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
to take a very large institution to
 
06:55:52.270 --> 06:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
oversee that's a very complex process
 
06:55:53.830 --> 06:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know dealing with all the deciding
 
06:55:55.070 --> 06:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
what's to valid
 
06:55:57.070 --> 06:55:57.080 align:start position:0%
educational expenditure I mean it is
 
06:55:58.990 --> 06:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
true that the way this is written just
 
06:56:00.708 --> 06:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
about any parent could spend this money
 
06:56:03.430 --> 06:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
just about anything that's like even
 
06:56:05.510 --> 06:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
remotely an educational expense so
 
06:56:09.510 --> 06:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's uh and uh just reminding what I
 
06:56:11.350 --> 06:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
said before if we gave every gave us
 
06:56:13.948 --> 06:56:13.958 align:start position:0%
every child that would be very expensive
 
06:56:15.590 --> 06:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
and huge program and I think for this to
 
06:56:16.830 --> 06:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
work it would have to be very expensive
 
06:56:18.670 --> 06:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
and huge program and uh that would be
 
06:56:18.680 --> 06:56:19.990 align:start position:0%
and huge program and uh that would be
one

06:56:19.990 --> 06:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
one
 
06:56:22.750 --> 06:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
thing if there was a valid if it was a
 
06:56:25.430 --> 06:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
good good idea basic idea was a good
 
06:56:27.388 --> 06:56:27.398 align:start position:0%
behind it but the basic idea behind this
 
06:56:29.270 --> 06:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
ver this plan is just it's not a bad
 
06:56:30.948 --> 06:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
idea it's a bad implementation of a bad
 
06:56:33.190 --> 06:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
idea I think it's totally unsalvageable
 
06:56:35.468 --> 06:56:35.478 align:start position:0%
so I would U urge you me to find this
 
06:56:39.430 --> 06:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
real itl as soon as possible and then um
 
06:56:43.430 --> 06:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
you know when we meet together uh rumors
 
06:56:45.270 --> 06:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
are it's in February sometime late
 
06:56:47.788 --> 06:56:47.798 align:start position:0%
February Let's uh let's let's kill it
 
06:56:50.190 --> 06:56:50.200 align:start position:0%
let's put this idea the you know let's
 
06:56:52.708 --> 06:56:52.718 align:start position:0%
put it aside for now I'm sure one of
 
06:56:53.910 --> 06:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
those things that just keeps coming back
 
06:56:55.388 --> 06:56:55.398 align:start position:0%
every year I'm sure somebody will come
 
06:56:57.030 --> 06:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
up in another form but like this is just
 
06:56:58.628 --> 06:56:58.638 align:start position:0%
not worth working I think it's not worth
 
06:57:00.150 --> 06:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
the education committee's time working
 
06:57:02.230 --> 06:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
on it certainly isn't worth the second
 
06:57:03.750 --> 06:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
committee which be financed so I just
 
06:57:05.190 --> 06:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
think you it's a bad idea it's
 
06:57:08.708 --> 06:57:08.718 align:start position:0%
unsalvageable and uh it would be way it'
 
06:57:10.708 --> 06:57:10.718 align:start position:0%
be extremely expensive if you Tred to
 
06:57:13.788 --> 06:57:13.798 align:start position:0%
try to implement it so those are I'm
 
06:57:15.350 --> 06:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
going to join and many of those say
 
06:57:17.788 --> 06:57:17.798 align:start position:0%
please find this inexpedient to
 
06:57:17.798 --> 06:57:21.388 align:start position:0%
please find this inexpedient to
legislate

06:57:21.388 --> 06:57:21.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:21.398 --> 06:57:23.150 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

06:57:23.150 --> 06:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
06:57:24.670 --> 06:57:24.680 align:start position:0%

07:00:06.628 --> 07:00:06.638 align:start position:0%
of my
 
07:00:10.948 --> 07:00:10.958 align:start position:0%
testimony um I'm uh a former School
 
07:00:13.350 --> 07:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
Board member in in penbroke and I am
 
07:00:16.150 --> 07:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
currently on the budget committee so I
 
07:00:18.990 --> 07:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
have a little experience in the area um
 
07:00:21.150 --> 07:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
but I'm speaking as an individual and I
 
07:00:22.788 --> 07:00:22.798 align:start position:0%
just want to
 
07:00:25.110 --> 07:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
take my town as a good example we are
 
07:00:29.030 --> 07:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
struggling to keep solvent we cannot
 
07:00:32.468 --> 07:00:32.478 align:start position:0%
afford to lose more money we are losing
 
07:00:32.478 --> 07:00:33.830 align:start position:0%
afford to lose more money we are losing
about

07:00:33.830 --> 07:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:00:37.468 --> 07:00:37.478 align:start position:0%
$800,000 in state revenue over
 
07:00:41.670 --> 07:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
2122 we are looking at a h tax increase
 
07:00:45.708 --> 07:00:45.718 align:start position:0%
of right now A little over 8% which is
 
07:00:47.670 --> 07:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
going to hurt an awful lot of people in
 
07:00:50.110 --> 07:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
this town and that only came about
 
07:00:54.110 --> 07:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
because our school uh schools cut
 
07:00:56.948 --> 07:00:56.958 align:start position:0%
$700,000 out of their proposed
 
07:01:00.468 --> 07:01:00.478 align:start position:0%
budget we need to focus
 
07:01:03.910 --> 07:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
on better funding public schools and we
 
07:01:05.868 --> 07:01:05.878 align:start position:0%
can't afford to be giving money away to
 
07:01:07.590 --> 07:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
private schools I have nothing against
 
07:01:10.150 --> 07:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
private schools I'm a product of private
 
07:01:14.590 --> 07:01:14.600 align:start position:0%
school my my children are graduates of a
 
07:01:16.628 --> 07:01:16.638 align:start position:0%
private high school I have all due
 
07:01:19.708 --> 07:01:19.718 align:start position:0%
respect for private schools but I see no
 
07:01:21.548 --> 07:01:21.558 align:start position:0%
need for this state to be spending money
 
07:01:25.430 --> 07:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
to support them um we are in trouble in
 
07:01:29.310 --> 07:01:29.320 align:start position:0%

Nelson for
 
07:07:50.548 --> 07:07:50.558 align:start position:0%
Testimony can you identify uh your
 
07:07:52.350 --> 07:07:52.360 align:start position:0%
Association please
 
07:07:54.190 --> 07:07:54.200 align:start position:0%
yes thank you first of all I'd like to
 
07:07:56.110 --> 07:07:56.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak I've
 
07:07:58.788 --> 07:07:58.798 align:start position:0%
been waiting almost four hours I am not
 
07:08:02.310 --> 07:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
a lobbyist I have no agenda I am a
 
07:08:05.590 --> 07:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
citizen of New Hampshire and I am a
 
07:08:07.868 --> 07:08:07.878 align:start position:0%
parent but my children are in their 30s
 
07:08:09.510 --> 07:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
they've gone through Public School in
 
07:08:12.990 --> 07:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
Handover where I live and I thank you
 
07:08:15.788 --> 07:08:15.798 align:start position:0%
for allowing me this time to speak in
 
07:08:17.548 --> 07:08:17.558 align:start position:0%
opposition to
 
07:08:20.990 --> 07:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
hb20 I appreciate that some are eager to
 
07:08:23.628 --> 07:08:23.638 align:start position:0%
recogn Iz the late speaker dick hinch
 
07:08:26.190 --> 07:08:26.200 align:start position:0%
but I do not think this is an
 
07:08:29.910 --> 07:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to do so and I also
 
07:08:32.468 --> 07:08:32.478 align:start position:0%
think it was disingenuous of the
 
07:08:35.548 --> 07:08:35.558 align:start position:0%
commissioner to suggest that criticizing
 
07:08:38.948 --> 07:08:38.958 align:start position:0%
this bill is to criticize public
 
07:08:41.350 --> 07:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
education in New Hampshire I thought
 
07:08:42.670 --> 07:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
that was
 
07:08:45.708 --> 07:08:45.718 align:start position:0%
unfortunate I think we can all agree to
 
07:08:48.270 --> 07:08:48.280 align:start position:0%
the importance of careful Financial
 
07:08:51.788 --> 07:08:51.798 align:start position:0%
scrutiny over the dollars we spend and
 
07:08:54.628 --> 07:08:54.638 align:start position:0%
yet this bill provides absolutely no
 
07:08:57.990 --> 07:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
oversight or accountability as has been
 
07:08:58.000 --> 07:08:59.350 align:start position:0%
oversight or accountability as has been
repeatedly

07:08:59.350 --> 07:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
repeatedly
 
07:09:03.430 --> 07:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
said I hope we can all agree that a
 
07:09:06.708 --> 07:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
proud moment in our history was the
 
07:09:09.788 --> 07:09:09.798 align:start position:0%
establishment of public schools to
 
07:09:12.590 --> 07:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
educate our nation's children so that
 
07:09:14.910 --> 07:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
they would be informed
 
07:09:17.628 --> 07:09:17.638 align:start position:0%
citizens and yet this bill most
 
07:09:20.670 --> 07:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
certainly dismantles public education in
 
07:09:22.150 --> 07:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
07:09:25.350 --> 07:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
and I fear it opens us to National
 
07:09:29.350 --> 07:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
ridicule we can all agree that parents
 
07:09:31.708 --> 07:09:31.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely have the right to put their
 
07:09:35.708 --> 07:09:35.718 align:start position:0%
children into private and religious
 
07:09:39.548 --> 07:09:39.558 align:start position:0%
schools but that should not be paid for
 
07:09:42.590 --> 07:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
with taxpayer dollars nor should it
 
07:09:45.030 --> 07:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
increase the cost of public education
 
07:09:47.310 --> 07:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
for local
 
07:09:50.310 --> 07:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
communities because of these significant
 
07:09:53.590 --> 07:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
problems I urge you to vote against this
 
07:09:57.190 --> 07:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
bill which I think is better named the
 
07:10:01.910 --> 07:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
public education dismantling account or
 
07:10:05.310 --> 07:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
the private school account thank you
 
07:10:08.310 --> 07:10:08.320 align:start position:0%

Hampshire um so I want to start by
 
07:11:28.230 --> 07:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
saying I appreciate this opportunity to
 
07:11:31.270 --> 07:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
provide my testimony in support of the
 
07:11:33.670 --> 07:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
educational Freedom accounts as outlined
 
07:11:35.230 --> 07:11:35.240 align:start position:0%
in House Bill
 
07:11:37.868 --> 07:11:37.878 align:start position:0%
20 I have to be honest that I have
 
07:11:41.150 --> 07:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
learned so much because of this pandemic
 
07:11:43.150 --> 07:11:43.160 align:start position:0%
but most importantly from the handling
 
07:11:45.190 --> 07:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
of this pandemic by our Administration
 
07:11:47.830 --> 07:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
here in NASA our Board of Education and
 
07:11:50.868 --> 07:11:50.878 align:start position:0%
our Department of Public Health you see
 
07:11:53.628 --> 07:11:53.638 align:start position:0%
the nsha school district is one of the
 
07:11:56.388 --> 07:11:56.398 align:start position:0%
only school districts in New Hampshire
 
07:11:59.070 --> 07:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
in which we have not returned to any
 
07:12:01.270 --> 07:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
inperson learning capacity since March
 
07:12:01.280 --> 07:12:02.868 align:start position:0%
inperson learning capacity since March
of

07:12:02.868 --> 07:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:12:07.110 --> 07:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
2020 many of our children teachers
 
07:12:09.750 --> 07:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
administrators and much of our community
 
07:12:12.388 --> 07:12:12.398 align:start position:0%
overall have been paused while many
 
07:12:15.590 --> 07:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
other cities towns and states around us
 
07:12:18.270 --> 07:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
created plans for implementation to get
 
07:12:20.388 --> 07:12:20.398 align:start position:0%
the children who needed in person back
 
07:12:21.910 --> 07:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
into school
 
07:12:24.270 --> 07:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
our children here in nashaa are at a
 
07:12:27.430 --> 07:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
significant disadvantage and are now set
 
07:12:30.590 --> 07:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
apart from their peers as a result of
 
07:12:33.910 --> 07:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
the public education system now I have
 
07:12:36.670 --> 07:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
to be honest I'm in full support of the
 
07:12:39.388 --> 07:12:39.398 align:start position:0%
public education system but because of
 
07:12:40.990 --> 07:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
the handling of this pandemic the
 
07:12:42.788 --> 07:12:42.798 align:start position:0%
refusal to reopen the Nashville school
 
07:12:44.788 --> 07:12:44.798 align:start position:0%
district and those who are not doing
 
07:12:47.150 --> 07:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
well in remote learning it has given me
 
07:12:51.590 --> 07:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
a taxpayer the utmost buyer remorse what
 
07:12:54.270 --> 07:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
exactly did our tax dollars go to this
 
07:12:55.628 --> 07:12:55.638 align:start position:0%
year in
 
07:12:58.548 --> 07:12:58.558 align:start position:0%
nashaa after almost a full calendar year
 
07:13:02.150 --> 07:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
of plans negotiations changes to plans
 
07:13:04.230 --> 07:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
horrific Board of Education meetings
 
07:13:06.230 --> 07:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
that I could not even explain to you if
 
07:13:09.750 --> 07:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
I tried uh no resolutions and an
 
07:13:12.030 --> 07:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult time with obtaining
 
07:13:14.990 --> 07:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
a Buy in from our now former
 
07:13:17.030 --> 07:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
superintendent among so many other
 
07:13:19.430 --> 07:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
issues within our public school
 
07:13:21.830 --> 07:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
education system we have yet to make
 
07:13:24.708 --> 07:13:24.718 align:start position:0%
forward PR progress and our district is
 
07:13:27.230 --> 07:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
failing our children yet for months I
 
07:13:30.868 --> 07:13:30.878 align:start position:0%
have not sorry I have not seen a pathway
 
07:13:34.788 --> 07:13:34.798 align:start position:0%
that leads my personal family to Hope
 
07:13:37.230 --> 07:13:37.240 align:start position:0%
here in nasua much of our community has
 
07:13:38.750 --> 07:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
positioned itself to Value the
 
07:13:41.230 --> 07:13:41.240 align:start position:0%
preservation of the institution's
 
07:13:43.468 --> 07:13:43.478 align:start position:0%
reputation and become less focused on
 
07:13:46.150 --> 07:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
the children yet I have to be honest
 
07:13:48.590 --> 07:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
with you all as I sit in front of you
 
07:13:52.590 --> 07:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
today we have not had a choice I know
 
07:13:55.388 --> 07:13:55.398 align:start position:0%
that I personally have not had a choice
 
07:13:57.150 --> 07:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
for my
 
07:13:59.468 --> 07:13:59.478 align:start position:0%
children I have heard so many people
 
07:14:02.070 --> 07:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
mention accountability and
 
07:14:05.030 --> 07:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
spending and I have also heard how this
 
07:14:07.788 --> 07:14:07.798 align:start position:0%
hurts the public school system and in
 
07:14:09.548 --> 07:14:09.558 align:start position:0%
not many of these statements have I
 
07:14:12.868 --> 07:14:12.878 align:start position:0%
heard how this entire process and the
 
07:14:16.430 --> 07:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
lack of choices due to fam's concerns or
 
07:14:18.590 --> 07:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
inabilities to financially make these
 
07:14:21.388 --> 07:14:21.398 align:start position:0%
decisions for their children this is
 
07:14:23.948 --> 07:14:23.958 align:start position:0%
hurting many of our
 
07:14:26.230 --> 07:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
children as a mother of schoolage
 
07:14:27.868 --> 07:14:27.878 align:start position:0%
children both of which within the
 
07:14:30.310 --> 07:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
special education sector the remote
 
07:14:32.350 --> 07:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
learning only model at least here in
 
07:14:35.070 --> 07:14:35.080 align:start position:0%
nasua has forced my family and my
 
07:14:38.788 --> 07:14:38.798 align:start position:0%
children into simply a failed attempt at
 
07:14:41.910 --> 07:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
a one-size fits-all model but it is also
 
07:14:45.948 --> 07:14:45.958 align:start position:0%
a cry it is also a far cry from one size
 
07:14:50.868 --> 07:14:50.878 align:start position:0%
fits most as I stand well Zoom before
 
07:14:53.788 --> 07:14:53.798 align:start position:0%
for you today I hope that my testimony
 
07:14:55.590 --> 07:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
will help for some of you to understand
 
07:14:58.388 --> 07:14:58.398 align:start position:0%
that our world is evolving our children
 
07:15:00.590 --> 07:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
right now at least here in nasua that I
 
07:15:04.750 --> 07:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
can speak to directly many are losing a
 
07:15:07.708 --> 07:15:07.718 align:start position:0%
battle in many places and in many grades
 
07:15:09.388 --> 07:15:09.398 align:start position:0%
in which we are fighting for their
 
07:15:12.350 --> 07:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
comprehension knowledge and an overall
 
07:15:16.350 --> 07:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
suitable education yet it is fiercely
 
07:15:18.548 --> 07:15:18.558 align:start position:0%
inaccurate to Simply expect that there
 
07:15:20.910 --> 07:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
will be only one plausible and Financial
 
07:15:23.628 --> 07:15:23.638 align:start position:0%
option available to our children at
 
07:15:25.510 --> 07:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
least I feel this way about my own
 
07:15:28.310 --> 07:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
children I need to clarify I've heard
 
07:15:33.468 --> 07:15:33.478 align:start position:0%
multiple times today references to RSA
 
07:15:36.190 --> 07:15:36.200 align:start position:0%
1933 although manifest educational
 
07:15:38.830 --> 07:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
hardship is a pathway that my family
 
07:15:40.990 --> 07:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
personally entertained there was a
 
07:15:44.548 --> 07:15:44.558 align:start position:0%
systemic refusal to approve most by our
 
07:15:47.948 --> 07:15:47.958 align:start position:0%
former superintendent so again where
 
07:15:49.910 --> 07:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
were our educational choices for our
 
07:15:49.920 --> 07:15:52.590 align:start position:0%
were our educational choices for our
children

07:15:52.590 --> 07:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
children
 
07:15:54.670 --> 07:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
we have never had a choice here at least
 
07:15:57.230 --> 07:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
in nashaa not for my family that did not
 
07:15:59.468 --> 07:15:59.478 align:start position:0%
financially implicate my family other
 
07:16:02.468 --> 07:16:02.478 align:start position:0%
families and many more I have spoken
 
07:16:04.708 --> 07:16:04.718 align:start position:0%
with and have shared that
 
07:16:06.830 --> 07:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
choosing an alternative learning
 
07:16:08.430 --> 07:16:08.440 align:start position:0%
environment would not be fiscally
 
07:16:11.590 --> 07:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
realistic for myself or for many others
 
07:16:13.670 --> 07:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
where is our choice for other learning
 
07:16:16.788 --> 07:16:16.798 align:start position:0%
models for March to now we have not had
 
07:16:19.628 --> 07:16:19.638 align:start position:0%
one here in nashaa in fact at a pupil
 
07:16:21.548 --> 07:16:21.558 align:start position:0%
cost in a public educ education at are
 
07:16:24.590 --> 07:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
about $20,000 per pupil the city of
 
07:16:28.030 --> 07:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
nasua lost 860 students that is an
 
07:16:28.040 --> 07:16:29.468 align:start position:0%
nasua lost 860 students that is an
estimated

07:16:29.468 --> 07:16:29.478 align:start position:0%
estimated
 
07:16:33.030 --> 07:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
$17.2 million in loss which could have
 
07:16:35.510 --> 07:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
potentially been reallocated to follow
 
07:16:37.628 --> 07:16:37.638 align:start position:0%
the student so that their educational
 
07:16:41.510 --> 07:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
needs were met as a parent who is aware
 
07:16:44.430 --> 07:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
that it is my responsibility to research
 
07:16:47.030 --> 07:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
information assess and review options
 
07:16:49.110 --> 07:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
for my children's
 
07:16:51.350 --> 07:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
learning will there
 
07:16:53.310 --> 07:16:53.320 align:start position:0%
schools that do or do not accept
 
07:16:56.070 --> 07:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
students yes of course however the
 
07:16:58.110 --> 07:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
structure of this bill I would challenge
 
07:17:00.590 --> 07:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
you to view no differently than we would
 
07:17:02.670 --> 07:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
if this were higher education at the
 
07:17:05.388 --> 07:17:05.398 align:start position:0%
Collegiate level admissions requirements
 
07:17:07.628 --> 07:17:07.638 align:start position:0%
academic requirements assessment
 
07:17:09.590 --> 07:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
requirements and all of those things are
 
07:17:11.270 --> 07:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
all part of the selection process and
 
07:17:14.030 --> 07:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
choice options this only gives our
 
07:17:17.270 --> 07:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to use the same model in our
 
07:17:20.030 --> 07:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
primary education system I need to
 
07:17:22.350 --> 07:17:22.360 align:start position:0%
caution those in this meeting that even
 
07:17:23.990 --> 07:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
at the middle school level here in
 
07:17:26.190 --> 07:17:26.200 align:start position:0%
nashaa I would like to put you into my
 
07:17:29.628 --> 07:17:29.638 align:start position:0%
shoes on a rotating block schedule our
 
07:17:32.868 --> 07:17:32.878 align:start position:0%
hours here in nashaa are 9:00 a.m to
 
07:17:36.670 --> 07:17:36.680 align:start position:0%
1:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday now
 
07:17:38.750 --> 07:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
block scheduling is an alternating
 
07:17:42.070 --> 07:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
schedule and Fridays are used for extra
 
07:17:45.510 --> 07:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
help and office hours so in reality our
 
07:17:47.350 --> 07:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
only choice here in NASA within our
 
07:17:49.750 --> 07:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
public school system is two days of
 
07:17:52.270 --> 07:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
instruction consistently for a subject
 
07:17:55.110 --> 07:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
and the loss of Fridays as although
 
07:17:56.868 --> 07:17:56.878 align:start position:0%
they're counted towards instructional
 
07:17:59.510 --> 07:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
hours you see our district and many like
 
07:18:01.590 --> 07:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
it have opted to spend money that was
 
07:18:03.270 --> 07:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
that was previously allocated to our
 
07:18:05.948 --> 07:18:05.958 align:start position:0%
children within the district that is the
 
07:18:08.030 --> 07:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
same means in which our children are
 
07:18:10.830 --> 07:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
failing our taxes increased this year
 
07:18:14.750 --> 07:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
here in NASA due to education yet I must
 
07:18:18.030 --> 07:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
remind you or share with you that our
 
07:18:20.590 --> 07:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
schools remained closed since March of
 
07:18:23.310 --> 07:18:23.320 align:start position:0%
2020 we still pay tax amounts for the
 
07:18:26.468 --> 07:18:26.478 align:start position:0%
utilities janitorial services and other
 
07:18:30.510 --> 07:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous expensive expenses yet our
 
07:18:32.990 --> 07:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
schools remain closed do we not deserve
 
07:18:34.788 --> 07:18:34.798 align:start position:0%
to take the money allocated to our
 
07:18:37.310 --> 07:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
children out of District a district that
 
07:18:40.910 --> 07:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
is proven to fail them well at least my
 
07:18:43.070 --> 07:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
children I would be happy to do the
 
07:18:45.910 --> 07:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
research and choose an alternative model
 
07:18:47.830 --> 07:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
however we don't have that choice right
 
07:18:50.110 --> 07:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
now not financially and not for my
 
07:18:50.120 --> 07:18:51.628 align:start position:0%
now not financially and not for my
family

07:18:51.628 --> 07:18:51.638 align:start position:0%
family
 
07:18:55.030 --> 07:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
the money is lost and simply reallocated
 
07:18:57.190 --> 07:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
to an alternative learning choice would
 
07:19:00.430 --> 07:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
give me an option to help my children I
 
07:19:02.708 --> 07:19:02.718 align:start position:0%
want to conclude my testimony by
 
07:19:04.548 --> 07:19:04.558 align:start position:0%
challenging those in this hearing to
 
07:19:06.830 --> 07:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
think about the number of times you or
 
07:19:08.708 --> 07:19:08.718 align:start position:0%
someone that you know has had to
 
07:19:11.270 --> 07:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
maneuver around red tape for information
 
07:19:13.670 --> 07:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
from a district the number of times that
 
07:19:16.230 --> 07:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
you have had to modify a lesson so your
 
07:19:19.590 --> 07:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
child could comprehend the information
 
07:19:22.150 --> 07:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
or the Heartbreak inly evident reality
 
07:19:24.830 --> 07:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
of having to console a crying child
 
07:19:26.548 --> 07:19:26.558 align:start position:0%
while managing their declining mental
 
07:19:30.350 --> 07:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
health pushing a child to remain engaged
 
07:19:31.788 --> 07:19:31.798 align:start position:0%
while they're staring at a computer
 
07:19:34.350 --> 07:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
screen for over three hours per day I
 
07:19:36.750 --> 07:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
know for me personally this pandemic and
 
07:19:38.788 --> 07:19:38.798 align:start position:0%
the lack of choices has shown me that
 
07:19:40.788 --> 07:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
many educational models lack
 
07:19:43.030 --> 07:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
transparency why are you teaching this
 
07:19:46.310 --> 07:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
information or why is this part of the
 
07:19:48.110 --> 07:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
curriculum there have been so many
 
07:19:51.110 --> 07:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions and I also feel
 
07:19:54.150 --> 07:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
that our public education system should
 
07:19:56.990 --> 07:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
be a you get what you pay for and right
 
07:19:59.510 --> 07:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
now I have to be honest that I feel like
 
07:20:02.270 --> 07:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
our educational tax purchase for the
 
07:20:03.990 --> 07:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
future of my children may have been
 
07:20:05.830 --> 07:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
better spent elsewhere and I would love
 
07:20:08.388 --> 07:20:08.398 align:start position:0%
the choice to be able to determine that
 
07:20:10.190 --> 07:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom accounts in House
 
07:20:12.548 --> 07:20:12.558 align:start position:0%
Bill 20 would enable me to seek
 
07:20:15.230 --> 07:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
alternative Pathways among many others
 
07:20:17.310 --> 07:20:17.320 align:start position:0%
to use children's funds from our
 
07:20:19.788 --> 07:20:19.798 align:start position:0%
generous state government and I beg you
 
07:20:20.910 --> 07:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
to please
 
07:20:23.270 --> 07:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
approve this bill I challenge anyone in
 
07:20:25.430 --> 07:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
the in this hearing to truly approach
 
07:20:28.510 --> 07:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
this with an open mind a levelheaded
 
07:20:30.590 --> 07:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
understanding of how the deficits in the
 
07:20:32.388 --> 07:20:32.398 align:start position:0%
public education system have been
 
07:20:35.270 --> 07:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
showcased specifically as we continue
 
07:20:36.510 --> 07:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
here in
 
07:20:40.230 --> 07:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
covid-19 and just as a Viewpoint from a
 
07:20:42.750 --> 07:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
family to regain their right to choose
 
07:20:44.510 --> 07:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
the best educational model that suits
 
07:20:46.708 --> 07:20:46.718 align:start position:0%
their children a decision that
 
07:20:49.590 --> 07:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
truthfully only a parent or guardian or
 
07:20:51.868 --> 07:20:51.878 align:start position:0%
those respons for their children should
 
07:20:54.350 --> 07:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
be able to make this bill does not force
 
07:20:55.990 --> 07:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
those who wish to remain in public
 
07:20:59.270 --> 07:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
school this does not promote a
 
07:21:02.468 --> 07:21:02.478 align:start position:0%
solitary private school system this is
 
07:21:05.388 --> 07:21:05.398 align:start position:0%
merely an alternative a choice to those
 
07:21:06.830 --> 07:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
families in which the traditional
 
07:21:09.868 --> 07:21:09.878 align:start position:0%
educational model does not work it gives
 
07:21:11.628 --> 07:21:11.638 align:start position:0%
the parents back the choice for their
 
07:21:13.548 --> 07:21:13.558 align:start position:0%
child or their children's educational
 
07:21:16.350 --> 07:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
model thank you so much for your time
 
07:21:19.910 --> 07:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
stay safe stay warm and please take a
 
07:21:22.310 --> 07:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
moment to evaluate put yourself into the
 
07:21:24.110 --> 07:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
shoes of the parents as we are
 
07:21:26.270 --> 07:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
navigating this educational system right
 
07:21:29.468 --> 07:21:29.478 align:start position:0%
now and I beg you please give us our
 
07:21:32.310 --> 07:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
choice thank you for your
 
07:21:34.468 --> 07:21:34.478 align:start position:0%
time thank you very much for your
 
07:21:37.030 --> 07:21:37.040 align:start position:0%

special education services go so I have
 
07:22:05.868 --> 07:22:05.878 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you uh thank you for

your question that's actually a very
 
07:22:11.270 --> 07:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
good question representative luno um the
 
07:22:13.310 --> 07:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
public school school system in the way
 
07:22:14.868 --> 07:22:14.878 align:start position:0%
that it's formatted right now with the
 
07:22:17.510 --> 07:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
special education needs uh there's a
 
07:22:21.708 --> 07:22:21.718 align:start position:0%
large deficit um at at at least here in
 
07:22:25.750 --> 07:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
nashaa with the a availability of means
 
07:22:28.388 --> 07:22:28.398 align:start position:0%
to provide the accommodations and the
 
07:22:30.230 --> 07:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
amount of red tape that you have to
 
07:22:33.868 --> 07:22:33.878 align:start position:0%
encounter in order to have the schools
 
07:22:36.190 --> 07:22:36.200 align:start position:0%
and the educational system follow those
 
07:22:38.628 --> 07:22:38.638 align:start position:0%
from what I've seen within
 
07:22:41.468 --> 07:22:41.478 align:start position:0%
covid-19 it has been my responsibility
 
07:22:44.990 --> 07:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
as the parent to take the lesson plans
 
07:22:49.070 --> 07:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:51.628 --> 07:22:51.638 align:start position:0%
reconformation children will comprehend
 
07:22:54.628 --> 07:22:54.638 align:start position:0%
them so my expectation would be that it
 
07:22:57.110 --> 07:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
would be my responsibility to continue
 
07:23:00.150 --> 07:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
should I make the choice to pursue other
 
07:23:02.350 --> 07:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
opportunities to educate myself on the
 
07:23:04.990 --> 07:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
special education process if need be and
 
07:23:07.270 --> 07:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
to seek out alternative Services there's
 
07:23:09.590 --> 07:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
lots of services that are available for
 
07:23:12.110 --> 07:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
free um United Way has really great
 
07:23:13.788 --> 07:23:13.798 align:start position:0%
services but that would be on me as the
 
07:23:15.910 --> 07:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
parent while I'm making this choice on
 
07:23:18.750 --> 07:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
where the tax dollars are being spent in
 
07:23:21.830 --> 07:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
order to make that decision make that
 
07:23:25.868 --> 07:23:25.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:29.190 --> 07:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
research so just a quick followup Mr
 
07:23:31.070 --> 07:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely just to just to make
 
07:23:33.430 --> 07:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
sure I I understand this and it sounds
 
07:23:36.388 --> 07:23:36.398 align:start position:0%
like you do too that that that um that
 
07:23:39.270 --> 07:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
the NASA School District it should you
 
07:23:43.948 --> 07:23:43.958 align:start position:0%
um uh enter a EFA Pro Voucher Program um
 
07:23:46.590 --> 07:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
uh with a with a with a different um
 
07:23:48.628 --> 07:23:48.638 align:start position:0%
School the nationville school district
 
07:23:50.830 --> 07:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
would no longer have any respon ibility
 
07:23:53.788 --> 07:23:53.798 align:start position:0%
for special education services I'm not
 
07:23:55.270 --> 07:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
quite sure on that answer that's a
 
07:23:58.670 --> 07:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
really great question um I would assume
 
07:24:00.830 --> 07:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
I if I can get your email I can actually
 
07:24:03.150 --> 07:24:03.160 align:start position:0%
find out that information and then I can
 
07:24:05.468 --> 07:24:05.478 align:start position:0%
respond to you if that would be okay no
 
07:24:08.788 --> 07:24:08.798 align:start position:0%
that would be fine um um my emails on
 
07:24:11.230 --> 07:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
you can look me up on the on the general
 
07:24:11.240 --> 07:24:12.150 align:start position:0%
you can look me up on the on the general
court

07:24:12.150 --> 07:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
court
 
07:24:15.350 --> 07:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
website um but the the the bill I think
 
07:24:18.750 --> 07:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
says it that um that that that the that
 
07:24:21.510 --> 07:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
the parent basically has selected uh to
 
07:24:26.868 --> 07:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
Cho to um um well notice under 20 USC
 
07:24:26.878 --> 07:24:27.990 align:start position:0%
Cho to um um well notice under 20 USC
section

07:24:27.990 --> 07:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
section
 
07:24:31.270 --> 07:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
1412 is that the idea the individuals
 
07:24:34.070 --> 07:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
with disabilities Education Act so I
 
07:24:36.670 --> 07:24:36.680 align:start position:0%
think that part of what this choice
 
07:24:40.750 --> 07:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
would do is as communities it would be
 
07:24:43.070 --> 07:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
kind of our responsibility as those
 
07:24:46.750 --> 07:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
within the local levels that we would
 
07:24:50.190 --> 07:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
have to then educate the community on
 
07:24:52.708 --> 07:24:52.718 align:start position:0%
what is this house bill and is it
 
07:24:54.910 --> 07:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
something that would fit for you I don't
 
07:24:57.708 --> 07:24:57.718 align:start position:0%
think that this bill is meant as a one-
 
07:24:59.910 --> 07:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
siiz fits-all I know that for me
 
07:25:01.830 --> 07:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
personally the accommodations that I've
 
07:25:04.270 --> 07:25:04.280 align:start position:0%
found under idea within the public
 
07:25:06.750 --> 07:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
school system and under the Ada for a
 
07:25:10.510 --> 07:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
504 plan they have not been sufficient
 
07:25:12.388 --> 07:25:12.398 align:start position:0%
and I've had to rework the models so
 
07:25:15.628 --> 07:25:15.638 align:start position:0%
maybe I would probably be not a good
 
07:25:18.350 --> 07:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
person to ask that representative luno
 
07:25:20.070 --> 07:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
because I have already made the
 
07:25:23.350 --> 07:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
determination that I'm going to need to
 
07:25:26.230 --> 07:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
rework the model for the educational
 
07:25:29.590 --> 07:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
system in which my children learn so my
 
07:25:31.830 --> 07:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
expectation would be as a home educator
 
07:25:33.628 --> 07:25:33.638 align:start position:0%
if that were the pathway that I decided
 
07:25:36.750 --> 07:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
to go I would be able to then designate
 
07:25:39.150 --> 07:25:39.160 align:start position:0%
my own learning opportunities and cater
 
07:25:42.430 --> 07:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
those to my children's learning
 
07:25:46.430 --> 07:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
styles great thank thanks very much and
 
07:25:47.948 --> 07:25:47.958 align:start position:0%
uh representative luno I think that
 
07:25:50.468 --> 07:25:50.478 align:start position:0%
section you referred to uh part of it
 
07:25:52.230 --> 07:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
address specifically a parental
 
07:25:54.230 --> 07:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
placement in a private
 
07:25:59.510 --> 07:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
school right that's correct yeah um I I
 
07:26:01.910 --> 07:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
see our chairman is back uh maybe
 
07:26:03.670 --> 07:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
representative Hopson can bring up the
 
07:26:06.350 --> 07:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
uh next speaker well before we bring up
 
07:26:08.590 --> 07:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
the next speaker I I'd like to speak to
 
07:26:10.350 --> 07:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
the whole committee and let them know
 
07:26:11.388 --> 07:26:11.398 align:start position:0%
where we
 
07:26:15.070 --> 07:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
are um I I do not know where we are in
 
07:26:18.270 --> 07:26:18.280 align:start position:0%
terms of all the people on the list but
 
07:26:19.868 --> 07:26:19.878 align:start position:0%
I can look at all the hands up and in
 
07:26:21.388 --> 07:26:21.398 align:start position:0%
the air on the on the right hand side of
 
07:26:24.548 --> 07:26:24.558 align:start position:0%
the attendees I see that I also see all
 
07:26:28.110 --> 07:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
that have requested to speak on the uh
 
07:26:30.510 --> 07:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
remote testifying sheet that was handed
 
07:26:33.308 --> 07:26:33.318 align:start position:0%
us today um if I look at the total
 
07:26:35.150 --> 07:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
number of people that responded this
 
07:26:39.308 --> 07:26:39.318 align:start position:0%
bill both supporting and opposing we're
 
07:26:40.868 --> 07:26:40.878 align:start position:0%
up above th
 
07:26:42.750 --> 07:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
3,000 uh
 
07:26:45.388 --> 07:26:45.398 align:start position:0%
people uh that's more than we've
 
07:26:48.910 --> 07:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
experienced in in bills I think at any
 
07:26:52.230 --> 07:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
time I've been in house and and so what
 
07:26:53.788 --> 07:26:53.798 align:start position:0%
we're going to do is we're going to go
 
07:26:58.070 --> 07:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
through to 5:00 today and we're going to
 
07:27:00.548 --> 07:27:00.558 align:start position:0%
reconvene this meeting recess this
 
07:27:04.150 --> 07:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
meeting till Thursday of next week and
 
07:27:05.948 --> 07:27:05.958 align:start position:0%
start at nine o'clock in the morning on
 
07:27:09.548 --> 07:27:09.558 align:start position:0%
Thursday of next week with hb20 and take
 
07:27:13.350 --> 07:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
the entire day we will be limiting time
 
07:27:15.030 --> 07:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to start limiting time
 
07:27:19.308 --> 07:27:19.318 align:start position:0%
right now to several minutes a person
 
07:27:21.708 --> 07:27:21.718 align:start position:0%
and if it's need be based upon what we
 
07:27:23.430 --> 07:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
got left it could be even a shorter
 
07:27:26.910 --> 07:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
period of time um that's the only way
 
07:27:29.350 --> 07:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to get through this and
 
07:27:32.270 --> 07:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
we're also going to have to be cognizant
 
07:27:35.430 --> 07:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
of the fact that some folks now are
 
07:27:38.510 --> 07:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
repeating and I I think that that's you
 
07:27:41.350 --> 07:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
know they're telling stories which are
 
07:27:44.548 --> 07:27:44.558 align:start position:0%
story very personal to them and very
 
07:27:47.190 --> 07:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
meaningful uh however at this point in
 
07:27:49.190 --> 07:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
time as a committee that's got a task to
 
07:27:50.910 --> 07:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
get something out by the
 
07:27:53.468 --> 07:27:53.478 align:start position:0%
18th of of this month we're going to
 
07:27:56.190 --> 07:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
have to really start start moving here
 
07:27:58.350 --> 07:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
so that is the plan of action we're
 
07:28:00.350 --> 07:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
going to take and from this point
 
07:28:02.788 --> 07:28:02.798 align:start position:0%
forward today we're limiting no more
 
07:28:05.708 --> 07:28:05.718 align:start position:0%
than two minutes uh per person I just
 
07:28:08.308 --> 07:28:08.318 align:start position:0%
had a call with us the clerk of the
 
07:28:10.708 --> 07:28:10.718 align:start position:0%
house and several others and that was
 
07:28:13.150 --> 07:28:13.160 align:start position:0%
the advice I was given by the clerk who
 
07:28:16.308 --> 07:28:16.318 align:start position:0%
is represents both parties Democrat and
 
07:28:18.990 --> 07:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
Republican so U that's that's our
 
07:28:20.510 --> 07:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
Direction are there any comments from
 
07:28:22.868 --> 07:28:22.878 align:start position:0%
the committee regarding this next
 
07:28:25.990 --> 07:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
Thursday the 11th is it is that that
 
07:28:30.708 --> 07:28:30.718 align:start position:0%
well um whatever yes is that the ninth
 
07:28:33.230 --> 07:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
or I don't know i' have let me look the
 
07:28:36.510 --> 07:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
11th that's the 11th that's right
 
07:28:38.190 --> 07:28:38.200 align:start position:0%
because the 18th is the day that all
 
07:28:40.110 --> 07:28:40.120 align:start position:0%
early burs have to be reported that's a
 
07:28:42.388 --> 07:28:42.398 align:start position:0%
week later that's correct so it would be
 
07:28:45.510 --> 07:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
the 11th at nine o'clock we're also
 
07:28:48.750 --> 07:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
meeting next Tuesday to do other early
 
07:28:48.760 --> 07:28:50.308 align:start position:0%
meeting next Tuesday to do other early
bills

07:28:50.308 --> 07:28:50.318 align:start position:0%
bills
 
07:28:52.030 --> 07:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
um but somewhere along the way here
 
07:28:53.830 --> 07:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to do some exing and
 
07:28:56.308 --> 07:28:56.318 align:start position:0%
I probably end up hearing these bills
 
07:28:58.230 --> 07:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
and then have a you know then we'll just
 
07:29:00.548 --> 07:29:00.558 align:start position:0%
list like we have traditionally done
 
07:29:02.670 --> 07:29:02.680 align:start position:0%
exec sessions and list all those bills
 
07:29:04.708 --> 07:29:04.718 align:start position:0%
and just start going through them as an
 
07:29:07.230 --> 07:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
as a body for discussion and making
 
07:29:10.110 --> 07:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
taking motions if there's no objections
 
07:29:12.430 --> 07:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
to that that will be our
 
07:29:14.750 --> 07:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
plan uh I think that's the only way
 
07:29:16.388 --> 07:29:16.398 align:start position:0%
we're going to make this work and still
 
07:29:18.868 --> 07:29:18.878 align:start position:0%
be you know supportive of our public and
 
07:29:21.750 --> 07:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:24.708 --> 07:29:24.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity okay let's uh representative
 
07:29:27.830 --> 07:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
Hobson Let's uh move on with it and what
 
07:29:30.750 --> 07:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to do now is a two minutes a
 
07:29:33.830 --> 07:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
person and uh try not to repeat I will
 
07:29:36.430 --> 07:29:36.440 align:start position:0%

07:30:00.750 --> 07:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
constraints here we're limiting the uh
 
07:30:02.868 --> 07:30:02.878 align:start position:0%
time available to a speaker from this
 
07:30:06.670 --> 07:30:06.680 align:start position:0%
point on two minutes for all so I try
 
07:30:08.910 --> 07:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
not to repeat uh if you've been
 
07:30:11.868 --> 07:30:11.878 align:start position:0%
listening something been previously said
 
07:30:14.308 --> 07:30:14.318 align:start position:0%
thank you I have thank you so much and I
 
07:30:15.948 --> 07:30:15.958 align:start position:0%
appreciate everything that the committee
 
07:30:18.350 --> 07:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
members do for children of New Hampshire
 
07:30:20.510 --> 07:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
I live in barn state D and I'm currently
 
07:30:22.590 --> 07:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
the interim superintendent of schools at
 
07:30:24.548 --> 07:30:24.558 align:start position:0%
sa44 which are the districts of
 
07:30:27.030 --> 07:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
Northwood notingham and straford but I
 
07:30:29.430 --> 07:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
speak today as a professional educator
 
07:30:31.708 --> 07:30:31.718 align:start position:0%
and not as a representative of my school
 
07:30:34.628 --> 07:30:34.638 align:start position:0%
boards I am a longtime District Public
 
07:30:36.750 --> 07:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
School administrator I have also served
 
07:30:38.628 --> 07:30:38.638 align:start position:0%
as a local and state Charter Public
 
07:30:41.548 --> 07:30:41.558 align:start position:0%
School administrator in Massachusetts
 
07:30:43.750 --> 07:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
Connecticut North Carolina Georgia and
 
07:30:47.670 --> 07:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
Florida my objections to House Bill 20
 
07:30:49.948 --> 07:30:49.958 align:start position:0%
because I speak in opposition
 
07:30:52.190 --> 07:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
um stem in large part to the lack of
 
07:30:53.670 --> 07:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
accountability which has been well
 
07:30:56.230 --> 07:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
documented by the speakers that preceded
 
07:30:59.990 --> 07:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
me I also have a significant concern
 
07:31:03.150 --> 07:31:03.160 align:start position:0%
about the impact on social and economic
 
07:31:06.750 --> 07:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
stratification of children by subsid
 
07:31:09.110 --> 07:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
subsidizing affluent families who are
 
07:31:12.910 --> 07:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
already able to afford private education
 
07:31:16.750 --> 07:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
the best comparison I can make is a
 
07:31:19.350 --> 07:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
similar situation that occasionally
 
07:31:21.830 --> 07:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
plays out with some Charter Public
 
07:31:24.628 --> 07:31:24.638 align:start position:0%
Schools when a Charter Public School
 
07:31:26.308 --> 07:31:26.318 align:start position:0%
doesn't provide
 
07:31:29.030 --> 07:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
transportation doesn't offer School
 
07:31:32.350 --> 07:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
meals schedules a slightly later than
 
07:31:37.030 --> 07:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
normal start time these are uh
 
07:31:40.030 --> 07:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
situations that exclude families who
 
07:31:42.190 --> 07:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
don't have the luxury of a stay-at-home
 
07:31:44.190 --> 07:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
parent are being able to set their own
 
07:31:46.628 --> 07:31:46.638 align:start position:0%
work hours but the school claims to be
 
07:31:49.548 --> 07:31:49.558 align:start position:0%
open to all and that's not a choice it's
 
07:31:53.708 --> 07:31:53.718 align:start position:0%
barrier the situation with esas is that
 
07:31:55.830 --> 07:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
it they are not going to increase school
 
07:31:58.750 --> 07:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
choice for lowincome families who
 
07:32:01.750 --> 07:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
arguably need it the most families with
 
07:32:04.150 --> 07:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
limited financial resources are still
 
07:32:06.110 --> 07:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to afford private
 
07:32:08.750 --> 07:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
schooling and the truth is is that these
 
07:32:11.590 --> 07:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
accounts are a subsidy to affluent
 
07:32:15.670 --> 07:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
families and in NADA an analysis of zip
 
07:32:18.830 --> 07:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
code shows that students who live in
 
07:32:21.388 --> 07:32:21.398 align:start position:0%
house olds with incomes above
 
07:32:23.990 --> 07:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
$100,000 are much more likely to be
 
07:32:27.350 --> 07:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
enrolled in an Esa program in that state
 
07:32:29.830 --> 07:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
than children who come in families with
 
07:32:31.388 --> 07:32:31.398 align:start position:0%
incomes below
 
07:32:33.990 --> 07:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
$225,000 and that is not an opportunity
 
07:32:36.230 --> 07:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
07:32:39.990 --> 07:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
windfall an opportunity esas actually
 
07:32:43.830 --> 07:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
are a windfall for families of means
 
07:32:45.670 --> 07:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you all so much I would be happy
 
07:32:48.150 --> 07:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
to take questions should the chair
 
07:32:51.548 --> 07:32:51.558 align:start position:0%
permit yes are there any questions of
 
07:32:54.868 --> 07:32:54.878 align:start position:0%
Monica n seean thank you very much thank
 
07:33:00.230 --> 07:33:00.240 align:start position:0%

we have Mikel
Robinson

07:33:08.270 --> 07:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:15.230 --> 07:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:18.868 --> 07:33:18.878 align:start position:0%
Mel hello so my name is Mel Roberson I'm

07:33:24.270 --> 07:33:24.280 align:start position:0%
14 welcome and welcome to the
 
07:33:27.788 --> 07:33:27.798 align:start position:0%
legislature um thank you we are we are
 
07:33:30.070 --> 07:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
at the point in our hearings where we're
 
07:33:32.750 --> 07:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
allowing people several minutes and
 
07:33:34.230 --> 07:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
because we have so many people wanting
 
07:33:36.628 --> 07:33:36.638 align:start position:0%
to testify go
 
07:33:40.308 --> 07:33:40.318 align:start position:0%
ahead okay so I've struggled with mental
 
07:33:42.628 --> 07:33:42.638 align:start position:0%
health my whole life my SCH situation
 
07:33:45.070 --> 07:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
didn't help I've had multiple mental
 
07:33:47.270 --> 07:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
breakdowns about school the reasons vary
 
07:33:48.868 --> 07:33:48.878 align:start position:0%
mainly being about the pile up of school
 
07:33:50.590 --> 07:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
work the challenge of living up to
 
07:33:53.230 --> 07:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
societies and my own expectations and
 
07:33:54.948 --> 07:33:54.958 align:start position:0%
complicated relationships with friends
 
07:33:56.308 --> 07:33:56.318 align:start position:0%
as we try to find
 
07:33:59.350 --> 07:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
ourselves I'm relatively smart but I
 
07:34:01.628 --> 07:34:01.638 align:start position:0%
really wasn't doing a whole lot I never
 
07:34:03.868 --> 07:34:03.878 align:start position:0%
studied because I wasn't interested in
 
07:34:06.868 --> 07:34:06.878 align:start position:0%
the materials provided I was depressed I
 
07:34:09.030 --> 07:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
realized that continuing to stay in in
 
07:34:10.510 --> 07:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
the public school system would be
 
07:34:12.788 --> 07:34:12.798 align:start position:0%
detrimental to my mental health as early
 
07:34:15.070 --> 07:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
as 7th grade I started having thoughts
 
07:34:16.628 --> 07:34:16.638 align:start position:0%
about ending My
 
07:34:19.270 --> 07:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
Life by the beginning of nth grade my
 
07:34:21.190 --> 07:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
depression got worse so I started
 
07:34:23.308 --> 07:34:23.318 align:start position:0%
talking to my mom and therapist coming
 
07:34:25.350 --> 07:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
to the conclusion that I needed a
 
07:34:28.308 --> 07:34:28.318 align:start position:0%
change my situation became dire despite
 
07:34:29.868 --> 07:34:29.878 align:start position:0%
the school's best efforts the student
 
07:34:32.110 --> 07:34:32.120 align:start position:0%
population was toxic we have a lot of
 
07:34:34.030 --> 07:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
people in our town who really struggle
 
07:34:36.628 --> 07:34:36.638 align:start position:0%
to get by a lot of stud students in my
 
07:34:38.868 --> 07:34:38.878 align:start position:0%
school have really hard lives making
 
07:34:41.670 --> 07:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
connection with them difficult if I
 
07:34:43.430 --> 07:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to thrive I needed to leave the
 
07:34:45.110 --> 07:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
school I'm lucky enough that my parents
 
07:34:46.708 --> 07:34:46.718 align:start position:0%
can afford to pay for me to have
 
07:34:49.110 --> 07:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
resources and guidance outside of school
 
07:34:52.590 --> 07:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
but it really was a stretch for us hb20
 
07:34:55.230 --> 07:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
would help our family a lot I've just
 
07:34:56.868 --> 07:34:56.878 align:start position:0%
begun myself self- directed journey and
 
07:34:59.110 --> 07:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
already I'm feeling a change in the past
 
07:35:00.590 --> 07:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
few months I've made more friends than
 
07:35:03.510 --> 07:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
I've made in years and I've had more fun
 
07:35:06.510 --> 07:35:06.520 align:start position:0%

see all of you here again as former
 
07:36:08.830 --> 07:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
State Rep I promise to be really brief
 
07:36:11.350 --> 07:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
you've received my written testimony
 
07:36:14.070 --> 07:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
already um and I just wanted to re
 
07:36:16.948 --> 07:36:16.958 align:start position:0%
reiterate a point that I have not heard
 
07:36:19.548 --> 07:36:19.558 align:start position:0%
um in today's
 
07:36:22.788 --> 07:36:22.798 align:start position:0%
testimony which is um we are looking to
 
07:36:25.548 --> 07:36:25.558 align:start position:0%
solve a public education problem with a
 
07:36:28.308 --> 07:36:28.318 align:start position:0%
voucher program that could potentially
 
07:36:30.948 --> 07:36:30.958 align:start position:0%
be solved with looking at the research
 
07:36:34.430 --> 07:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
that's been done um on Aces and early
 
07:36:38.110 --> 07:36:38.120 align:start position:0%
childhood education in the value of
 
07:36:38.120 --> 07:36:39.990 align:start position:0%
childhood education in the value of
universal

07:36:39.990 --> 07:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
universal
 
07:36:44.030 --> 07:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
pre and differentiated learning I hear a
 
07:36:46.868 --> 07:36:46.878 align:start position:0%
lot of people's talking today struggling
 
07:36:49.788 --> 07:36:49.798 align:start position:0%
with special education needs
 
07:36:49.798 --> 07:36:50.948 align:start position:0%
with special education needs
with

07:36:50.948 --> 07:36:50.958 align:start position:0%
with
 
07:36:54.948 --> 07:36:54.958 align:start position:0%
um the ability to thrive in an
 
07:36:59.070 --> 07:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
environment and I believe that we
 
07:37:03.628 --> 07:37:03.638 align:start position:0%
are looking at the wrong solution and I
 
07:37:07.628 --> 07:37:07.638 align:start position:0%
encourage I implore uh the committee to
 
07:37:11.350 --> 07:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
not pass this bill um to dive deeper
 
07:37:13.548 --> 07:37:13.558 align:start position:0%
into looking at other solutions that
 
07:37:15.868 --> 07:37:15.878 align:start position:0%
will address all of our students my
 
07:37:17.590 --> 07:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
other point is I
 
07:37:21.750 --> 07:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
am very very much concerned about the
 
07:37:26.388 --> 07:37:26.398 align:start position:0%
level of financial impact to towns
 
07:37:29.948 --> 07:37:29.958 align:start position:0%
um I represented Hollis New Hampshire in
 
07:37:32.948 --> 07:37:32.958 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County District 27 but there
 
07:37:35.548 --> 07:37:35.558 align:start position:0%
are countless um districts across our
 
07:37:38.948 --> 07:37:38.958 align:start position:0%
state that would having that state
 
07:37:41.350 --> 07:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
adequacy funding uh plus the
 
07:37:43.030 --> 07:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
differentiation depending on what
 
07:37:45.468 --> 07:37:45.478 align:start position:0%
learner that is removed from those
 
07:37:47.750 --> 07:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
budgets those budgets have to be made up
 
07:37:50.590 --> 07:37:50.600 align:start position:0%
because there are fixed costs I'm also
 
07:37:54.110 --> 07:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
greatly concerned about uh local citizen
 
07:37:58.030 --> 07:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
petitions that would cap and restrict um
 
07:38:00.350 --> 07:38:00.360 align:start position:0%
the overall tax rate and contributions
 
07:38:02.990 --> 07:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
to education um which would lead to
 
07:38:05.230 --> 07:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
other people you know dismantling the
 
07:38:08.308 --> 07:38:08.318 align:start position:0%

very high academic Achievers but one

ended up dealing with some very
difficult

07:40:00.990 --> 07:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
07:40:04.230 --> 07:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
administrators um and in fact at Nash
 
07:40:06.308 --> 07:40:06.318 align:start position:0%
High South the administration just ended
 
07:40:08.830 --> 07:40:08.840 align:start position:0%

switch classes when she had teachers who
 
07:40:21.948 --> 07:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
mistreated her because of her
 
07:40:24.270 --> 07:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
disability and some of the teachers at
 
07:40:26.070 --> 07:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
Nashville South were outright
 
07:40:28.990 --> 07:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
emotionally abusive and it was a rough
 
07:40:30.830 --> 07:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
situation for all of
 
07:40:34.150 --> 07:40:34.160 align:start position:0%

07:42:51.440 --> 07:42:53.110 align:start position:0%
 
afternoon

07:42:53.110 --> 07:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
07:42:57.030 --> 07:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
sure um I'm a private citizen that lives
 
07:42:59.990 --> 07:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
in Dublin New Hampshire and despite the
 
07:43:01.708 --> 07:43:01.718 align:start position:0%
fact that you might think Dublin's a
 
07:43:04.350 --> 07:43:04.360 align:start position:0%
rich Community our family is a low
 
07:43:06.868 --> 07:43:06.878 align:start position:0%
income family and so some of these
 
07:43:10.190 --> 07:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
arguments that uh oh it's only for the
 
07:43:13.670 --> 07:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
rich uh just really goes out the window
 
07:43:17.708 --> 07:43:17.718 align:start position:0%
we home educated our five children we
 
07:43:21.308 --> 07:43:21.318 align:start position:0%
spent 20 20 years my wife invested a lot
 
07:43:23.150 --> 07:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
of time in them they've been very
 
07:43:26.628 --> 07:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
successful very proud of them
 
07:43:31.548 --> 07:43:31.558 align:start position:0%
um and I think but I also teach I teach
 
07:43:33.670 --> 07:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
in a traditional classroom and so I know
 
07:43:36.150 --> 07:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
there are advantages and disadvantages
 
07:43:39.308 --> 07:43:39.318 align:start position:0%
to every form of education and this is
 
07:43:42.510 --> 07:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
just another opportunity as commissioner
 
07:43:46.830 --> 07:43:46.840 align:start position:0%
Ute said to add one more option which I
 
07:43:49.990 --> 07:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
think is a huge positive for children in
 
07:43:52.830 --> 07:43:52.840 align:start position:0%
our state I also see it as a huge
 
07:43:57.270 --> 07:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
positive because the key to education is
 
07:44:00.308 --> 07:44:00.318 align:start position:0%
a motivated student and Studies have
 
07:44:02.990 --> 07:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
shown and our experience certainly shows
 
07:44:05.990 --> 07:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
that the more the parents are involved
 
07:44:09.388 --> 07:44:09.398 align:start position:0%
the more motivation there is our oldest
 
07:44:11.270 --> 07:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
son teaches history at Manchester
 
07:44:15.110 --> 07:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
Central and he's repeated how when it
 
07:44:18.150 --> 07:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
comes to parents night the AP students
 
07:44:19.750 --> 07:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
all of the parents show up because
 
07:44:22.430 --> 07:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
they're involved and the low in the
 
07:44:24.948 --> 07:44:24.958 align:start position:0%
lower classes hardly any of the parents
 
07:44:27.708 --> 07:44:27.718 align:start position:0%
show up so something that involves
 
07:44:32.230 --> 07:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
parents is a huge Plus for the education
 
07:44:34.670 --> 07:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
of those
 
07:44:38.788 --> 07:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
students I'd also like to uh point out
 
07:44:41.628 --> 07:44:41.638 align:start position:0%
that there are a lot
 
07:44:46.070 --> 07:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
of uh families in this state unlike our
 
07:44:48.868 --> 07:44:48.878 align:start position:0%
family we're lowincome but we had the
 
07:44:51.708 --> 07:44:51.718 align:start position:0%
opportunities for my wife to work
 
07:44:55.190 --> 07:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
full-time our my schedule was such that
 
07:44:56.990 --> 07:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
we could do a lot that other families
 
07:44:58.548 --> 07:44:58.558 align:start position:0%
couldn't do she didn't have to work
 
07:45:02.030 --> 07:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
outside the home and so we would like to
 
07:45:05.788 --> 07:45:05.798 align:start position:0%
see uh families across the state have
 
07:45:05.798 --> 07:45:06.548 align:start position:0%
see uh families across the state have
the

07:45:06.548 --> 07:45:06.558 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:45:09.708 --> 07:45:09.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be more involved and to
 
07:45:12.750 --> 07:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
have other choices in their children's
 
07:45:15.190 --> 07:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
education so thank you very much Neil
 
07:45:18.230 --> 07:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
your time is up unfortunately so uh but
 
07:45:19.868 --> 07:45:19.878 align:start position:0%

please on mute great um yes
 
07:45:51.510 --> 07:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
hello I'm speaking from 35 years of
 
07:45:53.948 --> 07:45:53.958 align:start position:0%
experience teaching teachers and working
 
07:45:56.150 --> 07:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with teachers from
 
07:45:59.628 --> 07:45:59.638 align:start position:0%
public and private parochial schools um
 
07:46:03.350 --> 07:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
I am very touched by all the stories of
 
07:46:05.910 --> 07:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
um children and parents with um special
 
07:46:08.230 --> 07:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
needs mental health issues and the
 
07:46:09.590 --> 07:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
import I realize very much the
 
07:46:11.150 --> 07:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
importance of Parental involvement like
 
07:46:15.590 --> 07:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
we just heard however nothing in this
 
07:46:18.590 --> 07:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
bill addresses those
 
07:46:22.590 --> 07:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
problems in fact it exacerbates them and
 
07:46:24.990 --> 07:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
as a researcher who's worked with these
 
07:46:27.548 --> 07:46:27.558 align:start position:0%
and many other more highly qualified
 
07:46:29.948 --> 07:46:29.958 align:start position:0%
educational researchers um I just took a
 
07:46:31.708 --> 07:46:31.718 align:start position:0%
quick look at the research literature
 
07:46:34.388 --> 07:46:34.398 align:start position:0%
and it's very clear from many cities
 
07:46:37.190 --> 07:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
across the United States several States
 
07:46:38.948 --> 07:46:38.958 align:start position:0%
significant Studies have been done on
 
07:46:42.190 --> 07:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
children in voucher systems who have
 
07:46:45.350 --> 07:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
declined under the voucher systems um a
 
07:46:47.308 --> 07:46:47.318 align:start position:0%
previous speaker voted talked a little
 
07:46:49.190 --> 07:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
bit about some some educational research
 
07:46:51.030 --> 07:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
by University people and all he said was
 
07:46:52.990 --> 07:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
that the public school kids don't get
 
07:46:56.308 --> 07:46:56.318 align:start position:0%
harmed well no I'm saying the voucher
 
07:47:00.308 --> 07:47:00.318 align:start position:0%
kids get harmed parents are not the best
 
07:47:03.350 --> 07:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
judge all in all cases of whether a kid
 
07:47:05.868 --> 07:47:05.878 align:start position:0%
is succeeding or meeting all adequate
 
07:47:05.878 --> 07:47:06.910 align:start position:0%
is succeeding or meeting all adequate
education

07:47:06.910 --> 07:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
education
 
07:47:10.190 --> 07:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
needs I'm I know this I'm a teacher and
 
07:47:12.230 --> 07:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know everything my kids are
 
07:47:15.990 --> 07:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
learning in school so it's very hard for
 
07:47:18.510 --> 07:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
parents to judge what's really best we
 
07:47:20.628 --> 07:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
have to improve our Public Schools
 
07:47:22.510 --> 07:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
especially for those special cases that
 
07:47:25.308 --> 07:47:25.318 align:start position:0%
I just cited it's a serious and sad
 
07:47:28.670 --> 07:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
situation but this bill does not address
 
07:47:32.270 --> 07:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
that please let this bill go put it into
 
07:47:35.430 --> 07:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
that that category of re redu um serious
 
07:47:37.788 --> 07:47:37.798 align:start position:0%
redu and instead spend your time
 
07:47:40.350 --> 07:47:40.360 align:start position:0%
addressing those needs which you heard
 
07:47:42.910 --> 07:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
plaintively in all those cases which
 
07:47:46.590 --> 07:47:46.600 align:start position:0%
were for this bill rewrite those cases
 
07:47:48.468 --> 07:47:48.478 align:start position:0%
and turn them into new bills that
 
07:47:51.510 --> 07:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
address those situations thank
 
07:47:54.430 --> 07:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much Cynthia are
 
07:47:56.830 --> 07:47:56.840 align:start position:0%

[Music]

07:48:05.868 --> 07:48:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:10.548 --> 07:48:10.558 align:start position:0%
much I unmuted myself uh next we

opportunity thank you for the time I
 
07:48:24.270 --> 07:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
will be brief I did email some comments
 
07:48:27.190 --> 07:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
um so I'm Jody lelot I am speaking to
 
07:48:30.270 --> 07:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
you today representing myself um I am a
 
07:48:32.230 --> 07:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
mom I'm a mental health Advocate and
 
07:48:34.868 --> 07:48:34.878 align:start position:0%
educator um I'm also an ases uh
 
07:48:37.190 --> 07:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
certified master trainer and again I'm
 
07:48:39.230 --> 07:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself with no agenda I
 
07:48:41.430 --> 07:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
just want to quickly touch on Aces and
 
07:48:43.670 --> 07:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
those are adverse childhood experiences
 
07:48:44.750 --> 07:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
we know through the study that was
 
07:48:46.910 --> 07:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
conducted in the 90s that over 80% of
 
07:48:48.910 --> 07:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
our most common problems um are
 
07:48:50.990 --> 07:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
attributable to high a scores and we
 
07:48:52.830 --> 07:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
know that high a scores are a common
 
07:48:55.270 --> 07:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
indicator for poverty and homelessness
 
07:48:59.070 --> 07:48:59.080 align:start position:0%
and that about 78% of drug addiction and
 
07:49:01.910 --> 07:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
misuse is stemming from Aces we know
 
07:49:03.948 --> 07:49:03.958 align:start position:0%
that Ace scores High Ace scores are not
 
07:49:07.468 --> 07:49:07.478 align:start position:0%
a determinant um or they're not a a a
 
07:49:09.910 --> 07:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
prescription for failure but that they
 
07:49:12.070 --> 07:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
increase the risk of people struggling
 
07:49:13.628 --> 07:49:13.638 align:start position:0%
and then moving into poverty and having
 
07:49:15.830 --> 07:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
issues and we know that protective
 
07:49:17.190 --> 07:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
factors and positive childhood
 
07:49:19.708 --> 07:49:19.718 align:start position:0%
experiences can counteract the effects
 
07:49:22.070 --> 07:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
of ases ases do modify the brain trauma
 
07:49:24.670 --> 07:49:24.680 align:start position:0%
modifies the brain but positive adult
 
07:49:26.548 --> 07:49:26.558 align:start position:0%
experiences protective factors can help
 
07:49:28.708 --> 07:49:28.718 align:start position:0%
to modify this our Public Schools serve
 
07:49:31.430 --> 07:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
as the first line of defense against
 
07:49:33.670 --> 07:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
Aces and in helping identify children
 
07:49:35.190 --> 07:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
who are facing adversity in the home
 
07:49:36.948 --> 07:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
whether it be abuse neglect or other
 
07:49:39.150 --> 07:49:39.160 align:start position:0%
factors um and then also helping to
 
07:49:40.948 --> 07:49:40.958 align:start position:0%
compensate and those positive role
 
07:49:43.110 --> 07:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
models can have a huge impact on those
 
07:49:45.070 --> 07:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
children being successful I don't
 
07:49:47.190 --> 07:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
believe that hb20 as it stands now is
 
07:49:49.150 --> 07:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
setting children up for the opportunity
 
07:49:51.270 --> 07:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
to be able to take advantage of these
 
07:49:52.830 --> 07:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
vouchers and that we're going to be
 
07:49:54.990 --> 07:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
creating a further Gap in education for
 
07:49:57.388 --> 07:49:57.398 align:start position:0%
these children um and not being able to
 
07:49:59.548 --> 07:49:59.558 align:start position:0%
help them overcome the adversity that
 
07:50:01.670 --> 07:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
they're seeing if we reduce Aces we're
 
07:50:03.110 --> 07:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
going to be reducing our homelessness
 
07:50:04.708 --> 07:50:04.718 align:start position:0%
problem our drug addiction problem and
 
07:50:06.948 --> 07:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
many other health and social problems
 
07:50:08.110 --> 07:50:08.120 align:start position:0%
and so I believe that we should be
 
07:50:09.830 --> 07:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
focusing on how we can create
 
07:50:11.590 --> 07:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
educational changes that are going to
 
07:50:14.388 --> 07:50:14.398 align:start position:0%
help to reduce Aces to overall boost our
 
07:50:16.350 --> 07:50:16.360 align:start position:0%
um educational system and our the health
 
07:50:18.150 --> 07:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
and well-being of our community
 
07:50:20.110 --> 07:50:20.120 align:start position:0%
and our citizens so I'm imploring you to
 
07:50:23.830 --> 07:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
please um to not vote for hb20 as it
 
07:50:25.830 --> 07:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
stands right now we do need a change
 
07:50:28.030 --> 07:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely and we do need to support
 
07:50:30.110 --> 07:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
individuals who um their children don't
 
07:50:31.948 --> 07:50:31.958 align:start position:0%
do in public school um but I don't
 
07:50:33.190 --> 07:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
believe that defunding our Public
 
07:50:34.628 --> 07:50:34.638 align:start position:0%
Schools is the option these schools
 
07:50:36.350 --> 07:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
struggle to fund as well and some of the
 
07:50:37.990 --> 07:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
problems we've heard today about
 
07:50:39.868 --> 07:50:39.878 align:start position:0%
programs not being successful or even
 
07:50:42.030 --> 07:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
schools remaining virtual are directly
 
07:50:43.548 --> 07:50:43.558 align:start position:0%
related to the fact that these schools
 
07:50:45.510 --> 07:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
lack adequate funding to provide for
 
07:50:47.670 --> 07:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
their students as it is and we have home
 
07:50:49.468 --> 07:50:49.478 align:start position:0%
owners and property owners who struggle
 
07:50:51.270 --> 07:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
to pay their taxes and so an increase in
 
07:50:53.190 --> 07:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
taxes is not going to help as well so
 
07:50:54.510 --> 07:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
I'll end my comments there because this
 
07:50:55.830 --> 07:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
has been a very long meeting and I know
 
07:50:57.350 --> 07:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
more people want to speak but if you
 
07:50:59.990 --> 07:51:00.000 align:start position:0%

07:51:03.190 --> 07:51:03.200 align:start position:0%

Sonia Prince from nashille New Hampshire
 
07:51:33.788 --> 07:51:33.798 align:start position:0%
I have three kids uh two kids in college
 
07:51:35.868 --> 07:51:35.878 align:start position:0%
and one kid in high school they all went
 
07:51:38.308 --> 07:51:38.318 align:start position:0%
to Public Schools super successful we're
 
07:51:40.868 --> 07:51:40.878 align:start position:0%
very fortunate um you know there's been
 
07:51:43.070 --> 07:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
ups and downs but as a school teacher I
 
07:51:45.628 --> 07:51:45.638 align:start position:0%
can tell you that um it doesn't matter
 
07:51:47.948 --> 07:51:47.958 align:start position:0%
what school you go to if there's bul or
 
07:51:50.788 --> 07:51:50.798 align:start position:0%
social issues it can happen anywhere I
 
07:51:53.230 --> 07:51:53.240 align:start position:0%
have an African-American son who's now
 
07:51:55.788 --> 07:51:55.798 align:start position:0%
21 and it didn't matter if we were on
 
07:51:58.990 --> 07:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
vacation in public at a school um he got
 
07:52:01.270 --> 07:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
bullied it is what it is it doesn't
 
07:52:03.030 --> 07:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
matter if I put him in a private school
 
07:52:04.948 --> 07:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
or or a public school he would have got
 
07:52:07.350 --> 07:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
bullied wherever he went it is what it
 
07:52:09.270 --> 07:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
is um there are social issues that
 
07:52:11.750 --> 07:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
happen but we dealt with them we you
 
07:52:13.990 --> 07:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
know took care of the problem and moved
 
07:52:17.548 --> 07:52:17.558 align:start position:0%
on and my kid is very resilient and um
 
07:52:19.990 --> 07:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
um he spoke at graduation so he's doing
 
07:52:22.510 --> 07:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
really well at Satan Hall University
 
07:52:25.270 --> 07:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
also um I am kind of upset I feel like
 
07:52:29.190 --> 07:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
this is like a a gold card package tax
 
07:52:33.388 --> 07:52:33.398 align:start position:0%
grab um to give to public to to give to
 
07:52:35.510 --> 07:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
private institutions to make money I
 
07:52:38.590 --> 07:52:38.600 align:start position:0%
mean that 10% bothered me for whoever
 
07:52:41.548 --> 07:52:41.558 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization takes care
 
07:52:44.750 --> 07:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
of so they get paid um also I didn't
 
07:52:46.628 --> 07:52:46.638 align:start position:0%
like that there's no accountability on
 
07:52:49.150 --> 07:52:49.160 align:start position:0%
the spending so that money can go
 
07:52:52.628 --> 07:52:52.638 align:start position:0%
anywhere um and again teachers at
 
07:52:54.510 --> 07:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
private schools or public schools they
 
07:52:57.030 --> 07:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
all have teaching degrees you may get
 
07:52:59.308 --> 07:52:59.318 align:start position:0%
better teaching teaching at a high
 
07:53:00.990 --> 07:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
school than you will at a private school
 
07:53:03.830 --> 07:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
you just never know so I don't feel like
 
07:53:05.070 --> 07:53:05.080 align:start position:0%
that's a comparison that they're going
 
07:53:07.190 --> 07:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
to get better service wherever they go
 
07:53:10.190 --> 07:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
because it's a private versus public um
 
07:53:13.030 --> 07:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
I am disappointed for instance in nashwa
 
07:53:16.948 --> 07:53:16.958 align:start position:0%
years ago when we had mayor loo um they
 
07:53:19.150 --> 07:53:19.160 align:start position:0%
cut our our gifted program and our after
 
07:53:21.030 --> 07:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
school program the same year they opened
 
07:53:23.030 --> 07:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
two charter schools so that was very
 
07:53:24.830 --> 07:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
disturbing to me because that attracted
 
07:53:27.750 --> 07:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
all our top students to go there and
 
07:53:29.468 --> 07:53:29.478 align:start position:0%
then it lowered the test scores for our
 
07:53:31.070 --> 07:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
Public Schools so it made it appear like
 
07:53:32.990 --> 07:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
our Public Schools weren't doing so well
 
07:53:34.750 --> 07:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
and the charter schools were doing great
 
07:53:37.350 --> 07:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
so I feel like the money is being pushed
 
07:53:39.910 --> 07:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
around just to get into private hands
 
07:53:41.868 --> 07:53:41.878 align:start position:0%
and not being accountable it's just
 
07:53:45.190 --> 07:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
another way to help um people not pay
 
07:53:47.910 --> 07:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
for private school thank you
 
07:53:50.708 --> 07:53:50.718 align:start position:0%

07:53:53.030 --> 07:53:53.040 align:start position:0%

serving on this committee representing
 
07:54:33.468 --> 07:54:33.478 align:start position:0%
the city of Manchester there's been a
 
07:54:35.230 --> 07:54:35.240 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion in this hearing about
 
07:54:38.670 --> 07:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
discrimination to that point T
 
07:54:41.670 --> 07:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
Willard fair is President and chief

executive officer of the Urban League of

leader who advocates for school choice
 
07:54:49.708 --> 07:54:49.718 align:start position:0%
he wrote a column for USA Today which
 
07:54:52.150 --> 07:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
reads in part we know that far too many
 
07:54:53.750 --> 07:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
black children are sitting in classrooms
 
07:54:55.230 --> 07:54:55.240 align:start position:0%
where they are not learning we know
 
07:54:57.110 --> 07:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
their schools have fewer resources we
 
07:54:58.868 --> 07:54:58.878 align:start position:0%
know expectations for these children are
 
07:55:00.788 --> 07:55:00.798 align:start position:0%
set lower than the expectations for
 
07:55:03.190 --> 07:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
students in more affluent Suburban
 
07:55:06.070 --> 07:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
schools he goes on to say once we were
 
07:55:09.070 --> 07:55:09.080 align:start position:0%
told where we could live and work play
 
07:55:11.750 --> 07:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
and pray eat and gather I find it no
 
07:55:13.868 --> 07:55:13.878 align:start position:0%
more acceptable that today we are told
 
07:55:16.510 --> 07:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
where our children can go to school if
 
07:55:18.030 --> 07:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
we are going to have a sincere
 
07:55:20.190 --> 07:55:20.200 align:start position:0%
discussion about equity and education it
 
07:55:23.030 --> 07:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
begins with education Freedom education
 
07:55:25.430 --> 07:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity is so much more than a k
 
07:55:28.110 --> 07:55:28.120 align:start position:0%
through 12 education receiving the right
 
07:55:30.308 --> 07:55:30.318 align:start position:0%
education opens the doors to opportunity
 
07:55:32.270 --> 07:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
for all children across all walks of
 
07:55:34.868 --> 07:55:34.878 align:start position:0%
life education Choice can lift children
 
07:55:36.708 --> 07:55:36.718 align:start position:0%
out of poverty and set them on the path
 
07:55:38.708 --> 07:55:38.718 align:start position:0%
for Success that would otherwise be out
 
07:55:41.150 --> 07:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
of reach as I stated I live in
 
07:55:43.190 --> 07:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
Manchester which is very diverse
 
07:55:44.948 --> 07:55:44.958 align:start position:0%
Community some of our state
 
07:55:46.510 --> 07:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
representatives have taken to social
 
07:55:48.670 --> 07:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
media to discuss this bill they have
 
07:55:50.230 --> 07:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
boasted about their own private
 
07:55:52.628 --> 07:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
education and have taken and have had
 
07:55:54.788 --> 07:55:54.798 align:start position:0%
the audacity to state that only children
 
07:55:56.510 --> 07:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
that come from families that can afford
 
07:55:58.388 --> 07:55:58.398 align:start position:0%
a private education should have that
 
07:56:01.110 --> 07:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
privilege these same people are offended
 
07:56:02.628 --> 07:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
by the fact that parents would choose a
 
07:56:04.388 --> 07:56:04.398 align:start position:0%
school other than a traditional public
 
07:56:06.430 --> 07:56:06.440 align:start position:0%
school and deny that District the state
 
07:56:08.788 --> 07:56:08.798 align:start position:0%
adequacy funds attributed to that child
 
07:56:10.590 --> 07:56:10.600 align:start position:0%
however they ignore the fact that their
 
07:56:13.070 --> 07:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
own families made the same choice they
 
07:56:15.308 --> 07:56:15.318 align:start position:0%
believe our poorer Families Our Refugee
 
07:56:16.628 --> 07:56:16.638 align:start position:0%
families and our most vulnerable
 
07:56:18.510 --> 07:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
students should not have the same
 
07:56:20.388 --> 07:56:20.398 align:start position:0%
opportunities that they themselves have
 
07:56:23.388 --> 07:56:23.398 align:start position:0%
had I could not disagree more in fact it
 
07:56:25.468 --> 07:56:25.478 align:start position:0%
is those children who deserve a hand up
 
07:56:27.948 --> 07:56:27.958 align:start position:0%
all children deserve the opportunity to
 
07:56:30.468 --> 07:56:30.478 align:start position:0%
pursue the right education for them if a
 
07:56:31.910 --> 07:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
child is being challenged and is
 
07:56:34.430 --> 07:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
supported in their Traditional School
 
07:56:36.910 --> 07:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
that's wonderful many families benefit
 
07:56:38.670 --> 07:56:38.680 align:start position:0%
from our traditional public schools and
 
07:56:41.230 --> 07:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
will continue to do so but some children
 
07:56:43.830 --> 07:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
do better in less traditional settings
 
07:56:46.430 --> 07:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
like charter schools montau schools
 
07:56:48.510 --> 07:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
private schools or homeschools school
 
07:56:50.628 --> 07:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
choice is about each family finding the
 
07:56:52.788 --> 07:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
right fit where their children will grow
 
07:56:55.388 --> 07:56:55.398 align:start position:0%
to be the person God intended them to be
 
07:56:57.868 --> 07:56:57.878 align:start position:0%

coming and thank you for this
 
07:57:36.868 --> 07:57:36.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh I'm here uh I'm opposed
 
07:57:39.388 --> 07:57:39.398 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 20 I did submit written
 
07:57:41.590 --> 07:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
testimony I won't read that for you I'll
 
07:57:44.070 --> 07:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
be brief I just have a couple of points
 
07:57:47.070 --> 07:57:47.080 align:start position:0%
um I agree with representative miler
 
07:57:48.990 --> 07:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill 20 describes a voucher
 
07:57:52.468 --> 07:57:52.478 align:start position:0%
program plain and simple um I also Echo
 
07:57:54.708 --> 07:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
Mary Heath's representative uh Mary
 
07:57:57.190 --> 07:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
Heath's concerns regarding the fiscal
 
07:57:59.468 --> 07:57:59.478 align:start position:0%
note that was provided and I'll give you
 
07:58:03.510 --> 07:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
a quick example um say you have 20
 
07:58:07.030 --> 07:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
students uh that take advantage of a
 
07:58:10.230 --> 07:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
voucher um or you know the esa as it's
 
07:58:13.350 --> 07:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
called here that's about uh comes out to
 
07:58:15.270 --> 07:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
just right around
 
07:58:18.868 --> 07:58:18.878 align:start position:0%
$100,000 um but those 20 students just
 
07:58:20.868 --> 07:58:20.878 align:start position:0%
because there's 20 students that doesn't
 
07:58:23.070 --> 07:58:23.080 align:start position:0%
mean that there's a reduction in staff
 
07:58:25.788 --> 07:58:25.798 align:start position:0%
it's you know the argument has been made
 
07:58:27.788 --> 07:58:27.798 align:start position:0%
for example under when we were talking
 
07:58:30.910 --> 07:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
about SP sp13 that 20 students is a
 
07:58:32.308 --> 07:58:32.318 align:start position:0%
classroom so you should be able to
 
07:58:35.510 --> 07:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
reduce a teacher but that's not the case
 
07:58:37.388 --> 07:58:37.398 align:start position:0%
um I'm the superintendent of schools in
 
07:58:39.910 --> 07:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
the madn Regional School District and
 
07:58:42.308 --> 07:58:42.318 align:start position:0%
it's entirely possible that 20 students
 
07:58:44.030 --> 07:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
could represent two students from one
 
07:58:46.430 --> 07:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
grade two from another two from another
 
07:58:48.788 --> 07:58:48.798 align:start position:0%
and there would not be a correlating
 
07:58:51.628 --> 07:58:51.638 align:start position:0%
reduction in staff um I don't understand
 
07:58:53.910 --> 07:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
the math uh that was presented in the
 
07:58:56.510 --> 07:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that on average across the
 
07:58:59.110 --> 07:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
state we St we spend 20,000 per student
 
07:59:01.708 --> 07:59:01.718 align:start position:0%
we subtract out the
 
07:59:04.270 --> 07:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
4,603 noted in the fiscal note per
 
07:59:06.430 --> 07:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
student that would go to the esa and
 
07:59:09.788 --> 07:59:09.798 align:start position:0%
that results in a $15,000 savings for
 
07:59:13.110 --> 07:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers if we're not reducing
 
07:59:17.350 --> 07:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
employees we're not reducing bus runs um
 
07:59:19.948 --> 07:59:19.958 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how we add that up to a
 
07:59:23.430 --> 07:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
$15,000 savings to taxpayers um I'd have
 
07:59:25.548 --> 07:59:25.558 align:start position:0%
to go back and take another look I first
 
07:59:27.030 --> 07:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
blush that doesn't make a lot of sense
 
07:59:30.548 --> 07:59:30.558 align:start position:0%
to me I do want to comment also on
 
07:59:32.510 --> 07:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities and
 
07:59:35.070 --> 07:59:35.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination um private schools do not
 
07:59:38.150 --> 07:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
have to follow anti-discrimination laws
 
07:59:40.628 --> 07:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
or the individuals with disabilities
 
07:59:43.868 --> 07:59:43.878 align:start position:0%
Education Act other speakers have have
 
07:59:46.070 --> 07:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
indicated some schools do and perhaps
 
07:59:48.830 --> 07:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
many do but the fact remains they don't
 
07:59:52.030 --> 07:59:52.040 align:start position:0%
have to and they can pick and choose who
 
07:59:54.430 --> 07:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
they choose to accept and there's
 
07:59:57.750 --> 07:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
nothing you're out of time Lisa I okay
 
08:00:01.030 --> 08:00:01.040 align:start position:0%

08:00:04.990 --> 08:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
time any questions Lisa not seeing hands
 
08:00:08.670 --> 08:00:08.680 align:start position:0%
we have time for one more speaker
 
08:00:12.708 --> 08:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
today okay our representative Spain uh
 
08:00:16.150 --> 08:00:16.160 align:start position:0%

Blain thank you so much for my ability
 
08:00:27.788 --> 08:00:27.798 align:start position:0%
to speak today I think the the chair and
 
08:00:27.798 --> 08:00:28.670 align:start position:0%
to speak today I think the the chair and
the

08:00:28.670 --> 08:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:00:31.548 --> 08:00:31.558 align:start position:0%
committee um I am one of those people
 
08:00:34.070 --> 08:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
who lived through this we have going
 
08:00:36.750 --> 08:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
been going through this in New Hampshire
 
08:00:40.868 --> 08:00:40.878 align:start position:0%
since uh 1980 at
 
08:00:42.990 --> 08:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
least my
 
08:00:46.150 --> 08:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
parents had to go into debt to put me in
 
08:00:47.590 --> 08:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
a private
 
08:00:51.150 --> 08:00:51.160 align:start position:0%
school because there was no facility to
 
08:00:54.750 --> 08:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
take and put me into a different school
 
08:00:57.670 --> 08:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
from the school that I was in and I will
 
08:01:00.628 --> 08:01:00.638 align:start position:0%
tell you straight out um I was headed on
 
08:01:02.750 --> 08:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
a wrong
 
08:01:06.990 --> 08:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
path I was headed into a a a path of
 
08:01:08.948 --> 08:01:08.958 align:start position:0%
degeneracy and
 
08:01:12.510 --> 08:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
whatnot on the public school end of
 
08:01:16.030 --> 08:01:16.040 align:start position:0%
things when I got into private school
 
08:01:18.430 --> 08:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
because my parents were able to pay for
 
08:01:22.750 --> 08:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
it that I was uh totally turned
 
08:01:22.760 --> 08:01:24.548 align:start position:0%
it that I was uh totally turned
around

08:01:24.548 --> 08:01:24.558 align:start position:0%
around
 
08:01:28.270 --> 08:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
and I think that uh you need to you need
 
08:01:32.030 --> 08:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
to look at the fact that any argument
 
08:01:34.868 --> 08:01:34.878 align:start position:0%
that this is defunding the public
 
08:01:38.948 --> 08:01:38.958 align:start position:0%
schools is absolutely ridiculous what
 
08:01:41.708 --> 08:01:41.718 align:start position:0%
we're doing is taking students who are
 
08:01:43.750 --> 08:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
no longer in those public schools and
 
08:01:46.030 --> 08:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
putting their money forward so they have
 
08:01:50.190 --> 08:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
no more interest in those students those
 
08:01:53.110 --> 08:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
students now are in a different school
 
08:01:55.388 --> 08:01:55.398 align:start position:0%
why should they continue getting funding
 
08:01:57.270 --> 08:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
for the students that are no longer
 
08:01:58.430 --> 08:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
attending their
 
08:02:02.030 --> 08:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
school I have been fighting this fight
 
08:02:04.110 --> 08:02:04.120 align:start position:0%
since I was in high
 
08:02:04.120 --> 08:02:06.110 align:start position:0%
since I was in high
school

08:02:06.110 --> 08:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
school
 
08:02:10.030 --> 08:02:10.040 align:start position:0%
and I have persevered only because my
 
08:02:12.388 --> 08:02:12.398 align:start position:0%
parents were willing to go into debt to
 
08:02:14.990 --> 08:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
put me through private school on their
 
08:02:17.590 --> 08:02:17.600 align:start position:0%
own and this is a a problem with New
 
08:02:20.110 --> 08:02:20.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that has been
 
08:02:22.670 --> 08:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
longstanding since the
 
08:02:24.830 --> 08:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
80s where we
 
08:02:26.990 --> 08:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
have not
 
08:02:30.150 --> 08:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
allowed for students who do not fit a
 
08:02:30.160 --> 08:02:32.230 align:start position:0%
allowed for students who do not fit a
particular

08:02:32.230 --> 08:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
particular
 
08:02:35.590 --> 08:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
curriculum to go to a different School
 
08:02:39.948 --> 08:02:39.958 align:start position:0%
in my case it was because I was Advanced
 
08:02:42.308 --> 08:02:42.318 align:start position:0%
from the current curriculum and they
 
08:02:44.430 --> 08:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
said the only option they had was to put
 
08:02:48.270 --> 08:02:48.280 align:start position:0%
me in the regress curriculum of the
 
08:02:51.308 --> 08:02:51.318 align:start position:0%
special needs students in order to give
 
08:02:53.990 --> 08:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
me special
 
08:02:56.990 --> 08:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
one-on-one attention James we're not at
 
08:02:59.590 --> 08:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
the end of your time other than that
 
08:03:01.110 --> 08:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
they told me sit in the back of the
 
08:03:03.830 --> 08:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
classroom and read books and don't do
 
08:03:05.990 --> 08:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
anything and I will tell you straight
 
08:03:11.468 --> 08:03:11.478 align:start position:0%
out we need to allow students to find
 
08:03:14.830 --> 08:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
the ability to get the best education
 
08:03:17.990 --> 08:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
that those students need
 
08:03:20.990 --> 08:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
not everyone fits the same model and we
 
08:03:23.628 --> 08:03:23.638 align:start position:0%
need to give people the ability to find
 
08:03:26.708 --> 08:03:26.718 align:start position:0%
their model that fits their
 
08:03:29.468 --> 08:03:29.478 align:start position:0%
education and give them the best ability
 
08:03:32.750 --> 08:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
to to grow within their education
 
08:03:36.308 --> 08:03:36.318 align:start position:0%
ability and we need to do that and this
 
08:03:39.030 --> 08:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
bill allows us to do that thank you very
 
08:03:41.708 --> 08:03:41.718 align:start position:0%

place right
 
08:04:45.590 --> 08:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
now okay folks Rick quick quick question
 
08:04:48.150 --> 08:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
yeah what what are we looking at right
 
08:04:50.708 --> 08:04:50.718 align:start position:0%
now as far as blue sheets and the pink
 
08:04:53.430 --> 08:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
car in the pink SL in the you know Dave
 
08:04:55.388 --> 08:04:55.398 align:start position:0%
I really don't have a hot
 
08:04:59.150 --> 08:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
clue I'm saying that honestly uh de Deb
 
08:05:01.510 --> 08:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh Hobson can give us that information
 
08:05:06.030 --> 08:05:06.040 align:start position:0%
or even Jennifer four but uh we have a a
 
08:05:10.670 --> 08:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
whole slug of people to come and uh the
 
08:05:12.670 --> 08:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
the conversation I had with Paul Smith
 
08:05:15.110 --> 08:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
was Rick you know you just you know
 
08:05:17.430 --> 08:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
recess it conv in on another day and go
 
08:05:19.708 --> 08:05:19.718 align:start position:0%
for it then no I think that's that's a
 
08:05:23.628 --> 08:05:23.638 align:start position:0%
good plan but I think it is yeah so so
 
08:05:26.270 --> 08:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
far so
 
08:05:29.990 --> 08:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
far many of these people have already
 
08:05:33.948 --> 08:05:33.958 align:start position:0%
submitted um written testimony because
 
08:05:36.030 --> 08:05:36.040 align:start position:0%
I've been going through the list and
 
08:05:37.948 --> 08:05:37.958 align:start position:0%
almost every single person that spoke
 
08:05:41.110 --> 08:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
has already submitted written testimony
 
08:05:43.670 --> 08:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
I think if they that they should all be
 
08:05:46.830 --> 08:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
told to just either submit r written
 
08:05:49.750 --> 08:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
testimony or a sign up to speak one or
 
08:05:53.430 --> 08:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
the other I don't see why that's a
 
08:05:55.910 --> 08:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
problem well you know the state of New
 
08:05:57.830 --> 08:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire believes in having a House of
 
08:06:00.190 --> 08:06:00.200 align:start position:0%
Representatives allows everybody the
 
08:06:02.990 --> 08:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come forward and say
 
08:06:06.430 --> 08:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
they're two cents worth um and we always
 
08:06:08.308 --> 08:06:08.318 align:start position:0%
ask if they have written testimony to
 
08:06:10.070 --> 08:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
leave that at your doorstep there
 
08:06:14.468 --> 08:06:14.478 align:start position:0%
Barbara so um you know I think that I
 
08:06:17.670 --> 08:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
know it's our tradition though and we
 
08:06:20.868 --> 08:06:20.878 align:start position:0%
can't give up on what New Hampshire
 
08:06:25.070 --> 08:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
is what wasb what was Deb going to say I
 
08:06:28.230 --> 08:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
was just going to tell you um I I'm not
 
08:06:30.070 --> 08:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
sure what time this
 
08:06:32.670 --> 08:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
report was given to us it was given to
 
08:06:35.388 --> 08:06:35.398 align:start position:0%
us in the afternoon at some point but we
 
08:06:40.910 --> 08:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
had um supporting 600 opposing
 
08:06:47.990 --> 08:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
3,198 neutral 5 total testifying uh
 
08:06:52.750 --> 08:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
131 can I also say that it's been very
 
08:06:56.388 --> 08:06:56.398 align:start position:0%
difficult to look at the the hands that
 
08:06:58.910 --> 08:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
are raised to speak from the attendee
 
08:07:03.150 --> 08:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
list and find them on maybe this list

representative lad can I ask for on the
 
08:08:11.308 --> 08:08:11.318 align:start position:0%
11th if we finished would you plan on
 
08:08:15.270 --> 08:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
executing bills because my vaccine
 
08:08:17.070 --> 08:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
appointment is for
 
08:08:19.548 --> 08:08:19.558 align:start position:0%
5:00 and I wouldn't want to miss that
 
08:08:22.230 --> 08:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
but if you're going to exact bills I'll
 
08:08:24.548 --> 08:08:24.558 align:start position:0%
have them get a sub for me because I'm
 
08:08:27.628 --> 08:08:27.638 align:start position:0%
going for my vaccine let me get back to
 
08:08:30.708 --> 08:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
that on Patricia I I I honestly don't
 
08:08:32.868 --> 08:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
know at this point in time okay I gotta
 
08:08:34.750 --> 08:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
do a little of this modern math with
 
08:08:36.468 --> 08:08:36.478 align:start position:0%
these bills and find out if we go two
 
08:08:38.350 --> 08:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
minutes a piece how many minutes are we
 
08:08:40.830 --> 08:08:40.840 align:start position:0%
gonna need as long as I know in time to
 
08:08:43.510 --> 08:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
get a sub if I have to yes I I will
 
08:08:46.030 --> 08:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
definitely communicate that and uh
 
08:08:48.350 --> 08:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
Patricia I'll work directly with uh Mel
 
08:08:51.190 --> 08:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
my or your ranking rep and he can
 
08:08:53.270 --> 08:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
disseminate that information amongst you
 
08:08:57.590 --> 08:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
allk thank you Rick yeah Mr chairman yes
 
08:09:01.948 --> 08:09:01.958 align:start position:0%
this is Jim um to clear up confusion in
 
08:09:04.510 --> 08:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
my brain at this point last week I
 
08:09:06.590 --> 08:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
believe you said to us that we would be
 
08:09:10.910 --> 08:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
meeting Tuesdays and Thursdays for the
 
08:09:13.548 --> 08:09:13.558 align:start position:0%
foreseeable uh but now we're talking
 
08:09:16.430 --> 08:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
about next Tuesday and next Thursday say
 
08:09:19.270 --> 08:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
are we not meeting two days hence no
 
08:09:21.510 --> 08:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
we're meeting this thur let me tell you
 
08:09:25.110 --> 08:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
what's going on here um the of course we
 
08:09:27.190 --> 08:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
have to get those early bills out and
 
08:09:29.548 --> 08:09:29.558 align:start position:0%
report them on the
 
08:09:33.590 --> 08:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
18th at the latest at the latest um so
 
08:09:37.150 --> 08:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
we had for these last this last week and
 
08:09:39.868 --> 08:09:39.878 align:start position:0%
or this week and the next week we have
 
08:09:43.230 --> 08:09:43.240 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays and Thursdays for the week of
 
08:09:45.990 --> 08:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
the let's see that'll be the week of the
 
08:09:49.548 --> 08:09:49.558 align:start position:0%
16th I believe or the 15 16 17 the
 
08:09:53.510 --> 08:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
15th um we will get two days in that
 
08:09:57.150 --> 08:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
week um we're going to have to have them
 
08:09:59.150 --> 08:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
in fact when I spoke with the chief of
 
08:10:02.388 --> 08:10:02.398 align:start position:0%
staff this afternoon they said yes this
 
08:10:04.190 --> 08:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
education committee because we have a
 
08:10:07.708 --> 08:10:07.718 align:start position:0%
whole slug of bills we we need that time
 
08:10:10.308 --> 08:10:10.318 align:start position:0%
so I don't know the specific days
 
08:10:13.350 --> 08:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
whether it's the 16th 17th or 15th 16th
 
08:10:17.190 --> 08:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
17th or 18th um we will probably have
 
08:10:20.788 --> 08:10:20.798 align:start position:0%
the the the 16th which is
 
08:10:23.030 --> 08:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
the well I'm not going to say which of
 
08:10:25.548 --> 08:10:25.558 align:start position:0%
the two but we're going to have two days
 
08:10:28.750 --> 08:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
that last week so that means we're going
 
08:10:31.230 --> 08:10:31.240 align:start position:0%
to have to set up a day in which we do
 
08:10:31.240 --> 08:10:32.030 align:start position:0%
to have to set up a day in which we do
the

08:10:32.030 --> 08:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:10:35.510 --> 08:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
exact um and there if we have some time
 
08:10:39.548 --> 08:10:39.558 align:start position:0%
at the end we'll try to exact bills that
 
08:10:42.948 --> 08:10:42.958 align:start position:0%
um we don't have a mending language for
 
08:10:46.308 --> 08:10:46.318 align:start position:0%
or we that we feel we can get through uh
 
08:10:48.510 --> 08:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
without you know having to get into the
 
08:10:51.990 --> 08:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
great debate and and you know
 
08:10:53.190 --> 08:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
understanding that the folks don't
 
08:10:56.030 --> 08:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
always see it the same way yes but um
 
08:11:00.150 --> 08:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
when we get to issues like hb20 or maybe
 
08:11:01.830 --> 08:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
like or Thursday we're going to be
 
08:11:04.510 --> 08:11:04.520 align:start position:0%
talking about school building Aid Dave
 
08:11:07.510 --> 08:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
and we have two bills there one
 
08:11:10.510 --> 08:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
bill is exactly the same as the second
 
08:11:12.510 --> 08:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
bill but the second bill goes farther
 
08:11:15.270 --> 08:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
with looking at that that the formula
 
08:11:17.750 --> 08:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
and the payment period and all that so
 
08:11:21.430 --> 08:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
that will be some discussion there but
 
08:11:23.308 --> 08:11:23.318 align:start position:0%
at the end we might be able to come up
 
08:11:26.548 --> 08:11:26.558 align:start position:0%
with you know a solution of either
 
08:11:28.590 --> 08:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
amending or or getting those things
 
08:11:30.388 --> 08:11:30.398 align:start position:0%
through that's not going to be as hotly
 
08:11:33.190 --> 08:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
debated I don't think as what we've been
 
08:11:36.670 --> 08:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
just going through today so TimeWise I
 
08:11:38.990 --> 08:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
hope to use our time efficiently get
 
08:11:41.468 --> 08:11:41.478 align:start position:0%
some EXA sessions in the way we'll get
 
08:11:44.110 --> 08:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
some of them done perhaps if we have
 
08:11:46.230 --> 08:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
like a whole of a half hour 4 5 minutes
 
08:11:49.510 --> 08:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
along the way between bills if we have
 
08:11:52.190 --> 08:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
that um but looking at our history we
 
08:11:54.910 --> 08:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
had so far this this this session we
 
08:11:57.308 --> 08:11:57.318 align:start position:0%
have not had a lot of
 
08:11:59.910 --> 08:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
holes so it looks like it's going to be
 
08:12:02.628 --> 08:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
days just set up for exec
 
08:12:04.948 --> 08:12:04.958 align:start position:0%
alone and and we'll try and get all the
 
08:12:08.468 --> 08:12:08.478 align:start position:0%
amendments to people prior to the exact
 
08:12:10.230 --> 08:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
sessions and that's why I asked the
 
08:12:11.948 --> 08:12:11.958 align:start position:0%
question earlier today is legislative
 
08:12:14.388 --> 08:12:14.398 align:start position:0%
Services sending them out as well to
 
08:12:16.750 --> 08:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
committee members as as to the research
 
08:12:18.548 --> 08:12:18.558 align:start position:0%
people upstairs where they used to run
 
08:12:20.750 --> 08:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
them off for us and we picked them
 
08:12:23.788 --> 08:12:23.798 align:start position:0%
up Glenn you had your hand up yes I just
 
08:12:25.308 --> 08:12:25.318 align:start position:0%
wanted um to follow up with
 
08:12:28.350 --> 08:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
representative allard's comment and um
 
08:12:30.468 --> 08:12:30.478 align:start position:0%
uh correct me if I'm wrong but we are
 
08:12:32.468 --> 08:12:32.478 align:start position:0%
meeting on Thursday as scheduled in the
 
08:12:36.590 --> 08:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
calendar yes we are yes we
 
08:12:39.830 --> 08:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
are okay folks that's it and I'll be in
 
08:12:42.628 --> 08:12:42.638 align:start position:0%
touch with now we have one more comment
 
08:12:46.230 --> 08:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
representative a clarification yes
 
08:12:49.990 --> 08:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
on Thursday the 11th are you allowing
 
08:12:52.190 --> 08:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
new testimony or only those that are
 
08:12:54.510 --> 08:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
already on your listing today oh it's
 
08:12:56.430 --> 08:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
only those which have you know
 
08:13:00.070 --> 08:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
identified as of today uh we we don't
 
08:13:03.030 --> 08:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
want to go in no I just didn't know I
 
08:13:05.430 --> 08:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
didn't know what the process was I think
 
08:13:08.548 --> 08:13:08.558 align:start position:0%
you concur right I'm just asking you
 
08:13:11.030 --> 08:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
know you know Rick I'm not I'm not sure
 
08:13:13.628 --> 08:13:13.638 align:start position:0%
um I I think last year the clerk gave us
 
08:13:16.510 --> 08:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
advice to the contrary yeah
 
08:13:19.948 --> 08:13:19.958 align:start position:0%
know yeah that's correct yeah we un I
 
08:13:22.868 --> 08:13:22.878 align:start position:0%
hate to say this but my understanding
 
08:13:25.150 --> 08:13:25.160 align:start position:0%
you might want to check with with Paul
 
08:13:27.350 --> 08:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh Rick but when I checked with him he
 
08:13:29.830 --> 08:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
said no if you if you have a public
 
08:13:31.750 --> 08:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
meeting you've got to allow other people
 
08:13:34.388 --> 08:13:34.398 align:start position:0%
in and um to
 
08:13:37.350 --> 08:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
testify I'm not that I want to be a suer
 
08:13:39.750 --> 08:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
of more time but I think just check with
 
08:13:42.110 --> 08:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
Paul and he'll see what he says would be
 
08:13:43.910 --> 08:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
any different than today people checking
 
08:13:45.750 --> 08:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
in later on the day you would the
 
08:13:48.030 --> 08:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
meeting so they're still checking in
 
08:13:50.750 --> 08:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
