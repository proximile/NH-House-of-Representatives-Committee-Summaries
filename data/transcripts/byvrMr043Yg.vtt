suicide um she's here today and you're

hear her story
 
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
too what I learned from our
 
00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 align:start position:0%
conversations over the last few months
 
00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 align:start position:0%
are are three things devastating impact
 
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
that a tragedy like this can have on the
 
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
people who are left
 
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.949 align:start position:0%
people who are left
behind

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 align:start position:0%
behind
 
00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
the finality of an attempted suicide by
 
00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
firearm which has a 90% success rate and
 
00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 align:start position:0%
the fact that there are small but
 
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
significant changes we can make to our
 
00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
laws to help people who are at risk for
 
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
suicide as well as their
 
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
families there are many people who
 
00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
experience suicidal thoughts for some
 
00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
the idea that they can buy a firearm is
 
00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
troubling but at times the temptation to
 
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
do so can be
 
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 align:start position:0%
overwhelming they may have no History of
 
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
Violence or self harm or they may have
 
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 align:start position:0%
already tried to they may be prone to
 
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.590 align:start position:0%
already tried to they may be prone to
severe

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
severe
 
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.150 align:start position:0%
severe
deppression

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 align:start position:0%
they may suffer from severe bipolar
 
00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 align:start position:0%
disorder many of them may have never
 
00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
been treated for mental illness they may
 
00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 align:start position:0%
be fine now but they know the UPS the
 
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
Downs the mood swings and the
 
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
overwhelming urge to do themselves harm
 
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
back they also know that having a
 
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
firearm in their lives will put them at
 
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
risk for taking their own
 
00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
life in most parts of the country
 
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire
 
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
there's no ability to voluntarily add
 
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
yourself to the federal background check
 
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
system so you can't purchase a
 
00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
firearm what this bill would do is
 
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
change that by establishing a voluntary
 
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
Firearms do not sell list for people who
 
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
voluntarily wish to wave their right to
 
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.230 align:start position:0%
voluntarily wish to wave their right to
buy

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 align:start position:0%
buy
 
00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
firearms the bill authorizes the
 
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
department of safety to create
 
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
administrative processes needed to
 
00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 align:start position:0%
establish and manage this list it also
 
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
establishes ground rules for handling
 
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
these applications s for example once an
 
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 align:start position:0%
application is submitted the department
 
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
of safety will have one business day to
 
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
transmit this information to the
 
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
systems used by law enforcement agencies
 
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 align:start position:0%
to identify people who purchase
 
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
firearms once the person is on the list
 
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
and in the system they won't be able to
 
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
pass a background check for any type of
 
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
firearm in effect they become a
 
00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
prohibited person should a Firearms
 
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
dealer sell a weapon to one of them
 
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
anyway they would risk the same penalty
 
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
they would for selling a gun to any
 
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
other type of prohibited
 
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
person meanwhile a listed person who
 
00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 align:start position:0%
attempts to buy a firearm would also be
 
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
subject to a penalty but in this
 
00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 align:start position:0%
particular Bill uh We've written that as
 
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
a violation level penalty rather than a
 
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor to class B felony penalty
 
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
that provide to other people who provide
 
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.510 align:start position:0%
that provide to other people who provide
false

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 align:start position:0%
information while my preferences Prime
 
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
sponsor would have been to have no
 
00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
penalty and to avoid the risk of further
 
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
harming a person who may already be in
 
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
crisis one of the first states to pass a
 
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
law like this learned uh the hard way
 
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
that unless the offense actually carries
 
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
a penalty it it can't be entered into
 
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
the next system uh the state of
 
00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:50.199 align:start position:0%
Washington actually had to amend their
 
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
bill later on so they could actually add
 
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
people into the system so for this
 
00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
reason the bill has the lowest penalty
 
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
available to us under our
 
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
law also part of the bill is a provision
 
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
that allows a listed person to apply for
 
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
removal from the list at any time after
 
00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
having been on it for 60 days once the
 
00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
application for removal is received the
 
00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:11.879 align:start position:0%
department of safety would have a
 
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
maximum of 21 days to remove them from
 
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
any federal or state firearms background
 
00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
check database or file there are also
 
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
safeguards in the bill that protect the
 
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
privacy of anyone who appears on the
 
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
list who applies for the list and who is
 
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
removed from the
 
00:07:29.869 --> 00:07:29.879 align:start position:0%
list what this legislation
 
00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:31.639 align:start position:0%
also attempts to do is to strike a
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
balance between authorizing the
 
00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
department of safety to manage the list
 
00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
and having us in the legislature
 
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
micromanage them however if you believe
 
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
that there are key parts of the process
 
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
that need to be changed or that need to
 
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
be spelled out more clearly uh I would
 
00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
ask for your help uh in doing
 
00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
that to date three other states uh Utah
 
00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:53.879 align:start position:0%
Virginia and Washington State have
 
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
passed legislation like this in Utah the
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
bill had the full support of the gun
 
00:07:58.639 --> 00:07:59.869 align:start position:0%
bill had the full support of the gun
community

00:07:59.869 --> 00:07:59.879 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
in Washington state after some glitches
 
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
with the initial signup process uh they
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
found it was helpful to amend the law to
 
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
authorize Healthcare Providers to submit
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
the necessary paperwork with the patient
 
00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
authorization now this is not part of
 
00:08:16.149 --> 00:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
the bill that's before us today uh but I
 
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
do want to make you aware that the
 
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
sponsors of the bill told me that this
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
change did result in a substantial
 
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
uptick uh in signups so it's something
 
00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
we could
 
00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
consider one piece of information I'll
 
00:08:28.749 --> 00:08:28.759 align:start position:0%
leave you with is a survey conducted of
 
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
people at RIS for suicide when asked if
 
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:33.919 align:start position:0%
they would sign up for a list like this
 
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
46% of them said they
 
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
would the bottom line is with this bill
 
00:08:43.149 --> 00:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
nobody's guns are taken away if a person
 
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
decides to voluntarily give up their
 
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:47.320 align:start position:0%
right to purchase a firearm there is a
 
00:08:49.949 --> 00:08:49.959 align:start position:0%
process for them to get that right back
 
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
if they decide that's what they
 
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
want you may ask why do we need a bill
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
like this when people can simply decide
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
not to buy a
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
gun let me read you part of an email I
 
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
got from a doctor who supports the bill
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
and survived a suicide attempt that
 
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
didn't involve a firearm a few years
 
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:11.240 align:start position:0%
ago he writes by limiting access to high
 
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
lethality means of suicide we can
 
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:15.800 align:start position:0%
provide people like me who struggle with
 
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:18.200 align:start position:0%
Suicidal Thoughts with a tool to protect
 
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
themselves in the event of foreseeable
 
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
Mental Health
 
00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:24.519 align:start position:0%
crisis as a person who has previously
 
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:26.680 align:start position:0%
attempted suicide I know that I am
 
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
dramatically at increased lifetime risk
 
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
for another suicide
 
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
attempt so what we have here is people
 
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
in this situation they know themselves
 
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
and they know their vulnerabilities and
 
00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
they know them far better than we do
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
they know there are times when they may
 
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
not have total control over their
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
emotions and their actions when it comes
 
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
to doing themselves
 
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
harm by taking this simple step we can
 
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
take the quickest the deadliest in our
 
00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
state the most common form of suicide
 
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
off the table for people who simply go
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
the extra step of asking us to take it
 
00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:06.279 align:start position:0%
off the
 
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
table and with that I'll take any
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
questions the committee has on the
 
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
bill thank you representative I I see
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
the other states have done it what what
 
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
I'm curious about is the interaction
 
00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:21.079 align:start position:0%
with the federal laws do the federal
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
laws allow this that the um FBI has
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
allowed these states to put these names
 
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
in and withdraw them with no problems
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
they do and have you tracked the success
 
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
as far as the number of people who have
 
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
signed up for this in those various
 
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
States yeah I I think one of the issues
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh I believe in Washington DC was that
 
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:42.200 align:start position:0%
initially as anytime there's a change in
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
the law it can be difficult getting the
 
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
word out to the right people um so one
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
of the things that that they did to
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
actually uh uh make more people aware of
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
it was a campaign to actually make more
 
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
physicians in the state aware of it and
 
00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
one of the things that they did to
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
supplement that was they actually
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
created a process that allows a
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
physician to have that conversation with
 
00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
a patient get their authorization so
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a wet signature type
 
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
of an authorization and then transmit
 
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:12.680 align:start position:0%
the paperwork uh to the people in the
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
state who in in in in Washington state
 
00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
who then send it on to the federal
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
government so that is not in this bill
 
00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:24.279 align:start position:0%
um it's something that could be in the
 
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:25.839 align:start position:0%
bill if we thought it was a good idea
 
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
but I think the the most important thing
 
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
right now is just to get this process
 
00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
underway and to get something started
 
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
and if we decide uh perhaps there are
 
00:11:37.389 --> 00:11:37.399 align:start position:0%
better ways to do it or there are ways
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
we can supplement it to make it more
 
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
effective those are things that we can
 
00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:42.839 align:start position:0%
consider down the
 
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
road thank you I noticed that there's a
 
00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:47.240 align:start position:0%
a significant fiscal note what are your
 
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that as far as um what's
 
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
been given to us I I saw that too and
 
00:11:52.829 --> 00:11:52.839 align:start position:0%
and you know having been a member on
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
this committee and having seen fiscal
 
00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
notes several times um I I think one of
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
the reasons why why we we I wanted to
 
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
make sure we gave the department of
 
00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
safety wide latitude is because I know
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
that um they're not a wash in cash no
 
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department is um given the
 
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
number of people who might be on a list
 
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
like this uh it might be something uh
 
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
that could be managed it could be
 
00:12:17.949 --> 00:12:17.959 align:start position:0%
managed with a database that needs to be
 
00:12:19.389 --> 00:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
set up it could be managed with an
 
00:12:21.629 --> 00:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
existing database it could be managed
 
00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
with a spreadsheet um there are a bunch
 
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
of different ways to manage it I'm a
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
little puzzled at the need to add two
 
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
employees to manage to manage the
 
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
process uh uh I I I think part of Again
 
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
part of the reason for giving them the
 
00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:37.839 align:start position:0%
flexibility is uh so we don't have to
 
00:12:39.629 --> 00:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
design something that's over overly
 
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
elaborate we can design something that
 
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
meets the need hopefully with the
 
00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:45.399 align:start position:0%
Personnel that the department of safety
 
00:12:47.189 --> 00:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
already has but I'm I'm sure we'll hear
 
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
from them on that too thank you
 
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
committee representative um excuse me
 
00:12:58.509 --> 00:12:58.519 align:start position:0%
read thank you Mr chairman a couple qu
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
two two questions if I may um I'm sorry
 
00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
could you speak into your mic so um the
 
00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
when once somebody puts themselves on on
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
the list um how difficult is it to get
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
your name off of after the 60 days or
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
whatever and do people actually go back
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
and take their names off um and um how
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
you know that's three okay then that's
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
it thank you very very from what I've
 
00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
heard and I've and I actually had
 
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
conversations with the Washington
 
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor and uh from what I understand
 
00:13:36.389 --> 00:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
very few people take themselves off the
 
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
list once they're on it but I think it's
 
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
very important that we have a process in
 
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
place for people who want to do that so
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh the way that the bill envisions that
 
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
process working is there would be a
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
separate application uh that would be
 
00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:50.519 align:start position:0%
available from the Department of Safety
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
to remove yourself from the list uh and
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
the department of safety would have 21
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
days once that's submitted to make that
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
happen um the the thing I think that we
 
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
try we're we try to avoid is in a lot of
 
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
situations you in these situations we're
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
talking about people who know they're
 
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
prone to severe depression they know
 
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
they're prone to bipolar epod episodes
 
00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
so these are people who a lot of the
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
time I mean they're just as functional
 
00:14:21.949 --> 00:14:21.959 align:start position:0%
as we are I mean there there's no issue
 
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
um but then they can hit one of those
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
points and and the issue is when they
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
hit one of those points um one of the
 
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
things that that they want in
 
00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:34.759 align:start position:0%
participating in you know in in on a
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
list like this is they want to be able
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
to take their access to purchasing a
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
firearm off the table you know their
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
ability to do themselves harm by the by
 
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
basically the most lethal means
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
available so there are processes um uh
 
00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:52.839 align:start position:0%
that are you know that in the bill that
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
are in the bill that uh speak to that
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
there are also things in the bill that
 
00:14:59.629 --> 00:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
speak to the Privacy uh the Privacy
 
00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
rights of the people who are actually on
 
00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
the list and and one of the things I
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make clear to everybody
 
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
too is that if you're if you're actually
 
00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:10.519 align:start position:0%
list you know get on the list for this
 
00:15:10.519 --> 00:15:12.069 align:start position:0%
list you know get on the list for this
reason

00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
um a nobody at a gun store would
 
00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
actually know why you're a prohibited
 
00:15:20.949 --> 00:15:20.959 align:start position:0%
person they wouldn't know that you
 
00:15:22.749 --> 00:15:22.759 align:start position:0%
voluntarily uh they wouldn't they
 
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:25.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know the difference between uh
 
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
somebody who's on this list and let's
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
say somebody who is a convicted felon
 
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:31.160 align:start position:0%
you're both prohibited people and that's
 
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
the way it works and because this is a
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
federal list this would pertain to other
 
00:15:40.269 --> 00:15:40.279 align:start position:0%
states as well not just New Hampshire so
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
once you were listed you would not only
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
be listed in New Hampshire you would be
 
00:15:44.279 --> 00:15:45.629 align:start position:0%
be listed in New Hampshire you would be
listed

00:15:45.629 --> 00:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
listed
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
federally follow-up question okay um
 
00:15:49.519 --> 00:15:51.269 align:start position:0%
federally follow-up question okay um
representative

00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
Pratt has a lot of questions I have I'm
 
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
just going to ask a couple um the cost
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
of 354,000 for three years uh we talked
 
00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:00.839 align:start position:0%
about you talked about a simple
 
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet uh this is an awesome
 
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility that the government and
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
the gun owners are taking over a
 
00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility that the person is not
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
responsible for themselves so uh what is
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
the liability if an error is made in
 
00:16:18.189 --> 00:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
this simple spreadsheet if a person buys
 
00:16:21.069 --> 00:16:21.079 align:start position:0%
a gun that's not supposed to buy a gun
 
00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
the liability of a person who buys a gun
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
that wasn't on the list because of an
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
error oh who's who's on who's on the
 
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
list so there is for the person who for
 
00:16:33.069 --> 00:16:33.079 align:start position:0%
the person who's listed who tries to buy
 
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:35.720 align:start position:0%
a gun it's a violation level penalty so
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
there is a penalty we have to have that
 
00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
or NYX won't actually let us list it in
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
the in the system for the dealer who who
 
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
would actually if so for instance if a
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
dealer sees that this is a prohibited
 
00:16:51.069 --> 00:16:51.079 align:start position:0%
person and sells the gun gun anyway the
 
00:16:53.069 --> 00:16:53.079 align:start position:0%
same penalties would apply to the
 
00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
Firearms dealer as if they would have
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
sold a felon a firearm so there's and
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
and again the dealer has no way of
 
00:17:04.029 --> 00:17:04.039 align:start position:0%
knowing so that and I I I think that's
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
the way we want our lot of work anyway
 
00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
followup J just one quick followup uh
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
that's not exactly what I meant so say
 
00:17:16.029 --> 00:17:16.039 align:start position:0%
an error is made on creating this list
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
somehow the person isn't on the list the
 
00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
gun own sells them the gun and the
 
00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
person uses the gun um in the wrong way
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
now who is responsible for that there's
 
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
got to be a liability if you're going to
 
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
keep a list so you're saying if a person
 
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
applies to be on the list and then
 
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
somehow they're not put on the list I
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
mean we're talking simple spreadsheets
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
to the extreme of 354,000 for three
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
years so you're talking two different
 
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
ranges of list here if this list isn't
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
done correctly who is liable if somebody
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
buys a gun and they thought they were on
 
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.190 align:start position:0%
buys a gun and they thought they were on
a

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
list it's a good question I mean there
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
you know I think one of the things that
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
you try to do when you establish a
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
process like this is to you know you you
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
try to create and and I think this is
 
00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
one of the things where it'll be
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
important to actually get some feedback
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
on realistically how quickly we can make
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
some of these things happen but once we
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
actually agree to that those are
 
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
parameters that we really do need to
 
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:12.280 align:start position:0%
stick with uh because these are people
 
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
you know who are prone to incidents like
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
this so I mean I it's a little bit of a
 
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
kind of a a wh if question is this a
 
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
possibility you know that that there
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
could be some liability if the list
 
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:28.360 align:start position:0%
somehow is mismanaged um I I guess Poss
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
posibly but that's that's really all I
 
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
representative so not quite a question
 
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
but maybe a clarification for the bill
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
and I I know this is going to sound cold
 
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
and hard but I I just dealt with this in
 
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
another bill that um a relative of mine
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
was put on a a list that's on a
 
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
website uh and I asked she actually
 
00:18:59.310 --> 00:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
passed and I asked asked for them to be
 
00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:01.799 align:start position:0%
removed from the list and there was no
 
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
way for them to remove her from the list
 
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:06.799 align:start position:0%
which which list so this is for the EMS
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
board disciplinary list that comes up on
 
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.070 align:start position:0%
board disciplinary list that comes up on
a

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:19:12.909 --> 00:19:12.919 align:start position:0%
website and her name is going to stay
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
there forever but I have a bill coming
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
back to this committee that will allow
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
the director to remove deceased people
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
from a list right she can't come back
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
for a job so I would think that you
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
might want to put a provision in here
 
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
so the family could go remove them if
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
they so desired but right now there it's
 
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.390 align:start position:0%
they so desired but right now there it's
on

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:37.720 align:start position:0%
indefinitely right so even if that
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
person passes away from old
 
00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
age they can't remove that name from the
 
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
list it has to stay in the spreadsheet
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
forever and and I would I wouldn't think
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
that would be the way but I just
 
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
experience it it doesn't say they can
 
00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
take them off they can't take them off
 
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
and I think what you're saying is that
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
there's a it's it's important to have a
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
process for removing people from you
 
00:20:03.549 --> 00:20:03.559 align:start position:0%
know from a list like this I would agree
 
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
even not the person themselves the
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
family member or or something else that
 
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
wants that name removed out of
 
00:20:12.909 --> 00:20:12.919 align:start position:0%
documentation for whatever reason you
 
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
mean if the person is no longer with us
 
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
right yeah okay I I guess I guess I can
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
understand that the for clarification
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
representative if if this is to be
 
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
handled the way that normally people um
 
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
who are submitted for prohibited persons
 
00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
the state should not be maintaining any
 
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
list it should be uploaded to the Nick
 
00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:36.200 align:start position:0%
system and then wiped from the state
 
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
would be the optimal way because I think
 
00:20:40.029 --> 00:20:40.039 align:start position:0%
we don't want the state maintaining list
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
of people they submit it to NX it's in
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
there once it's in there it's not the
 
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
state's responsibility anymore is that
 
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
the way you understand it or do you
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
understand it to be that dos would keep
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
a list of
 
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
people I I think that's I think for the
 
00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:55.720 align:start position:0%
purpose of making sure that people I
 
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
mean you know part of it is the the
 
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:00.200 align:start position:0%
request the request to get off the list
 
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
needs to be managed um at the state
 
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
level and to do that the state actually
 
00:21:05.789 --> 00:21:05.799 align:start position:0%
probably needs to know who's on the list
 
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
and maybe they can do that once once
 
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
actually you know kind of thinking it
 
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
through um they would probably be able
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
to just get that information from Nick
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
you know just do a download who are all
 
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:17.720 align:start position:0%
the people who are currently listed for
 
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
this particular reason so I I I don't
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
think we really have an
 
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
issue representative Stone thank you
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
chairman Roy and thank you for taking my
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
question can you you tell me under what
 
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
current federal law guarantees they'd
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
have to honor a state's request to
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
remove somebody upon request from the
 
00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:37.559 align:start position:0%
next database under what federal law I
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
can't I I can't tell you I don't have my
 
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
Federal Register in front of me are you
 
00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:45.559 align:start position:0%
aware that uh Nicks is solely the
 
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the federal
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
government yes and you're also aware
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
that the state uh basically has to make
 
00:21:54.269 --> 00:21:54.279 align:start position:0%
a request they can't
 
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
employ also aware that there are people
 
00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
who are are are listed and and Dlisted
 
00:22:03.149 --> 00:22:03.159 align:start position:0%
um we do that for protective orders and
 
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
things of that nature um this is
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
something that um we have experience
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
with uh as a state it's something that
 
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
the folks who run the Nick system have
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
experience with as well um and I I don't
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
think it's a showstopper in this
 
00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
case she no further questions thank you
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
for your T
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
who represent
 
00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.630 align:start position:0%

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
Balden
 
00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:33.400 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of um short-term
 
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:36.200 align:start position:0%
conditions such as um being uh
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
institutionalize for mental health issue
 
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
that while
 
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
shortterm affect uh someone's ability to
 
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
purchase a firearm forever I I think I
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
understand the law correctly um so would
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
this if someone is listed and then
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
delisted that's short term um does that
 
00:22:58.269 --> 00:22:58.279 align:start position:0%
play a role in their ability to buy buy
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
a gun in the
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
future if there're do like do you have
 
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
any sense of whether it would be a
 
00:23:07.909 --> 00:23:07.919 align:start position:0%
consider voluntary a completely
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
voluntary process so one of the things
 
00:23:12.029 --> 00:23:12.039 align:start position:0%
that's really important to understand
 
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
about this is you cannot be put on this
 
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
list by a relative by a police officer
 
00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:19.640 align:start position:0%
you know by a by a judge um nobody can
 
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
put this on your on you can put you on a
 
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
list like this except yourself um it it
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's totally
 
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.830 align:start position:0%
it's totally
voluntary

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
voluntary
 
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:49.720 align:start position:0%
Moren hello um this bill allows a person
 
00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
to surrender their second amendment
 
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
rights for whatever reason and be kept
 
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
on a list so if they attempt to purchase
 
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
a firearm after voluntarily being put
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
out on put on this list they will be
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
unable to we've established that if a
 
00:24:04.669 --> 00:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
person is suicidal they are most likely
 
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
not in any mental health condition to
 
00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
make sound choices such as giving up
 
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
their fundamental human right to
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
self-defense if a person attempts to
 
00:24:14.269 --> 00:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
practice their Second Amendment right
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
while being on the list they will be in
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
violation this bill is so poorly written
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't even explain what the P
 
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
penalty actually is but they'll become a
 
00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
felon if they according to federal law
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
if they try to purchase a fire while
 
00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:30.559 align:start position:0%
still remaining on this list and New
 
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire currently doesn't have any way
 
00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
for a person to get off that list it
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
would cost them thousands of dollars to
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
go the federal route to try to get off
 
00:24:41.789 --> 00:24:41.799 align:start position:0%
that nics list the gun control crowd is
 
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
once again using suicide as an excuse to
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
push more gun control this bill is a
 
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
self-induced red flag bill that doesn't
 
00:24:50.909 --> 00:24:50.919 align:start position:0%
provide mental health help for anyone
 
00:24:52.669 --> 00:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
it's discriminatory in that it only
 
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
applies to Gun Owners or potential gun
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
owners and if passed could open a
 
00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
Pandora's Box for for Bloomberg's red
 
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:00.600 align:start position:0%

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%

legislation please vote inexpedient to
 
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
legislate on this poorly written and
 
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
poorly thought out bill that claims to
 
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
be about stopping suicides when it will

safety in New Hampshire I'm sure you're
 
00:26:17.549 --> 00:26:17.559 align:start position:0%

suicides our rate of gun violence is
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
simply tragic and far
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
surpasses the rates of other similar

societies I've testified here in the
 
00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:36.039 align:start position:0%
house for years on this issue but
 
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the will to pass Common
 
00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:41.720 align:start position:0%
Sense gun violence laws still eludes Us
 
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
in New
 
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire although it is certainly true
 
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
that laws cannot remove the risk of
 
00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
Violence by Firearms completely many
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
stud Studies have shown that Common
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
Sense gun violence laws can reduce the
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
risk of gun violence
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
substantially in New Hampshire suicide
 
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
by Firearms Is tragically far too
 
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
prevalent as a psychiatrist I've had two
 
00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:14.120 align:start position:0%
men who shot themselves in their heads
 
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
and died just in the last two
 
00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.710 align:start position:0%
and died just in the last two
years

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
hb150 is a relatively simple and
 
00:27:25.389 --> 00:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
straightforward statute allowing persons
 
00:27:25.399 --> 00:27:26.510 align:start position:0%
straightforward statute allowing persons
who

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.110 align:start position:0%
who
self-identify

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
self-identify
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
voluntarily as at risk of harming
 
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
themselves to be listed again
 
00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.909 --> 00:27:44.919 align:start position:0%
list and to and that would prevent them
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
from purchasing a firearm the statute
 
00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.039 align:start position:0%
also as described
 
00:27:50.039 --> 00:27:51.870 align:start position:0%
also as described
by

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
uh representative representative Muse
 
00:27:58.269 --> 00:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
has a mechanism for being removed from
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
this do do not sell list please consider
 
00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
supporting hb150 so we can reduce
 
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
somewhat the high rate of suicide in New
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
you represent Reed thank you Mr chairman
 
00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
in in your opinion can who is more
 
00:28:23.909 --> 00:28:23.919 align:start position:0%
likely to use um a gun uh in a suicide
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
situation somebody who has a
 
00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:27.799 align:start position:0%
pre-existing Med mental health condition
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
like bipolar or you know schizophrenia
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
or whatever or somebody in a crisis
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
situation so if somebody's in a crisis
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
situation um are they more likely to use
 
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:43.480 align:start position:0%
a gun as opposed to somebody with a a
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
and my point of the question is is um
 
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
how effective a list would be if if
 
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
people who commit suicide are most
 
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
likely in a situational crisis um
 
00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
episode well some people people who have
 
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
a mental health disorder recognize that
 
00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:06.919 align:start position:0%
at certain points they may be suicidal
 
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
and those people and it might just be a
 
00:29:11.789 --> 00:29:11.799 align:start position:0%
small number of people we don't really
 
00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
know might agree to
 
00:29:17.509 --> 00:29:17.519 align:start position:0%
voluntarily give up their right to
 
00:29:22.509 --> 00:29:22.519 align:start position:0%
purchase a gun so that when the uh
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
emergency episode occurs they would be
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
prevented and they would know that they
 
00:29:31.149 --> 00:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
would be prevented from uh purchasing a
 
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:41.240 align:start position:0%
safety followup so this offers minimal
 
00:29:43.149 --> 00:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
protection to the people that are really
 
00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:46.039 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable the ones that are having
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
a sudden crisis incident correct is do
 
00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
you see it that way uh probably that's
 
00:29:55.149 --> 00:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
probably true um in other words this
 
00:29:59.070 --> 00:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
bill might save some people but it's
 
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
certainly not going to save everyone
 
00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:07.480 align:start position:0%
from uh uh from suicide by guns
 
00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.470 align:start position:0%
from uh uh from suicide by guns
represent

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
sik thank you and thank you for taking
 
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
my question um for people who for
 
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
whatever is going on in their lives have
 
00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.350 align:start position:0%
whatever is going on in their lives have
suicidal

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
suicidal
 
00:30:21.789 --> 00:30:21.799 align:start position:0%
idation um does that tend to be a
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
one-time occurrence for the majority of
 
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
them or is it something that um unless
 
00:30:28.269 --> 00:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
they're success uccessful at committing
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
suicide um tends to recur with you know
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
over time it tends to occur reoccur uh
 
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
during crisis when faced with a variety
 
00:30:45.549 --> 00:30:45.559 align:start position:0%
of stressors we ask a followup thank you
 
00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
and so for people who may have had um a
 
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
suicidal episode and survived
 
00:30:56.629 --> 00:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
it um who seek treatment and recognize
 
00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
that they're
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
likely is a bill like this in your
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
opinion more or less likely to save even
 
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
one life it it might because if if we
 
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
have this bill Ava available let's say
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
that I have a patient who has tried to
 
00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
kill themselves maybe not with a gun
 
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
because most likely with a gun it would
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
be successful but if they've tried to
 
00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:24.919 align:start position:0%
kill themselves and then in therapy or
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
treatment they recognize that this kind
 
00:31:30.509 --> 00:31:30.519 align:start position:0%
of Crisis might occur again then the
 
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
mental health um provider might
 
00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:37.639 align:start position:0%
recommend to them that they might get on
 
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
such a list if we had one and if they do
 
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
then when the next Crisis if it does
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
occur occurs um they would be protected
 
00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
from purchasing a gun thank you
 
00:31:52.399 --> 00:31:53.470 align:start position:0%
from purchasing a gun thank you

00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:55.559 align:start position:0%
Stone thank you chairman waran thank you
 
00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question in your uh
 
00:31:59.549 --> 00:31:59.559 align:start position:0%
professional experience what are the
 
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
other forms of suicide you've dealt with
 
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
with your patients all kinds of I've
 
00:32:06.629 --> 00:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
been a psychiatrist for 50 years all
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
kinds of followup attempts
 
00:32:12.909 --> 00:32:12.919 align:start position:0%
uh drugs
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
overdoses is there a percentage you
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
could clarify of what uh relates to
 
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
Firearms versus drugs for
 
00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.269 align:start position:0%
Firearms versus drugs for
suicide

00:32:22.269 --> 00:32:22.279 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
well suicide by Firearms is uh as has
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
been mentioned is about 90% effective in
 
00:32:33.629 --> 00:32:33.639 align:start position:0%
killing a person
 
00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
overdose uh is much less
 
00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:39.519 align:start position:0%
successful um people also can kill
 
00:32:42.629 --> 00:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
themselves by hanging that's relatively
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
successful there are other means of uh
 
00:32:50.909 --> 00:32:50.919 align:start position:0%
suicide that uh are sometimes successful
 
00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
but there's no uh mechanism of suicide
 
00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
that's more success uccessful in
 
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
succeeding to kill a person than with a
 
00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
you um representative
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
Balden thanks for taking my question um
 
00:33:25.389 --> 00:33:25.399 align:start position:0%
I have a an old friend who
 
00:33:28.509 --> 00:33:28.519 align:start position:0%
um several years years ago was in a car
 
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
accident when I went to visit him in the
 
00:33:34.029 --> 00:33:34.039 align:start position:0%
hospital he's actually a a former rep
 
00:33:37.149 --> 00:33:37.159 align:start position:0%
um I noticed a bruise on his neck and I
 
00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
asked him about it and he said that I
 
00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
was the first person to notice and that
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
that was from when he had tried to hang
 
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
himself and that's when I learned that
 
00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
he spent the prior two weeks quietly
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
going through different methods of
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
attempted suicide first pills then
 
00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
hanging he woke up from the pills the
 
00:33:58.990 --> 00:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
the news broke from the ceiling and then
 
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
he survived the car accident he's pretty
 
00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
displeased with the results so if
 
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
someone like that was in your care and
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
they admitted to you that they had been
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
making an effort um to end their lives
 
00:34:15.629 --> 00:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
but kept surviving and you knew about
 
00:34:20.589 --> 00:34:20.599 align:start position:0%
this um the efficacy of suicide by gun
 
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:23.240 align:start position:0%
would you be recommending like If This
 
00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:25.399 align:start position:0%
Were law would you recommend to such a
 
00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
patient that they voluntarily enroll
 
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
before another episode I think I would
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
certainly suggest uh that they consider
 
00:34:42.109 --> 00:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:44.669 --> 00:34:44.679 align:start position:0%
list thank you for your
 
00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:53.240 align:start position:0%

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you I'm
 
00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
representative sah ORS and I'm here to
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
testify in favor of not going forward
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
with this bill you know people forget
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
history lessons and it's a shame because
 
00:35:22.829 --> 00:35:22.839 align:start position:0%
gun control started in
 
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
America against the black
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
population the woodro Wilson
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
Administration did not want blacks to
 
00:35:30.119 --> 00:35:31.150 align:start position:0%
Administration did not want blacks to
have

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:33.880 align:start position:0%
firearms they wanted the K clu's Clan to
 
00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
have firearms they wanted other groups
 
00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
to have firearms but not the blacks and
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
historically speaking we've seen this in
 
00:35:44.589 --> 00:35:44.599 align:start position:0%
Europe and it wasn't that many years ago
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
when the Jews were denied firearms and
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
then the Christians were denied
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
firearms and then the Lutheran were
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
denied firearms and we know what the
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
result to that that was 20 million
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
people that could not defend themselves
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
whether it was the ghettos in Warsaw or
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be we seem to keep
 
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
forgetting history and to have people
 
00:36:12.309 --> 00:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
put their name on a list like this I can
 
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
see where they would get coerced into
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
this I've had my mental health issues
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
after living through
 
00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
911 and then my post office was under
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
the anthrax terrorist attack in New
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
Jersey when I'd get a bag of mail and it
 
00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.190 align:start position:0%
Jersey when I'd get a bag of mail and it
was

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
burnt and then I was working in London
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
when the terrorist bomb the buses and
 
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
Subways and then
 
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
just I I don't I don't believe in lucky
 
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
rabbit's foots but then I was in
 
00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
Bingington New York when some guy from
 
00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
Thailand blocked the back exit door of
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
the Civic Center where I was supposed to
 
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:53.560 align:start position:0%
be volunteering and killed 13 people
 
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
that day so I've had my experience
 
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
is and I'll tell you what anybody that
 
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
is healthy and well and doesn't have a
 
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
weapon at their disposal is really
 
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
taking a chance especially if you're
 
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
black and Jewish and Christian in this
 
00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
country as well as Europe you know we we
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
heard testimony that in Europe you know
 
00:37:22.109 --> 00:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
we are the most uh we have the most Mass
 
00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:24.440 align:start position:0%
shoot no we don't the mass shootings in
 
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:26.200 align:start position:0%
Europe are just they're they're about
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
the same what we have is suppression
 
00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
from the media so a couple things I like
 
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
to say in addition to that is there's no
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
such thing is gun violence there are
 
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
weapons and people use weapons but
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
people can use hammers blunts
 
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
instruments when I worked for the
 
00:37:45.309 --> 00:37:45.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense a buddy of mine
 
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
who I worked with he worked in London
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
for about six seven years him and his
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
wife are there and he said when they
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
took away the weapons they used bats or
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
they used hammers or they used the two
 
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
by for so we could do these things but
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
to put people on a list like this you
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
know I can see where a they be coerced
 
00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:07.839 align:start position:0%
in some cases maybe not but the thing
 
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
you got to remember is what if they
 
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
forget to take their name off the list
 
00:38:14.309 --> 00:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
now you've made an innocent person into
 
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
a felon if they forget thank you I'll
 
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
any thank you for your testimony thank
 
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.790 align:start position:0%
any thank you for your testimony thank
you

00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
Slover hello I'm Kathleen Slover I'm
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
from Portsmith New Hampshire and I'm
 
00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
representing myself today uh my son is a
 
00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:50.200 align:start position:0%
proud member of the National Guard he
 
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
just went through boot camp this summer
 
00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
and we are not a military family so this
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
was all new to us
 
00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
um uh I got a pH I usually get phone
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
calls from him on Sunday and I got one
 
00:39:05.589 --> 00:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
on Thursday and my stomach dropped he
 
00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:08.079 align:start position:0%
said Mom I'm fine somebody in our
 
00:39:10.589 --> 00:39:10.599 align:start position:0%
Barracks um died by suicide because he
 
00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
had access to
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
Firearms we've talked a lot about um
 
00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:19.720 align:start position:0%
suicide rates among military personnel
 
00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
and Veterans and you would think as a
 
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
mother I would be looking at the what's
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
happening in the Middle East what's
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
happening at at uh in in South the South
 
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
China Sea after that phone call I went
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
down the rabbit hole because I'm worried
 
00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:37.240 align:start position:0%
about my son he has access to firearms
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
and he's in
 
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
a he's in a profession or he wants to go
 
00:39:44.109 --> 00:39:44.119 align:start position:0%
into the profession full-time which I am
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
supportive of uh once he finishes his
 
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
guard duties um but he's in a profession
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
that any given year it's 40 to 60%
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
higher rate of suicide than the average
 
00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.910 align:start position:0%
higher rate of suicide than the average
population

00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
ation so I went down the rabbit hole and
 
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh according to the US Department of
 
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
Veteran Affairs veterans are more likely
 
00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
to die by Suicide than non- veterans 70%
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
by Firearms 90% of those cases are not
 
00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
with issued not issued Firearms they are
 
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
from personally purchased Firearms
 
00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:21.880 align:start position:0%
researchers surveyed VA patients who had
 
00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
already received mental health treatment
 
00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
to assess their attitudes towards
 
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
voluntary interventions to reduce access
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
to Firearms they were surprised that
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
93% of the respondents were open to a
 
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
low intensity technique such as talking
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
about their gun ownership with their
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
doctor that's not coercion they wanted
 
00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
to talk about their mental health issues
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
and as they related to their gun
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
ownership about 75% of veterans um in
 
00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
this survey also endorsed at least one
 
00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
of the more intensive options to
 
00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:00.280 align:start position:0%
substantially limit access to Firearms
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
like the disposal of the firearm that
 
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
they have or a VA program to store
 
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
firearms on their
 
00:41:10.349 --> 00:41:10.359 align:start position:0%
behalfs voluntary waivers of firearms
 
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
are one tool like the options given in
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
the researchers study to give power to
 
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
those who know they are at risk so they
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
can take po a potentially lifesaving
 
00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
action when utilized in conjunction with
 
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
other gun violence prevention measures a
 
00:41:29.309 --> 00:41:29.319 align:start position:0%
volun waiver can help reduce suicide by
 
00:41:31.829 --> 00:41:31.839 align:start position:0%
firearm as I went down the F uh the
 
00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:33.640 align:start position:0%
rabbit hole I realized the Veterans
 
00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
Affair Association the military the army
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
they have extensive research and
 
00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
programs that military personnel and
 
00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
Veterans can access and I'm really happy
 
00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
that they do uh my son said that when he
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
came home from boot camp he said the
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
number one problem the military has is
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
mental health issues and they are
 
00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
working on it as a mother I have talked
 
00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
and canvased um from gun violence
 
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
prevention measures and I have talked to
 
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists gun owners across the
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
state and they believe in voluntary
 
00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
measures to help people just give them a
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
tool um so I I'll end my testimony with
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
this I feel like the military is doing
 
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
their part they really are we're doing
 
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
our part by educating people I'm
 
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
educating myself as a mother of a son
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
who really wants to go full-time Army
 
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm proud of him and I want him to
 
00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
do that I need you to do your part and
 
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
help the community stay safe and if this
 
00:42:39.309 --> 00:42:39.319 align:start position:0%
is one small measure I think we should
 
00:42:44.109 --> 00:42:44.119 align:start position:0%
take it so please support uh hb150 thank
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your
 
00:42:50.549 --> 00:42:50.559 align:start position:0%
testimony um I have the the study here
 
00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:56.910 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
simin good morning Mr chairman and
 
00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
giving me an opportunity to
 
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
testify uh I usually have prepared
 
00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
testimony I do not on this bill
 
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
there and I've have attended many such
 
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
hearings over the years I'm a federally
 
00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
licensed Firearms dealer and have been
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
so for a shade over four decades three
 
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
of them in New Hampshire so I understand
 
00:43:46.549 --> 00:43:46.559 align:start position:0%
the law both federal and
 
00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
state and I have another competence
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
that's relevant here I'm an
 
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
international economic consultant and
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
I've been that for about 20 years and a
 
00:43:58.549 --> 00:43:58.559 align:start position:0%
corporate international Economist for
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
about 20 years before that so numbers
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
have a certain meaning to
 
00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
me and they should to
 
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
you I suspect that no matter what durus
 
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
were applied to each of you you could
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
not come within 50 million of the number
 
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
of firearms in the United
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
States the number as at end 2022
 
00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
and normally you would have print
 
00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
written testimony from me with specific
 
00:44:33.549 --> 00:44:33.559 align:start position:0%
data sources was
 
00:44:33.559 --> 00:44:35.430 align:start position:0%
data sources was
474

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
474
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
million that data point omits imports
 
00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:42.950 align:start position:0%
million that data point omits imports
from

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
20 21 through 2022 those data have not
 
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:51.160 align:start position:0%
yet been published so that data point
 
00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
474 million is a
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
low-end data point if I put in my
 
00:44:59.309 --> 00:44:59.319 align:start position:0%
guesstimate for imports for each of
 
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:02.200 align:start position:0%
those two years the number of firearms
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
in the United States is certainly over
 
00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.750 align:start position:0%
in the United States is certainly over
480

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
480
 
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
million thus the concept that anyone can
 
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
control something so
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
numerous many of which are highly
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
concealable is
 
00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:25.640 align:start position:0%
absurd gun control is for doomed to fail
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
it doesn't ma unless there's a qualifier
 
00:45:32.349 --> 00:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
unless you are willing to enforce police
 
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
state measures so in Japan there is no
 
00:45:38.109 --> 00:45:38.119 align:start position:0%
private ownership of
 
00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
firearms there's an exception in
 
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
Japan's laws for Olympic competitors but
 
00:45:47.589 --> 00:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
they can't keep their firearms in their
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
homes so obviously the incidence of
 
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
crime involving firearms in Japan is far
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
lower than it is here but I also point
 
00:45:59.630 --> 00:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
out that in Japan police officers can
 
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
enter any private place without a
 
00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
warrant and further that the conviction
 
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
rate for prosecutors in Japan is about
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
99% they don't bring cases unless they
 
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
are going to get a
 
00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:21.160 align:start position:0%
conviction and the rights that we have
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
here for
 
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
example under Miranda Japanese don't
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
have so gun control can be made to
 
00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
work but not
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
here unless you're willing to
 
00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
countenance police state
 
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
measures I've been to Japan several
 
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
times it is a very quote safe place
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
however it's safe in a narrow sense
 
00:46:53.069 --> 00:46:53.079 align:start position:0%
globally the downside to gun control
 
00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
isn't Injustice it is genocide the
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
proposition is very simple it is not
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
possible to murder hundreds of thousands
 
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
or Millions unless and until the
 
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
targeted group and its sympathizers have
 
00:47:12.589 --> 00:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
been disarmed that makes it easier for a
 
00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:17.839 align:start position:0%
genocidal politician Vladimir V Putin go
 
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
President of Russia is potentially one
 
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:22.559 align:start position:0%
such he is not
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
yet but he admires the Soviet regime
 
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
which was
 
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
genocidal so
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
that when anyone votes for gun control
 
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
they're making a statement either one I
 
00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:41.240 align:start position:0%
don't care about genocide or two yes I
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
care about genocide but it couldn't
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
happen here uh and a witness who
 
00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
preceded me talked about Jews in Germany
 
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839 align:start position:0%
it wasn't the disarming of the Jews that
 
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
mattered Jews were
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
0.7% of Germany's population in
 
00:48:03.069 --> 00:48:03.079 align:start position:0%
1933 it was the
 
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:05.720 align:start position:0%
disarming of other
 
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
Germans who on 5 March
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
1933 when an election was held five
 
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
weeks after the Nazis lawfully took
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
office did not support the Nazis they
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
did not get a majority in that election
 
00:48:27.309 --> 00:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
despite Stormtroopers being
 
00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:31.839 align:start position:0%
able to attack other parties candidates
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
and other parties campaign
 
00:48:33.839 --> 00:48:35.870 align:start position:0%
and other parties campaign
events

00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
events
 
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
so the Nazis had to form a coalition to
 
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
get a majority in Mr simp um we have a
 
00:48:44.109 --> 00:48:44.119 align:start position:0%
lot of people to testify today I
 
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate the history lesson it's all
 
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
very interesting but this bill relates
 
00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
to people putting their names on a list
 
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
could you just narrow it down I will
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
conclude there with the following I'm a
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
licensed see I have had two persons
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
denied in the roughly 26 years we have
 
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
had background checks both were denied
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
for things that were fixable I knew I
 
00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
didn't know what the things were but the
 
00:49:13.549 --> 00:49:13.559 align:start position:0%
screeners at the gunline here in conquer
 
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
told me have your customer call us we
 
00:49:19.789 --> 00:49:19.799 align:start position:0%
will tell them what they need to do to
 
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
get to get cleared one did the other I
 
00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:27.160 align:start position:0%
never heard from again my my point is
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
that as a
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
dealer I don't want people coming to me
 
00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:35.720 align:start position:0%
who are going to be denied and usually
 
00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
people contact me and I pre-screen
 
00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
them what folks do not know is that once
 
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
you are in the nick system good luck
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
getting out the federal authorities do
 
00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
not and when I testify later I will set
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
forth the basis for what I'm about to
 
00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
say the federal authorities do not have
 
00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
to respect any State's attempt to remove
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
someone's name from The Nick system we
 
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
have no way to compel
 
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
them and anyone who knows differently
 
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to be
 
00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:19.480 align:start position:0%
educated thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'll be happy
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
to take any
 
00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.309 align:start position:0%
to take any
questions

00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:47.309 --> 00:50:47.319 align:start position:0%
Terrell good morning representative Roy
 
00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
and the committee this is my first time
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
testifying I'll try to be quick and
 
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
forgive me if I break any rules of
 
00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
decorum my name is UC Terell I work at
 
00:50:57.549 --> 00:50:57.559 align:start position:0%
the University of New Hampshire's Cary
 
00:50:59.829 --> 00:50:59.839 align:start position:0%
School of Public Policy but I'm um
 
00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:02.200 align:start position:0%
testifying on my own behalf today I have
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
some remarks a request and an image
 
00:51:08.309 --> 00:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
that's being passed around it is um a
 
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
lot of folks have talked about this as a
 
00:51:12.549 --> 00:51:12.559 align:start position:0%
gun control Bill and this is never I've
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
followed this for a number of years um
 
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh as it's passed in other states it's
 
00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:19.640 align:start position:0%
as it's been introduced federally last
 
00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:21.640 align:start position:0%
year co-sponsored by two very
 
00:51:24.789 --> 00:51:24.799 align:start position:0%
conservative Republicans and if this is
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
a bill about
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
self-control it's about the ability on
 
00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
good days to make choices that protect
 
00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:34.520 align:start position:0%
yourself on bad days when you struggle
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
with mental health you struggle uh in my
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
experience the worst part is not being
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
able to trust your own mind when the bad
 
00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
times come there is total certainty that
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
your loved ones will be better off
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
without you your husband and your
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
children will Thrive after you're gone
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
you realize you're a burden to the world
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
it's hard to explain how clear that
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
realization is and what a relief it is
 
00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
to know that you figured out what's
 
00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:03.400 align:start position:0%
really going on suicide feels like a way
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
to regain
 
00:52:07.589 --> 00:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
control so those are the bad periods but
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
even in the good periods there's this
 
00:52:11.309 --> 00:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
niggling Terror in the back of your mind
 
00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
because you know the disorientation is
 
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
going to hit you again without warning
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
followed by that awful Clarity of the
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
abomination of your
 
00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:23.240 align:start position:0%
existence the idea of voluntarily
 
00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
temporarily confidentially suspending
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
your ability to be buy a firearm would
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
be a tremendous
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
relief as I mentioned I've been
 
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
following this model for many years as
 
00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:37.960 align:start position:0%
it passed in Utah um Washington Virginia
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
it was introduced federally it will be
 
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
introduced in 12 more States this year
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
as I understand it nationally it's
 
00:52:45.789 --> 00:52:45.799 align:start position:0%
called Donna's Law And to be honest many
 
00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
of the questions and concerns that have
 
00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
been raised have already been addressed
 
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
um for example um in a peer-reviewed
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
medical journal a survey of inpatient
 
00:52:57.549 --> 00:52:57.559 align:start position:0%
patients and outpatients of an Alabama
 
00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
um psychiatric institution 46% said that
 
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
they would sign up uh rather than
 
00:53:05.789 --> 00:53:05.799 align:start position:0%
speculation we can learn from other
 
00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:07.720 align:start position:0%
states experiences and I am not an
 
00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
expert by if I'm the both the person who
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
knows the most about this in the room
 
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:14.200 align:start position:0%
about other efforts I'm happy to try and
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you have as I
 
00:53:18.349 --> 00:53:18.359 align:start position:0%
understand it this committee has had
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
recent experience with bipartisanship
 
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
with bail reform with Firearms reporting
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
reporting hb150 is squarely
 
00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
in what New Hampshire stands for we
 
00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:30.440 align:start position:0%
don't require that individuals wear seat
 
00:53:32.789 --> 00:53:32.799 align:start position:0%
bels or motorcycle helmets but we
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
support individuals choices with that
 
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
government infrastructure like the
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
safety standards um in those other
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
examples that give individuals the power
 
00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
to choose to protect themselves again
 
00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
it's about self-control not about gun
 
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
control um so I mentioned in the other
 
00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
uh states that have implemented a
 
00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:55.160 align:start position:0%
voluntary do not sell list to date um
 
00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:57.640 align:start position:0%
Utah was absolutely a bipartisan effort
 
00:53:59.910 --> 00:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
with public um Health officials gun
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
owners and others on a coalition to move
 
00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:05.240 align:start position:0%
this forward Washington wasn't initially
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
but in the most recent Amendment it
 
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
passed with um unanimously in the
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
committee so as a bipartisan effort my
 
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
fervent request is that chair Roy um
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
that others um L lend full-throated
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
support this once this hits the floor um
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
not only is it a know a good idea that
 
00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
saves lives and eles but it also shows
 
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
that we can come together around some of
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
these these issues there's an image an
 
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
analogy from Greek and Roman mythology
 
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
that captures what this bill means to me
 
00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:37.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure it will mean as much to you
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
as it to me but I wanted to offer it to
 
00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
you in case it resonated with some of

project and um I just wanted to offer a
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
couple of views here today um that to me
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
there is something deeply troubling
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
about um
 
00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
legislating um an invitation for someone
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
to abandon their inalienable right um I
 
00:56:41.029 --> 00:56:41.039 align:start position:0%
don't believe it makes any sense or it's
 
00:56:45.069 --> 00:56:45.079 align:start position:0%
possible to legislate love or care or
 
00:56:45.079 --> 00:56:46.510 align:start position:0%
possible to legislate love or care or
Community

00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
Community
 
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
Spirit um someone who is in deep mental
 
00:56:54.309 --> 00:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
distress such as you know if they're
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
suffering from from um bipolar or
 
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
schizophrenia um I'm not a medical
 
00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:03.160 align:start position:0%
professional but I do know people who
 
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
have suffered from that and one of the
 
00:57:09.069 --> 00:57:09.079 align:start position:0%
common um threads is the uh an intense
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
vulnerability to suggestion and also an
 
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
intense paranoia and I don't believe
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
that this kind of
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
bill um would in any way be um in
 
00:57:27.549 --> 00:57:27.559 align:start position:0%
encouraging for someone to put their
 
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
name on a list that a government
 
00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
controls someone who's in mental
 
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
distress like that I just don't see it
 
00:57:39.630 --> 00:57:39.640 align:start position:0%
happening at all but on the plus side
 
00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
there is a group already and I want to
 
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
tell you about them um just briefly um
 
00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:49.480 align:start position:0%
they're called uh hold my guns they're
 
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
an amazing organization and one that
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
needs a lot more attention uh you can
 
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
find out about them on holdy guns. org
 
00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:03.160 align:start position:0%
um they um they have firearm storage
 
00:58:05.069 --> 00:58:05.079 align:start position:0%
they do community outreach crisis
 
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
awareness training mental they are huge
 
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
mental health Advocates and if you um
 
00:58:12.309 --> 00:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
permit me just to read their vision
 
00:58:16.109 --> 00:58:16.119 align:start position:0%
statement which I think is is
 
00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
brilliant um hold my guns is working
 
00:58:21.309 --> 00:58:21.319 align:start position:0%
together within the Firearms Community
 
00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
combined with appropriate Community
 
00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:25.480 align:start position:0%
partner alliances to raise awareness and
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
promote a self-governance
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
non-legislative approach to addressing
 
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
the prevention of suicide theft and
 
00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
accidental shootings we will encourage
 
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:36.839 align:start position:0%
educational and enrichment opportunities
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
that approach stresses contributing to
 
00:58:42.109 --> 00:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
Suicide risk such as Financial Wellness
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
conflict resolution and reac re
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
acclamation after deployment in a way
 
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
that is a matter of fact helpful and in
 
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
the stigma-free environment of
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
partnering gun shops isolation and lack
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
of connectedness which are risk factors
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
for suicide are holistically addressed
 
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
as gun shop customers volunteer
 
00:59:04.109 --> 00:59:04.119 align:start position:0%
shoulder-to-shoulder through community
 
00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
service opportunities available through
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
hold my guns partnering gun shops it is
 
00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839 align:start position:0%
an inevitable that those taking the time
 
00:59:14.109 --> 00:59:14.119 align:start position:0%
to serve others will in turn feel a
 
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
sense of Pride and camaraderie knowing
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
that they are working together to make a
 
00:59:20.349 --> 00:59:20.359 align:start position:0%
difference in their
 
00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:23.240 align:start position:0%
neighborhood it's a beautiful group
 
00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
there is not so far as I know
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
a partnership um here in New Hampshire
 
00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
with them but I just want to say to the
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
committee and I want to let everyone
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
here know that as the state rep for
 
00:59:36.029 --> 00:59:36.039 align:start position:0%
women for gun rights I will do
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
everything now that I know about them to
 
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
get as many Firearms businesses and as
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
many gun supporters as many veterans to
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
support this movement so that there are
 
00:59:50.109 --> 00:59:50.119 align:start position:0%
places for people to go maybe to their
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
local gun shop maybe to to the local
 
00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:54.839 align:start position:0%
shooting range if they own multiple guns
 
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
they know people they they have a
 
00:59:58.710 --> 00:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
favorite spot that they go to to seek
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
advice to look at guns if they're
 
01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:04.200 align:start position:0%

connection with and the more places like
 
01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:14.359 align:start position:0%

you're not on a government list that you
 
01:00:25.029 --> 01:00:25.039 align:start position:0%

tracked I love this group and I urge you
 
01:00:47.309 --> 01:00:47.319 align:start position:0%
to reconsider um any approval of a
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
legislation that would um as I said
 
01:00:53.470 --> 01:00:53.480 align:start position:0%
invite someone to give up a right that
 
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
they have when there are other
 
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
she you filled out two cards did you
 
01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:25.480 align:start position:0%
want to do two different bills or no um
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
representative Muse did a card for me
 
01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
and then he thought it was gone so I did
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
another one just one thank
 
01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.190 align:start position:0%
another one just one thank
you

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:37.160 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my testimony uh
 
01:01:40.589 --> 01:01:40.599 align:start position:0%
this bill is named after another bill
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
called Donna's law and Donna's law is
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
ironically named after a woman whose
 
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
name was Don Nathan that was her
 
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
name I think it's ironic because I'm
 
01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
here today speaking speaking in support
 
01:01:58.950 --> 01:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
of this bill and my name is Donna and my
 
01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:01.640 align:start position:0%
son his name is
 
01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
Nathan and on January 5th
 
01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
2022 Nathan drove to our local gun
 
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
shop and he purchased a
 
01:02:14.589 --> 01:02:14.599 align:start position:0%
gun and 30 minutes later he was back at
 
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
our home and he took that gun and he put
 
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
it to his Temple and he shot
 
01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:24.839 align:start position:0%
himself Donna's law a probably wouldn't
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
have saved Nathan's life I'll be honest
 
01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.510 align:start position:0%
have saved Nathan's life I'll be honest
with

01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
you however this bill would save the
 
01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:36.799 align:start position:0%
life of someone like my daughter or
 
01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
myself so January 5th 2022 was the
 
01:02:44.829 --> 01:02:44.839 align:start position:0%
beginning of the worst days of my
 
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
life rushing to the
 
01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
hospital seeing so much of my son's
 
01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:54.799 align:start position:0%
Blood on the floor of the emergency room
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
and then hearing the doctor say that my
 
01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
beautiful 21-year-old son with this
 
01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
bright future as an engineer was going
 
01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
to live his last hours in extreme
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
pain this is a trauma that no parent
 
01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
should have to go through nobody should
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
so you might say well I bet that was the
 
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
worst day of her life but it
 
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't as horrific as that day was when
 
01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
Nate took his life was that was for
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
me it pales in comparison to the pain I
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
feel every single day knowing that I
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
have to live the rest of my life without
 
01:03:42.029 --> 01:03:42.039 align:start position:0%
him I would relive that day aund times
 
01:03:44.309 --> 01:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
if I could have him back for just five
 
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
minutes I I really
 
01:03:50.549 --> 01:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
would and the pain that I feel every
 
01:03:50.559 --> 01:03:51.990 align:start position:0%
would and the pain that I feel every
single

01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
single
 
01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
day it has brought me to thoughts of
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
suicide and I stay here for my husband
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
for my daughters for my
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
parents because I could not make them
 
01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:06.839 align:start position:0%
live through another
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
suicide but the pain and the thoughts
 
01:04:13.029 --> 01:04:13.039 align:start position:0%
are there all the time I don't want to
 
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
end up putting a gun to my head and
 
01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
pulling the trigger I don't want my
 
01:04:18.670 --> 01:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
family to find my
 
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
body I also know that if I was going to
 
01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:26.039 align:start position:0%
end my life I would make sure it
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
worked because I don't want to end up
 
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
worse off than I am now and I certainly
 
01:04:34.109 --> 01:04:34.119 align:start position:0%
don't want my family having to have to
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
spend the rest of their life taking care
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
of me and depleting our entire savings
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with any medical bills I might
 
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
have so the quickest and most effective
 
01:04:48.789 --> 01:04:48.799 align:start position:0%
way to take my life would be with a
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
gun so I just want to tell you that I
 
01:04:55.230 --> 01:04:55.240 align:start position:0%
have not shared this very personal part
 
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
of myself with literally anybody except
 
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
my therapist nobody
 
01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
nobody knows this except now
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
apparently a movie thing that's going
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
and you guys and all these people here
 
01:05:17.069 --> 01:05:17.079 align:start position:0%
um I'm speaking publicly about this even
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
though it's terrifying because I really
 
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
feel that this bill is that
 
01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
important the goal of this bill is to
 
01:05:27.269 --> 01:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
allow a person like myself to make a
 
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:30.200 align:start position:0%
decision when they are in a calm mind
 
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
and not in emotional distress we already
 
01:05:35.789 --> 01:05:35.799 align:start position:0%
have a precedent for this when people
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
create living wills to decide how long
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
they choose to live before they become
 
01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:42.750 align:start position:0%
they choose to live before they become
physically

01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
physically
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
incapacitated Donna's law has a similar
 
01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
goal in that people can make an advanced
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
directive indicating they don't want to
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
end their life with a
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
firearm when they are are emotionally
 
01:05:59.589 --> 01:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
incapacitated so to protect my family
 
01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:02.200 align:start position:0%
and myself I would put my name on a do
 
01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
not sell list you're asking what kind of
 
01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:07.400 align:start position:0%
person would do it it would be
 
01:06:12.029 --> 01:06:12.039 align:start position:0%
me um just because I want to make sure
 
01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
that I wouldn't be tempted to go down to
 
01:06:18.990 --> 01:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
that same firearm dealer um when I'm not
 
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.230 align:start position:0%
that same firearm dealer um when I'm not
thinking

01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
clearly I don't want to have a moment of
 
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
weakness where I can't see that life's
 
01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
not worth living because it is um and
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
this bill could literally save my life
 
01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
there are many so many people out there
 
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
that simply are having a hard time
 
01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
living and we don't know how to cope and
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
we sometimes feel that an escape is
 
01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
really just the best answer and that's
 
01:06:44.589 --> 01:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
how my son Nathan
 
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
felt but when we get to that place we
 
01:06:50.349 --> 01:06:50.359 align:start position:0%
need to be able to just take a breath
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
and get through the moment I know that
 
01:06:55.789 --> 01:06:55.799 align:start position:0%
there are other lethal means of suicide
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
I realize that you can take your life in
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
a bunch of other ways including like
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
someone else said Hammers and bats and
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
all kinds of things but why not allow
 
01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
people who want to make sure that
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
they're safe from their own hand the
 
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
freedom to make that decision for
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
themselves they can make that decision
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
when they're in a safe State of Mind
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
when somebody kills themselves they're
 
01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
not only destroying their own life but
 
01:07:22.349 --> 01:07:22.359 align:start position:0%
they destroy the lives of everybody
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
around them and and we all know that
 
01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
there's this ripple effect within the
 
01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
community Nate's suicide was not an
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
isolation there were four previous
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
suicides that year at the college he
 
01:07:38.349 --> 01:07:38.359 align:start position:0%
attended his friend had taken his life a
 
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
year and a half earlier passing this law
 
01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
would allow people to protect those
 
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
those that they love by giving them a
 
01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
chance to stay alive and get help I hope
 
01:07:51.069 --> 01:07:51.079 align:start position:0%
I never need this law I anticipate that
 
01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:53.480 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be strong enough and with
 
01:07:55.390 --> 01:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
therapy I'll get to a point where the
 
01:07:58.349 --> 01:07:58.359 align:start position:0%
pain just might not be that intense but
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
why not give someone like me the option
 
01:08:03.309 --> 01:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
to protect my children and my husband
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
from losing me now I teach American
 
01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:09.640 align:start position:0%
government so I'm going to end with that
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
we all know that the second amendment
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
gives us the right to bear arms the
 
01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
ninth amendment is given less attention
 
01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:19.839 align:start position:0%
but it gives citizens rights that are
 
01:08:22.269 --> 01:08:22.279 align:start position:0%
not specified within the text of the
 
01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights
 
01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
the Supreme uh Supreme Court Justice
 
01:08:31.269 --> 01:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
Goldberg he wrote 1965 he said the
 
01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
language in history of the 9th Amendment
 
01:08:35.229 --> 01:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
reveal that the framers of the
 
01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
Constitution believed that there are
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
additional fundamental rights protected
 
01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:43.480 align:start position:0%
from governmental infringement which
 
01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
exist alongside those fundamental rights
 
01:08:48.510 --> 01:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
specifically mentioned in the first
 
01:08:51.390 --> 01:08:51.400 align:start position:0%
eight Constitutional Amendments this is
 
01:08:54.829 --> 01:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
just one of those additional rights
 
01:08:57.070 --> 01:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
a right that a c citizen should have is
 
01:08:59.229 --> 01:08:59.239 align:start position:0%
to be allowed to choose to not have a
 
01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
firearm as a source of Temptation for a
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
mental illness that they are trying to
 
01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
control so often legislators are asking
 
01:09:10.110 --> 01:09:10.120 align:start position:0%
what can we do to help people with their
 
01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
mental health something has to be done
 
01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
well this bill is just one step in
 
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
helping reduce
 
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
suicides so I'll take any questions if
 
01:09:21.789 --> 01:09:21.799 align:start position:0%
you have
 
01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
them thank you very much here testimony
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
and I do have this do do you want this
 
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
sure whatever you want to give us thank
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony and
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
today chair calls William
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:52.749 --> 01:09:52.759 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll try to write better I really
 
01:09:57.070 --> 01:09:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:59.709 --> 01:09:59.719 align:start position:0%
printing thank you for your opportunity
 
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
to speak today I'm I'm kind of nervous
 
01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
but this sounds like a good bill I mean
 
01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
who could be opposed to doing something
 
01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
that might prevent a suicide but it
 
01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
seems to me when when I hear another
 
01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
bill another
 
01:10:21.310 --> 01:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
law I know it's redundant we know that
 
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists have ways to prevent
 
01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
people from from going out and doing
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
things they can lock them up we've got
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
laws to prevent this we don't need
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
another law and every time there's
 
01:10:35.950 --> 01:10:35.960 align:start position:0%
another law there's Administration for
 
01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
that law and that Administration costs
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
money if it's at the state level or the
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
federal level it's going to cost us some
 
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
money and it's we've already got the
 
01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
laws um sure I'm sure it's easy to get a
 
01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
get on the Nicks list for prohibited
 
01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
persons but I know it's as others have
 
01:10:59.950 --> 01:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
testified it's hard to get off that list
 
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
and you may trust I don't well maybe
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
nobody trusts a giant Federal
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy to be able to handle stuff
 
01:11:11.229 --> 01:11:11.239 align:start position:0%
like this they're already overwhelmed
 
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
with laws and and things like that so my
 
01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
concern would be if you got on that
 
01:11:19.870 --> 01:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
Nicks list would be getting it off and
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
second of all like I said there already
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
are laws psychiatrists can use to to to
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
lock people up and what they need to do
 
01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
and they just don't do it so before we
 
01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:33.640 align:start position:0%
pass new laws why don't we find a way to
 
01:11:36.430 --> 01:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
enforce the laws that are already on the
 
01:11:39.229 --> 01:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
books that are already there we don't
 
01:11:42.149 --> 01:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
need more the last thing we need is more
 
01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
more laws and more government and
 
01:11:46.510 --> 01:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
especially more federal government to
 
01:11:50.189 --> 01:11:50.199 align:start position:0%
administrate those laws um so I I think
 
01:11:50.199 --> 01:11:52.149 align:start position:0%
administrate those laws um so I I think
other

01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
people have have um alluded to the same
 
01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.430 --> 01:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
also liability it seems like an easy way
 
01:12:08.270 --> 01:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
for medical professions to put the
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
liability back on the patient so that
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
they can say well they chose to do this
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
rather than them having to decide to you
 
01:12:19.149 --> 01:12:19.159 align:start position:0%
know have a backbone and say okay we're
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
taking away your rights because they can
 
01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
already take away their rights because
 
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
every time I fill out a a form for a
 
01:12:28.629 --> 01:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
background check it says have you ever
 
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
been adjudicated nuts I'm I'm I'm sorry
 
01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
me you know mentally defective or in a
 
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
hospital or anything like that so it's
 
01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
already there and I know that you would
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
not be able to get off the next list
 
01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.870 align:start position:0%
not be able to get off the next list
easily

01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
easily
 
01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
um I think that's
 
01:12:51.629 --> 01:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
all thank you for your
 
01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:04.280 align:start position:0%

I'm here today to speak in strong
 
01:13:28.629 --> 01:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
support of
 
01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
hb150 when an individual is experiencing
 
01:13:32.629 --> 01:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
a mental health crisis limiting their
 
01:13:34.629 --> 01:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
access to lethal means is a crucial step
 
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
in preventing suicide and saving lives I
 
01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
want to further emphasize The lethality
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
of firearms and suicide attempts and
 
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
that Firearms are the most common you
 
01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
method used in Sude attempts and
 
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
suicides deaths make up the majority of
 
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
all firearm deaths hb150 offers a
 
01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
straightforward policy to help prevent
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
suicide by putting agency in the hands
 
01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
of an individual when folks who live
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
with a mental health condition or
 
01:14:01.709 --> 01:14:01.719 align:start position:0%
regularly experience suicidal ideation
 
01:14:03.790 --> 01:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
are doing well they may recognize their
 
01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
potential to be a danger to themselves
 
01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
future echoing the comments of a
 
01:14:10.629 --> 01:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
previous speaker similar to an advanced
 
01:14:12.390 --> 01:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
directive for healthcare decisions this
 
01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
policy is a mechanism by which
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
individuals can formally communicate
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
their wishes for when their
 
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
decision-making may be later impaired in
 
01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
many instances individuals already take
 
01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
similar steps to protect themselves in
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
instance of suicide risk such as asking
 
01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
their loved ones to take possession of
 
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
their firearms or other lethal means
 
01:14:29.629 --> 01:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
when they feel their mental health
 
01:14:31.870 --> 01:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
declining this bill is just one more
 
01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
tool in that crucial toolbx hb150 is
 
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
thoughtful and balanced policy that
 
01:14:39.629 --> 01:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
respects the agency rights and privacy
 
01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
of those who choose to utilize it and it
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
could save lives for these reasons Nami
 
01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire urges the committee to
 
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
recommend OTP for hp150 I can take any
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'll hand in my written
 
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
you attorney Dean did you want to
 
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
testify on this
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:22.199 --> 01:15:23.750 align:start position:0%
 
Dean

01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
Dean
 
01:15:25.310 --> 01:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my testimony
 
01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee good morning
 
01:15:29.709 --> 01:15:29.719 align:start position:0%
and I would ask if this bill be ited for
 
01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
several reasons and just as an aside
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
those of you who might consider hold my
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
guns or recommending them I don't
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
recommend them all I can say is run
 
01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
forest run I've had ffls of mine say
 
01:15:44.189 --> 01:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
have you heard about this hold my guns I
 
01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:47.480 align:start position:0%
go yep probably shouldn't be interested
 
01:15:49.629 --> 01:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
it's not what you think it is um fear
 
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
being tracked and stuff right up there I
 
01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
have a Jewish friend who told me the
 
01:15:58.830 --> 01:15:58.840 align:start position:0%
tractate on divorce was written before
 
01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
the tractate on
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
marriage and I'm not Jewish but I've
 
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
been told tractates are these written
 
01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
guidelines for Jewish people and so his
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
point is there's never a problem put in
 
01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
the world from from their perspective
 
01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:16.280 align:start position:0%
that the solution hasn't already been
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
provided and I think it's relevant to
 
01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:16:23.149 --> 01:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
because if the sponsors were truly
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
concerned about allowing people out of
 
01:16:27.229 --> 01:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
the hotel California where you can check
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
out any time you like but you can never
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
leave they would have written the
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
process and procedure for getting off
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
the list oh we can write all that later
 
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
let's pass this bill and and we can take
 
01:16:40.510 --> 01:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
care of all those things
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
later and the other thing that I would
 
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
note is with the exception of one um
 
01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
testimony testifier or rather there all
 
01:16:52.830 --> 01:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
these studies that say 70 and 80 and 90%
 
01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
of gun owners support this or support
 
01:16:56.590 --> 01:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
that I haven't seen the data brought
 
01:16:58.830 --> 01:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
forth to the committee and I believe
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
they don't exist or if they did they're
 
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
not academically rigorous or not um
 
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed so I would just talk about
 
01:17:10.590 --> 01:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
the actual language of the
 
01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:13.639 align:start position:0%
bill and just think about it from a dumb
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
country girl's practical point of view
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
of which I consider myself despite the
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
fact I'm a lawyer if you look at the
 
01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:23.560 align:start position:0%
first page of the bill and you look at
 
01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
um line
 
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
10 any person enrolled on the list shall
 
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
be ineligible to purchase or otherwise
 
01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
receive ownership of a firearm from a
 
01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
dealer as long as the person's name
 
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
remains on the
 
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
list so what about I'm a shooting
 
01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
instructor and I sometimes say you know
 
01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
people who have lived in New Hampshire
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
all the life go to the New Hampshire
 
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
State Police and run a New Hampshire
 
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
criminal background check comprehensive
 
01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
for analment purposes on yourself and
 
01:17:53.189 --> 01:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
bring it to me before you under the the
 
01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
class and that's as good as I can get
 
01:17:57.550 --> 01:17:57.560 align:start position:0%
that you're not a prohibited
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
person so what if as an introductory
 
01:18:04.510 --> 01:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
classes I Supply Firearms to all the
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
students have I committed a criminal act
 
01:18:10.189 --> 01:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
here but more importantly what's going
 
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
to appear on the New Hampshire State
 
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
Police criminal record
 
01:18:16.590 --> 01:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
check because if they had been arrested
 
01:18:18.669 --> 01:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
charged or convicted of a variety of
 
01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
crimes it's going to appear on that list
 
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
on the record we get from the New
 
01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police
 
01:18:27.189 --> 01:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
but you're saying this can't appear so
 
01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
this person if they want to do that they
 
01:18:30.669 --> 01:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
sign up for my class and come into my
 
01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
class now maybe they aren't going to
 
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
grab one of those guns and commit
 
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
suicide but maybe they just want to
 
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
shoot but it doesn't say anything about
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
possession per se receiving ownership of
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
a firearm but that's not possession
 
01:18:48.149 --> 01:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
they're possessing them in my
 
01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
class next we talk
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
about Nicks
 
01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
NX is not responsive at all if you think
 
01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
here's what I tell my clients if you've
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
tried to buy a gun and been wrongfully
 
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
denied and it was a handgun just sign a
 
01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:05.560 align:start position:0%
release to me I'm going to go to the New
 
01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police gun line I'm
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
going to show them the paperwork and I
 
01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
bet it'll be fixed in no time if you
 
01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
been denied from the
 
01:19:15.870 --> 01:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
feds you can write me a $50,000 check
 
01:19:18.510 --> 01:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
and they go whoa whoa $50,000 check I go
 
01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
yeah $50,000 check because we're
 
01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
probably going to have to sue in federal
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
court they like well what here's an
 
01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
appeal thing and here's this I go yeah I
 
01:19:27.790 --> 01:19:27.800 align:start position:0%
understand all those things just cuz
 
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
they write words on pieces of paper
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean they work rarely going to
 
01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
work the feds have a system supposedly
 
01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
that you can quote challenge a gun
 
01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
denial I have unicorns in my backyard
 
01:19:42.430 --> 01:19:42.440 align:start position:0%
too and so as a practical matter it just
 
01:19:45.950 --> 01:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't work and so we look at this my
 
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
other concern is I think you're going to
 
01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:50.229 align:start position:0%
other concern is I think you're going to
see

01:19:50.229 --> 01:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
situations where people are going to be
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
forced as they said or coursed to sign
 
01:19:58.270 --> 01:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
these I'm mother and you want to live
 
01:19:59.830 --> 01:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
with me anymore and I'm concerned about
 
01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
you my adult child sign one of these
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
forms so you're not staying home with me
 
01:20:07.229 --> 01:20:07.239 align:start position:0%
anymore I'm a
 
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
court um you want to go to jail it's a
 
01:20:12.189 --> 01:20:12.199 align:start position:0%
choice I'm not forcing you you can go to
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
jail for 5 years and you can sign one of
 
01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:14.470 align:start position:0%
jail for 5 years and you can sign one of
these

01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
forms no corion here
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
choice I can think of all these things
 
01:20:22.189 --> 01:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
I'm my your therapist I don't feel
 
01:20:24.430 --> 01:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable treating you unless you sign
 
01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:25.790 align:start position:0%
comfortable treating you unless you sign
this

01:20:25.790 --> 01:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
form and so you ask yourself how many of
 
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
these people are actually going to quote
 
01:20:32.669 --> 01:20:32.679 align:start position:0%
voluntarily sign this form and I
 
01:20:34.270 --> 01:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
respectfully say there's a lot of room
 
01:20:38.510 --> 01:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
for coercion here but then we talk about
 
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
well we can be removed from this but
 
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
here's what's really important to me
 
01:20:45.189 --> 01:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
about the tractate for divorce versus
 
01:20:47.629 --> 01:20:47.639 align:start position:0%
marriage the sponsors haven't prepared
 
01:20:50.350 --> 01:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
the forms and the devil is in the
 
01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
details which courts are going to have
 
01:20:55.629 --> 01:20:55.639 align:start position:0%
jur dition to hear this that's important
 
01:20:57.310 --> 01:20:57.320 align:start position:0%
first thing Court's going to say is
 
01:20:59.310 --> 01:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
attorney Dean show me the statute show
 
01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
me show me what gives me jurisdiction to
 
01:21:03.070 --> 01:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
hear this case and so we're going to be
 
01:21:04.750 --> 01:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
going around like homeless people from
 
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
knocking on every Court door and they're
 
01:21:08.590 --> 01:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
going to say good luck to
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
you but the next thing is we're talking
 
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
21 days let's say a person really wants
 
01:21:17.950 --> 01:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
their time period but now how many days
 
01:21:19.709 --> 01:21:19.719 align:start position:0%
before they actually get their rights
 
01:21:22.990 --> 01:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
back that they quote voluntarily gave up
 
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
well first 21 days after application's
 
01:21:30.990 --> 01:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
been received for removal now then they
 
01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
have to have a hearing but they have a
 
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
hearing in what court and where and who
 
01:21:39.070 --> 01:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
gets to appear and what's the burden of
 
01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
proof those are important things and I
 
01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
can tell you a judge is going to ask
 
01:21:46.030 --> 01:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
both sides to say give me a memo on
 
01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
what's the standards how do I decide
 
01:21:50.110 --> 01:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
these things and that's only fair to the
 
01:21:53.070 --> 01:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
judge and make it easier to the court
 
01:21:56.430 --> 01:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
the other thing is
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
um what about landlords and stuff and
 
01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
they say landlords won't know about this
 
01:22:03.229 --> 01:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
but how do we know if someone is or
 
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
isn't on the list if something isn't
 
01:22:07.310 --> 01:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
being printed on your department of
 
01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:08.310 align:start position:0%
being printed on your department of
safety

01:22:08.310 --> 01:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
record and if it's not being printed
 
01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
there does the department of safety have
 
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
the software and have the capabilities
 
01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
to not put things like this on the
 
01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
record they're passing out I don't know
 
01:22:20.189 --> 01:22:20.199 align:start position:0%
if someone talked to the Department of
 
01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
Safety about this and that's a serious
 
01:22:23.709 --> 01:22:23.719 align:start position:0%
question question that their computer
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:29.709 --> 01:22:29.719 align:start position:0%
out the other thing
 
01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
is they talk about on page two line one
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
list I thought there wasn't supposed to
 
01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
be a list if you're putting in NYX it's
 
01:22:42.830 --> 01:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
going to be integrated with the database
 
01:22:45.030 --> 01:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
I can't imagine for anything that
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
there's a separate list it's all
 
01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
integrated but the question is NX is
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
pulled through every state in the
 
01:22:52.159 --> 01:22:53.709 align:start position:0%
pulled through every state in the
country

01:22:53.709 --> 01:22:53.719 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:22:56.189 --> 01:22:56.199 align:start position:0%
how are we going to restrict what other
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
states ultimately do with this data we
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
can't tell Utah what to
 
01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
do and once it's out there you can't un
 
01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
ring a bell you can't call back a bullet
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't work that way so the
 
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
question is how are we going to protect
 
01:23:15.669 --> 01:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
these people and worse yet just like
 
01:23:15.679 --> 01:23:16.910 align:start position:0%
these people and worse yet just like
swatting

01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
swatting
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
people what if someone swats someone and
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
puts them on the list if I'm a domestic
 
01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
vience abuser and I want to really fix
 
01:23:27.310 --> 01:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
that person's Little Red Wagon be it men
 
01:23:29.669 --> 01:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
or women in addition to fact abusing I'm
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
going to put them on the list so now
 
01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
they go to buy a gun to protect
 
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:33.560 align:start position:0%
themselves from me and they're in a
 
01:23:35.550 --> 01:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
logistical nightmare
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
here so you have to ask yourself how is
 
01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
that going to work but then we go
 
01:23:44.430 --> 01:23:44.440 align:start position:0%
further and if we go down the page on
 
01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
page two and we look at um lines 12 and
 
01:23:52.510 --> 01:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
13 within one business day of receiving
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
enrollment application the department of
 
01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
safety shall submit identification
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
information what identification
 
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
information and again I'm going back to
 
01:24:05.470 --> 01:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
the devil in the details will a passwort
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
passport work will a driver's license
 
01:24:09.510 --> 01:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
work has anyone talk to the Department
 
01:24:10.990 --> 01:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
of Safety about whether or not they have
 
01:24:12.669 --> 01:24:12.679 align:start position:0%
the Manpower in which department is
 
01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
going to handle this because you're
 
01:24:16.189 --> 01:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
telling within one business day that's
 
01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
quick and have submitted a form
 
01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:24.229 align:start position:0%
quick and have submitted a form
voluntarily

01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
voluntarily
 
01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
okay and now here's the question it
 
01:24:31.669 --> 01:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
comes to lines 15 and 16 on page two
 
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
database via the state police online
 
01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
telecommunication spots for inclusion in
 
01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:38.750 align:start position:0%
telecommunication spots for inclusion in
the

01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:41.480 align:start position:0%
NCC so here's the question when I get
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
pulled over by the police and they run a
 
01:24:45.629 --> 01:24:45.639 align:start position:0%
spots thing which is what they're going
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
to do probably the officer before he
 
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
runs up to my vehicle he's going to say
 
01:24:50.669 --> 01:24:50.679 align:start position:0%
oh this vehicle's registered to her
 
01:24:51.870 --> 01:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to see if she's driving it
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
and all these things come up am I a
 
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
wanted felon am I a bank robber is this
 
01:24:59.229 --> 01:24:59.239 align:start position:0%
going to come up that I've signed up to
 
01:25:00.270 --> 01:25:00.280 align:start position:0%
be on the
 
01:25:03.629 --> 01:25:03.639 align:start position:0%
list and what if I'm open carrying then
 
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
he's going to say wait a minute you
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
signed up to be on the Don not buy list
 
01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
and you're open carrying how does this
 
01:25:13.709 --> 01:25:13.719 align:start position:0%
work and so there's a lot of things that
 
01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
haven't been thought out and haven't
 
01:25:16.990 --> 01:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
been considered what is that police
 
01:25:19.229 --> 01:25:19.239 align:start position:0%
officer supposed to
 
01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
do because maybe I say I didn't buy it I
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
already had it I just signed up so I
 
01:25:26.430 --> 01:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
don't buy any more
 
01:25:29.149 --> 01:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
guns but the bottom line is is that
 
01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
going to come up every time they run
 
01:25:35.229 --> 01:25:35.239 align:start position:0%
you and is that does that mean that the
 
01:25:37.149 --> 01:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
police are going to treat mentally ill
 
01:25:39.669 --> 01:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
people differently because I'm looking
 
01:25:43.629 --> 01:25:43.639 align:start position:0%
that like the big red sign on my head
 
01:25:45.109 --> 01:25:45.119 align:start position:0%
because what you're saying is this
 
01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
person is mentally ill or thinks they're
 
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
mentally ill and not strong you know and
 
01:25:51.149 --> 01:25:51.159 align:start position:0%
concerned about their own well-being
 
01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
that they've signed this list so how is
 
01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
that going to work in they're being
 
01:25:58.910 --> 01:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
treated but then we go to line 19 on
 
01:26:02.430 --> 01:26:02.440 align:start position:0%
page two within seven business days of
 
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
receiving an application from a listed
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
person to remove the listed person from
 
01:26:09.390 --> 01:26:09.400 align:start position:0%
the list so we've got they've got 21
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
days then we got seven we're at 28 days
 
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
so you're not wanting to get off the
 
01:26:14.590 --> 01:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
list I'm
 
01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
predicting um the department of safety
 
01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
shall initiate the process to remove the
 
01:26:21.470 --> 01:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
person from the list I thought they were
 
01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
going to court so maybe the department
 
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
of safety is handling this now do they
 
01:26:27.109 --> 01:26:27.119 align:start position:0%
have a special administrative unit
 
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
that's going to do this do they have a
 
01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
dedicated person is that person going to
 
01:26:31.199 --> 01:26:32.990 align:start position:0%
dedicated person is that person going to
be

01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:26:35.550 --> 01:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
trained and these are serious questions
 
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
they might seem to be nitpicky but if
 
01:26:40.270 --> 01:26:40.280 align:start position:0%
you're the person that gets signed up
 
01:26:42.270 --> 01:26:42.280 align:start position:0%
correctly or incorrectly or you change
 
01:26:45.629 --> 01:26:45.639 align:start position:0%
your mind how is this going to work to
 
01:26:47.950 --> 01:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
remove that person from any state or
 
01:26:49.629 --> 01:26:49.639 align:start position:0%
federal list or database that would
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
identify them as a prohibited person for
 
01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
the per purpose of purchasing or taking
 
01:26:58.109 --> 01:26:58.119 align:start position:0%
ownership from a firearm or
 
01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
dealer so the question you're going to
 
01:27:05.669 --> 01:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
ask this says shall initiate the process
 
01:27:07.229 --> 01:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say that they shall have
 
01:27:09.510 --> 01:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
completed the process within a certain
 
01:27:11.310 --> 01:27:11.320 align:start position:0%
period of time what is there to initiate
 
01:27:14.350 --> 01:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
a process if a person has asked to be
 
01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
off at you've got 21 days you got 7 days
 
01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
why isn't it as simple as when you're
 
01:27:22.189 --> 01:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
convicted of XYZ they put you in the
 
01:27:25.629 --> 01:27:25.639 align:start position:0%
database takes 2 seconds you're now in
 
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
you get a DVP order against you in the
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
database right in there why are you not
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
switch o change o taken out the same way
 
01:27:38.910 --> 01:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
they would if they put you in um but
 
01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
here's the larger issue I have had case
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
after case where you anull things or
 
01:27:46.350 --> 01:27:46.360 align:start position:0%
have things impr that were improperly
 
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
removed and Nick sometimes will not
 
01:27:51.790 --> 01:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
remove them and there're the big grill
 
01:27:54.750 --> 01:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
in the room and they're like make me and
 
01:27:57.550 --> 01:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
so a person who's mentally ill or
 
01:27:59.669 --> 01:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
struggling if they're truly on a road to
 
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
recovery and change their mind then the
 
01:28:04.350 --> 01:28:04.360 align:start position:0%
issue is how they going to handle this
 
01:28:05.350 --> 01:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
are they going to have to fight with
 
01:28:09.030 --> 01:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
nyck to get themselves out okay now
 
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
within 30 um here's the next thing this
 
01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:15.800 align:start position:0%
section shall not apply to a listed
 
01:28:18.030 --> 01:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
person who's also prohibited from
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
purchasing or possession of firearm
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
because of a criminal offense or
 
01:28:23.189 --> 01:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
protective order
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
I think you better think that one
 
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
through really carefully and here's the
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
reason protective orders are usually
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
good for a set period of time and they
 
01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
expire so if a person wants to
 
01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
voluntarily put themselves on this no
 
01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:40.280 align:start position:0%
gum byy list and you say well we're not
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
going to put them in here because
 
01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
they're already subject to a protective
 
01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
order I bet the protective order has an
 
01:28:47.550 --> 01:28:47.560 align:start position:0%
end date and so you're not going to be
 
01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
solving your problem if you don't put
 
01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
them in there because the protective
 
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
order ends now they're not prohibited
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
the other thing is people get their
 
01:28:59.109 --> 01:28:59.119 align:start position:0%
crimes annulled all the time so you may
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
be prohibited because you have a bunch
 
01:29:02.709 --> 01:29:02.719 align:start position:0%
of convictions but if you get them
 
01:29:04.990 --> 01:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
annulled during the same time this
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
protective order for voluntarily no buy
 
01:29:10.189 --> 01:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be in place again is that
 
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
going to be a 42 USC
 
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
1983 or other charge against the
 
01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
government massive lawsuits because they
 
01:29:18.550 --> 01:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
didn't enter it because they were told
 
01:29:20.990 --> 01:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
not to because of this you have to think
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
now you're telling them about purchasing
 
01:29:29.390 --> 01:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
not allowed but I think the most
 
01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
interesting part is found on page
 
01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:34.109 align:start position:0%
interesting part is found on page
three

01:29:34.109 --> 01:29:34.119 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
and this is a case where it is
 
01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely word
 
01:29:42.030 --> 01:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
salad and if you look at line three says
 
01:29:44.189 --> 01:29:44.199 align:start position:0%
neither a voluntary waiver of firearm
 
01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
rights nor a revocation of voluntary W
 
01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
for fire right shall be considered by a
 
01:29:52.510 --> 01:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
court in any legal proceeding that says
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
shell a judge is going to say this tells
 
01:29:58.830 --> 01:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
me shell Shell's mandatory but you go
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
down a couple three lines and it says
 
01:30:06.189 --> 01:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
lines 10 11 and 12 any person appearing
 
01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
on the list with knowledge that person
 
01:30:09.790 --> 01:30:09.800 align:start position:0%
has voluntarily waved a person's right
 
01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
to purchase a farm and who attempts to
 
01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
purchase a farm from a federal license
 
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
dealer should be guilty of a
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
violation well you're going to try and
 
01:30:20.510 --> 01:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
bring that evidence into court and the
 
01:30:22.629 --> 01:30:22.639 align:start position:0%
judge is going to say
 
01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
I can't consider it and they're going to
 
01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
prosecutor is going to say but it says
 
01:30:29.109 --> 01:30:29.119 align:start position:0%
anybody shall be guilty of a violation
 
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639 align:start position:0%
and the judge is like that's great show
 
01:30:32.590 --> 01:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
me other evidence you have but I can't
 
01:30:34.709 --> 01:30:34.719 align:start position:0%
look at that because lines three and
 
01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
four says shall not be considered by any
 
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
Court uh or shall sh shall be considered
 
01:30:46.669 --> 01:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry neither a waiver nor voluntary
 
01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:49.480 align:start position:0%
um shall be considered okay so it says I
 
01:30:52.270 --> 01:30:52.280 align:start position:0%
can't consider it we go down further any
 
01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
person lines 13 through 15 any person
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
who knowingly gives any false
 
01:30:59.310 --> 01:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
information who makes any false
 
01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
statement with the intent of enrolling
 
01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
or removing another person onto or from
 
01:31:08.590 --> 01:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor so the question is are these
 
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
same forms not going to be allowed into
 
01:31:16.229 --> 01:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
court so you say that you're going to
 
01:31:18.109 --> 01:31:18.119 align:start position:0%
keep people from essentially swatting
 
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
other people but if those forms are not
 
01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:22.390 align:start position:0%
other people but if those forms are not
admissible

01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
admissible
 
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
how's that going to work so that means
 
01:31:27.709 --> 01:31:27.719 align:start position:0%
really that I a bad person can with
 
01:31:31.709 --> 01:31:31.719 align:start position:0%
impunity SWAT whoever they want because
 
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
the evidence is not going to be
 
01:31:35.950 --> 01:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
admissible I think you have to look at
 
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
these proposed penalties and say how is
 
01:31:42.189 --> 01:31:42.199 align:start position:0%
that work if you look at lines five and
 
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
six a voluntary waiver of firearm rights
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
may not be required of an individual as
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
a condition for receiving employment
 
01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:52.310 align:start position:0%
a condition for receiving employment

01:31:55.390 --> 01:31:55.400 align:start position:0%
education benefits Insurance Contracting
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
or other
 
01:31:59.709 --> 01:31:59.719 align:start position:0%
services but it doesn't say other
 
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
services against it's not Court it
 
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't say criminal convictions or
 
01:32:07.709 --> 01:32:07.719 align:start position:0%
criminal things so I think that they
 
01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
still are going to be able to
 
01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
potentially say this sign the waiver or
 
01:32:16.510 --> 01:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
go to jail sign the waiver or pay a fine
 
01:32:20.109 --> 01:32:20.119 align:start position:0%
but the other thing is how
 
01:32:23.189 --> 01:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
would anyone know if you had a voluntary
 
01:32:25.629 --> 01:32:25.639 align:start position:0%
waiver cuz if if they make you sign a
 
01:32:27.149 --> 01:32:27.159 align:start position:0%
voluntary waiver for receiving
 
01:32:29.470 --> 01:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
employment let's say I'll just go and
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
remove it you just wait the six months
 
01:32:34.669 --> 01:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
you remove it and so how are they going
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
to know this unless somebody somewhere
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
is telling them this you know this is
 
01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
supposed to be so
 
01:32:42.270 --> 01:32:42.280 align:start position:0%
confidential but I think you have
 
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
problems with it um and then it goes
 
01:32:48.830 --> 01:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
further lines 16 17 and 18 any person
 
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
who discriminates against a person on
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
the list with respect to health care
 
01:32:55.990 --> 01:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
services employment education housing
 
01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
Insurance governmental benefits are
 
01:32:59.790 --> 01:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
crack tacking because the person is on
 
01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:01.030 align:start position:0%
crack tacking because the person is on
the

01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:03.109 --> 01:33:03.119 align:start position:0%
list how are they going to know the
 
01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
person's on the list is supposedly a
 
01:33:04.719 --> 01:33:06.149 align:start position:0%
person's on the list is supposedly a
confidential

01:33:06.149 --> 01:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
01:33:09.109 --> 01:33:09.119 align:start position:0%
list so I think there's all these
 
01:33:11.709 --> 01:33:11.719 align:start position:0%
mechanical problems that you have but I
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
think the most important problems anyone
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
who seriously puts Force something like
 
01:33:19.109 --> 01:33:19.119 align:start position:0%
this has got to do as supposedly the
 
01:33:21.629 --> 01:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
Jews have done you put forth the
 
01:33:23.669 --> 01:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
solution first which is how you get off
 
01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
the list and all the forms and how it's
 
01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
going to work and then you talk about
 
01:33:30.030 --> 01:33:30.040 align:start position:0%
the list I think this bill needs to be
 
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
it for a million reasons but even if one
 
01:33:35.629 --> 01:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
supported it which I don't I support an
 
01:33:38.590 --> 01:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
itl this is not the vehicle it's not the
 
01:33:40.629 --> 01:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
mechanical thought out vehicle it's
 
01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
worse than any rubbe Goldberg you've
 
01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:43.229 align:start position:0%
worse than any rubbe Goldberg you've
ever

01:33:43.229 --> 01:33:43.239 align:start position:0%
ever
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
seen actually rubbe Goldberg's usually
 
01:33:47.149 --> 01:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
worked they just worked weird this this
 
01:33:49.709 --> 01:33:49.719 align:start position:0%
is not going to work um this is going to
 
01:33:51.149 --> 01:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
keep you off the list forever I'm happy
 
01:33:52.990 --> 01:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
to answer mechanical questions but it
 
01:33:54.990 --> 01:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
just it's not well written or well
 
01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:58.109 align:start position:0%
just it's not well written or well
thought

01:33:58.109 --> 01:33:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:01.149 --> 01:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
out representative roads thank you Mr
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:34:06.189 --> 01:34:06.199 align:start position:0%
question I'm sorry so so one of the
 
01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
questions that I had written down that I
 
01:34:08.910 --> 01:34:08.920 align:start position:0%
was waiting for somebody answer and you
 
01:34:11.790 --> 01:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
did but I have a question with it is
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
on what am I on page
 
01:34:18.350 --> 01:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
two line 26 the any person enrolled onto
 
01:34:19.709 --> 01:34:19.719 align:start position:0%
the list shall not be removed from the
 
01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
list list until days after an
 
01:34:23.629 --> 01:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
application has been received for
 
01:34:25.669 --> 01:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
removal then you talked about the
 
01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
process for
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
removal So in
 
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
theory is there a timeline that the
 
01:34:37.870 --> 01:34:37.880 align:start position:0%
person would have to be removed they
 
01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
don't offer it in here so they don't
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
give you a time if I ask to be removed
 
01:34:46.629 --> 01:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
in the 21 days then they have the seven
 
01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
days but there's no penalties and
 
01:34:50.790 --> 01:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
there's no mandated time like it has to
 
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
happen in 20 days 30 days 50 days it's
 
01:34:56.350 --> 01:34:56.360 align:start position:0%
not in here so it could it could be in
 
01:34:58.030 --> 01:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
definite time okay thank you for
 
01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:03.709 --> 01:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
question no further questions thank you
 
01:35:06.149 --> 01:35:06.159 align:start position:0%
oh representative Stone thank you Mr
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
chairman and real
 
01:35:10.590 --> 01:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
quickly given uh your profession would
 
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
you see this bill affecting those with
 
01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
limited financial means from ensuring
 
01:35:16.229 --> 01:35:16.239 align:start position:0%
their their rights they would be
 
01:35:18.510 --> 01:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
affected the most because it breaks my
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
heart there are people with limited
 
01:35:22.590 --> 01:35:22.600 align:start position:0%
financial means call me all the time
 
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
when their gun rights have been just
 
01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:25.550 align:start position:0%
when their gun rights have been just
totally

01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
totally
 
01:35:27.709 --> 01:35:27.719 align:start position:0%
decimated and they can't afford to hire
 
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
me cuz even just an hour I Church 300 an
 
01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
hour which is actually very low for most
 
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
attorneys and they don't make 300 a week
 
01:35:37.709 --> 01:35:37.719 align:start position:0%
or 400 a week they can't pay that the
 
01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
the poorest among us are going to be hit
 
01:35:43.149 --> 01:35:43.159 align:start position:0%
the hardest thank you very
 
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:06.350 --> 01:36:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:09.510 --> 01:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm Dr Jeffrey feder I'm a
 
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist at New Hampshire hospital
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
and today I'm testifying on behalf of
 
01:36:18.030 --> 01:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
DHHS in favor of this bill um I have
 
01:36:19.470 --> 01:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
some written testimony I'm not going to
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
read through the whole thing I just want
 
01:36:23.790 --> 01:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
to light three particular
 
01:36:25.629 --> 01:36:25.639 align:start position:0%
points excuse
 
01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
me um one is that um it has been shown
 
01:36:32.590 --> 01:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
in multiple studies that decreasing
 
01:36:36.229 --> 01:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
access to lethal means does decrease um
 
01:36:39.109 --> 01:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
suicide rates it's been shown in um
 
01:36:42.550 --> 01:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
India in a study with poisons um that
 
01:36:45.070 --> 01:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
the majority of suicides at that time in
 
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
in that place were done through um
 
01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
agricultural fertilizers when they
 
01:36:51.229 --> 01:36:51.239 align:start position:0%
replaced it with a different type of
 
01:36:53.070 --> 01:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
fertilizer that was less poisonous
 
01:36:55.229 --> 01:36:55.239 align:start position:0%
people did not find other ways to kill
 
01:36:57.950 --> 01:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
themselves um there's a famous study
 
01:37:00.189 --> 01:37:00.199 align:start position:0%
where in an American city there were two
 
01:37:03.109 --> 01:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
Bridges one um was favored for people to
 
01:37:05.910 --> 01:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
jump off one was not they put fences so
 
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
you couldn't jump off that other Bridge
 
01:37:09.189 --> 01:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
people did not walk two blocks to the
 
01:37:09.199 --> 01:37:10.070 align:start position:0%
people did not walk two blocks to the
other

01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:37:13.709 --> 01:37:13.719 align:start position:0%
Bridge um similarly in uh in England
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
there was a study regarding um the
 
01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
switch over from uh coal gas to Natural
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
Gas people used to mostly kill
 
01:37:22.669 --> 01:37:22.679 align:start position:0%
themselves by putting their heads in the
 
01:37:25.629 --> 01:37:25.639 align:start position:0%
stove um when they switch that type of
 
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
gas to a less lethal gas people do not
 
01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
find other ways to kill themselves
 
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
denying access to lethal means is
 
01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
effective as a public health
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
measure second is is the short-term
 
01:37:39.669 --> 01:37:39.679 align:start position:0%
nature of suicidal
 
01:37:42.109 --> 01:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
ideation um about 20 years ago there was
 
01:37:43.629 --> 01:37:43.639 align:start position:0%
a study where they interviewed people
 
01:37:46.149 --> 01:37:46.159 align:start position:0%
who survived jumping off the Golden Gate
 
01:37:50.229 --> 01:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
Bridge and almost all of them said on
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
interview that they they regretted
 
01:37:55.510 --> 01:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
Letting Go almost immediately on the way
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
down people are not at their best when
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
they are committing suicide and it is a
 
01:38:05.709 --> 01:38:05.719 align:start position:0%
um an expression of their their of their
 
01:38:08.709 --> 01:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
freedom to be able to have some control
 
01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
over those dark moments when they are at
 
01:38:12.589 --> 01:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
their best it's almost like having an
 
01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
advanced directive we would never want
 
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
to take away the right of somebody to
 
01:38:19.470 --> 01:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
make those decisions for themselves when
 
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
they're not at their best when they are
 
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
able to think straight and uh um uh make
 
01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
their wishes known so for these reasons
 
01:38:31.470 --> 01:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
DHHS is in favor of this bill as a
 
01:38:35.149 --> 01:38:35.159 align:start position:0%
public health measure um and um be happy
 
01:38:38.189 --> 01:38:38.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:40.430 --> 01:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
01:38:43.629 --> 01:38:43.639 align:start position:0%
scitech uh doctor I have a question that
 
01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
is this How likely is this scenario you
 
01:38:52.109 --> 01:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
are treating a patient who is suicidal
 
01:38:55.189 --> 01:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
and you are concerned and you say look
 
01:38:57.229 --> 01:38:57.239 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have you involuntarily
 
01:39:00.270 --> 01:39:00.280 align:start position:0%
committed based on what I've seen in our
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
therapy sessions unless you get on this
 
01:39:06.270 --> 01:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
list that is likely scenario because I'm
 
01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
concerned about coercion that's my there
 
01:39:10.750 --> 01:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
are some mechanic well never mind that
 
01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:11.709 align:start position:0%
are some mechanic well never mind that
that's

01:39:11.709 --> 01:39:11.719 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:14.159 align:start position:0%
all if if I was thinking about
 
01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
involuntarily committing a person this
 
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
would not be enough reassurance to me
 
01:39:20.709 --> 01:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
that I would not involuntarily commit
 
01:39:20.719 --> 01:39:22.550 align:start position:0%
that I would not involuntarily commit
them

01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:39:24.030 --> 01:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
I would expect they could get a gun some
 
01:39:28.229 --> 01:39:28.239 align:start position:0%
other way doctor do you in your um
 
01:39:30.510 --> 01:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
understanding if a patient you're
 
01:39:32.589 --> 01:39:32.599 align:start position:0%
treating tells you that they're suicidal
 
01:39:34.550 --> 01:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
or they're having violent thoughts about
 
01:39:37.310 --> 01:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
someone else do you have a a obligation
 
01:39:38.830 --> 01:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
to report that to the Department of
 
01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:42.159 align:start position:0%
Safety as it stands under our current
 
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
statutes if I believe they have violent
 
01:39:48.750 --> 01:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
thoughts towards someone else um I have
 
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
I have an obligation to take some sort
 
01:39:54.149 --> 01:39:54.159 align:start position:0%
of measure to protect um that person so
 
01:39:57.950 --> 01:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
if if I can involuntarily commit that
 
01:39:59.550 --> 01:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
individual who told me about those
 
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
thoughts I don't have to notify the
 
01:40:03.589 --> 01:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
department of safety at that point but
 
01:40:06.990 --> 01:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
if they have to be released from um the
 
01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
state hospital for technical reasons or
 
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
something like that then I would well I
 
01:40:12.629 --> 01:40:12.639 align:start position:0%
was thinking more if you were just uh
 
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
under your license or treating someone
 
01:40:17.070 --> 01:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
outside of the hospital for example in a
 
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
therapy session and they said to you you
 
01:40:20.669 --> 01:40:20.679 align:start position:0%
know I'm I'm thinking I'm probably going
 
01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
to kill myself tonight or I'm going to
 
01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
kill my mother or someone tonight what
 
01:40:26.589 --> 01:40:26.599 align:start position:0%
would your obligation be under the law
 
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
currently so it's basically still the
 
01:40:31.790 --> 01:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
same if if I can have them committed at
 
01:40:34.669 --> 01:40:34.679 align:start position:0%
that point it's that's considered the
 
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
safer thing to do to contain the
 
01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
dangerousness if I can't have them
 
01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
committed for whatever reason then
 
01:40:42.350 --> 01:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
there's a um a rule called the terasoft
 
01:40:45.189 --> 01:40:45.199 align:start position:0%
rule that requires um metal health
 
01:40:47.589 --> 01:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
professional to notify the potential
 
01:40:50.189 --> 01:40:50.199 align:start position:0%
victim or the authorities to protect
 
01:40:52.990 --> 01:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
that person thank
 
01:40:56.790 --> 01:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
you see no further representative sing
 
01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question um do you see this
 
01:41:05.350 --> 01:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
lives I think there's a good chance that
 
01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:10.550 align:start position:0%
lives I think there's a good chance that
it

01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:14.310 --> 01:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
could representative Pratt um I was a
 
01:41:17.109 --> 01:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
fire chief in a fireman in a town for 42
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
years and I've seen 14 different
 
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
suicides only two of them was guns
 
01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
how does the people choose what they're
 
01:41:26.830 --> 01:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
going to use and if we block one way of
 
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
doing it what's going to prevent them
 
01:41:29.709 --> 01:41:29.719 align:start position:0%
from using another
 
01:41:33.109 --> 01:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
way so that question has been studied
 
01:41:35.870 --> 01:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
and in mult multiple studies that have
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
been replicated denying access to one
 
01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:40.639 align:start position:0%
lethal means and it's been studied in
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
Firearms as well as the kind of strange
 
01:41:44.709 --> 01:41:44.719 align:start position:0%
methods that I me mentioned denying
 
01:41:46.910 --> 01:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
access to lethal means does decrease the
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
chance that someone dies of
 
01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
suicide all lethal means all lethal
 
01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
means well I mean the most lethal means
 
01:41:59.310 --> 01:41:59.320 align:start position:0%
okay so if you know for instance uh the
 
01:42:01.070 --> 01:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
coal gas is considered a highly lethal
 
01:42:03.629 --> 01:42:03.639 align:start position:0%
means compared to natural gas so just
 
01:42:05.390 --> 01:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
switching that over people did not
 
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
decide okay I'm going to slip my throat
 
01:42:11.910 --> 01:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
or hang myself instead um they they have
 
01:42:14.310 --> 01:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
an idea of a certain means and throwing
 
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
any obstacle in their way tends to make
 
01:42:19.870 --> 01:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
them change their mind um I've had
 
01:42:22.830 --> 01:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
patients tell me I stood on the bridge
 
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
the the patient I can think of who
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
jumped off the Quee Bridge um told me
 
01:42:30.189 --> 01:42:30.199 align:start position:0%
that if someone had just walked along
 
01:42:33.149 --> 01:42:33.159 align:start position:0%
and said what's wrong is there something
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
going on I would have just turned around
 
01:42:35.870 --> 01:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
but no one
 
01:42:38.589 --> 01:42:38.599 align:start position:0%
did people are it's hard to commit
 
01:42:41.070 --> 01:42:41.080 align:start position:0%
suicide you throw any little obstacle in
 
01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
their way and you might change the path
 
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%

01:43:24.990 --> 01:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
who at risk I have worked as a

since
 
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
1995 I have worked with many patients
 
01:43:33.790 --> 01:43:33.800 align:start position:0%
who did something very dangerous with a
 
01:43:36.470 --> 01:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
gun towards themselves or others when in
 
01:43:39.709 --> 01:43:39.719 align:start position:0%
an episode of severe mental
 
01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
illness many of those patients respond
 
01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
very well to mental health
 
01:43:48.589 --> 01:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
treatment and they later regret their
 
01:43:51.750 --> 01:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
dangerous actions with which resulted in
 
01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:53.189 align:start position:0%

you thank you VI test who now
representative

01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
Newman yeah I I just want to ask a
 
01:44:32.229 --> 01:44:32.239 align:start position:0%
question about some of the testimony we
 
01:44:34.830 --> 01:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
heard earlier and I I can't tell you
 
01:44:36.830 --> 01:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
exactly what it said but but I'll try
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
and paraphrase that there were no
 
01:44:39.719 --> 01:44:41.189 align:start position:0%
and paraphrase that there were no
peer-reviewed

01:44:41.189 --> 01:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed
 
01:44:45.510 --> 01:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
studies that show um the various how how
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
violence how Firearms are connected
 
01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:51.229 align:start position:0%
violence how Firearms are connected
to

01:44:51.229 --> 01:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:44:54.149 --> 01:44:54.159 align:start position:0%
suicide no I think to to be clear I
 
01:44:56.189 --> 01:44:56.199 align:start position:0%
think the witness said there's no
 
01:44:58.990 --> 01:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed studies or or um with
 
01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
related to what percentage of gun owners
 
01:45:04.270 --> 01:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
supported this legislation I think was
 
01:45:07.350 --> 01:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
what the the comment was but you may ask
 
01:45:10.030 --> 01:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
that question I'll withdraw my question
 
01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:11.310 align:start position:0%
that question I'll withdraw my question
thank

01:45:11.310 --> 01:45:11.320 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%

02:02:58.109 --> 02:02:58.119 align:start position:0%
to give a little history here of why
 
02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
this bill is before the committee today
 
02:03:02.990 --> 02:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
in 2018 the House of Representatives
 
02:03:05.790 --> 02:03:05.800 align:start position:0%
Senate uh put a constitutional amendment
 
02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
before the voters and it passed uh
 
02:03:11.589 --> 02:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
giving them uh the citizens of New
 
02:03:14.270 --> 02:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the right to privacy that same
 
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
year a colonist in the New York Times
 
02:03:19.550 --> 02:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
placed a
 
02:03:22.149 --> 02:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
column explaining that the federal
 
02:03:24.310 --> 02:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
government because they're restricted
 
02:03:28.870 --> 02:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
from doing a Firearms registry um would
 
02:03:33.189 --> 02:03:33.199 align:start position:0%
should attack uh Firearms by going
 
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
through the banking system so
 
02:03:39.550 --> 02:03:39.560 align:start position:0%
Amalgamated Bank approached the iso
 
02:03:41.189 --> 02:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
which the international organization of
 
02:03:43.109 --> 02:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
standardization you've all heard of ISO
 
02:03:45.790 --> 02:03:45.800 align:start position:0%
9000 certification that sort of thing
 
02:03:49.709 --> 02:03:49.719 align:start position:0%
and the iso based upon that petition
 
02:03:52.350 --> 02:03:52.360 align:start position:0%
introduced a MCC which is a merchant
 
02:03:55.910 --> 02:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
category code in September of 22 about
 
02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
that same time after it was announced
 
02:04:00.030 --> 02:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
that they would be doing that uh the New
 
02:04:02.069 --> 02:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire attorney general joined with
 
02:04:04.030 --> 02:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
23 other Attorneys General across the
 
02:04:06.149 --> 02:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
country and sent a letter to Visa
 
02:04:09.549 --> 02:04:09.559 align:start position:0%
American Express Mastercard condemning
 
02:04:13.790 --> 02:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
this move to do a uh Firearms registry
 
02:04:17.350 --> 02:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
quas Firearms registry uh via Private
 
02:04:22.149 --> 02:04:22.159 align:start position:0%
Industry so March 23 after several
 
02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
houses of Representatives and senates
 
02:04:26.870 --> 02:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
across the state across the country
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
introduced legislation to stop this type
 
02:04:34.589 --> 02:04:34.599 align:start position:0%
of uh registry uh the Visa Mastercard
 
02:04:36.350 --> 02:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
and American Express said that they were
 
02:04:40.270 --> 02:04:40.280 align:start position:0%
going to pause their plans so I I'll
 
02:04:42.109 --> 02:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
talk about the the states that have
 
02:04:45.109 --> 02:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
instituted this a very similar Bill Sim
 
02:04:46.950 --> 02:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
similar law to what I have before you
 
02:04:49.390 --> 02:04:49.400 align:start position:0%
today it would be West Virginia I ho
 
02:04:52.270 --> 02:04:52.280 align:start position:0%
Mississippi North Dakota Florida Montana
 
02:04:54.350 --> 02:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
and Texas I understand there are five
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
other states in the union this year that
 
02:05:00.589 --> 02:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
are contemplating a similar bill so the
 
02:05:01.709 --> 02:05:01.719 align:start position:0%
first part of the bill is the
 
02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
definitions of who this would affect
 
02:05:07.149 --> 02:05:07.159 align:start position:0%
what a Farm's code is which is actually
 
02:05:11.430 --> 02:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
a merchant uh nmcc under the iso using
 
02:05:14.350 --> 02:05:14.360 align:start position:0%
big words if you have questions for me
 
02:05:16.629 --> 02:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
again I I'd actually ask that you ask me
 
02:05:18.109 --> 02:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
during the executive session because
 
02:05:19.109 --> 02:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people people here that
 
02:05:23.270 --> 02:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
want to testify on the bill um so this
 
02:05:25.270 --> 02:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
bill would prohibit the use of those
 
02:05:27.430 --> 02:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
Firearms codes in the state of New
 
02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the third part is it
 
02:05:32.470 --> 02:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
places it before the Attorney General to
 
02:05:34.950 --> 02:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
investigate the violations of this law
 
02:05:37.549 --> 02:05:37.559 align:start position:0%
in the ability of whoever violates the
 
02:05:39.950 --> 02:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
law 30 days to come back into compliance
 
02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
with the statute uh if they fail to do
 
02:05:44.549 --> 02:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
so then there's a civil
 
02:05:44.559 --> 02:05:47.669 align:start position:0%
so then there's a civil
penalty

02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:51.109 --> 02:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
and there is a process in the Civil
 
02:05:52.870 --> 02:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
Court to appeal
 
02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:54.430 align:start position:0%
Court to appeal
that

02:05:54.430 --> 02:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:05:57.430 --> 02:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
um this if it's passed by the house
 
02:05:58.709 --> 02:05:58.719 align:start position:0%
senate and signed by the governor this
 
02:06:00.709 --> 02:06:00.719 align:start position:0%
will take effect in January of
 
02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
25 um I just want to closeing saying
 
02:06:07.430 --> 02:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
that if I go to kidy trading post a Bass
 
02:06:10.750 --> 02:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
Pro Shop or one of these other places um
 
02:06:12.030 --> 02:06:12.040 align:start position:0%
you you may not know but I'm an
 
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
Outdoorsman I'm an eagle scout I like to
 
02:06:16.549 --> 02:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
go out and do things in the outdoors if
 
02:06:19.149 --> 02:06:19.159 align:start position:0%
I go to Bass Pro Shop and buy hiking
 
02:06:21.950 --> 02:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
boots a backpacking tent a frame pack
 
02:06:24.629 --> 02:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
hiking poles Black Rifle coffee gortex
 
02:06:27.310 --> 02:06:27.320 align:start position:0%
jacket rain pants and a kayak and I get
 
02:06:30.229 --> 02:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
to the register and I use my credit card
 
02:06:32.030 --> 02:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
and it comes up as a purchase of about
 
02:06:34.470 --> 02:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
$4,000 I don't want somebody mistaken
 
02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
that I went out and purchased a firearm
 
02:06:39.910 --> 02:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
I want I don't want that discernable to
 
02:06:43.350 --> 02:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
any other Sporting Goods category so
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
basically the bill is is telling these
 
02:06:48.589 --> 02:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
um these places that they cannot use a
 
02:06:51.549 --> 02:06:51.559 align:start position:0%
bills spec I mean a code specific for
 
02:06:53.870 --> 02:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
firearms that it can be general
 
02:06:59.270 --> 02:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:01.549 --> 02:07:01.559 align:start position:0%

sir
 
02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
um um thank you then for your
 
02:07:10.470 --> 02:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
Davis

02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
there we go honorable members of the
 
02:07:27.790 --> 02:07:27.800 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Justin Davis I
 
02:07:29.069 --> 02:07:29.079 align:start position:0%
serve as the New Hampshire state
 
02:07:30.229 --> 02:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
director for the National Rifle
 
02:07:31.790 --> 02:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
Association I'm also a gun owner here in
 
02:07:33.350 --> 02:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I appreciate the
 
02:07:36.189 --> 02:07:36.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh represent our members
 
02:07:38.310 --> 02:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh belief that uh this bill should pass
 
02:07:40.149 --> 02:07:40.159 align:start position:0%
uh in New Hampshire uh as representative
 
02:07:42.430 --> 02:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
janver so eloquently said in 2018 the
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
New York Times published how Banks could
 
02:07:46.750 --> 02:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
control gun sales when Washington won't
 
02:07:48.229 --> 02:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
uh the the article argued that major
 
02:07:49.709 --> 02:07:49.719 align:start position:0%
Banks credit card companies could set
 
02:07:51.510 --> 02:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
new rules surrounding Merchant category
 
02:07:53.790 --> 02:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
codes to track and potentially hinder
 
02:07:56.069 --> 02:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
firearm purchases just four years later
 
02:07:57.350 --> 02:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
the International Organization for
 
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
standardization announced that they
 
02:08:00.510 --> 02:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
would create the MCC code on the
 
02:08:02.549 --> 02:08:02.559 align:start position:0%
purchase of firearms and ammunition now
 
02:08:03.510 --> 02:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
the important thing to understand about
 
02:08:05.790 --> 02:08:05.800 align:start position:0%
this MCC code is that it's not just for
 
02:08:07.510 --> 02:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
if a firearm or ammunition is purchased
 
02:08:09.149 --> 02:08:09.159 align:start position:0%
but if it's at of firearm retailer right
 
02:08:11.589 --> 02:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
so like representative janver said I go
 
02:08:14.950 --> 02:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
to L Cody or Bass Pro Shops and I buy a
 
02:08:18.109 --> 02:08:18.119 align:start position:0%
tent new boots coveralls for my hunting
 
02:08:19.790 --> 02:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
um that would show up as a firearm
 
02:08:21.149 --> 02:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
purchase just like it would buy if I one
 
02:08:23.069 --> 02:08:23.079 align:start position:0%
bought a new CZ 612 for duck hunting
 
02:08:25.149 --> 02:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
right so when you have these high level
 
02:08:26.910 --> 02:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
purchases or these large amounts it
 
02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
could flag for the Department of
 
02:08:29.830 --> 02:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
Treasury or that credit card company
 
02:08:31.229 --> 02:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
well as this person a threat they buying
 
02:08:33.629 --> 02:08:33.639 align:start position:0%
large quantities of firearms um this
 
02:08:36.229 --> 02:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
creates a major concern for privacy um
 
02:08:38.510 --> 02:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
mainly because uh these these purchases
 
02:08:39.750 --> 02:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
should not be flagged where a credit
 
02:08:41.229 --> 02:08:41.239 align:start position:0%
card company can deny these purchases
 
02:08:42.430 --> 02:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
because you want to make a firearm
 
02:08:45.149 --> 02:08:45.159 align:start position:0%
related purchase um and it also serves
 
02:08:46.990 --> 02:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
as a quasa gun registry right so we can
 
02:08:49.109 --> 02:08:49.119 align:start position:0%
see where myself every firearm I
 
02:08:50.350 --> 02:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
purchased or every time I went to these
 
02:08:52.430 --> 02:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
gun stores this the government can then
 
02:08:54.669 --> 02:08:54.679 align:start position:0%
look at what we've done so in a time
 
02:08:56.589 --> 02:08:56.599 align:start position:0%
where data privacy is paramont to the
 
02:08:58.069 --> 02:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire I think that
 
02:08:59.390 --> 02:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
this is something that's certainly
 
02:09:02.430 --> 02:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
needed um and even as representative Jan
 
02:09:04.430 --> 02:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
said Visa and MasterCard and these major
 
02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
credit card companies have already
 
02:09:06.790 --> 02:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
paused this because there are major
 
02:09:09.069 --> 02:09:09.079 align:start position:0%
concerns about the uh the facility of
 
02:09:10.709 --> 02:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
that so happy to take any questions you
 
02:09:12.390 --> 02:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
have but the National Rifle Association
 
02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:21.109 --> 02:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:23.629 --> 02:09:23.639 align:start position:0%
Muse some something I'm trying to
 
02:09:25.870 --> 02:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
understand is how information that's
 
02:09:28.270 --> 02:09:28.280 align:start position:0%
recorded on your personal credit card
 
02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:29.430 align:start position:0%
recorded on your personal credit card
can

02:09:29.430 --> 02:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:09:33.149 --> 02:09:33.159 align:start position:0%
become public or can be disclosed to
 
02:09:35.229 --> 02:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
people you know outside of you and and
 
02:09:38.109 --> 02:09:38.119 align:start position:0%
your credit card company so the way I
 
02:09:40.310 --> 02:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
understand Merchant codes and and I
 
02:09:42.709 --> 02:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
actually appreciate them uh on my own
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
credit card statement because they show
 
02:09:48.030 --> 02:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
things like charitable contributions and
 
02:09:50.189 --> 02:09:50.199 align:start position:0%
and they can help me get organized for
 
02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
tax purposes and things like that so I
 
02:09:55.510 --> 02:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
I'm a little confused over over how
 
02:09:57.830 --> 02:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
privacy rights might be violated and
 
02:10:00.109 --> 02:10:00.119 align:start position:0%
where where the concern is coming from
 
02:10:02.030 --> 02:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
here yeah absolutely so there's two
 
02:10:04.069 --> 02:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
prongs to that one is that it can be
 
02:10:05.830 --> 02:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
flag for the Department of Treasury uh
 
02:10:07.629 --> 02:10:07.639 align:start position:0%
if there's large purchases made under
 
02:10:09.390 --> 02:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
these codes um and I'm happy to provide
 
02:10:10.709 --> 02:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
some more of that information for you I
 
02:10:11.950 --> 02:10:11.960 align:start position:0%
don't have it readily available from you
 
02:10:12.830 --> 02:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
but I'm Happ to provide you that
 
02:10:15.149 --> 02:10:15.159 align:start position:0%
information uh secondly I think as we're
 
02:10:16.430 --> 02:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
all aware there's a lot of data leak
 
02:10:18.830 --> 02:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
issues uh a lot of stolen identity issue
 
02:10:20.669 --> 02:10:20.679 align:start position:0%
so having that information become public
 
02:10:22.229 --> 02:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
for firearm purchase that you make I
 
02:10:23.910 --> 02:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
know as a gun owner I don't think I want
 
02:10:25.069 --> 02:10:25.079 align:start position:0%
the general public to know all the
 
02:10:27.310 --> 02:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
purchases that I make at certain retails
 
02:10:29.189 --> 02:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
uh for whatever whether it's for hunting
 
02:10:30.390 --> 02:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's for an actual firearm
 
02:10:31.830 --> 02:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
ammunition purchase I think there's a
 
02:10:33.669 --> 02:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
very real concern for people about the
 
02:10:36.109 --> 02:10:36.119 align:start position:0%
data privacy uh not just in house in
 
02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
these places but for that to become
 
02:10:41.390 --> 02:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
public is there some type of a federal
 
02:10:44.310 --> 02:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
um law that authorizes the credit card
 
02:10:45.669 --> 02:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
companies to share information with the
 
02:10:47.830 --> 02:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Treasury I'll have to look
 
02:10:49.549 --> 02:10:49.559 align:start position:0%
at that to get a success statute for
 
02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
that but I'll provide that for the
 
02:10:51.629 --> 02:10:51.639 align:start position:0%
committee thank
 
02:10:56.310 --> 02:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:00.270 --> 02:11:00.280 align:start position:0%
Tes what bil yeah looks like 11 I think
 
02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:03.599 align:start position:0%
it say these things um
 
02:11:06.910 --> 02:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
Leonard Leonard is that you again oh
 
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
yeah it seems your handwriting is
 
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:20.470 --> 02:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:23.189 --> 02:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
so um as I said before I represent the
 
02:11:25.390 --> 02:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Psychiatric Society and
 
02:11:27.830 --> 02:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Medical Society and
 
02:11:30.030 --> 02:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
I'll just be
 
02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
brief gun violence is a major epidemic
 
02:11:38.470 --> 02:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
in our country it is the position
 
02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
of uh our medical societies and the
 
02:11:44.589 --> 02:11:44.599 align:start position:0%
American Medical
 
02:11:50.270 --> 02:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
Association that guns Firearms be
 
02:11:52.229 --> 02:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
registered and
 
02:11:55.549 --> 02:11:55.559 align:start position:0%
Firearm operators be
 
02:12:00.629 --> 02:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
licensed so the we we have information
 
02:12:05.310 --> 02:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
about cars and ownership of cars and we
 
02:12:10.709 --> 02:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
need to have information about uh guns
 
02:12:14.350 --> 02:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
as well and I realize that uh uh people
 
02:12:19.030 --> 02:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
are uh in favor of gun rights are not in
 
02:12:23.189 --> 02:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
favor of these types of uh information
 
02:12:27.109 --> 02:12:27.119 align:start position:0%
being available but for people who are
 
02:12:30.629 --> 02:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
interested in gun safety registration
 
02:12:33.109 --> 02:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
and knowledge about who are purchasing
 
02:12:37.069 --> 02:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
guns uh is important that's all I have
 
02:12:37.079 --> 02:12:38.629 align:start position:0%
guns uh is important that's all I have
to

02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:12:41.470 --> 02:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
say that's said enough thank you very
 
02:12:45.109 --> 02:12:45.119 align:start position:0%
much um thank you the chair recognizes
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh Penny
 
02:12:47.040 --> 02:13:01.870 align:start position:0%
uh Penny
Dean

02:13:01.870 --> 02:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:03.549 --> 02:13:03.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Penny Dean and as
 
02:13:07.830 --> 02:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
in all these I represent myself and
 
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
myself only as a private citizen
 
02:13:14.709 --> 02:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
and there are Banking and credit card
 
02:13:16.109 --> 02:13:16.119 align:start position:0%
companies in this country that
 
02:13:18.669 --> 02:13:18.679 align:start position:0%
discriminated against gun owners and the
 
02:13:21.390 --> 02:13:21.400 align:start position:0%
most famous is probably Bank of America
 
02:13:23.910 --> 02:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
and Bank of America told McMillan's
 
02:13:26.589 --> 02:13:26.599 align:start position:0%
stock several years ago and McMillan and
 
02:13:29.589 --> 02:13:29.599 align:start position:0%
I would not make stacks and high-end
 
02:13:31.069 --> 02:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
competitive firearms that was one of
 
02:13:33.709 --> 02:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
their main things after being a customer
 
02:13:36.750 --> 02:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
for 20 years McMillan was told take your
 
02:13:39.510 --> 02:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
money and get out of our bank and bless
 
02:13:41.790 --> 02:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
his heart he made that public he took
 
02:13:44.030 --> 02:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
the letter that was given to him and
 
02:13:46.109 --> 02:13:46.119 align:start position:0%
spread it all for all gun owners to know
 
02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
that you probably shouldn't do business
 
02:13:49.870 --> 02:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
with Bank of America and when Bank of
 
02:13:51.390 --> 02:13:51.400 align:start position:0%
America called him in and said we don't
 
02:13:53.470 --> 02:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
want your money in your business anymore
 
02:13:56.549 --> 02:13:56.559 align:start position:0%
he's like why we pay our loans we had a
 
02:13:58.270 --> 02:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
great banking relationship with you
 
02:14:01.430 --> 02:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
what's the problem you sell guns he says
 
02:14:04.589 --> 02:14:04.599 align:start position:0%
I make stacks for custom guns I don't
 
02:14:08.270 --> 02:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
per se sell guns didn't matter it was
 
02:14:11.430 --> 02:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
gun business and they looked at it as
 
02:14:13.310 --> 02:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
bad money because of guns and they
 
02:14:16.149 --> 02:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
simply didn't want his business so how
 
02:14:18.189 --> 02:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
many of us could see our bank Banking
 
02:14:20.830 --> 02:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
and our credit card shut down because
 
02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a gun purchase because
 
02:14:26.069 --> 02:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
it's coded as a gun purchase how many of
 
02:14:28.629 --> 02:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
us would see credit cards denied because
 
02:14:30.149 --> 02:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
when they run a credit report they're
 
02:14:32.350 --> 02:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
going to say you've bought a lot of guns
 
02:14:34.030 --> 02:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
because we have code numbers here and
 
02:14:35.549 --> 02:14:35.559 align:start position:0%
you shop at gun
 
02:14:37.990 --> 02:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
stores and if anyone thinks that type of
 
02:14:40.149 --> 02:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
discrimination doesn't appear all the
 
02:14:42.990 --> 02:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
time I'll respectfully say it does and
 
02:14:45.549 --> 02:14:45.559 align:start position:0%
it's as Insidious as racism was years
 
02:14:49.149 --> 02:14:49.159 align:start position:0%
ago it's just a little um um becoming
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
more and more blatant every day
 
02:14:53.189 --> 02:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
depending on which party you belong to
 
02:14:56.109 --> 02:14:56.119 align:start position:0%
so this bill is absolutely
 
02:14:58.629 --> 02:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
necessary and as the representative
 
02:15:01.109 --> 02:15:01.119 align:start position:0%
noted he sees codes on his credit card
 
02:15:03.030 --> 02:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
bill and more of us are seeing those
 
02:15:05.390 --> 02:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
more and more of where you bought the
 
02:15:08.470 --> 02:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
purchases and so what happens when your
 
02:15:10.669 --> 02:15:10.679 align:start position:0%
credit card company happens to be the
 
02:15:12.350 --> 02:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
same one that your employer is you have
 
02:15:15.069 --> 02:15:15.079 align:start position:0%
a employer's credit card Your Own Credit
 
02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
Card which you diligently keep separate
 
02:15:19.069 --> 02:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
what happens when the credit card
 
02:15:21.189 --> 02:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
company mistakenly sends your personal
 
02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
Bill to your employer or transposes the
 
02:15:26.030 --> 02:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
numbers in the accounts and now your
 
02:15:29.189 --> 02:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
employer sees how many guns you buy for
 
02:15:31.589 --> 02:15:31.599 align:start position:0%
some people that could be a job killer
 
02:15:32.870 --> 02:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
even though it has nothing to do with
 
02:15:36.470 --> 02:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
their job there's a million things that
 
02:15:37.990 --> 02:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
how how about when you go to apply for
 
02:15:39.310 --> 02:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
an apartment they want to see your most
 
02:15:40.870 --> 02:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
recent credit card
 
02:15:42.750 --> 02:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
statements you're going to see all those
 
02:15:45.549 --> 02:15:45.559 align:start position:0%
codes on there so there's a million ways
 
02:15:48.390 --> 02:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
in which it's can harm a private person
 
02:15:51.189 --> 02:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
and so this bill I would strongly
 
02:15:53.669 --> 02:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
recommend is ought to pass because it is
 
02:15:56.310 --> 02:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
about privacy interest and civil rights
 
02:15:58.830 --> 02:15:58.840 align:start position:0%
we should be treated as they say the
 
02:16:01.910 --> 02:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
content of our soul not anything else
 
02:16:04.470 --> 02:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
and how much money that we spend on any
 
02:16:07.229 --> 02:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
particular thing be it jewelry or guns
 
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
or cars should be nobody's business and
 
02:16:13.069 --> 02:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
so the bottom line is and we shouldn't
 
02:16:14.629 --> 02:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
be treated differently by these
 
02:16:16.270 --> 02:16:16.280 align:start position:0%
companies because of how we choose to
 
02:16:18.229 --> 02:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
spend our money and I think that could
 
02:16:19.669 --> 02:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
happen more and more and more because
 
02:16:21.310 --> 02:16:21.320 align:start position:0%
more and more gun owners have talked
 
02:16:23.229 --> 02:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
about banking of America and certain
 
02:16:25.430 --> 02:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
other companies that don't want our
 
02:16:27.790 --> 02:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
business so I respect I'm happy to
 
02:16:29.830 --> 02:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
answer mechanical questions or practical
 
02:16:32.030 --> 02:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
questions but I would ask respectfully
 
02:16:32.040 --> 02:16:33.750 align:start position:0%
questions but I would ask respectfully
that

02:16:33.750 --> 02:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:16:37.110 --> 02:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
you consider this is an ought to pass
 
02:16:39.150 --> 02:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
necessary to
 
02:16:44.030 --> 02:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:56.910 --> 02:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:59.469 --> 02:16:59.479 align:start position:0%
s difficult name isn't it thank you Mr
 
02:17:00.509 --> 02:17:00.519 align:start position:0%
chair it's
 
02:17:03.110 --> 02:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
ORS uh thank you for hearing me once
 
02:17:05.030 --> 02:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
again committee I testified a little
 
02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:06.150 align:start position:0%
again committee I testified a little
earlier

02:17:06.150 --> 02:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
02:17:09.469 --> 02:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
today and I just wanted to reiterate
 
02:17:13.230 --> 02:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
this the fact about a little history and
 
02:17:16.589 --> 02:17:16.599 align:start position:0%
when it was mentioned earlier here in
 
02:17:20.309 --> 02:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
testimony that gun registration is
 
02:17:23.030 --> 02:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
necessary well we know what happens in
 
02:17:26.309 --> 02:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
Europe in the 40s and 30s with gun
 
02:17:28.790 --> 02:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
registration and the same goes with
 
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
credit card information when the banks
 
02:17:33.230 --> 02:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
are allowed to take credit card
 
02:17:35.429 --> 02:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
information and screen people whether
 
02:17:38.070 --> 02:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
it's for business or whether it's the
 
02:17:41.509 --> 02:17:41.519 align:start position:0%
fact that they buy weapons or weapon
 
02:17:44.709 --> 02:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
related materials ammunition whatever it
 
02:17:48.150 --> 02:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
is the last thing we want in a free
 
02:17:51.070 --> 02:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
Society in our Republic is to have our
 
02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
privacy taken away by the government or
 
02:17:55.910 --> 02:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
anyone and so I would like you to take
 
02:17:57.950 --> 02:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
that into consideration as we move
 
02:18:00.349 --> 02:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
forward on some of these bills the last
 
02:18:02.469 --> 02:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
thing we want is big brother or somebody
 
02:18:04.950 --> 02:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
else looking over our shoulders and then
 
02:18:06.830 --> 02:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
going to tell us what to do or come
 
02:18:10.349 --> 02:18:10.359 align:start position:0%
after us as we have seen as the doj and
 
02:18:12.230 --> 02:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
different organizations within our
 
02:18:14.070 --> 02:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
country become politicized thank you
 
02:18:15.790 --> 02:18:15.800 align:start position:0%
very much and I'll take questions if you
 
02:18:15.800 --> 02:18:16.509 align:start position:0%
very much and I'll take questions if you
have

02:18:16.509 --> 02:18:16.519 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:18:16.519 --> 02:18:19.110 align:start position:0%
have
any

02:18:19.110 --> 02:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:18:21.469 --> 02:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
02:18:22.870 --> 02:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
anyone else wishing to testify on this
 
02:18:34.230 --> 02:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:38.870 --> 02:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:41.709 --> 02:18:41.719 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chairman I apologize
 
02:18:45.150 --> 02:18:45.160 align:start position:0%
for um not having the card handy um I
 
02:18:48.509 --> 02:18:48.519 align:start position:0%
just wanted to quickly state that
 
02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
there are two purposes for having that
 
02:18:52.990 --> 02:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
code that identifies uh you know gun
 
02:18:55.150 --> 02:18:55.160 align:start position:0%
businesses the first one is to create a
 
02:18:58.549 --> 02:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
gun registry which uh is not a policy
 
02:19:00.270 --> 02:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
that should be followed by anybody since
 
02:19:01.750 --> 02:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
you'd be keeping a registry of people
 
02:19:03.870 --> 02:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
who did nothing wrong and it was used in
 
02:19:06.150 --> 02:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
the past to harass them I want to remind
 
02:19:08.349 --> 02:19:08.359 align:start position:0%
you that in California there was a
 
02:19:10.030 --> 02:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
accidental leak of all the people on the
 
02:19:12.870 --> 02:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
gun registry who then ended up being
 
02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
harassed I don't think we should keep
 
02:19:17.150 --> 02:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
that information the other purpose for
 
02:19:18.950 --> 02:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
this which is really the real purpose
 
02:19:21.150 --> 02:19:21.160 align:start position:0%
for this is to treat
 
02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
gun businesses gun firearm related
 
02:19:25.830 --> 02:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
businesses the same way the feds treat
 
02:19:29.230 --> 02:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
the weed businesses by cutting off their
 
02:19:31.469 --> 02:19:31.479 align:start position:0%
Bank access one of the huge risks of
 
02:19:33.830 --> 02:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
having a marijuana business anywhere in
 
02:19:36.669 --> 02:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
the US is that no banks will do business
 
02:19:38.190 --> 02:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
with you you got to deal in cash you got
 
02:19:41.070 --> 02:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
to have armored vehicles and all that
 
02:19:43.070 --> 02:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
because the federal law still still says
 
02:19:45.349 --> 02:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
that doing business in there is illegal
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
there have been previous attempts from
 
02:19:49.150 --> 02:19:49.160 align:start position:0%
the feds to do exactly that unofficially
 
02:19:50.550 --> 02:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
but they were St it because they
 
02:19:53.710 --> 02:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
couldn't quite track who to cut access
 
02:19:56.349 --> 02:19:56.359 align:start position:0%
to so now they want a code to make it
 
02:19:58.910 --> 02:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
really easy now there was a question
 
02:20:00.830 --> 02:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
asked on whether this data would be
 
02:20:03.790 --> 02:20:03.800 align:start position:0%
available commercially if you look up um
 
02:20:06.150 --> 02:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
Senator weyden's recent press release uh
 
02:20:08.309 --> 02:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
he's uh talking about the fact that the
 
02:20:10.469 --> 02:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
NSA has purchased a massive massive
 
02:20:12.630 --> 02:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
amount of commercially available
 
02:20:14.710 --> 02:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
information to get around the Fourth
 
02:20:16.510 --> 02:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment and basically search your
 
02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
information whether a warrant because
 
02:20:20.389 --> 02:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
they can buy that from Brokers if you
 
02:20:21.910 --> 02:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
read the press release it includes
 
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
purchase information yes that is
 
02:20:27.790 --> 02:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
available that information is on sale if
 
02:20:29.990 --> 02:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
you want to purchase
 
02:20:33.630 --> 02:20:33.640 align:start position:0%
it and if we think that having a bank
 
02:20:39.550 --> 02:20:39.560 align:start position:0%
code for firearm Merchants is a good
 
02:20:42.830 --> 02:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
idea would you feel that having a
 
02:20:44.790 --> 02:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
separate banking code for abortion
 
02:20:46.990 --> 02:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
providers would be appropriate would you
 
02:20:49.190 --> 02:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
see concerns then in terms of what would
 
02:20:50.990 --> 02:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
that do to the privacy of the people
 
02:20:53.110 --> 02:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
that use those Services they're not
 
02:20:54.830 --> 02:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
doing anything wrong they're not
 
02:20:57.349 --> 02:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
breaking any laws why would I keep track
 
02:20:59.630 --> 02:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
of them I want to assure you that I
 
02:21:02.230 --> 02:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
would oppose efforts to keep track of
 
02:21:05.550 --> 02:21:05.560 align:start position:0%
both those types of people or of anybody
 
02:21:08.270 --> 02:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
else who is doing something legal and
 
02:21:10.670 --> 02:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
the government has no business keeping
 
02:21:12.870 --> 02:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
track of them I really appreciate the
 
02:21:15.389 --> 02:21:15.399 align:start position:0%
time and uh I'm available for any
 
02:21:17.590 --> 02:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you I have a quick
 
02:21:20.309 --> 02:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
question um the psychiatrist uh
 
02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
testified a few minutes ago from the uh
 
02:21:26.070 --> 02:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Medical Association and he
 
02:21:28.349 --> 02:21:28.359 align:start position:0%
said that they felt that there should be
 
02:21:31.110 --> 02:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
a a list a registry of people that own
 
02:21:35.469 --> 02:21:35.479 align:start position:0%
firearms and the Firearms they buy um do
 
02:21:38.389 --> 02:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
you think that we should have a list of
 
02:21:40.910 --> 02:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
people who go to see psychiatrists and
 
02:21:43.910 --> 02:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
we keep that for safety purposes I
 
02:21:46.389 --> 02:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
absolutely do not think the government
 
02:21:49.230 --> 02:21:49.240 align:start position:0%
should keep that list because we already
 
02:21:51.230 --> 02:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
have legislation saying that there is a
 
02:21:53.590 --> 02:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
certain amount of mandatory reporting
 
02:21:55.590 --> 02:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
from the medical service
 
02:21:58.429 --> 02:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
professionals but it should be a very
 
02:22:00.309 --> 02:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
high threshold before people end up
 
02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
putting on a registry that can result in
 
02:22:03.469 --> 02:22:03.479 align:start position:0%
them putting you know losing
 
02:22:05.070 --> 02:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights and while I
 
02:22:08.030 --> 02:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
respect the professional opinion of a
 
02:22:11.309 --> 02:22:11.319 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist who Prof has a professional
 
02:22:13.630 --> 02:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
opinion that less access to guns May
 
02:22:15.990 --> 02:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
save lives our job as legislature is to
 
02:22:18.190 --> 02:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
look at the big picture and
 
02:22:20.110 --> 02:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
take a potential benefit and wait
 
02:22:21.870 --> 02:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
against the other costs that such
 
02:22:24.309 --> 02:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
legislation May incur so my opinion as a
 
02:22:26.590 --> 02:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
legislature will consider the opinion of
 
02:22:28.469 --> 02:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
professionals but it cannot just be
 
02:22:31.670 --> 02:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
driven by that thank
 
02:22:34.389 --> 02:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
you that I Clos the public hearing on

thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
02:22:58.910 --> 02:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
committee I will be brief three words to
 
02:23:04.030 --> 02:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
begin data are lethal two quick examples
 
02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
18 April
 
02:23:08.590 --> 02:23:08.600 align:start position:0%

Southwest Pacific Japanese aircraft
 
02:23:14.670 --> 02:23:14.680 align:start position:0%
prepared to land it was shot down by US
 
02:23:19.790 --> 02:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
Army aviators on board is soku Yamamoto
 
02:23:22.030 --> 02:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
who planned the attack on Pearl
 
02:23:25.469 --> 02:23:25.479 align:start position:0%
Harbor Admiral Yamamoto I guess didn't
 
02:23:28.030 --> 02:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
know that the United States had broken
 
02:23:32.110 --> 02:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
Japan's Naval code and thus had his
 
02:23:34.590 --> 02:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
itinerary the only thing that the
 
02:23:38.070 --> 02:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
aviators needed to know where and when
 
02:23:41.389 --> 02:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
nothing more Admiral Yamamoto did not
 
02:23:44.750 --> 02:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
survive the attack fast forward 3
 
02:23:48.150 --> 02:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
January 2020
 
02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:51.760 align:start position:0%

02:23:54.870 --> 02:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
others left Baghdad airport in one of
 
02:23:59.070 --> 02:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
the cars was a colonel kasum
 
02:24:01.830 --> 02:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
solmani of the Islamic revolutionary
 
02:24:01.840 --> 02:24:03.510 align:start position:0%
solmani of the Islamic revolutionary
guard

02:24:03.510 --> 02:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
guard
 
02:24:08.790 --> 02:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
Corps he didn't know that a US drone was
 
02:24:11.469 --> 02:24:11.479 align:start position:0%
up there it fired one or two hired
 
02:24:14.990 --> 02:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
missiles he didn't survive the attack
 
02:24:17.630 --> 02:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
again the only thing that the us needed
 
02:24:22.030 --> 02:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
to know when and where so the idea that
 
02:24:25.910 --> 02:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
data are somehow oh not dangerous is
 
02:24:28.790 --> 02:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
provably false I don't have a horse in
 
02:24:31.269 --> 02:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
this race I'm a lensee I have never
 
02:24:35.630 --> 02:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
taken credit cards further as a leny my
 
02:24:38.710 --> 02:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
name and address are published by the
 
02:24:43.309 --> 02:24:43.319 align:start position:0%
feds this bill ought to be
 
02:24:47.070 --> 02:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
enacted with support from both parties
 
02:24:51.070 --> 02:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
because databases aren't secure anyone
 
02:24:52.830 --> 02:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
who pretends to the
 
02:24:56.269 --> 02:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
contrary should not drink
 
02:24:59.790 --> 02:24:59.800 align:start position:0%
Kool-Aid when JP Morgan Chase major Bank
 
02:25:02.349 --> 02:25:02.359 align:start position:0%
gets hacked and the hackers are in their
 
02:25:04.510 --> 02:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
system for
 
02:25:08.190 --> 02:25:08.200 align:start position:0%
weeks it's a big bank it has plenty of
 
02:25:10.510 --> 02:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
money to spend on data
 
02:25:12.870 --> 02:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
security you
 
02:25:16.309 --> 02:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
cannot imagine you shouldn't imagine
 
02:25:17.950 --> 02:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
that data are
 
02:25:21.550 --> 02:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
secure I'll be happy to take
 
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
02:25:26.190 --> 02:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
02:25:28.389 --> 02:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
chairman with that I open the public
 
02:25:31.830 --> 02:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 1336 and invite
 
02:25:38.110 --> 02:25:38.120 align:start position:0%

bill we got
 
02:25:43.230 --> 02:25:43.240 align:start position:0%

02:25:46.269 --> 02:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much Mr chair and U
 
02:25:47.950 --> 02:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
I forgot to introduce myself when I
 
02:25:50.110 --> 02:25:50.120 align:start position:0%
spoke last I apologize I figured that 3
 
02:25:52.190 --> 02:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
minutes later should cover both I'm
 
02:25:54.389 --> 02:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
Daniel popovic Miller representing
 
02:25:57.230 --> 02:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
Windham Rockingham District
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
17 um I uh filed this bill based on a
 
02:26:03.910 --> 02:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
constituent request somebody came to me
 
02:26:05.030 --> 02:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
and told
 
02:26:07.670 --> 02:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
me I have a problem I know you're are a
 
02:26:07.680 --> 02:26:08.950 align:start position:0%
me I have a problem I know you're are a
State

02:26:08.950 --> 02:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
State
 
02:26:13.150 --> 02:26:13.160 align:start position:0%
Rep I carry concealed my employer is
 
02:26:15.110 --> 02:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
Banning firearm possession on their
 
02:26:17.830 --> 02:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
property and I want to respect that
 
02:26:20.590 --> 02:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm fine with that but unfortunately
 
02:26:22.349 --> 02:26:22.359 align:start position:0%
because I have to park my vehicle in an
 
02:26:24.190 --> 02:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
employee owned parking
 
02:26:27.469 --> 02:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
lot that respecting that choice of my
 
02:26:29.670 --> 02:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
employee which I want to respect
 
02:26:32.070 --> 02:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
requires me to also not carry at all on
 
02:26:34.910 --> 02:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
the way to work and I need to stop and
 
02:26:37.070 --> 02:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
stop the grocery store stop at Banks we
 
02:26:39.030 --> 02:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
have a life and I cannot make a separate
 
02:26:41.190 --> 02:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
trip to work come back carry and now go
 
02:26:44.429 --> 02:26:44.439 align:start position:0%
around so my intent was and by the way
 
02:26:46.950 --> 02:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
here obviously due to the nature of of
 
02:26:49.950 --> 02:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
the concern ask me not to uh ask him to
 
02:26:52.190 --> 02:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
testify or to disclose his information
 
02:26:55.230 --> 02:26:55.240 align:start position:0%
because obviously there are concerns so
 
02:26:59.309 --> 02:26:59.319 align:start position:0%
my intent was to find a way to protect
 
02:27:01.670 --> 02:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
the rights of you know people who want
 
02:27:04.030 --> 02:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
to carry concealed while at the same
 
02:27:06.990 --> 02:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
time not infringing at all or as little
 
02:27:08.309 --> 02:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
as possible on the rights of the
 
02:27:10.429 --> 02:27:10.439 align:start position:0%
employers I think this bill does exactly
 
02:27:12.469 --> 02:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
that and I put a lot of thought into
 
02:27:15.469 --> 02:27:15.479 align:start position:0%
that it's a very simple bill by the way
 
02:27:17.790 --> 02:27:17.800 align:start position:0%
I don't want to use lots of word words
 
02:27:21.030 --> 02:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
when I write legislation it basically
 
02:27:24.349 --> 02:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
says an employee who is coming to work
 
02:27:26.910 --> 02:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
in his own vehicle has the right to
 
02:27:29.910 --> 02:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
leave that thing locked and out of sight
 
02:27:31.150 --> 02:27:31.160 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:27:33.830 --> 02:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
vehicle as long as they do that the
 
02:27:37.030 --> 02:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
employer is not allowed to ask them
 
02:27:40.230 --> 02:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
about it to search the car or to punish
 
02:27:42.150 --> 02:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
them in any way they become aware that
 
02:27:44.389 --> 02:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
there is a firearm in the vehicle as
 
02:27:47.230 --> 02:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
long as again the firearm is out of site
 
02:27:48.870 --> 02:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
in a locked
 
02:27:51.309 --> 02:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle because the
 
02:27:54.550 --> 02:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
employer will you know have that firearm
 
02:27:56.030 --> 02:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
potentially in the parking lot there is
 
02:27:57.990 --> 02:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
a paragraph in the bill insulating the
 
02:28:00.150 --> 02:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
employers from any civil action in
 
02:28:03.230 --> 02:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
regards to uh any losses that may occur
 
02:28:05.469 --> 02:28:05.479 align:start position:0%
from them following the law I don't want
 
02:28:07.910 --> 02:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
to have a law that puts employees
 
02:28:09.870 --> 02:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
employers at risk of being sued for
 
02:28:12.309 --> 02:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
something they are legally required to
 
02:28:18.030 --> 02:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
do and really that's about I recognize
 
02:28:20.389 --> 02:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
that there is a minimal impact on the
 
02:28:22.429 --> 02:28:22.439 align:start position:0%
right of an employer to control access
 
02:28:24.469 --> 02:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
to firearms on their property but since
 
02:28:27.510 --> 02:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
it is so restricted to just a personal
 
02:28:30.070 --> 02:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle of employee and the firearm has
 
02:28:32.150 --> 02:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
to remain locked and out of sight in the
 
02:28:35.150 --> 02:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
vehicle I believe that I did everything
 
02:28:37.110 --> 02:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
I could to minimize that impact while at
 
02:28:39.469 --> 02:28:39.479 align:start position:0%
the same time protecting the rights of
 
02:28:42.550 --> 02:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
people that want to carry concealed on
 
02:28:46.950 --> 02:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
the way home and back to do so and again
 
02:28:48.670 --> 02:28:48.680 align:start position:0%
respect the rights of the employer and
 
02:28:50.550 --> 02:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
that's my introduction and of course I'm
 
02:28:55.309 --> 02:28:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:59.870 --> 02:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:03.030 --> 02:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
Muse so I know in New Hampshire we spent
 
02:29:05.110 --> 02:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of time on on especially on this
 
02:29:07.150 --> 02:29:07.160 align:start position:0%
committee talking about property rights
 
02:29:10.150 --> 02:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
as well as as well as gun rights and I'm
 
02:29:13.790 --> 02:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm kind of curious how you how well
 
02:29:16.790 --> 02:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
you think your law strikes your proposal
 
02:29:18.710 --> 02:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
law strikes a balance between those two
 
02:29:21.950 --> 02:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
things thank you for asking I
 
02:29:23.389 --> 02:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that concern from the
 
02:29:26.309 --> 02:29:26.319 align:start position:0%
beginning right I I try to present my
 
02:29:29.110 --> 02:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
laws my bills in as objective a manner
 
02:29:31.710 --> 02:29:31.720 align:start position:0%
as possible so I acknowledge there is an
 
02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely minimal infringement that in
 
02:29:38.190 --> 02:29:38.200 align:start position:0%
my opinion is more than balanced by the
 
02:29:40.750 --> 02:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
benefits that it gives look I do not
 
02:29:43.630 --> 02:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
believe that employers are creating
 
02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
those restrictions to control what
 
02:29:48.349 --> 02:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
people do outside side of their
 
02:29:51.190 --> 02:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
property unfortunately we do have that
 
02:29:53.590 --> 02:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
minimal area where I cross onto employee
 
02:29:55.750 --> 02:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
proper employer property to park and
 
02:29:59.349 --> 02:29:59.359 align:start position:0%
that's it and their desire to regulate
 
02:30:01.590 --> 02:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
that essentially extends that boundary
 
02:30:03.349 --> 02:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
tens of Miles depending on how long
 
02:30:05.469 --> 02:30:05.479 align:start position:0%
somebody commutes to work I don't
 
02:30:07.230 --> 02:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
believe that's their intent and I spend
 
02:30:09.870 --> 02:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of time trying to again address
 
02:30:13.309 --> 02:30:13.319 align:start position:0%
that issue with absolutely a minimal
 
02:30:14.750 --> 02:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
impact and again this is why they're
 
02:30:17.030 --> 02:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
insulated from any Civil Life ability
 
02:30:19.070 --> 02:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
I've done everything I could and the
 
02:30:25.190 --> 02:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:28.230 --> 02:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
that would the liability protection in
 
02:30:31.870 --> 02:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
your bill for example extend let's say
 
02:30:33.750 --> 02:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
to uh an
 
02:30:36.030 --> 02:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
employer uh let let's say somebody
 
02:30:39.030 --> 02:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
breaks into the car on site a lot of a
 
02:30:40.750 --> 02:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
lot of companies have parking lots that
 
02:30:43.710 --> 02:30:43.720 align:start position:0%
are out in the open um steals the
 
02:30:46.670 --> 02:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
weapons and uses the weapons to rob
 
02:30:48.710 --> 02:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
somebody shoot somebody do harm to to
 
02:30:53.710 --> 02:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
some other person um because the because
 
02:30:56.670 --> 02:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
the employer had a policy allowing
 
02:30:59.990 --> 02:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
weapons to be stored on site that may
 
02:31:01.990 --> 02:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
not have
 
02:31:04.349 --> 02:31:04.359 align:start position:0%
been maybe in an area that could have
 
02:31:06.070 --> 02:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
been maybe better protected than it
 
02:31:09.030 --> 02:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
could have been uh but maybe it wasn't
 
02:31:13.230 --> 02:31:13.240 align:start position:0%
does that create a situation where the
 
02:31:16.429 --> 02:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
the employer is exposed to a different
 
02:31:17.710 --> 02:31:17.720 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
02:31:22.469 --> 02:31:22.479 align:start position:0%
liability in my opinion no I also spoke
 
02:31:25.510 --> 02:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
with the I OSS drafting attorneys and
 
02:31:27.429 --> 02:31:27.439 align:start position:0%
asked that very question and they
 
02:31:30.870 --> 02:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
assured me that this language would not
 
02:31:34.790 --> 02:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
expose the employer to any liability
 
02:31:36.670 --> 02:31:36.680 align:start position:0%
from this because obviously criminally
 
02:31:37.950 --> 02:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
there couldn't be liability because they
 
02:31:39.309 --> 02:31:39.319 align:start position:0%
are obeying state law and by the way
 
02:31:40.750 --> 02:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
it's not their policy it's a state law
 
02:31:42.670 --> 02:31:42.680 align:start position:0%
they have to obey it's not a
 
02:31:44.950 --> 02:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
discretionary choice of theirs this
 
02:31:47.230 --> 02:31:47.240 align:start position:0%
takes that decision out of that hand so
 
02:31:49.070 --> 02:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
therefore no liability can be attached
 
02:31:51.429 --> 02:31:51.439 align:start position:0%
to them for following a state law
 
02:31:53.670 --> 02:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
essentially this would increase the
 
02:31:56.110 --> 02:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
protection of employers that may
 
02:31:58.190 --> 02:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise be look the real risk right
 
02:32:00.110 --> 02:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
now is that you have a policy that's not
 
02:32:01.830 --> 02:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
consistently enforced if the same
 
02:32:03.750 --> 02:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
scenario happened the employer would
 
02:32:06.269 --> 02:32:06.279 align:start position:0%
actually may be liable today if we do
 
02:32:09.389 --> 02:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
pass this this will protect the employer
 
02:32:10.990 --> 02:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
and frankly the liability in that
 
02:32:12.870 --> 02:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
situation should be on the person who
 
02:32:15.070 --> 02:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
broke into a car and stole property I I
 
02:32:17.870 --> 02:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
really don't like the concept the legal
 
02:32:19.830 --> 02:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
concept that I've seen applied that you
 
02:32:21.590 --> 02:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
know I'm somehow responsible because
 
02:32:23.309 --> 02:32:23.319 align:start position:0%
somebody broke into my house and stole
 
02:32:25.030 --> 02:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
property and used that property to
 
02:32:28.230 --> 02:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
commit crimes I mean you know anybody of
 
02:32:30.950 --> 02:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
us could go to jail for that you know I
 
02:32:32.710 --> 02:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
don't think it's okay to punish people
 
02:32:33.910 --> 02:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
who've done nothing wrong because
 
02:32:35.309 --> 02:32:35.319 align:start position:0%
they're a victim of a crime but that's a
 
02:32:37.429 --> 02:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
discussion for another
 
02:32:40.269 --> 02:32:40.279 align:start position:0%
hearing thank you thank you
 
02:32:40.279 --> 02:32:42.710 align:start position:0%
hearing thank you thank you
representative

02:32:42.710 --> 02:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:32:45.429 --> 02:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
Newman yeah I just want to clar clarify
 
02:32:47.750 --> 02:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
this law would apply apply to a loaded
 
02:32:50.389 --> 02:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
weapon that is just secur is under the
 
02:32:53.190 --> 02:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
seat and the the vehicle is locked the
 
02:32:55.750 --> 02:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
requirement is that the firearm be out
 
02:32:58.710 --> 02:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
of sight and the vehicle be locked the
 
02:33:00.429 --> 02:33:00.439 align:start position:0%
the intent behind this is to have
 
02:33:02.070 --> 02:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable protections against the
 
02:33:04.469 --> 02:33:04.479 align:start position:0%
possibility somebody may see something
 
02:33:06.230 --> 02:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
and be tempted to steal it I mean if you
 
02:33:07.830 --> 02:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
live a firearm on your dashboard and
 
02:33:09.710 --> 02:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
everybody can see it this this does not
 
02:33:12.389 --> 02:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
protect you you were careless but as
 
02:33:14.870 --> 02:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
long as it's out of sight and in a
 
02:33:17.030 --> 02:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
locked vehicle how much more can we
 
02:33:19.030 --> 02:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
reasonably ask anybody to do to protect
 
02:33:20.750 --> 02:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
their property I mean to me that's as
 
02:33:23.349 --> 02:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
far as you can ask and be reasonable and
 
02:33:27.510 --> 02:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
not start in trapping innocent people in
 
02:33:31.750 --> 02:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
crimes follow up follow up and uh it
 
02:33:35.950 --> 02:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:38.910 --> 02:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
well I'm Not Gon to ask
 
02:33:40.990 --> 02:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
question represent
 
02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
sake thank you and thank you for taking
 
02:33:45.750 --> 02:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
my question I'm I'm wondering whether
 
02:33:49.030 --> 02:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
you would be be open to a very small
 
02:33:51.389 --> 02:33:51.399 align:start position:0%
amendment that would say that the person
 
02:33:54.790 --> 02:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
would need to have their weapon in a
 
02:33:57.950 --> 02:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
locked case within a locked vehicle
 
02:33:59.389 --> 02:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
essentially to double the layer of
 
02:34:01.070 --> 02:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
security right so that if someone
 
02:34:02.830 --> 02:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
happened to be randomly breaking into
 
02:34:04.389 --> 02:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
cars as we know happens or if someone
 
02:34:06.750 --> 02:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
forgot to lock their car that day it
 
02:34:09.230 --> 02:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
would just add an additional layer of
 
02:34:12.190 --> 02:34:12.200 align:start position:0%
protection for the general public
 
02:34:16.990 --> 02:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
um I I will consider it but my first
 
02:34:20.469 --> 02:34:20.479 align:start position:0%
take since you know it I had exactly
 
02:34:22.990 --> 02:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
five seconds to think about it I come
 
02:34:25.030 --> 02:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts and I've seen
 
02:34:28.710 --> 02:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts prosecute innocent people
 
02:34:30.870 --> 02:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
for having their house broken into and
 
02:34:32.550 --> 02:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
Firearms stolen because they violated
 
02:34:35.030 --> 02:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts storage law I think
 
02:34:37.269 --> 02:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
that anybody who breaks into a vehicle
 
02:34:38.870 --> 02:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
will also have the ability to break into
 
02:34:41.150 --> 02:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
a log boox look I have a little safe in
 
02:34:43.550 --> 02:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
my house that I use for my carry stuff
 
02:34:46.190 --> 02:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
right I know that if somebody takes it
 
02:34:48.870 --> 02:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
outside and US uses a big hammer in 5
 
02:34:51.110 --> 02:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
minutes they'll open it it's meant to
 
02:34:53.349 --> 02:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
protect somebody from you know a quick
 
02:34:55.349 --> 02:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
attempt to grab something in a few
 
02:34:57.429 --> 02:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
seconds I think that anybody who already
 
02:34:59.469 --> 02:34:59.479 align:start position:0%
broke into a car will not be deterred by
 
02:35:02.190 --> 02:35:02.200 align:start position:0%
more boxes and I I hesitate
 
02:35:05.630 --> 02:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
to add more risk for the employees that
 
02:35:08.510 --> 02:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to protect and more costs
 
02:35:10.510 --> 02:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
without what I perceive to see a good
 
02:35:12.429 --> 02:35:12.439 align:start position:0%
benefit but I would be open to talking
 
02:35:14.309 --> 02:35:14.319 align:start position:0%
about it maybe offline after the hearing
 
02:35:20.190 --> 02:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:22.349 --> 02:35:22.359 align:start position:0%
sense thank
 
02:35:29.790 --> 02:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:33.990 --> 02:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:38.590 --> 02:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
phone um wow I'm even short at the desk
 
02:35:40.349 --> 02:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
um while we agree that granted Staters
 
02:35:41.670 --> 02:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
should be able to practice their
 
02:35:44.070 --> 02:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
fundamental human right to self-defense
 
02:35:46.309 --> 02:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
however and wherever they say fit the
 
02:35:47.670 --> 02:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
government shouldn't be getting involved
 
02:35:49.550 --> 02:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
nor mandating what a private company
 
02:35:51.830 --> 02:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
does we know of instances where
 
02:35:54.469 --> 02:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
companies have a no firearms policy but
 
02:35:56.389 --> 02:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
in domestic abuse and stalking cases
 
02:35:57.750 --> 02:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
they have allowed employees to carry
 
02:36:00.150 --> 02:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
firearms in their vehicles so they could
 
02:36:04.389 --> 02:36:04.399 align:start position:0%
be protected when they left the actual U
 
02:36:07.309 --> 02:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
business and um another thing to think
 
02:36:09.469 --> 02:36:09.479 align:start position:0%
about is if this was actually
 
02:36:11.510 --> 02:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
implemented and it could be easily
 
02:36:13.230 --> 02:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
flipped around if God forbid the gun
 
02:36:15.230 --> 02:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
control crowd was to gain control of the
 
02:36:17.309 --> 02:36:17.319 align:start position:0%
legislature and the corner office they
 
02:36:19.230 --> 02:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
could flip this and say that no
 
02:36:21.269 --> 02:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
employers are allowed to ever allow
 
02:36:22.910 --> 02:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
employees to carry firearms whether in
 
02:36:24.349 --> 02:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
their vehicle or on the person and this
 
02:36:28.429 --> 02:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
would apply to ranges gun shops Etc this
 
02:36:29.990 --> 02:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
is an issue between employees and their
 
02:36:31.590 --> 02:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
employers not an issue that the
 
02:36:32.990 --> 02:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
government should be involved with
 
02:36:34.830 --> 02:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
please vote in expedient to legislate on
 
02:36:34.840 --> 02:36:36.790 align:start position:0%
please vote in expedient to legislate on
this

02:36:36.790 --> 02:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:36:41.429 --> 02:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
you chair calls attorney Penny
 
02:36:44.880 --> 02:37:01.389 align:start position:0%
you chair calls attorney Penny
Dean

02:37:01.389 --> 02:37:01.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:03.110 --> 02:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
Penny Dean again from conquered New
 
02:37:05.550 --> 02:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representing myself I
 
02:37:07.070 --> 02:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
respectfully say this should get an
 
02:37:11.110 --> 02:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
ought to pass um as it is and here's the
 
02:37:13.830 --> 02:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
reason we have more multinational
 
02:37:15.510 --> 02:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
companies in this state than you'd
 
02:37:15.520 --> 02:37:16.990 align:start position:0%
companies in this state than you'd
realize

02:37:16.990 --> 02:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
realize
 
02:37:19.630 --> 02:37:19.640 align:start position:0%
and a lot of them are large employers
 
02:37:22.230 --> 02:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
and some of them come from places where
 
02:37:25.469 --> 02:37:25.479 align:start position:0%
the Second Amendment just is doesn't
 
02:37:28.389 --> 02:37:28.399 align:start position:0%
exist and it's an Abomination to some of
 
02:37:30.750 --> 02:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
them sadly but yet they choose to do
 
02:37:33.190 --> 02:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
business in our state and this would
 
02:37:35.990 --> 02:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
give those employers cover in other
 
02:37:38.070 --> 02:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
words employees that work there would be
 
02:37:39.710 --> 02:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
able to carry firearms and they would be
 
02:37:42.950 --> 02:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
able to tell their corporate owners in
 
02:37:45.269 --> 02:37:45.279 align:start position:0%
Europe primarily Europe some in the East
 
02:37:46.870 --> 02:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
to say look look we have to let
 
02:37:48.550 --> 02:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
employees carry here because it's state
 
02:37:50.750 --> 02:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
law we can't do anything about it we
 
02:37:52.150 --> 02:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
have to follow the laws of the state we
 
02:37:54.630 --> 02:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
don't want to pick up and move and the
 
02:37:57.830 --> 02:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
bottom line is the ones that claim that
 
02:37:59.910 --> 02:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
the only reason that they don't want
 
02:38:01.389 --> 02:38:01.399 align:start position:0%
employees to have firearms in their
 
02:38:03.269 --> 02:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
vehicles in the parking lot they'll say
 
02:38:05.950 --> 02:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
we're afraid of liability taking care of
 
02:38:08.750 --> 02:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
here you don't have any liability so the
 
02:38:11.830 --> 02:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
objections that they have are all solved
 
02:38:14.630 --> 02:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
right here but the bottom line is I'm
 
02:38:17.630 --> 02:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
very fortunate I work for myself so I I
 
02:38:20.309 --> 02:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
can do what I want but I know a lot of
 
02:38:22.429 --> 02:38:22.439 align:start position:0%
people because of family reasons because
 
02:38:24.030 --> 02:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
of obligations because of health
 
02:38:26.429 --> 02:38:26.439 align:start position:0%
insurance because of careers that work
 
02:38:29.429 --> 02:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
at places that don't allow them to
 
02:38:31.750 --> 02:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
exercise their second amendment rights
 
02:38:33.750 --> 02:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
they are mandated to park an employee
 
02:38:37.150 --> 02:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
parking lot and the employee parking lot
 
02:38:38.590 --> 02:38:38.600 align:start position:0%
isn't allowed
 
02:38:41.030 --> 02:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
guns and they know their vehicle to get
 
02:38:43.309 --> 02:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
searched at any time and if their guns
 
02:38:44.950 --> 02:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
are found there'd be a problem some
 
02:38:46.870 --> 02:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
choose not to kill carry guns cuz of the
 
02:38:50.550 --> 02:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
risk others choose the option that I
 
02:38:53.990 --> 02:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
suggest is you have to be alive to be
 
02:38:57.150 --> 02:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
fired but again that's an easy choice
 
02:38:58.550 --> 02:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
for a person that doesn't have a wife
 
02:39:01.030 --> 02:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
and three kids to support so I look at
 
02:39:02.990 --> 02:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
this and this gives people a Level
 
02:39:05.950 --> 02:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
Playing Field I respectfully suggest
 
02:39:08.349 --> 02:39:08.359 align:start position:0%
that there's harm to no
 
02:39:11.230 --> 02:39:11.240 align:start position:0%
one that whether or not it should be
 
02:39:13.309 --> 02:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
between employers and employees as a
 
02:39:14.950 --> 02:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
practical matter employees don't have
 
02:39:17.510 --> 02:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
the same bargaining power and that gives
 
02:39:19.830 --> 02:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
those who don't have the education I'm
 
02:39:21.469 --> 02:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
very fortunate I have a fair amount of
 
02:39:23.590 --> 02:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
Education I have a lot of employment
 
02:39:25.070 --> 02:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
options there's a lot of people in the
 
02:39:26.269 --> 02:39:26.279 align:start position:0%
state that don't have a lot of
 
02:39:28.750 --> 02:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
employment options even though we have a
 
02:39:30.429 --> 02:39:30.439 align:start position:0%
great economy and low employment they
 
02:39:32.950 --> 02:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
can't just go anywhere and so you have
 
02:39:35.750 --> 02:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
to say this protects the least of us
 
02:39:38.230 --> 02:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
this protects the man who can't stand up
 
02:39:39.990 --> 02:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
for himself this protects the man with a
 
02:39:41.910 --> 02:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
high school diploma that's trying to
 
02:39:44.670 --> 02:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
support his family so I respectfully say
 
02:39:46.030 --> 02:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
if there's anything you could can do to
 
02:39:48.110 --> 02:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
help the poor and the powerless this
 
02:39:50.670 --> 02:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
does help them this gives them the
 
02:39:53.269 --> 02:39:53.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to protect themselves going
 
02:39:56.110 --> 02:39:56.120 align:start position:0%
home maybe in the Lesser quality
 
02:39:58.670 --> 02:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
neighborhood you know maybe shopping at
 
02:40:00.349 --> 02:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
the store picking up their wife or
 
02:40:02.429 --> 02:40:02.439 align:start position:0%
whatever I respectfully say I don't see
 
02:40:04.429 --> 02:40:04.439 align:start position:0%
the harm in it and I see a lot of good
 
02:40:08.070 --> 02:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
in it and I'm happy to answer any
 
02:40:10.590 --> 02:40:10.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um could you tell us
 
02:40:12.469 --> 02:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
what the state of the law is currently
 
02:40:14.750 --> 02:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
with regard to um leaving firearms and
 
02:40:17.950 --> 02:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
vehicles um in New
 
02:40:22.150 --> 02:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we don't have a law requiring
 
02:40:24.030 --> 02:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
they be locked in vehicles so there
 
02:40:26.550 --> 02:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
currently is not a law requiring they be
 
02:40:29.870 --> 02:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
locked and there isn't any statutory law
 
02:40:33.070 --> 02:40:33.080 align:start position:0%
per se there is laws that say about
 
02:40:35.469 --> 02:40:35.479 align:start position:0%
negligent um storage where miners get
 
02:40:37.870 --> 02:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
access to guns of course and you could
 
02:40:40.309 --> 02:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
say that's in a car anywhere so most
 
02:40:42.630 --> 02:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
prudent people are going to lock a car
 
02:40:45.790 --> 02:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
but I do agree with um representative
 
02:40:48.670 --> 02:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
that adding lock boxes and stuff that's
 
02:40:51.590 --> 02:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
just a pain in the foot and a recipe for
 
02:40:53.590 --> 02:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
disaster each person's going to make
 
02:40:55.710 --> 02:40:55.720 align:start position:0%
their own choices but it's kind of like
 
02:40:58.070 --> 02:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
the robber rapists that they'll break 10
 
02:40:59.870 --> 02:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
laws but they won't break 11 I'm not
 
02:41:01.990 --> 02:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
buying that anybody is going to break
 
02:41:04.030 --> 02:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
into your car you know they're just
 
02:41:05.870 --> 02:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
going to take the lock box with them
 
02:41:09.070 --> 02:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
anyhow you know so I think that this
 
02:41:11.429 --> 02:41:11.439 align:start position:0%
solves the problem presuming you keep
 
02:41:14.670 --> 02:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
your vehicle locked and I don't see any
 
02:41:16.630 --> 02:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
other legal impediments in New Hampshire
 
02:41:19.150 --> 02:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
to this bill and it really does give the
 
02:41:22.190 --> 02:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
employers cover you know and and that's
 
02:41:23.870 --> 02:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
what they they claim they're worried
 
02:41:29.030 --> 02:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:31.990 --> 02:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
it representative Stone thank you
 
02:41:34.110 --> 02:41:34.120 align:start position:0%
chairman Roy and thank you for taking my
 
02:41:36.190 --> 02:41:36.200 align:start position:0%
question in your opinion or in the state
 
02:41:39.030 --> 02:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire is it viewed under law
 
02:41:41.389 --> 02:41:41.399 align:start position:0%
that your motor vehicle has a higher uh
 
02:41:44.190 --> 02:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
interest of privacy such as an extension
 
02:41:47.389 --> 02:41:47.399 align:start position:0%
of your home it is is it is um we are
 
02:41:49.590 --> 02:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
very very fortunate and a lot of people
 
02:41:51.269 --> 02:41:51.279 align:start position:0%
don't understand this but the United
 
02:41:54.790 --> 02:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
States Constitution um has a baseline
 
02:41:57.269 --> 02:41:57.279 align:start position:0%
you can't go before in constitutional
 
02:41:59.550 --> 02:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
rights but you're allowed to go higher
 
02:42:01.590 --> 02:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
and in New Hampshire in many areas we've
 
02:42:04.150 --> 02:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
chosen to value our constitutional
 
02:42:05.750 --> 02:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
rights if you will greater than the
 
02:42:08.110 --> 02:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
federal and so it is considered an
 
02:42:10.349 --> 02:42:10.359 align:start position:0%
extension of your person and just like I
 
02:42:11.910 --> 02:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't expect that you could just walk
 
02:42:13.550 --> 02:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
and get in my vehicle and start picking
 
02:42:16.070 --> 02:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
through my glove box I would presume I
 
02:42:17.590 --> 02:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
have some privacy and everything
 
02:42:20.030 --> 02:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
contained in the vehicle and as long as
 
02:42:22.309 --> 02:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
my employment contract doesn't provide
 
02:42:24.750 --> 02:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise um I think they should stay
 
02:42:27.070 --> 02:42:27.080 align:start position:0%
out of my vehicle quick
 
02:42:29.070 --> 02:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
followup could you also remind me what
 
02:42:30.710 --> 02:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
the penalty for a theft of a firearm in
 
02:42:32.030 --> 02:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:42:35.230 --> 02:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
is under federal law under New Hampshire
 
02:42:37.309 --> 02:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
state law there is an append it would
 
02:42:39.870 --> 02:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
depend on the value of the firearm 1500
 
02:42:42.230 --> 02:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
would be a felony so in New Hampshire
 
02:42:44.150 --> 02:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
the penalty levels go on the dollar
 
02:42:46.389 --> 02:42:46.399 align:start position:0%
value of the item
 
02:42:48.910 --> 02:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
thank you is there a federal law that
 
02:42:51.269 --> 02:42:51.279 align:start position:0%
you're aware of um regarding the theft
 
02:42:53.910 --> 02:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
of firearms I'm sorry is there a federal
 
02:42:55.269 --> 02:42:55.279 align:start position:0%
law that you're aware of regarding the
 
02:42:57.670 --> 02:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
theft of firearms depending on what you
 
02:43:00.429 --> 02:43:00.439 align:start position:0%
do yes depending on how it's taken in in
 
02:43:00.439 --> 02:43:03.030 align:start position:0%
do yes depending on how it's taken in in
such

02:43:03.030 --> 02:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:05.830 --> 02:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
yes and from where it's taken I should
 
02:43:08.510 --> 02:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
add okay thank you um see no further
 
02:43:10.950 --> 02:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you you
 
02:43:14.269 --> 02:43:14.279 align:start position:0%
Testament the chair calls Katherine
 
02:43:14.279 --> 02:43:28.389 align:start position:0%
Testament the chair calls Katherine
giddens

02:43:28.389 --> 02:43:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:31.150 --> 02:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I'm speaking right
 
02:43:34.070 --> 02:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
now just as uh for myself as a local
 
02:43:37.870 --> 02:43:37.880 align:start position:0%
resident um and I just wanted to um at
 
02:43:40.510 --> 02:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
whatever weight that is I'll be it uh
 
02:43:43.030 --> 02:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
very minimal uh to the spirit of this
 
02:43:46.510 --> 02:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
bill I think it um
 
02:43:49.389 --> 02:43:49.399 align:start position:0%
um I think it does make sense that
 
02:43:51.030 --> 02:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
although you may be parked on your
 
02:43:53.070 --> 02:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
employers you know in your employers
 
02:43:56.429 --> 02:43:56.439 align:start position:0%
parking lot it's it's your car it's an
 
02:43:59.469 --> 02:43:59.479 align:start position:0%
extension of your home and uh If an
 
02:44:03.630 --> 02:44:03.640 align:start position:0%
employer is not allowed to um inquire
 
02:44:07.110 --> 02:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
into your religion you know if they're
 
02:44:12.110 --> 02:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
not allowed to um um make any decisions
 
02:44:14.510 --> 02:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
for or against you based on your you
 
02:44:17.110 --> 02:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
know your ual preference or your
 
02:44:19.269 --> 02:44:19.279 align:start position:0%
whatever Creed you have whatever race
 
02:44:23.590 --> 02:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
you are um I would argue that um firearm
 
02:44:26.830 --> 02:44:26.840 align:start position:0%
ownership is part of a certain Creed and
 
02:44:30.510 --> 02:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
um if you uh store that safely in your
 
02:44:34.309 --> 02:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
car then uh it's no business of an
 
02:44:37.790 --> 02:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
employers um and that is just my
 
02:44:40.110 --> 02:44:40.120 align:start position:0%
personal opinion that's all I have to
 
02:44:43.190 --> 02:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
say thank you see no questions thank you
 
02:44:51.070 --> 02:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:53.670 --> 02:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
Rogers thank you
 
02:44:58.070 --> 02:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
again for giving me a chance to speak um
 
02:45:00.990 --> 02:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
I carry every day and when I heard this
 
02:45:04.710 --> 02:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
come up I said you know if I was in that
 
02:45:07.389 --> 02:45:07.399 align:start position:0%
situation I would have a problem I would
 
02:45:07.399 --> 02:45:08.590 align:start position:0%
situation I would have a problem I would
not

02:45:08.590 --> 02:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:45:11.950 --> 02:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
feel I was being responsible if I left a
 
02:45:15.790 --> 02:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
car if I left my firearm in a car even
 
02:45:18.670 --> 02:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
if it was locked I would not I would my
 
02:45:20.950 --> 02:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
choice would be not to do that because
 
02:45:25.070 --> 02:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
it's too easily stolen if it's stolen
 
02:45:27.830 --> 02:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
well let's let's face it Saints don't
 
02:45:30.630 --> 02:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
steal things if it's if they're going to
 
02:45:32.150 --> 02:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
steal it they're probably going to use
 
02:45:34.510 --> 02:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
it in a crime but when the
 
02:45:37.269 --> 02:45:37.279 align:start position:0%
representative said perhaps an amendment
 
02:45:39.790 --> 02:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
to have to put it in a locked box still
 
02:45:42.510 --> 02:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
out of sight in a car I would support
 
02:45:45.110 --> 02:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
that um but I wouldn't I could not
 
02:45:46.950 --> 02:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
support it without that Amendment
 
02:45:49.590 --> 02:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
because again personally I would not
 
02:45:52.469 --> 02:45:52.479 align:start position:0%
leave my gun in a locked
 
02:45:57.550 --> 02:45:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:08.150 --> 02:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:11.349 --> 02:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
Lynn thank you Mr chair and uh members
 
02:46:13.550 --> 02:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
of the committee I I appear here in
 
02:46:16.990 --> 02:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
support of this bill I'm co-sponsor and
 
02:46:18.389 --> 02:46:18.399 align:start position:0%
I have to say when representative
 
02:46:20.590 --> 02:46:20.600 align:start position:0%
papichi meller first approached me about
 
02:46:21.990 --> 02:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
whether I would be a co-sponsor in this
 
02:46:24.750 --> 02:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
bill I I have to say that I had to think
 
02:46:27.030 --> 02:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
about it because as representative Muse
 
02:46:29.230 --> 02:46:29.240 align:start position:0%
points out I I am also a very strong
 
02:46:31.190 --> 02:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
believer in property rights and you know
 
02:46:33.389 --> 02:46:33.399 align:start position:0%
the general view I think the general
 
02:46:35.830 --> 02:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
rule is if it's the employer's property
 
02:46:37.389 --> 02:46:37.399 align:start position:0%
you know the employer gets to say what
 
02:46:40.670 --> 02:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
the rules are I mean I I you know I
 
02:46:43.389 --> 02:46:43.399 align:start position:0%
gener as a general matter I I support
 
02:46:46.990 --> 02:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
that view um but I think here you're
 
02:46:49.230 --> 02:46:49.240 align:start position:0%
it's a question really of balancing that
 
02:46:52.830 --> 02:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
employer's right against the uh the the
 
02:46:55.309 --> 02:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
individual's right uh to be able to
 
02:46:57.830 --> 02:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
exercise his second amendment rights or
 
02:46:59.870 --> 02:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
his rights under uh under the New
 
02:47:02.950 --> 02:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution to to own uh and
 
02:47:06.590 --> 02:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
and to uh and to Bear uh firearms and as
 
02:47:09.550 --> 02:47:09.560 align:start position:0%
as as representative uh papichi Muller
 
02:47:11.990 --> 02:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
pointed out if you you know the problem
 
02:47:15.230 --> 02:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
here is if you have If an employer has
 
02:47:18.309 --> 02:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
that policy of no guns in the parking
 
02:47:21.349 --> 02:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
lot it effectively mean it it
 
02:47:25.550 --> 02:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
effectively means that the the employee
 
02:47:28.830 --> 02:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
can't exercise his rights on the way to
 
02:47:31.750 --> 02:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
the to the to work or on the way home
 
02:47:33.590 --> 02:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
because it you know you're not going to
 
02:47:35.830 --> 02:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
what are you going to do uh it it's just
 
02:47:38.269 --> 02:47:38.279 align:start position:0%
not it's just not practical and I guess
 
02:47:40.510 --> 02:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
I I I guess I would use a sort of a a
 
02:47:43.150 --> 02:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
sort of personal example fortunately I
 
02:47:45.070 --> 02:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
never worked at an employer that had a
 
02:47:48.710 --> 02:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
rule of no no guns outside the you know
 
02:47:50.389 --> 02:47:50.399 align:start position:0%
outside wherever you are but I'm a
 
02:47:53.510 --> 02:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
Target shooter so on Tuesday night uh
 
02:47:56.510 --> 02:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
you know it it's it's very recently very
 
02:47:58.429 --> 02:47:58.439 align:start position:0%
recently stopped because the the other
 
02:48:01.269 --> 02:48:01.279 align:start position:0%
people on the team you know got too old
 
02:48:05.110 --> 02:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
to to continue shooting and so that that
 
02:48:06.830 --> 02:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
that particular team kind of went to
 
02:48:11.790 --> 02:48:11.800 align:start position:0%
Funk but for 20 years if it was Tuesday
 
02:48:14.309 --> 02:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
night I was shooting in at the major
 
02:48:16.910 --> 02:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
walren uh Sportsman Club in barington
 
02:48:18.950 --> 02:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we had a we had a league
 
02:48:21.150 --> 02:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
so I live in Windham and I worked in
 
02:48:23.349 --> 02:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
conquered for a good part of that time
 
02:48:25.750 --> 02:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
so you know if you if you chart that out
 
02:48:27.190 --> 02:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty that's a pretty pretty
 
02:48:29.910 --> 02:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
big triangle to drive from Windam to
 
02:48:32.429 --> 02:48:32.439 align:start position:0%
conquer to go to work then after work
 
02:48:35.030 --> 02:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
drive to barington to go shoot and then
 
02:48:37.710 --> 02:48:37.720 align:start position:0%
drive back home to Windam so if I
 
02:48:39.990 --> 02:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't you know and I would have so on
 
02:48:43.150 --> 02:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
Tuesday night I would have my 22 target
 
02:48:46.150 --> 02:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
rifle locked in the car in the in my the
 
02:48:48.110 --> 02:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
back of my car and since it's a rifle
 
02:48:49.590 --> 02:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
you know you wouldn't put you can't put
 
02:48:51.990 --> 02:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
it under the seat um it was in the it
 
02:48:55.230 --> 02:48:55.240 align:start position:0%
was either in the trunk or if I had a a
 
02:48:58.110 --> 02:48:58.120 align:start position:0%
station wagon it was was in the back and
 
02:49:01.269 --> 02:49:01.279 align:start position:0%
I and I always kept the the case locked
 
02:49:04.510 --> 02:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
although candidly you know that's not as
 
02:49:06.190 --> 02:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
other people have pointed out that's not
 
02:49:08.950 --> 02:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
really much protection the the case is
 
02:49:11.910 --> 02:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
locked but you know somebody has a
 
02:49:13.469 --> 02:49:13.479 align:start position:0%
somebody has a sledgehammer or whatever
 
02:49:14.590 --> 02:49:14.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able to pretty it's
 
02:49:16.630 --> 02:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
not going to take them very long to uh
 
02:49:19.990 --> 02:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
to to get into the into the uh into the
 
02:49:22.110 --> 02:49:22.120 align:start position:0%
gun case and so I use that just as a
 
02:49:25.349 --> 02:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
very practical example is if you know if
 
02:49:28.070 --> 02:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
I worked at some employer that said you
 
02:49:29.710 --> 02:49:29.720 align:start position:0%
can't have guns in the parking lot what
 
02:49:31.870 --> 02:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
what what what do I do and why does it
 
02:49:34.670 --> 02:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
make sense for me for for me not to be
 
02:49:38.510 --> 02:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
able to have a gun locked in the car um
 
02:49:40.269 --> 02:49:40.279 align:start position:0%
so that I can you know so that at the
 
02:49:41.950 --> 02:49:41.960 align:start position:0%
end of the day I can go target shooting
 
02:49:44.469 --> 02:49:44.479 align:start position:0%
I just don't think should I have to park
 
02:49:46.590 --> 02:49:46.600 align:start position:0%
or off you know and if you're talking
 
02:49:48.309 --> 02:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
about some big employer I don't know
 
02:49:50.190 --> 02:49:50.200 align:start position:0%
like GE or some big employer that
 
02:49:52.590 --> 02:49:52.600 align:start position:0%
parking lot can be really huge what what
 
02:49:54.429 --> 02:49:54.439 align:start position:0%
do I what do I do I have to park like
 
02:49:57.269 --> 02:49:57.279 align:start position:0%
off the employer's property and and you
 
02:49:59.670 --> 02:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
know somehow walk in and then maybe I'm
 
02:50:01.030 --> 02:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
parking and maybe there's no place to
 
02:50:03.710 --> 02:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
park in the area or whatever it just it
 
02:50:06.830 --> 02:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
seems to me that on balance here the
 
02:50:08.990 --> 02:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
infringement if you want to call it that
 
02:50:12.349 --> 02:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
on on an employer's property right is
 
02:50:15.590 --> 02:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
pretty minimal
 
02:50:18.830 --> 02:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
um uh compared to the protection of the
 
02:50:21.710 --> 02:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
of the of the right of the person to to
 
02:50:24.870 --> 02:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh to have you know to pursue a law
 
02:50:27.110 --> 02:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
to pursue a lawful ownership and use of
 
02:50:30.110 --> 02:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
firearms so for those reasons I strongly
 
02:50:32.750 --> 02:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
support uh this bill and I hope you'll I
 
02:50:34.750 --> 02:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
hope you'll decide to consider it ought
 
02:50:34.760 --> 02:50:35.510 align:start position:0%
hope you'll decide to consider it ought
to

02:50:35.510 --> 02:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:50:39.550 --> 02:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
pass thank you would you in in your
 
02:50:40.870 --> 02:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
understanding would you consider the
 
02:50:43.349 --> 02:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment of Civil Right ABS oh
 
02:50:45.110 --> 02:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely I think it was a
 
02:50:46.910 --> 02:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
civil right are there any other laws
 
02:50:48.670 --> 02:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
that you're aware of that we allow
 
02:50:50.269 --> 02:50:50.279 align:start position:0%
employers to discriminate against
 
02:50:52.309 --> 02:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
people's civil's
 
02:50:55.429 --> 02:50:55.439 align:start position:0%
rights no you know I I mean the thing I
 
02:50:56.550 --> 02:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
I understand what you're saying the only
 
02:50:59.429 --> 02:50:59.439 align:start position:0%
thing where I raise you know I raise an
 
02:51:01.910 --> 02:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
issue here because I think I I think
 
02:51:03.790 --> 02:51:03.800 align:start position:0%
there is a point here of the property
 
02:51:07.110 --> 02:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
right in other words you know I I I
 
02:51:10.309 --> 02:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
suppose that an employer could have a
 
02:51:13.110 --> 02:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
policy of you know no speaking I mean
 
02:51:15.070 --> 02:51:15.080 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm making an a sort of
 
02:51:17.790 --> 02:51:17.800 align:start position:0%
an an you know a really extreme example
 
02:51:19.590 --> 02:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
but I suppose an employer could have an
 
02:51:23.710 --> 02:51:23.720 align:start position:0%
a policy of no talking on the uh you
 
02:51:26.309 --> 02:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
know on my premises except ex
 
02:51:28.670 --> 02:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
specifically about work you can't talk
 
02:51:30.870 --> 02:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
about anything else now you know I'm I
 
02:51:32.269 --> 02:51:32.279 align:start position:0%
suspect that employer is not going to
 
02:51:34.590 --> 02:51:34.600 align:start position:0%
stay in business for very long but
 
02:51:38.389 --> 02:51:38.399 align:start position:0%
presumably they could um and and I guess
 
02:51:40.830 --> 02:51:40.840 align:start position:0%
it would be a question you know there
 
02:51:42.309 --> 02:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
there that there it might be a little
 
02:51:44.510 --> 02:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
bit different because if if an employ
 
02:51:46.269 --> 02:51:46.279 align:start position:0%
employer had that
 
02:51:49.670 --> 02:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
rule at least that wouldn't prevent
 
02:51:52.030 --> 02:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
infringe on an employees First Amendment
 
02:51:54.429 --> 02:51:54.439 align:start position:0%
rights on their way to work or on their
 
02:51:56.910 --> 02:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
way home uh whereas this this sort of
 
02:52:02.110 --> 02:52:02.120 align:start position:0%
does um but there's you know there I I I
 
02:52:04.510 --> 02:52:04.520 align:start position:0%
guess what would a court say If an
 
02:52:06.510 --> 02:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
employer did have that rule no talking
 
02:52:09.229 --> 02:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
about anything other than you know other
 
02:52:12.070 --> 02:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
than uh uh the employer's business on
 
02:52:14.670 --> 02:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
the employer's property I don't know not
 
02:52:15.950 --> 02:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
sure the court the court has ever had
 
02:52:17.550 --> 02:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
such a case and hopefully there's not an
 
02:52:19.550 --> 02:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
employer that would be kind of foolish
 
02:52:21.790 --> 02:52:21.800 align:start position:0%
enough to adopt such a policy
 
02:52:24.389 --> 02:52:24.399 align:start position:0%
but it it would be a qu I think it would
 
02:52:27.990 --> 02:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
be an open question I guess well to your
 
02:52:31.630 --> 02:52:31.640 align:start position:0%
point a civil right that an employer
 
02:52:33.710 --> 02:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
impacted through their policy that not
 
02:52:35.750 --> 02:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
only impacted the person while they were
 
02:52:38.990 --> 02:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
there but on their way to and from work
 
02:52:41.630 --> 02:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
oh exactly exactly I think that I think
 
02:52:44.510 --> 02:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
that's I think that's exactly right U
 
02:52:44.520 --> 02:52:45.269 align:start position:0%
that's I think that's exactly right U
thank

02:52:45.269 --> 02:52:45.279 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:52:47.670 --> 02:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
you Representative
 
02:52:51.870 --> 02:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
scitec no one this morning has mentioned
 
02:52:54.150 --> 02:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
and I think it's a time that this be
 
02:52:56.830 --> 02:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
this get into play we have passed a
 
02:52:59.110 --> 02:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment guaranteeing
 
02:53:02.030 --> 02:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
privacy in the in New
 
02:53:04.590 --> 02:53:04.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what right does an employer
 
02:53:06.950 --> 02:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
have to say about anything in my
 
02:53:10.229 --> 02:53:10.239 align:start position:0%
personal car brought on premises locked
 
02:53:13.030 --> 02:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
up uh he has no legitimate business
 
02:53:16.309 --> 02:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
interest in anything in my car and
 
02:53:20.349 --> 02:53:20.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't our right under the con the our
 
02:53:23.630 --> 02:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
constitutional right Trump the
 
02:53:28.150 --> 02:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
employer right to uh to the concern in
 
02:53:31.990 --> 02:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
my car anything in my car any more than
 
02:53:34.389 --> 02:53:34.399 align:start position:0%
the employer it's his property but I can
 
02:53:37.590 --> 02:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
use the washroom privately can I not I'm
 
02:53:40.030 --> 02:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
infringing on his right in that
 
02:53:42.429 --> 02:53:42.439 align:start position:0%
case I I want to bring up our
 
02:53:45.670 --> 02:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional right is my part point no
 
02:53:47.429 --> 02:53:47.439 align:start position:0%
no no I I mean I think the I think the
 
02:53:49.870 --> 02:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
Privacy issue is a is a very is a is an
 
02:53:53.150 --> 02:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
important one I mean I guess you know I
 
02:53:54.590 --> 02:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
I I
 
02:53:58.070 --> 02:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
think I this is personally I would kind
 
02:54:00.510 --> 02:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
of dra in in the context of this
 
02:54:04.070 --> 02:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
Firearms thing I would draw the line at
 
02:54:07.550 --> 02:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
at the where this bill does in other
 
02:54:09.429 --> 02:54:09.439 align:start position:0%
words I would I would have a real
 
02:54:11.269 --> 02:54:11.279 align:start position:0%
problem I think I would if if there was
 
02:54:13.790 --> 02:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
a bill that proposed listen if you have
 
02:54:17.070 --> 02:54:17.080 align:start position:0%
a if you can lawfully con carry
 
02:54:20.630 --> 02:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
concealed you can carry concealed into
 
02:54:22.710 --> 02:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
the you know into the employer's
 
02:54:24.950 --> 02:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
business they can't have a policy that
 
02:54:28.269 --> 02:54:28.279 align:start position:0%
says nobody nobody can be carrying
 
02:54:30.950 --> 02:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
concealed in the business inside while
 
02:54:32.750 --> 02:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
they're working I would say no no no
 
02:54:35.910 --> 02:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
that goes too far they've got you know
 
02:54:38.750 --> 02:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
inside the workplace if if you own the
 
02:54:39.950 --> 02:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
business you can say I don't want
 
02:54:41.150 --> 02:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
anybody armed in here even though I
 
02:54:43.510 --> 02:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
might personally if I had a business I
 
02:54:45.110 --> 02:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
would not have that policy i' would say
 
02:54:46.870 --> 02:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
if you can legally own a gun fine you
 
02:54:48.790 --> 02:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
could come on in and carry out the you
 
02:54:50.910 --> 02:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
know do your job but I can certainly see
 
02:54:52.229 --> 02:54:52.239 align:start position:0%
that other people would have a different
 
02:54:55.550 --> 02:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
View and I would I would not I would not
 
02:54:57.990 --> 02:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
go you know I would not support a bill
 
02:54:59.150 --> 02:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
like that because I think that just
 
02:55:01.070 --> 02:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
would be too much of an infringment on
 
02:55:03.750 --> 02:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:06.469 --> 02:55:06.479 align:start position:0%
rights in your opinion the in other
 
02:55:08.790 --> 02:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
words the the Constitutional Amendment
 
02:55:10.429 --> 02:55:10.439 align:start position:0%
representative scitec brought up really
 
02:55:12.269 --> 02:55:12.279 align:start position:0%
is against the government versus an
 
02:55:14.790 --> 02:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
employer but the does the in your
 
02:55:16.429 --> 02:55:16.439 align:start position:0%
opinion does this balance this bill
 
02:55:17.870 --> 02:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
strike a balance between the rights of
 
02:55:19.150 --> 02:55:19.160 align:start position:0%
the employer and the rights of the
 
02:55:21.550 --> 02:55:21.560 align:start position:0%
employee I I I think it does and I you
 
02:55:26.630 --> 02:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
know I uh I I I think it's very limited
 
02:55:28.830 --> 02:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
it's only in the parking lot it's the
 
02:55:31.110 --> 02:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
car's got to be locked the gun can't be
 
02:55:35.469 --> 02:55:35.479 align:start position:0%
visible um I think I I think that the
 
02:55:38.309 --> 02:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
intrusion the intrusion on the
 
02:55:40.910 --> 02:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
employers employer property rights in
 
02:55:42.790 --> 02:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
that circumstance it seems to me is
 
02:55:45.910 --> 02:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
pretty minimal and I think the benefit
 
02:55:47.550 --> 02:55:47.560 align:start position:0%
to the you know person who wants to
 
02:55:49.229 --> 02:55:49.239 align:start position:0%
exercise their second amendment rights
 
02:55:51.790 --> 02:55:51.800 align:start position:0%
is pretty strong and so I would say that
 
02:55:54.429 --> 02:55:54.439 align:start position:0%
you know that does strike a proper
 
02:55:57.469 --> 02:55:57.479 align:start position:0%
balance as we learned in New Hampshire
 
02:55:59.670 --> 02:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
um ly of a firearm isn't necessarily a
 
02:56:02.990 --> 02:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
specific crime it's based on the value
 
02:56:05.429 --> 02:56:05.439 align:start position:0%
would you not see some value in in since
 
02:56:06.870 --> 02:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
if we're going to contemplate this at
 
02:56:08.830 --> 02:56:08.840 align:start position:0%
the same time making the theft of a
 
02:56:12.229 --> 02:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
firearm be a specific crime of its own
 
02:56:14.750 --> 02:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
yeah that might that I think I think
 
02:56:16.990 --> 02:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
under Colonel if if it's a firearm it up
 
02:56:18.870 --> 02:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
it can up the penalty from you know
 
02:56:21.150 --> 02:56:21.160 align:start position:0%
enhancement yeah enhancement but no that
 
02:56:22.510 --> 02:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
might make that might make a lot of
 
02:56:23.630 --> 02:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
sense to do
 
02:56:26.710 --> 02:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
that thank you represent
 
02:56:29.630 --> 02:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
Muse yeah I I did have one scenario I
 
02:56:31.229 --> 02:56:31.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to run by you and just have you
 
02:56:34.590 --> 02:56:34.600 align:start position:0%
comment on it so let's say the business
 
02:56:37.550 --> 02:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
that I operate is a daycare center and
 
02:56:39.309 --> 02:56:39.319 align:start position:0%
let's say the parking lot that my
 
02:56:41.349 --> 02:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
employees Park in is next to the
 
02:56:43.670 --> 02:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
building and next to the building is
 
02:56:45.469 --> 02:56:45.479 align:start position:0%
outdoor equipment that the children in
 
02:56:49.150 --> 02:56:49.160 align:start position:0%
the daycare center play in um given the
 
02:56:50.910 --> 02:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
fact that all of us at one time or
 
02:56:54.030 --> 02:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
another have gotten text messages or
 
02:56:55.670 --> 02:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
found ourselves busy when we're getting
 
02:56:57.349 --> 02:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
in and out of our cars and we come back
 
02:57:01.190 --> 02:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
and we go oh I forgot to lock my car
 
02:57:02.950 --> 02:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
given the nature of a business like that
 
02:57:04.830 --> 02:57:04.840 align:start position:0%
would you think that a business like
 
02:57:08.110 --> 02:57:08.120 align:start position:0%
that would have the ability to should
 
02:57:09.550 --> 02:57:09.560 align:start position:0%
have the ability as a condition of
 
02:57:11.990 --> 02:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
employment to say we don't want you to
 
02:57:14.670 --> 02:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
put firearms in your car when your car
 
02:57:17.389 --> 02:57:17.399 align:start position:0%
is on our property and and I guess on
 
02:57:20.030 --> 02:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
top of that we also have a child
 
02:57:22.190 --> 02:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
negligence law uh in New Hampshire that
 
02:57:24.630 --> 02:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
actually penalizes people if their
 
02:57:27.630 --> 02:57:27.640 align:start position:0%
firearms fall into the hands of uh of
 
02:57:29.309 --> 02:57:29.319 align:start position:0%
children who use them to commit crimes
 
02:57:32.670 --> 02:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
or shoot other people so I'm curious how
 
02:57:35.469 --> 02:57:35.479 align:start position:0%
you react to that yeah I I I'm not sure
 
02:57:37.269 --> 02:57:37.279 align:start position:0%
that that would change my view on it I
 
02:57:40.510 --> 02:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
mean it's you know can
 
02:57:42.510 --> 02:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
the can the
 
02:57:44.830 --> 02:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
employer I would you know can the
 
02:57:47.309 --> 02:57:47.319 align:start position:0%
employer say well listen you can't you
 
02:57:50.710 --> 02:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
know um in in that circumstance of the
 
02:57:52.830 --> 02:57:52.840 align:start position:0%
daycare the employer say to the employee
 
02:57:55.150 --> 02:57:55.160 align:start position:0%
you know don't you can't bring uh you
 
02:57:56.950 --> 02:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
can't you can't pick up your
 
02:58:01.150 --> 02:58:01.160 align:start position:0%
prescription for uh perco set or
 
02:58:03.150 --> 02:58:03.160 align:start position:0%
whatever on your way to work because you
 
02:58:05.389 --> 02:58:05.399 align:start position:0%
can't leave it in the car uh because you
 
02:58:07.630 --> 02:58:07.640 align:start position:0%
know maybe somebody maybe one of the
 
02:58:10.309 --> 02:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
kids will get into the car or you can't
 
02:58:14.510 --> 02:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
have uh you know um I don't know if you
 
02:58:18.429 --> 02:58:18.439 align:start position:0%
if you uh if you break a glass or
 
02:58:20.030 --> 02:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
something in the car you're driving to
 
02:58:21.510 --> 02:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
work with a and somehow you break a
 
02:58:23.550 --> 02:58:23.560 align:start position:0%
glass or there's glass in the car you
 
02:58:26.429 --> 02:58:26.439 align:start position:0%
know you can't come you can't you can't
 
02:58:28.510 --> 02:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
you have to clean it up before you uh
 
02:58:31.150 --> 02:58:31.160 align:start position:0%
come into work because maybe a kid will
 
02:58:32.349 --> 02:58:32.359 align:start position:0%
uh one of the kids from the daycare
 
02:58:35.150 --> 02:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
center will get in and cut themselves I
 
02:58:37.750 --> 02:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
I would tend to say you shouldn't be
 
02:58:40.510 --> 02:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
able to do any of those things and to
 
02:58:40.520 --> 02:58:41.630 align:start position:0%
able to do any of those things and to
sort

02:58:41.630 --> 02:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
sort
 
02:58:45.830 --> 02:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
of single out firearm arms you know I I
 
02:58:49.030 --> 02:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
don't I just I don't I would not think
 
02:58:52.590 --> 02:58:52.600 align:start position:0%
that that would make sense thank
 
02:58:57.590 --> 02:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:08.190 --> 02:59:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:10.190 --> 02:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
joeann good afternoon members of the
 
02:59:12.710 --> 02:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
committee my name is uh Joe Hannon uh I
 
02:59:14.429 --> 02:59:14.439 align:start position:0%
signed in and support of this bill for
 
02:59:15.990 --> 02:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
gun owners of New Hampshire but I'm
 
02:59:19.269 --> 02:59:19.279 align:start position:0%
speaking on my own behalf um right now
 
02:59:20.830 --> 02:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
uh I didn't think I was going to speak
 
02:59:22.150 --> 02:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
but there was a lot of comments that
 
02:59:24.790 --> 02:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
came up about why it's necessary to have
 
02:59:27.990 --> 02:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
this this uh change in law uh I actually
 
02:59:29.790 --> 02:59:29.800 align:start position:0%
worked at a very gun-free facility when
 
02:59:32.070 --> 02:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
I was in residency in North Philadelphia
 
02:59:33.910 --> 02:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
and and uh I could I'd like to say it
 
02:59:36.790 --> 02:59:36.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't the the best let's just say it
 
02:59:37.950 --> 02:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't the safest neighborhood to
 
02:59:41.710 --> 02:59:41.720 align:start position:0%
commute to and from um my now wife then
 
02:59:44.670 --> 02:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
girlfriend uh a few weeks after we met
 
02:59:46.990 --> 02:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
uh she was leaving the hospital got into
 
02:59:48.309 --> 02:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
her car drove home to a different part
 
02:59:50.469 --> 02:59:50.479 align:start position:0%
of Philadelphia was walking to her
 
02:59:52.309 --> 02:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
apartment and was pistol whipped by two
 
02:59:55.229 --> 02:59:55.239 align:start position:0%
armed individuals took her purse luckily
 
02:59:56.630 --> 02:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
that was all that happened she got a few
 
02:59:58.910 --> 02:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
stitches that was our third date
 
03:00:00.349 --> 03:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
watching her get the
 
03:00:03.710 --> 03:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
stitches um she became a very uh strong
 
03:00:05.389 --> 03:00:05.399 align:start position:0%
Enthusiast of second amendment rights
 
03:00:08.750 --> 03:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
after this incident um also uh
 
03:00:11.910 --> 03:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
personally I had several um close calls
 
03:00:14.670 --> 03:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
or scares coming to and going from toing
 
03:00:17.830 --> 03:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
from uh the hospital uh I had been
 
03:00:19.469 --> 03:00:19.479 align:start position:0%
chastised by one nurse because I opened
 
03:00:20.710 --> 03:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
a medicine bottle with a Swiss army
 
03:00:22.830 --> 03:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
knife she told me you couldn't have any
 
03:00:25.469 --> 03:00:25.479 align:start position:0%
weapons in the hospital I was okay I
 
03:00:27.349 --> 03:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
didn't know that uh I couldn't have a
 
03:00:29.150 --> 03:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
knife I was there as a foot and ankle
 
03:00:31.510 --> 03:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
surgery resident I had a fist full of
 
03:00:33.070 --> 03:00:33.080 align:start position:0%
scalples in my jacket pocket that was
 
03:00:34.870 --> 03:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
okay but a pocket knife
 
03:00:37.309 --> 03:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
wasn't anyway I didn't even ask about a
 
03:00:40.670 --> 03:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
gun I just let it go um but uh the
 
03:00:42.389 --> 03:00:42.399 align:start position:0%
parking garage was secured we had to go
 
03:00:43.950 --> 03:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
in and out there was a guard there so
 
03:00:45.870 --> 03:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
even if someone did break in they would
 
03:00:47.349 --> 03:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
probably be able to find them pretty
 
03:00:48.590 --> 03:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
quickly so I wasn't worried about
 
03:00:51.349 --> 03:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
securing a firearm in the parking lot uh
 
03:00:55.229 --> 03:00:55.239 align:start position:0%
however uh most people did not do so uh
 
03:00:57.349 --> 03:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
after uh someone wins the Super Bowl or
 
03:00:59.070 --> 03:00:59.080 align:start position:0%
big basketball game you know some cities
 
03:01:01.229 --> 03:01:01.239 align:start position:0%
have problems occasionally with rioting
 
03:01:03.030 --> 03:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
or celebration not rioting let's just
 
03:01:03.040 --> 03:01:03.870 align:start position:0%
or celebration not rioting let's just
say

03:01:03.870 --> 03:01:03.880 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:01:05.710 --> 03:01:05.720 align:start position:0%
celebration uh after leaving the
 
03:01:07.429 --> 03:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
hospital one night after the 76ers
 
03:01:10.670 --> 03:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
didn't do very well uh my car broke
 
03:01:13.710 --> 03:01:13.720 align:start position:0%
down and there were helicopters fires
 
03:01:15.790 --> 03:01:15.800 align:start position:0%
looked like something out of uh science
 
03:01:18.190 --> 03:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
fiction movie it was pretty crazy uh I'm
 
03:01:20.030 --> 03:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
sitting at a gas station trying to get
 
03:01:21.830 --> 03:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
help the person was ducked below some
 
03:01:24.349 --> 03:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
bulletproof glass wouldn't even take $20
 
03:01:26.830 --> 03:01:26.840 align:start position:0%
for a gallon of gas to help me get keep
 
03:01:29.110 --> 03:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
going uh my then girlfriend now wife
 
03:01:30.870 --> 03:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
dropped off some gas that she got didn't
 
03:01:32.469 --> 03:01:32.479 align:start position:0%
even slow down just threw a gas can at
 
03:01:35.990 --> 03:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
me and took off so um I think that
 
03:01:37.309 --> 03:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
someone and we heard all these other
 
03:01:39.229 --> 03:01:39.239 align:start position:0%
arguments about you know property rights
 
03:01:40.990 --> 03:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
the cars and extension all this other
 
03:01:42.550 --> 03:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
stuff but I think it's important to
 
03:01:44.349 --> 03:01:44.359 align:start position:0%
understand that not everyone lives in
 
03:01:45.870 --> 03:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
and now I live in Lee which is wonderful
 
03:01:47.309 --> 03:01:47.319 align:start position:0%
I don't worry my most people don't even
 
03:01:49.630 --> 03:01:49.640 align:start position:0%
lock their doors or cars I still do I'd
 
03:01:51.070 --> 03:01:51.080 align:start position:0%
lock my door when I check my mailbox
 
03:01:53.269 --> 03:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
because I grew up in that City but uh I
 
03:01:54.550 --> 03:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
think this is very important I think
 
03:01:56.190 --> 03:01:56.200 align:start position:0%
this is something that is not just a
 
03:01:57.790 --> 03:01:57.800 align:start position:0%
rights issue or a privacy issue I think
 
03:02:00.110 --> 03:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
this is a an issue of uh you know
 
03:02:01.910 --> 03:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
allowing someone an individual to
 
03:02:03.630 --> 03:02:03.640 align:start position:0%
protect themselves outside of
 
03:02:06.510 --> 03:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
environment now whether an an an
 
03:02:09.190 --> 03:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
institution can be gunfree or not I
 
03:02:10.710 --> 03:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
think that'll come up in uh some later
 
03:02:12.630 --> 03:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
testimony today but I will just say that
 
03:02:15.309 --> 03:02:15.319 align:start position:0%
this is an absolutely necessary Bill to
 
03:02:16.670 --> 03:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
prevent uh
 
03:02:18.750 --> 03:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
possible dangerous situations from
 
03:02:21.030 --> 03:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
happening to individuals you happy to
 
03:02:23.150 --> 03:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
take any
 
03:02:25.229 --> 03:02:25.239 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
03:02:27.070 --> 03:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
testimony her scar looks pretty good too
 
03:02:29.110 --> 03:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
by the way
 
03:02:31.469 --> 03:02:31.479 align:start position:0%
thanks that's it anyone else wish to
 
03:02:33.950 --> 03:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill was not done so see
 
03:02:35.950 --> 03:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
none I hereby close the public hearing
 
03:02:39.389 --> 03:02:39.399 align:start position:0%
wa what did you turn in a
 
03:02:42.550 --> 03:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
card Oh attorney
 
03:02:42.560 --> 03:02:49.670 align:start position:0%
card Oh attorney
on

03:02:49.670 --> 03:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:51.990 --> 03:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
I swear I'll be very quick it's a turny
 
03:02:54.190 --> 03:02:54.200 align:start position:0%
Andrew do you have a card or you didn't
 
03:02:55.469 --> 03:02:55.479 align:start position:0%
fill out card I didn't fill one out I
 
03:02:58.269 --> 03:02:58.279 align:start position:0%
certainly will okay um there was just a
 
03:03:00.710 --> 03:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
mention of whether or not theft of a
 
03:03:02.710 --> 03:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
firearm is a specific crime in New
 
03:03:04.830 --> 03:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if you do steal a firearm it
 
03:03:07.990 --> 03:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
makes theft a class a felony under RSA
 
03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:09.990 align:start position:0%
makes theft a class a felony under RSA
6371

03:03:09.990 --> 03:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
6371
 
03:03:12.750 --> 03:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
6371 yeah is the penalty section of the
 
03:03:15.429 --> 03:03:15.439 align:start position:0%
theft statute yeah which makes theft of
 
03:03:18.469 --> 03:03:18.479 align:start position:0%
a firearm a class a felony so that' be
 
03:03:20.830 --> 03:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
punishable by 7 and half to 15 years in
 
03:03:24.510 --> 03:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
the state prison so under under the this
 
03:03:26.990 --> 03:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
proposed Bill if someone broke into a
 
03:03:28.990 --> 03:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
car and stole a firearm it would be a
 
03:03:31.349 --> 03:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
class a felony with that penalty
 
03:03:33.830 --> 03:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
possible whether this bill passes or not
 
03:03:35.190 --> 03:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
if you break into a car and steal a
 
03:03:37.750 --> 03:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
firearm it's a class a felony thank you
 
03:03:41.349 --> 03:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions fy's
 
03:03:43.630 --> 03:03:43.640 align:start position:0%
here okay I'll fill out a card for you
 
03:03:47.630 --> 03:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
that's right and now it's really
 
03:03:50.910 --> 03:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
Clos with that I open the public hearing
 
03:03:53.070 --> 03:03:53.080 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
03:03:55.830 --> 03:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
1337 and invite the prime sponsor Mr
 
03:03:57.590 --> 03:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
chair I got to go get the sponsor okay
 
03:03:58.710 --> 03:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
yeah we're going to take uh we're going
 
03:04:12.389 --> 03:04:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:12.399 --> 03:20:11.389 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

03:20:11.389 --> 03:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:14.070 --> 03:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
if Dam opening the public hearing on
 
03:20:17.510 --> 03:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1337 I invite the prime
 
03:20:22.110 --> 03:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:24.389 --> 03:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chair members of the
 
03:20:26.110 --> 03:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
03:20:28.030 --> 03:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
Tom Manny representing Hillsboro one the
 
03:20:30.309 --> 03:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
town of pelum uh this bill is a result
 
03:20:32.389 --> 03:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
of a constituent request uh when they
 
03:20:34.070 --> 03:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
explained it to me what the process is
 
03:20:36.150 --> 03:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
for having your property returned uh to
 
03:20:37.750 --> 03:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
you upon the expiration of a protective
 
03:20:39.910 --> 03:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
order I had to reread the RSA several
 
03:20:42.510 --> 03:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
times to confirm yes in fact we have a
 
03:20:43.790 --> 03:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
law in the books that requires a
 
03:20:45.429 --> 03:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
defendant to prove their innocence
 
03:20:47.590 --> 03:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
before the court this is a complete
 
03:20:49.309 --> 03:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
inversion of due process flying in the
 
03:20:50.710 --> 03:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
face of the foundational system that
 
03:20:52.830 --> 03:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
innocent until proven guilty so this
 
03:20:54.670 --> 03:20:54.680 align:start position:0%
bill attempts to rectify this by
 
03:20:56.710 --> 03:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
inverting the responsibility uh to call
 
03:20:58.590 --> 03:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
a hearing before the court onto the
 
03:21:00.630 --> 03:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
plaintiff and uh should no hearing be
 
03:21:02.070 --> 03:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
called the defendant can retrieve their
 
03:21:03.550 --> 03:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
property without the Injustice of
 
03:21:06.229 --> 03:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
pleading before a court to do so uh a
 
03:21:07.630 --> 03:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
second Granite stat are also brought to
 
03:21:08.990 --> 03:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
my attention a situation where the
 
03:21:11.189 --> 03:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
storage fees they incurred uh from
 
03:21:12.910 --> 03:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
having their property held amounted to
 
03:21:14.469 --> 03:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
more than the value of the item I
 
03:21:16.189 --> 03:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
haven't followed up with that individual
 
03:21:18.429 --> 03:21:18.439 align:start position:0%
but that is it's an anecdotal experience
 
03:21:20.590 --> 03:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
so I did uh I had an assistant call
 
03:21:22.670 --> 03:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
around to various police St uh stations
 
03:21:25.030 --> 03:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
around the state including uh one from
 
03:21:26.429 --> 03:21:26.439 align:start position:0%
this specific situation and they all
 
03:21:28.150 --> 03:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
claimed they do not charge storage fees
 
03:21:30.070 --> 03:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
for property seeds from a protective
 
03:21:32.110 --> 03:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
order uh so there's a contradiction
 
03:21:33.790 --> 03:21:33.800 align:start position:0%
between those statements the anecdotal
 
03:21:35.269 --> 03:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
experience I was told and the fiscal
 
03:21:38.150 --> 03:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
note attached um uh since the phone
 
03:21:39.550 --> 03:21:39.560 align:start position:0%
calls lead me to believe that these
 
03:21:41.309 --> 03:21:41.319 align:start position:0%
stations aren't charging storage feeds
 
03:21:43.229 --> 03:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
at all I see no reason to give such
 
03:21:45.950 --> 03:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
leeway as a reasonable fee that may be
 
03:21:48.110 --> 03:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh inconsistently or maybe maliciously
 
03:21:50.830 --> 03:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
determined on a case-by Case basis um
 
03:21:52.429 --> 03:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
now if the methodology of this bill
 
03:21:53.670 --> 03:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
could be better served through some
 
03:21:55.030 --> 03:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
other design I'm happy to work with the
 
03:21:56.710 --> 03:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
committee on Amendment but I believe
 
03:21:57.790 --> 03:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
it's plain to see that there's an
 
03:21:59.590 --> 03:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
inversion of due process on the books
 
03:22:01.229 --> 03:22:01.239 align:start position:0%
that needs to be remedied uh same for
 
03:22:03.269 --> 03:22:03.279 align:start position:0%
the storage fees perhaps a hard cap
 
03:22:05.550 --> 03:22:05.560 align:start position:0%
would also suffice in that or in in in
 
03:22:07.429 --> 03:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
that realm uh regardless I ask the
 
03:22:10.750 --> 03:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
committee to vote OTP on HB 1337 thank
 
03:22:13.389 --> 03:22:13.399 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh representative did you
 
03:22:15.469 --> 03:22:15.479 align:start position:0%
just say you had an assistant call I was
 
03:22:17.590 --> 03:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
I was wondering how you got an assistant
 
03:22:20.110 --> 03:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
I must have missed that no I didn't get
 
03:22:22.550 --> 03:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
one in it's like an intern okay all
 
03:22:26.110 --> 03:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
right uh that's true um thank you any
 
03:22:28.510 --> 03:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
questions uh no no questions thank you
 
03:22:32.710 --> 03:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
for sweet thank you um
 
03:22:35.550 --> 03:22:35.560 align:start position:0%
I did you
 
03:22:40.750 --> 03:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
there the chair calls uh Dr Leonard
 
03:22:40.760 --> 03:22:47.790 align:start position:0%
there the chair calls uh Dr Leonard
Korn

03:22:47.790 --> 03:22:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:51.910 --> 03:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you you again all for uh hearing
 
03:22:51.920 --> 03:22:52.950 align:start position:0%
thank you you again all for uh hearing
my

03:22:52.950 --> 03:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
my
 
03:22:56.229 --> 03:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
testimony so this bill has to do with
 
03:22:59.070 --> 03:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
protective orders and protective orders
 
03:23:02.670 --> 03:23:02.680 align:start position:0%
are difficult to obtain and they are
 
03:23:02.680 --> 03:23:04.269 align:start position:0%
are difficult to obtain and they are
obtained

03:23:04.269 --> 03:23:04.279 align:start position:0%
obtained
 
03:23:06.550 --> 03:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
when uh an
 
03:23:06.560 --> 03:23:08.269 align:start position:0%
when uh an
individual

03:23:08.269 --> 03:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
individual
 
03:23:13.790 --> 03:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
is felt to be a danger to another person
 
03:23:17.309 --> 03:23:17.319 align:start position:0%
usually a partner or a spouse this is
 
03:23:19.469 --> 03:23:19.479 align:start position:0%
usually an abuse
 
03:23:23.349 --> 03:23:23.359 align:start position:0%
situation and the protective orders last
 
03:23:25.990 --> 03:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
for a certain interval of
 
03:23:30.910 --> 03:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
time statute right now requires
 
03:23:30.920 --> 03:23:32.590 align:start position:0%
time statute right now requires
the

03:23:32.590 --> 03:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:23:37.510 --> 03:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
defendant or abuser to go to court and
 
03:23:43.870 --> 03:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
get their rights to have guns ammunition
 
03:23:47.349 --> 03:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
and other deadly items back in their
 
03:23:52.590 --> 03:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
possession it's the burden of the abuser
 
03:23:57.189 --> 03:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
to go to court for that to take effect
 
03:23:59.910 --> 03:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
this bill in front of us changes the
 
03:24:04.670 --> 03:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
burden to the abused and the abused
 
03:24:10.070 --> 03:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
person has to object
 
03:24:12.469 --> 03:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
to the
 
03:24:20.309 --> 03:24:20.319 align:start position:0%
hearing and uh create the uh
 
03:24:22.630 --> 03:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
necessary uh
 
03:24:28.670 --> 03:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
Court situation so that the formerly
 
03:24:32.229 --> 03:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
abusing person doesn't get their guns
 
03:24:37.030 --> 03:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
back I think it behooves the state to
 
03:24:43.070 --> 03:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
keep the situation as it is rather than
 
03:24:48.870 --> 03:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh present the abused person the burden
 
03:24:48.880 --> 03:24:49.670 align:start position:0%
uh present the abused person the burden
to

03:24:49.670 --> 03:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:24:49.680 --> 03:24:51.269 align:start position:0%
to
prove

03:24:51.269 --> 03:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
prove
 
03:24:57.070 --> 03:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
that the their abuser is uh safe to get
 
03:25:00.030 --> 03:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
their guns that's about all I would have
 
03:25:00.040 --> 03:25:02.750 align:start position:0%
their guns that's about all I would have
to

03:25:02.750 --> 03:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:06.070 --> 03:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
say thank you for your
 
03:25:10.469 --> 03:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
testimony chair calls attorney peny
 
03:25:10.479 --> 03:25:25.269 align:start position:0%
testimony chair calls attorney peny
Dean

03:25:25.269 --> 03:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:26.830 --> 03:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the
 
03:25:30.150 --> 03:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
committee I strongly support this bill
 
03:25:32.229 --> 03:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
and I think it's highly necessary for
 
03:25:32.239 --> 03:25:33.510 align:start position:0%
and I think it's highly necessary for
many

03:25:33.510 --> 03:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
many
 
03:25:37.910 --> 03:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
reasons the last statistics I've seen if
 
03:25:40.510 --> 03:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
I recall them correctly were that about
 
03:25:43.429 --> 03:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
75% of protective orders were ultimately
 
03:25:45.830 --> 03:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
granted if I've read and and that's two
 
03:25:48.389 --> 03:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
years behind the way I read um the
 
03:25:50.309 --> 03:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
statistics that are put out by the state
 
03:25:52.510 --> 03:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so that's going two
 
03:25:54.309 --> 03:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
years back I have not seen because there
 
03:25:56.910 --> 03:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
usually is a delay in reporting the last
 
03:25:56.920 --> 03:25:58.750 align:start position:0%
usually is a delay in reporting the last
couple

03:25:58.750 --> 03:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
couple
 
03:26:02.070 --> 03:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
years I consider that pretty darn easy
 
03:26:04.910 --> 03:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
to obtain the other thing the only thing
 
03:26:07.950 --> 03:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
I think is easier is than dating a ham
 
03:26:10.670 --> 03:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
sandwich and those of us who have
 
03:26:13.110 --> 03:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
defended against these protective
 
03:26:18.189 --> 03:26:18.199 align:start position:0%
orders most people are shocked when they
 
03:26:19.670 --> 03:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
know that they went to court and what
 
03:26:21.710 --> 03:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
they thought was a simple hearing and it
 
03:26:24.229 --> 03:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
took their gun rights for a year and
 
03:26:25.670 --> 03:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
they call and they'll say to me well can
 
03:26:28.269 --> 03:26:28.279 align:start position:0%
we appeal this then and I go yes we can
 
03:26:30.550 --> 03:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
appeal it but we Appeal on issues of law
 
03:26:33.030 --> 03:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
not issues of fact and the chance of
 
03:26:35.269 --> 03:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
winning that is pretty slim you're going
 
03:26:36.950 --> 03:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
to pay me a whole lot of money and get a
 
03:26:38.349 --> 03:26:38.359 align:start position:0%
whole lot of
 
03:26:40.910 --> 03:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
nothing so if they happen to come to me
 
03:26:43.910 --> 03:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
before the hearing there's a chance but
 
03:26:45.630 --> 03:26:45.640 align:start position:0%
here's what you have to understand these
 
03:26:48.910 --> 03:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
people generally women who fill out 4 to
 
03:26:52.830 --> 03:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
eight pages of allegations and I say to
 
03:26:54.790 --> 03:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
them in order to effectively defend you
 
03:26:57.870 --> 03:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
CU any one of these single allegations
 
03:27:00.830 --> 03:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
will win her this protective order and
 
03:27:02.830 --> 03:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
here's what you have to understand why a
 
03:27:04.590 --> 03:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
lot of these women go get the protective
 
03:27:06.469 --> 03:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
order while the protective orders in
 
03:27:09.309 --> 03:27:09.319 align:start position:0%
place let me explain to you what happens
 
03:27:12.110 --> 03:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
I have one most recently man owned the
 
03:27:15.830 --> 03:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
house guess what he's out of his house
 
03:27:17.750 --> 03:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
because that's what she has been allowed
 
03:27:21.429 --> 03:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
to have and he cannot change anything so
 
03:27:23.429 --> 03:27:23.439 align:start position:0%
we had to ask for a longer hearing
 
03:27:26.110 --> 03:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
because if you've got pages and pages of
 
03:27:28.229 --> 03:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
allegations you're going to have to ask
 
03:27:30.309 --> 03:27:30.319 align:start position:0%
for sometimes two three I've had
 
03:27:32.870 --> 03:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
multi-day hearings you may have to wait
 
03:27:35.710 --> 03:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
up for a year for a hearing date while
 
03:27:37.990 --> 03:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
you do for a hearing date that temporary
 
03:27:40.510 --> 03:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
order stays in place which means he's
 
03:27:42.110 --> 03:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
still paying a house payment of a house
 
03:27:44.389 --> 03:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
he can't stay in he's still paying the
 
03:27:46.950 --> 03:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
lights the phone I can go down the whole
 
03:27:49.950 --> 03:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
list lights phone cable he says wait a
 
03:27:51.269 --> 03:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
minute why do I have to pay the lights
 
03:27:52.870 --> 03:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
phone and cable for a house I'm not
 
03:27:55.950 --> 03:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
living in when I'm going to throw the
 
03:27:57.590 --> 03:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
broad out if you will because we're
 
03:27:59.150 --> 03:27:59.160 align:start position:0%
getting divorced or we're getting
 
03:28:00.950 --> 03:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
separated or we're not having a
 
03:28:02.870 --> 03:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
relationship anymore and my answer is
 
03:28:05.189 --> 03:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
cuz there's a protective order in place
 
03:28:07.870 --> 03:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
now and so she can do what she does
 
03:28:09.469 --> 03:28:09.479 align:start position:0%
which is turn the heat up to 80 and
 
03:28:10.790 --> 03:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
leave the windows open and you have to
 
03:28:12.750 --> 03:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
pay the Heat every month cuz if not
 
03:28:14.030 --> 03:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
guess what you're in
 
03:28:16.590 --> 03:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
contempt you can't change anything you
 
03:28:19.309 --> 03:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
have to pay her phone bill every bill
 
03:28:21.710 --> 03:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
that's being paid up at that point you
 
03:28:23.510 --> 03:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
have to continue to
 
03:28:26.229 --> 03:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
pay and you say where is the Justice in
 
03:28:29.150 --> 03:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
that my answer is there isn't any but
 
03:28:31.550 --> 03:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is the only reason this
 
03:28:35.229 --> 03:28:35.239 align:start position:0%
75% statistic isn't higher in my opinion
 
03:28:37.950 --> 03:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
and I do not know I don't remember from
 
03:28:40.469 --> 03:28:40.479 align:start position:0%
the sheet is because a lot of these
 
03:28:43.349 --> 03:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
individuals the complaining if you will
 
03:28:45.550 --> 03:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
don't show up for the hearing and then
 
03:28:48.389 --> 03:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
it's automatically dismissed and I do
 
03:28:49.950 --> 03:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
not there's a percentage out there I've
 
03:28:51.630 --> 03:28:51.640 align:start position:0%
seen the number I just can't remember it
 
03:28:52.670 --> 03:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
to tell
 
03:28:55.389 --> 03:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
you so this number would even be higher
 
03:28:57.269 --> 03:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
so anyone that says these are difficult
 
03:29:00.229 --> 03:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
to obtain has never been in my shoes for
 
03:29:03.469 --> 03:29:03.479 align:start position:0%
my clients but I think what's even worse
 
03:29:06.349 --> 03:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
is as a practical matter I've seen some
 
03:29:08.990 --> 03:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
Department say now prove them your guns
 
03:29:10.710 --> 03:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
and you're like but I turned them over
 
03:29:13.429 --> 03:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
and you seized them you got them from me
 
03:29:15.510 --> 03:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
I have a receipt here yeah we know but
 
03:29:17.150 --> 03:29:17.160 align:start position:0%
we we need some receipts to show their
 
03:29:19.429 --> 03:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
your guns or we're not giving them
 
03:29:22.670 --> 03:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
back and even then once you get a court
 
03:29:24.670 --> 03:29:24.680 align:start position:0%
order which can take weeks and weeks and
 
03:29:27.150 --> 03:29:27.160 align:start position:0%
months and months you then have to make
 
03:29:28.750 --> 03:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
an appointment with the evidence
 
03:29:31.349 --> 03:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
technician or The Evidence Officer and
 
03:29:33.990 --> 03:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
The Evidence Officer he only works from
 
03:29:36.389 --> 03:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
2: to 4: on Tuesdays and Thursdays and
 
03:29:37.870 --> 03:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
the particular time you make an
 
03:29:39.590 --> 03:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
appointment with him yeah they're
 
03:29:40.910 --> 03:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
short-handed at the department he went
 
03:29:42.510 --> 03:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
out on a call come back well I took the
 
03:29:45.030 --> 03:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
day off work today yeah I know but he he
 
03:29:47.469 --> 03:29:47.479 align:start position:0%
had to go out on a call so we're coming
 
03:29:49.790 --> 03:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
back and so getting these Firearms
 
03:29:52.070 --> 03:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
backers not as simple and easy as they
 
03:29:55.150 --> 03:29:55.160 align:start position:0%
would make you think it is so putting
 
03:29:58.110 --> 03:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
and what's even more important here this
 
03:29:59.830 --> 03:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
person has not been convicted in a
 
03:30:02.910 --> 03:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
domestic violence sense this person has
 
03:30:05.070 --> 03:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
made the preponderance of the evidence
 
03:30:08.150 --> 03:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
standard which means just as we say 51%
 
03:30:10.429 --> 03:30:10.439 align:start position:0%
the scale tipped more that the judge
 
03:30:10.439 --> 03:30:11.630 align:start position:0%
the scale tipped more that the judge
believed

03:30:11.630 --> 03:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
believed
 
03:30:11.640 --> 03:30:12.670 align:start position:0%
believed
the

03:30:12.670 --> 03:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:30:15.110 --> 03:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
complainant there's no evidence in these
 
03:30:16.990 --> 03:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
cases that the person's been convicted
 
03:30:17.000 --> 03:30:18.150 align:start position:0%
cases that the person's been convicted
of

03:30:18.150 --> 03:30:18.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:30:20.389 --> 03:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
anything because if he were convicted he
 
03:30:22.510 --> 03:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be allowed to get his Firearms
 
03:30:25.309 --> 03:30:25.319 align:start position:0%
back so making it more difficult and
 
03:30:27.070 --> 03:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
more expensive for these people to get
 
03:30:28.710 --> 03:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
their firearms back when they're not
 
03:30:31.349 --> 03:30:31.359 align:start position:0%
under any restriction at the end of a
 
03:30:32.950 --> 03:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
domestic violence protection order to
 
03:30:35.670 --> 03:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
get their firearms back is unfair it'd
 
03:30:37.229 --> 03:30:37.239 align:start position:0%
be like before letting someone out of
 
03:30:39.150 --> 03:30:39.160 align:start position:0%
jail after they serve their time jump
 
03:30:40.590 --> 03:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
through some other Hoops or do some
 
03:30:42.990 --> 03:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
other things we don't do that to people
 
03:30:44.830 --> 03:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
once you've went through the process
 
03:30:46.389 --> 03:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
you're now a free person you're to be
 
03:30:49.269 --> 03:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
treated like a free person but the other
 
03:30:52.910 --> 03:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
thing that you talk about is um the
 
03:30:55.950 --> 03:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
storage fees and more importantly the
 
03:30:58.229 --> 03:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
obligation to store these things nicely
 
03:31:00.550 --> 03:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
I've had guys with a brand new Sig funny
 
03:31:02.510 --> 03:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
thing went in there came out the front
 
03:31:04.510 --> 03:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
sight's all gone and damaged and messed
 
03:31:07.269 --> 03:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
up now do you believe that just happened
 
03:31:09.950 --> 03:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
accidentally or whatever sigs are pretty
 
03:31:09.960 --> 03:31:11.510 align:start position:0%
accidentally or whatever sigs are pretty
rugged

03:31:11.510 --> 03:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
rugged
 
03:31:14.910 --> 03:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
you see abuse and damage to firearms
 
03:31:17.389 --> 03:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
that are sometimes darn near Priceless
 
03:31:19.030 --> 03:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing you can do about it
 
03:31:21.429 --> 03:31:21.439 align:start position:0%
so I
 
03:31:24.110 --> 03:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
think every part of this bill makes
 
03:31:26.870 --> 03:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
common sense and it begins to level a
 
03:31:28.670 --> 03:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
playing field which quite frankly I
 
03:31:32.790 --> 03:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
think is unfair because what happens is
 
03:31:34.630 --> 03:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
the women who generally apply for these
 
03:31:36.110 --> 03:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
we've got all sorts of state and
 
03:31:38.590 --> 03:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
volunteer helpers who help them fill out
 
03:31:41.229 --> 03:31:41.239 align:start position:0%
the forms who come support them in cour
 
03:31:43.070 --> 03:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
court and
 
03:31:45.750 --> 03:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
yet the person who's accused has got to
 
03:31:48.070 --> 03:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
go hire a private attorney usually in
 
03:31:50.309 --> 03:31:50.319 align:start position:0%
very short notice and sometimes to
 
03:31:52.790 --> 03:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
defend against pages and pages of
 
03:31:55.429 --> 03:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
allegations that are quite frankly a lot
 
03:31:56.950 --> 03:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
of times very difficult to defend
 
03:31:59.030 --> 03:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
against because they're allegations of
 
03:32:01.910 --> 03:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
he said she said so I'm happy to answer
 
03:32:04.110 --> 03:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
practical questions but this begins to
 
03:32:07.469 --> 03:32:07.479 align:start position:0%
make it more fair and more Equitable and
 
03:32:10.070 --> 03:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
quite frankly save these people from
 
03:32:12.590 --> 03:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
grief and getting Firearms
 
03:32:16.950 --> 03:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
back thank you if you could um walk walk
 
03:32:19.870 --> 03:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
me through the process so I have an
 
03:32:22.870 --> 03:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
order against me I turn in my firearms
 
03:32:25.630 --> 03:32:25.640 align:start position:0%
as I should yep the order expires it's
 
03:32:28.150 --> 03:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
not renewed how do I go about getting my
 
03:32:30.269 --> 03:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
firearms back right now you make a
 
03:32:32.269 --> 03:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
motion to the court where the domestic
 
03:32:34.870 --> 03:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
violence order was pending and ask for a
 
03:32:36.910 --> 03:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
motion for return of firearms they're
 
03:32:38.189 --> 03:32:38.199 align:start position:0%
going to have a they're going to set up
 
03:32:40.870 --> 03:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
a hearing now there's no statutory
 
03:32:42.429 --> 03:32:42.439 align:start position:0%
mandated date when they're going to set
 
03:32:44.750 --> 03:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
a hearing so it can be week or weeks or
 
03:32:46.630 --> 03:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
months from the time you
 
03:32:49.469 --> 03:32:49.479 align:start position:0%
ask when they go to the hearing what is
 
03:32:51.070 --> 03:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to have happened or what the
 
03:32:53.510 --> 03:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
court wants to happen and it's one of
 
03:32:55.910 --> 03:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
the many things that I disagree with but
 
03:32:58.790 --> 03:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's the way it is is that when you go
 
03:33:00.750 --> 03:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
to that hearing um and they're going to
 
03:33:03.269 --> 03:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
notify the complainant the party whose
 
03:33:06.790 --> 03:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
DVP is against and that person sometimes
 
03:33:10.309 --> 03:33:10.319 align:start position:0%
come and says they object well I don't
 
03:33:11.750 --> 03:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
even think they should be a party to
 
03:33:13.469 --> 03:33:13.479 align:start position:0%
this I think it's wrong because whether
 
03:33:15.790 --> 03:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
they object is whoopity ditya they got
 
03:33:18.830 --> 03:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
no legal basis to object because the
 
03:33:21.510 --> 03:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
order's over so you go there now it
 
03:33:23.110 --> 03:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
depends on the particular Police
 
03:33:24.710 --> 03:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
Department that's holding the Firearms
 
03:33:26.910 --> 03:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
they may may or may not show up but let
 
03:33:28.830 --> 03:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
me tell you the worst thing that happens
 
03:33:30.510 --> 03:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
and it happens all too
 
03:33:33.550 --> 03:33:33.560 align:start position:0%
frequently judges want a clean check
 
03:33:35.590 --> 03:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
from the gun line before they'll give
 
03:33:38.830 --> 03:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
the Firearms back even though there's no
 
03:33:40.870 --> 03:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
evidence before the court that the the
 
03:33:43.309 --> 03:33:43.319 align:start position:0%
person is prohibited from Firearms so
 
03:33:44.990 --> 03:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
more than once you go to court you pay
 
03:33:46.910 --> 03:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
your lawyer to go to court we all go to
 
03:33:49.790 --> 03:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
court and the judge says where's the gun
 
03:33:51.110 --> 03:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
line check oh it's not back yet your
 
03:33:53.830 --> 03:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
honor reschedule this court hearing and
 
03:33:57.469 --> 03:33:57.479 align:start position:0%
you're like what so what I try to do if
 
03:33:59.870 --> 03:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's if it's some case I'm handling a c
 
03:34:01.630 --> 03:34:01.640 align:start position:0%
Court Clerk and I say hey is the gun
 
03:34:04.110 --> 03:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
line check back yet because if it isn't
 
03:34:05.790 --> 03:34:05.800 align:start position:0%
I try to continue the matter so the
 
03:34:07.309 --> 03:34:07.319 align:start position:0%
client doesn't have to pay me to go to
 
03:34:09.070 --> 03:34:09.080 align:start position:0%
court I sit there and wait for our
 
03:34:11.710 --> 03:34:11.720 align:start position:0%
hearing right we go up only to find the
 
03:34:15.550 --> 03:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
gun line check isn't back yet and so the
 
03:34:17.389 --> 03:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
gunline check and when I said the gun
 
03:34:19.229 --> 03:34:19.239 align:start position:0%
line check they're not doing a gunline
 
03:34:20.510 --> 03:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
check cuz that's illegal they're
 
03:34:23.269 --> 03:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
actually running a triple ey check but
 
03:34:25.910 --> 03:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
the gun line what does it if you will
 
03:34:28.189 --> 03:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
they're people that handle it last time
 
03:34:28.199 --> 03:34:28.990 align:start position:0%
they're people that handle it last time
I

03:34:28.990 --> 03:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:34:31.790 --> 03:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
checked and so what happens
 
03:34:34.830 --> 03:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
is that if that check isn't back again
 
03:34:36.309 --> 03:34:36.319 align:start position:0%
and again and again if whoever's
 
03:34:38.229 --> 03:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
involved even though it should be able
 
03:34:39.910 --> 03:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
to be done it's just like a spots check
 
03:34:41.630 --> 03:34:41.640 align:start position:0%
behind side the road a trooper can do
 
03:34:43.830 --> 03:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
that in 2 seconds there's no reason it's
 
03:34:45.710 --> 03:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
not instant not done it's because some
 
03:34:48.510 --> 03:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
sort of Staff communication are busy it
 
03:34:50.030 --> 03:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
can be weeks and weeks and months and
 
03:34:52.150 --> 03:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
months so then you go to court and then
 
03:34:54.269 --> 03:34:54.279 align:start position:0%
you get it presumably an order that says
 
03:34:57.349 --> 03:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
you get your guns back and so and this
 
03:34:59.150 --> 03:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
is to tell you how difficult some police
 
03:35:01.269 --> 03:35:01.279 align:start position:0%
departments even make it so their
 
03:35:03.550 --> 03:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
officer was in court physically when
 
03:35:05.990 --> 03:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
this happened when the judge said give
 
03:35:08.110 --> 03:35:08.120 align:start position:0%
him his guns back right gives you the
 
03:35:10.710 --> 03:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
order so I tell the client listen you're
 
03:35:12.710 --> 03:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
going to have to go make an appointment
 
03:35:14.870 --> 03:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
with their evidence person to get your
 
03:35:17.229 --> 03:35:17.239 align:start position:0%
Firearms back but here's what we started
 
03:35:19.030 --> 03:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
doing because some police departments
 
03:35:20.309 --> 03:35:20.319 align:start position:0%
this is just tell you how difficult they
 
03:35:22.070 --> 03:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
make it the client goes there they said
 
03:35:23.870 --> 03:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
well where's your order and he's like
 
03:35:26.030 --> 03:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
well you're in court right beside me
 
03:35:28.189 --> 03:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
when they said it oh no we have to have
 
03:35:29.830 --> 03:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
a copy of the court order so the client
 
03:35:31.150 --> 03:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
goes and gives them a copy of the court
 
03:35:33.229 --> 03:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
order oh no we have to have a certified
 
03:35:36.590 --> 03:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
copy of the court order and we're like
 
03:35:39.110 --> 03:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
but you were sitting right there when it
 
03:35:41.630 --> 03:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
happened so I can understand maybe a
 
03:35:43.630 --> 03:35:43.640 align:start position:0%
department where they don't go to court
 
03:35:45.950 --> 03:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
I see no need for that record so to me
 
03:35:48.630 --> 03:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
as a matter of practice I just tell the
 
03:35:49.910 --> 03:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
client look when we leave we get
 
03:35:52.309 --> 03:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
certified records because some of them
 
03:35:53.870 --> 03:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
played this game so you're just going to
 
03:35:55.830 --> 03:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
say oh good I've got a certified record
 
03:35:59.309 --> 03:35:59.319 align:start position:0%
right here but even then sometimes even
 
03:36:01.710 --> 03:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
physically getting a hold of The
 
03:36:04.870 --> 03:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
Evidence Officer to make the appointment
 
03:36:07.510 --> 03:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
can take a client weeks literally weeks
 
03:36:09.429 --> 03:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
and there have been departments I've had
 
03:36:12.630 --> 03:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
to call and say hey can I speak to this
 
03:36:13.950 --> 03:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
person and make an appointment for my
 
03:36:15.710 --> 03:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
client because it's taken an awful long
 
03:36:18.269 --> 03:36:18.279 align:start position:0%
time so you're talking from the time
 
03:36:22.429 --> 03:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
this dvpn till you get your guns back
 
03:36:24.349 --> 03:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
can be 6 months or more I'm not saying
 
03:36:26.150 --> 03:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
there isn't wonderful occasions I've had
 
03:36:28.309 --> 03:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
wonderful occasions where a wonderful
 
03:36:30.070 --> 03:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
Department's there and says hey come B
 
03:36:32.590 --> 03:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
you later and get your guns those are
 
03:36:36.110 --> 03:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
rare rare rare exceptions so meanwhile
 
03:36:37.510 --> 03:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
you've been without your guns you now
 
03:36:39.910 --> 03:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
get them back but it's months and months
 
03:36:41.550 --> 03:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
and months and weeks and weeks and weeks
 
03:36:43.590 --> 03:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
before you actually physically retrieve
 
03:36:45.950 --> 03:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
them your guns and your ammo and I've
 
03:36:47.830 --> 03:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
had officers say to my clients well
 
03:36:49.229 --> 03:36:49.239 align:start position:0%
you're not prohibited from buying guns
 
03:36:51.950 --> 03:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
now just go buy another gun well if you
 
03:36:54.070 --> 03:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
got lots of money you can do that but
 
03:36:55.990 --> 03:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
not everybody has lots of
 
03:37:00.389 --> 03:37:00.399 align:start position:0%
money so it's it's an uous process and
 
03:37:02.790 --> 03:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
this the other thing is clients are
 
03:37:04.590 --> 03:37:04.600 align:start position:0%
shocked if they didn't have a lawyer
 
03:37:06.309 --> 03:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
that they have to file a motion to get
 
03:37:08.990 --> 03:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
their guns back yeah I mean they're like
 
03:37:11.070 --> 03:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
you got to be kidding I have seat here
 
03:37:12.870 --> 03:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
they took them you know I I voluntarily
 
03:37:15.550 --> 03:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
gave them up why do I have to file a
 
03:37:18.429 --> 03:37:18.439 align:start position:0%
motion to get my guns back and I tell
 
03:37:19.870 --> 03:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
them if you don't file this motion
 
03:37:21.070 --> 03:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be getting your guns
 
03:37:22.950 --> 03:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
back there's no Police Department that I
 
03:37:24.990 --> 03:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
know without a court order that'll give
 
03:37:25.000 --> 03:37:26.950 align:start position:0%
know without a court order that'll give
them

03:37:26.950 --> 03:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:37:31.110 --> 03:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
back what if you know is the average
 
03:37:32.990 --> 03:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
what would you charge a client to handle
 
03:37:35.710 --> 03:37:35.720 align:start position:0%
a a the just the guns are giving back
 
03:37:37.590 --> 03:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
case cuz that sounds like it's a totally
 
03:37:39.269 --> 03:37:39.279 align:start position:0%
different case than the it's a totally
 
03:37:42.429 --> 03:37:42.439 align:start position:0%
separate case thousand and here's why I
 
03:37:43.910 --> 03:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
first have to fill out the motion which
 
03:37:47.550 --> 03:37:47.560 align:start position:0%
is 60 bucks 80 bucks right but I have to
 
03:37:50.150 --> 03:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
dve I charge as most many lawyers do
 
03:37:52.110 --> 03:37:52.120 align:start position:0%
what's I call portal to Portal from the
 
03:37:53.830 --> 03:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
time I leave my office till the time I
 
03:37:57.189 --> 03:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
get back is the time I charge so we have
 
03:37:58.710 --> 03:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
to go set in court they're going to give
 
03:38:01.229 --> 03:38:01.239 align:start position:0%
us a court date if we're lucky we're in
 
03:38:03.750 --> 03:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
and out in a half hour if there's been a
 
03:38:05.630 --> 03:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
cur fluffle at the court if something
 
03:38:07.830 --> 03:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
else happens which courts are busy we
 
03:38:09.349 --> 03:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
could sit there for 2 hours waiting to
 
03:38:11.870 --> 03:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
be heard so paying for me to sit there
 
03:38:13.910 --> 03:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
for those two hours which I'm not happy
 
03:38:15.950 --> 03:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
about but I'm you know I mean they're
 
03:38:19.469 --> 03:38:19.479 align:start position:0%
paying that's $300 an hour and 55 cents
 
03:38:22.189 --> 03:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
a mile for my travel time and then when
 
03:38:25.189 --> 03:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
we leave of course it's I don't know 10
 
03:38:28.269 --> 03:38:28.279 align:start position:0%
bucks 5 to 10 bucks for a certified copy
 
03:38:31.510 --> 03:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
but then if I have to continue to call
 
03:38:33.349 --> 03:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
um the police department for them
 
03:38:35.630 --> 03:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
because sometimes it doesn't work and
 
03:38:38.710 --> 03:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes you have to I quite frankly be
 
03:38:40.150 --> 03:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
extra nice to him cuz I want him to give
 
03:38:42.510 --> 03:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
my client guns back that sometimes means
 
03:38:45.110 --> 03:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
longer conversations you can't just call
 
03:38:46.790 --> 03:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
them up and bark orders to them you got
 
03:38:51.469 --> 03:38:51.479 align:start position:0%
to ask nicely and so literally if you do
 
03:38:54.070 --> 03:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
the math it depends on where it is
 
03:38:56.070 --> 03:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
geographically like I have some clients
 
03:38:57.670 --> 03:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
say where I say well G I could recommend
 
03:38:59.590 --> 03:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
a lawyer closer and they go no I want
 
03:39:01.229 --> 03:39:01.239 align:start position:0%
you to handle this because you've done
 
03:39:03.429 --> 03:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
this before so it depends on how far
 
03:39:05.830 --> 03:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
geographically it is from conquered is
 
03:39:08.790 --> 03:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
the total price you know I've had people
 
03:39:12.870 --> 03:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
pay me go to South Boston the time and
 
03:39:14.950 --> 03:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
they feel that you know some of the
 
03:39:17.750 --> 03:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
things I know are helpful to them so
 
03:39:20.750 --> 03:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of money to get your guns
 
03:39:24.229 --> 03:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
back and sometimes the guns monetarily
 
03:39:25.790 --> 03:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
aren't that great one of my favorite
 
03:39:28.189 --> 03:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
clients only had two guns but they were
 
03:39:30.269 --> 03:39:30.279 align:start position:0%
his two guns and they were his property
 
03:39:31.870 --> 03:39:31.880 align:start position:0%
at matter Jim he had a handgun and a
 
03:39:34.750 --> 03:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
long gun and one of my dearest clients
 
03:39:36.630 --> 03:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
and like he said they shouldn't get to
 
03:39:39.670 --> 03:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
keep his property and that's and that's
 
03:39:41.630 --> 03:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
why he's paid more on me than they were
 
03:39:44.670 --> 03:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
worth quite frankly and the other thing
 
03:39:49.070 --> 03:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
is sometimes when judges get objections
 
03:39:51.510 --> 03:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
from the original complainant until they
 
03:39:53.429 --> 03:39:53.439 align:start position:0%
get a lawyer involved they're
 
03:39:55.189 --> 03:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
disinclined to give them back even
 
03:39:57.110 --> 03:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
though they have quote have to give them
 
03:40:00.189 --> 03:40:00.199 align:start position:0%
back so it's it's a very difficult and
 
03:40:03.229 --> 03:40:03.239 align:start position:0%
arous process for the person who's doing
 
03:40:04.790 --> 03:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
this who's who's trying to get their
 
03:40:07.150 --> 03:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
firearms back and again I know it seems
 
03:40:08.950 --> 03:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
so simple you say you file a motion you
 
03:40:11.910 --> 03:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
go to court um if all the pieces aren't
 
03:40:13.189 --> 03:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
in place you don't know how many times
 
03:40:15.910 --> 03:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
the Court's tell you to come back again
 
03:40:18.830 --> 03:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
and the defend the accused person who
 
03:40:20.790 --> 03:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
had the complaint order against him he's
 
03:40:21.950 --> 03:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
not going to know to call the court
 
03:40:23.790 --> 03:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
clerk and make sure the gun line ran the
 
03:40:25.910 --> 03:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
check you know he he's not going to know
 
03:40:27.870 --> 03:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
that and he's taken a half day off work
 
03:40:29.510 --> 03:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
and some people work by the hour they've
 
03:40:31.309 --> 03:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
not only made their employer not happy
 
03:40:34.070 --> 03:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
but they've missed income that's a lot
 
03:40:37.150 --> 03:40:37.160 align:start position:0%
of money for a working man and just to
 
03:40:39.750 --> 03:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
be clear the people we're talking about
 
03:40:41.910 --> 03:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
here are innocent correct they haven't
 
03:40:43.070 --> 03:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
been convicted because then they won't
 
03:40:44.349 --> 03:40:44.359 align:start position:0%
be able to get their firearms back at
 
03:40:46.110 --> 03:40:46.120 align:start position:0%
all yes these are not convicted men
 
03:40:47.710 --> 03:40:47.720 align:start position:0%
these are men who are innocent of all
 
03:40:49.790 --> 03:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
crimes that were aware of because if
 
03:40:52.269 --> 03:40:52.279 align:start position:0%
they had been convicted in a thing they
 
03:40:54.429 --> 03:40:54.439 align:start position:0%
would not be allowed to have these firms
 
03:40:56.990 --> 03:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
so these are innocent citizens that are
 
03:40:59.150 --> 03:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
being penalized I call it the double
 
03:41:00.910 --> 03:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
whammy by the
 
03:41:03.790 --> 03:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
system and so there's no reason to do
 
03:41:05.510 --> 03:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
this to these people these are innocent
 
03:41:08.030 --> 03:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
men whose property's been taken they
 
03:41:09.550 --> 03:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
have receipts everybody agrees it's
 
03:41:11.269 --> 03:41:11.279 align:start position:0%
their proper property and all they're
 
03:41:13.510 --> 03:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
asking for return of their property
 
03:41:15.830 --> 03:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
because meanwhile again average working
 
03:41:17.349 --> 03:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
men can't go out and buy a bunch more
 
03:41:18.750 --> 03:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
guns these are the ones they used to
 
03:41:20.550 --> 03:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
protect them themselves to protect their
 
03:41:22.389 --> 03:41:22.399 align:start position:0%
home to protect their
 
03:41:25.309 --> 03:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
families and they just want them back
 
03:41:26.510 --> 03:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
you know that that's really what it
 
03:41:28.349 --> 03:41:28.359 align:start position:0%
comes down to they're they're people who
 
03:41:28.359 --> 03:41:29.630 align:start position:0%
comes down to they're they're people who
have

03:41:29.630 --> 03:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:41:33.550 --> 03:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
done in my mind nothing wrong now they
 
03:41:35.110 --> 03:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
they might have had a protective order
 
03:41:37.269 --> 03:41:37.279 align:start position:0%
against them but sometimes again as we
 
03:41:38.990 --> 03:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
know from the Innocence Project even
 
03:41:40.990 --> 03:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
those that are convicted they not waste
 
03:41:43.550 --> 03:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
guilty you know so but these men have no
 
03:41:45.229 --> 03:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
criminal convictions and no legal
 
03:41:47.349 --> 03:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
impediments to getting their guns back
 
03:41:49.790 --> 03:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
they just have practical impediments
 
03:41:51.830 --> 03:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
through bureaucracy through the court
 
03:41:54.510 --> 03:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
system and through some police
 
03:41:58.070 --> 03:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
departments to obtain a protective order
 
03:41:59.510 --> 03:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
you don't necessarily have to have
 
03:42:01.670 --> 03:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
actually been accused of abusing someone
 
03:42:03.630 --> 03:42:03.640 align:start position:0%
it could be that you are an imminent
 
03:42:05.429 --> 03:42:05.439 align:start position:0%
threat of abusing someone yeah
 
03:42:07.990 --> 03:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely so even that isn't
 
03:42:09.590 --> 03:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily true that there's they've
 
03:42:11.550 --> 03:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
done something it's only been accused
 
03:42:13.510 --> 03:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
and then they weren't proved guilty
 
03:42:15.790 --> 03:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
that's exactly it a lot here is what I
 
03:42:18.149 --> 03:42:18.159 align:start position:0%
think is the worst part of these things
 
03:42:20.469 --> 03:42:20.479 align:start position:0%
is it comes down to what I call he said
 
03:42:22.990 --> 03:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
she said usually or he she said she said
 
03:42:27.229 --> 03:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
or he said she said is that I could say
 
03:42:29.110 --> 03:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
that he said he's going to cut my throat
 
03:42:29.990 --> 03:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
with a
 
03:42:32.950 --> 03:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
knife guess what protective order here
 
03:42:35.990 --> 03:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
we come you know because that's the
 
03:42:38.030 --> 03:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
threat of abuse it's the threat of
 
03:42:40.550 --> 03:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
physical violence with a weapon and the
 
03:42:42.550 --> 03:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
bottom line is it depends on who the
 
03:42:45.389 --> 03:42:45.399 align:start position:0%
judge believes and here's the thing I
 
03:42:47.149 --> 03:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
keep reminding people in this state we
 
03:42:50.030 --> 03:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
do not elect judges so we can't unelect
 
03:42:51.910 --> 03:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
them once they're on the bench they're
 
03:42:54.110 --> 03:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
there forever or until 70 you know
 
03:42:55.710 --> 03:42:55.720 align:start position:0%
they're they're there forever and it's a
 
03:42:57.389 --> 03:42:57.399 align:start position:0%
big difference I come from a state where
 
03:43:00.030 --> 03:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
you elect judges and so I'll tell you
 
03:43:02.030 --> 03:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
something that I believe every defense
 
03:43:04.550 --> 03:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
attorney or even attorney in general
 
03:43:06.630 --> 03:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
will ask you if you come to an attorney
 
03:43:09.429 --> 03:43:09.439 align:start position:0%
with a problem one some of the first two
 
03:43:12.229 --> 03:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
questions most of us ask before we ask
 
03:43:14.269 --> 03:43:14.279 align:start position:0%
about the facts or anything we ask two
 
03:43:16.389 --> 03:43:16.399 align:start position:0%
questions who's the judge and who's on
 
03:43:19.790 --> 03:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
the other side because that makes a huge
 
03:43:21.110 --> 03:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
amount of difference and you think well
 
03:43:23.110 --> 03:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
the facts should matter you know what
 
03:43:25.349 --> 03:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
the actual conflict is and what the
 
03:43:27.630 --> 03:43:27.640 align:start position:0%
specifics are yeah it should but guess
 
03:43:30.469 --> 03:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
what makes a huge huge difference you
 
03:43:32.910 --> 03:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
know we all know the judges who lean one
 
03:43:36.590 --> 03:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:38.870 --> 03:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
other representative
 
03:43:41.229 --> 03:43:41.239 align:start position:0%
jamon thank you Mr chairman I'll try to
 
03:43:43.670 --> 03:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
keep my question
 
03:43:46.550 --> 03:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
brief um I actually had a conversation
 
03:43:48.550 --> 03:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
with one constituents in the last couple
 
03:43:50.870 --> 03:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
months told him about this bill that we
 
03:43:53.229 --> 03:43:53.239 align:start position:0%
were going to be facing it and he told
 
03:43:55.229 --> 03:43:55.239 align:start position:0%
me and I'm just wondering if you could
 
03:43:57.149 --> 03:43:57.159 align:start position:0%
tell me how many times you've heard this
 
03:44:00.670 --> 03:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
occur where um the domestic violence
 
03:44:04.030 --> 03:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
order has expired um the police
 
03:44:05.590 --> 03:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
department is so honorous to get the
 
03:44:08.030 --> 03:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
Firearms back to go through that process
 
03:44:10.309 --> 03:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
and it cost so much but but it was
 
03:44:11.830 --> 03:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
easier for them to go to a federal
 
03:44:14.309 --> 03:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
licensed dealer and purchase a new
 
03:44:17.309 --> 03:44:17.319 align:start position:0%
firearm and leave the firearm in the
 
03:44:19.469 --> 03:44:19.479 align:start position:0%
possession of the police department took
 
03:44:21.149 --> 03:44:21.159 align:start position:0%
about 10 years and finally the police
 
03:44:22.349 --> 03:44:22.359 align:start position:0%
department reached out to him and says
 
03:44:23.469 --> 03:44:23.479 align:start position:0%
are you ever going to come back and get
 
03:44:25.550 --> 03:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
this firearm he goes I've already owned
 
03:44:28.110 --> 03:44:28.120 align:start position:0%
like 16 of them so I don't need that one
 
03:44:29.469 --> 03:44:29.479 align:start position:0%
back have you ever heard of that
 
03:44:34.269 --> 03:44:34.279 align:start position:0%
happening absolutely a absolutely um and
 
03:44:36.910 --> 03:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
but it's happened even more so because
 
03:44:39.229 --> 03:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
the person doesn't want to go without a
 
03:44:41.550 --> 03:44:41.560 align:start position:0%
gun in other other words I can't tell
 
03:44:44.510 --> 03:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
you how naked I feel I've only went a
 
03:44:46.309 --> 03:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
couple places where you know my guns
 
03:44:49.189 --> 03:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
can't go with me and I felt naked and
 
03:44:51.469 --> 03:44:51.479 align:start position:0%
exposed and whatever and so most people
 
03:44:52.990 --> 03:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
the minute they're able to be able to
 
03:44:55.349 --> 03:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
lawfully protect themselves again they
 
03:44:57.070 --> 03:44:57.080 align:start position:0%
want to go get another firearm And when
 
03:44:59.429 --> 03:44:59.439 align:start position:0%
they see it's going to be who knows when
 
03:45:01.229 --> 03:45:01.239 align:start position:0%
they're going to get it back they're
 
03:45:03.070 --> 03:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
like what the heck I me as well just go
 
03:45:05.389 --> 03:45:05.399 align:start position:0%
buy another one because you know you
 
03:45:07.670 --> 03:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
take two or three day I mean I've had
 
03:45:09.870 --> 03:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
clients after initially try to get their
 
03:45:11.429 --> 03:45:11.439 align:start position:0%
guns back but they take a half day off
 
03:45:13.389 --> 03:45:13.399 align:start position:0%
work there's a cur fluffle at the court
 
03:45:15.269 --> 03:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
so they've already lost that money and
 
03:45:17.110 --> 03:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
they like wait a minute I've taken two
 
03:45:19.309 --> 03:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
half days off work I still don't have my
 
03:45:22.550 --> 03:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
guns back I may as well save my court
 
03:45:25.229 --> 03:45:25.239 align:start position:0%
money and go buy a gun so yes no that's
 
03:45:28.189 --> 03:45:28.199 align:start position:0%
sadly happened more than
 
03:45:30.630 --> 03:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
once representative
 
03:45:32.670 --> 03:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
fratt you answered my first question
 
03:45:35.110 --> 03:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
about the cost there excessive cost uh
 
03:45:36.750 --> 03:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
would that be the same if a person was
 
03:45:39.269 --> 03:45:39.279 align:start position:0%
found not guilty we're talking about a
 
03:45:42.070 --> 03:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
protective order expiring but if a
 
03:45:43.670 --> 03:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
person went to court getting the guns
 
03:45:45.030 --> 03:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
back after the
 
03:45:48.229 --> 03:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
court sadly the process is the same same
 
03:45:52.349 --> 03:45:52.359 align:start position:0%
yes thank you yeah representative Stone
 
03:45:53.469 --> 03:45:53.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:45:55.590 --> 03:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question is going
 
03:45:59.910 --> 03:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
to be if the expired order happens an
 
03:46:01.870 --> 03:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
individual can purchase a new firearm
 
03:46:04.750 --> 03:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
under both federal and state law what is
 
03:46:07.269 --> 03:46:07.279 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the law or the history of
 
03:46:09.229 --> 03:46:09.239 align:start position:0%
it that we passed to maintain the
 
03:46:12.110 --> 03:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
firearm to have a separate hearing to go
 
03:46:14.510 --> 03:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
before a judge and have an order issued
 
03:46:16.269 --> 03:46:16.279 align:start position:0%
to return Firearms if they can just go
 
03:46:18.309 --> 03:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
out and purchase new ones what are we
 
03:46:20.189 --> 03:46:20.199 align:start position:0%
doing with this this
 
03:46:23.110 --> 03:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
law I think it's horrible the way I
 
03:46:24.630 --> 03:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
think the law state of the law right now
 
03:46:27.630 --> 03:46:27.640 align:start position:0%
is horrible the way it is this bill
 
03:46:29.990 --> 03:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
improves the horrible state of the law
 
03:46:33.309 --> 03:46:33.319 align:start position:0%
quite a bit do I think the entire
 
03:46:35.550 --> 03:46:35.560 align:start position:0%
process should be scrapped I
 
03:46:39.229 --> 03:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
do but as I'm realistic politically and
 
03:46:39.239 --> 03:46:40.149 align:start position:0%
do but as I'm realistic politically and
realis

03:46:40.149 --> 03:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
realis
 
03:46:42.790 --> 03:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
practically the best I can hope for at
 
03:46:45.229 --> 03:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
this point is that you pass this bill
 
03:46:47.309 --> 03:46:47.319 align:start position:0%
but but I agree with you that shouldn't
 
03:46:50.349 --> 03:46:50.359 align:start position:0%
be the process I agree with you that we
 
03:46:52.710 --> 03:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
have a protective order that ends I
 
03:46:54.710 --> 03:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
should be able to go get my stuff the
 
03:46:56.469 --> 03:46:56.479 align:start position:0%
stuff that I had to give to you I should
 
03:46:59.149 --> 03:46:59.159 align:start position:0%
be able to just go pick it up but that's
 
03:47:03.910 --> 03:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:06.670 --> 03:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
you representative Su
 
03:47:10.229 --> 03:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
Newman yes thank you
 
03:47:13.110 --> 03:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
if I took my notes correctly you said 70
 
03:47:16.349 --> 03:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
about 75% maybe a little more of
 
03:47:19.670 --> 03:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
protective orders are granted yes yes
 
03:47:21.469 --> 03:47:21.479 align:start position:0%
after and so I should be real clear
 
03:47:22.670 --> 03:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
because probably members of the
 
03:47:24.670 --> 03:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
committee don't understand something I
 
03:47:27.309 --> 03:47:27.319 align:start position:0%
didn't explain something to you is that
 
03:47:29.550 --> 03:47:29.560 align:start position:0%
initially the individual will go to the
 
03:47:31.229 --> 03:47:31.239 align:start position:0%
court of the Police Department and ask
 
03:47:33.389 --> 03:47:33.399 align:start position:0%
for a protective order to be issued
 
03:47:36.469 --> 03:47:36.479 align:start position:0%
that's considered a temporary order and
 
03:47:39.070 --> 03:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
then the person who the protective order
 
03:47:41.189 --> 03:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
has been granted against has an
 
03:47:44.349 --> 03:47:44.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a hearing and at that
 
03:47:47.510 --> 03:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
hearing is where the um the numbers come
 
03:47:49.349 --> 03:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
from the way I receive them in other
 
03:47:51.590 --> 03:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
words that of the people who apply for
 
03:47:53.429 --> 03:47:53.439 align:start position:0%
that initial order which is considered a
 
03:47:56.149 --> 03:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
temporary order and then what we call a
 
03:47:59.750 --> 03:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
permanent order which is the um one you
 
03:48:01.590 --> 03:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
typically one year I've never seen them
 
03:48:04.870 --> 03:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
issued for less than one year so 75% of
 
03:48:06.990 --> 03:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
those who apply for that temporary they
 
03:48:09.830 --> 03:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
become the permanent yes yes if I if I
 
03:48:12.429 --> 03:48:12.439 align:start position:0%
could continue thank you for that but
 
03:48:16.349 --> 03:48:16.359 align:start position:0%
the approximately 25% that are not do
 
03:48:19.950 --> 03:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
not go through no weapons are taken or
 
03:48:22.349 --> 03:48:22.359 align:start position:0%
dangerous devices are taken while those
 
03:48:24.670 --> 03:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
are being considered to be dismissed I
 
03:48:27.030 --> 03:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
guess no I should explain this to you
 
03:48:29.389 --> 03:48:29.399 align:start position:0%
better um and I apologize for not being
 
03:48:30.910 --> 03:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
clear because a lot of members of the
 
03:48:32.910 --> 03:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
committee probably don't understand this
 
03:48:34.790 --> 03:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
so I want to if I may just start from
 
03:48:37.070 --> 03:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
the very beginning so let's say that
 
03:48:38.950 --> 03:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
someone goes to the police department
 
03:48:42.429 --> 03:48:42.439 align:start position:0%
person one and says and they call a
 
03:48:44.269 --> 03:48:44.279 align:start position:0%
judge or magistrate get a protect
 
03:48:46.830 --> 03:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
temporary protective order out what they
 
03:48:49.309 --> 03:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
then do protective order against person
 
03:48:52.790 --> 03:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
number two the police department where
 
03:48:56.309 --> 03:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
person number two lives D literally
 
03:48:58.269 --> 03:48:58.279 align:start position:0%
drives immediately to person number
 
03:49:00.670 --> 03:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
two's house who the protective order is
 
03:49:03.070 --> 03:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
against and they say Sir you've been
 
03:49:05.229 --> 03:49:05.239 align:start position:0%
served with this protective order and
 
03:49:07.510 --> 03:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
this is where some horrible abuse begins
 
03:49:08.870 --> 03:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
and it's I'm really glad for your
 
03:49:10.830 --> 03:49:10.840 align:start position:0%
question representative because it's
 
03:49:13.870 --> 03:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
important is they say to the person do
 
03:49:16.790 --> 03:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
you have firearms or you know weapons
 
03:49:19.630 --> 03:49:19.640 align:start position:0%
that type of thing and they usually have
 
03:49:21.830 --> 03:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
already asked the person who's protected
 
03:49:23.790 --> 03:49:23.800 align:start position:0%
against what weapons they think they
 
03:49:26.910 --> 03:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
have and if the person says yes I do
 
03:49:29.349 --> 03:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
they say where are they at they will not
 
03:49:31.229 --> 03:49:31.239 align:start position:0%
let you go back in your own house and
 
03:49:32.590 --> 03:49:32.600 align:start position:0%
they'll tell you they'll arrest you if
 
03:49:34.670 --> 03:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
you do they will go in and rumage
 
03:49:36.990 --> 03:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
through your house and get all your guns
 
03:49:39.830 --> 03:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
and all your ammo and anything else that
 
03:49:42.189 --> 03:49:42.199 align:start position:0%
they think is in violation of it and
 
03:49:44.429 --> 03:49:44.439 align:start position:0%
this becomes really problematic and I've
 
03:49:47.030 --> 03:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
had this happen in many cases you'd be
 
03:49:48.870 --> 03:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
surprised or maybe you wouldn't the
 
03:49:50.550 --> 03:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
amount of adult people that still live
 
03:49:52.189 --> 03:49:52.199 align:start position:0%
with their parents so let's say it's a
 
03:49:54.790 --> 03:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
30-year-old adult man and he still lives
 
03:49:57.189 --> 03:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
at his parents house and his mother and
 
03:49:59.790 --> 03:49:59.800 align:start position:0%
father have their own guns the police
 
03:50:03.349 --> 03:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
take every gun in that house every round
 
03:50:05.510 --> 03:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
of ammo every everything even if the
 
03:50:06.910 --> 03:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
parents the mother and father are
 
03:50:08.830 --> 03:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
sitting right there saying this is our
 
03:50:10.710 --> 03:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
house we can show you the property deed
 
03:50:12.670 --> 03:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
he lives with us his driver's license is
 
03:50:14.990 --> 03:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
here but these are our guns and our ammo
 
03:50:18.309 --> 03:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
and this is his guns the answer is all
 
03:50:21.670 --> 03:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
guns all guns all ammo are
 
03:50:25.990 --> 03:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
taken and so while this temporary order
 
03:50:28.469 --> 03:50:28.479 align:start position:0%
is pending all guns and ammo are not
 
03:50:31.070 --> 03:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
only taken but he meaning the person who
 
03:50:33.630 --> 03:50:33.640 align:start position:0%
the order is against cannot go by any
 
03:50:36.590 --> 03:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
guns cannot possess guns cannot have
 
03:50:39.189 --> 03:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
access to guns ammunition or ammunition
 
03:50:41.750 --> 03:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
I components which is powder primer and
 
03:50:45.469 --> 03:50:45.479 align:start position:0%
Brass he cannot go buy a gun now here is
 
03:50:48.189 --> 03:50:48.199 align:start position:0%
the next problem technically he has a
 
03:50:51.429 --> 03:50:51.439 align:start position:0%
right to a hearing 3 to 5 days as a
 
03:50:54.469 --> 03:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
practical matter if he wants any type of
 
03:50:56.710 --> 03:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
in my opinion unless they are lucky they
 
03:50:58.750 --> 03:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
have time good attorney an attorney
 
03:51:00.990 --> 03:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
who's going to prep the case he is going
 
03:51:03.630 --> 03:51:03.640 align:start position:0%
to have to wave that timeline because if
 
03:51:05.870 --> 03:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
Johnny Joe calls me tomorrow and says
 
03:51:08.229 --> 03:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
I've got this protective order I first
 
03:51:10.269 --> 03:51:10.279 align:start position:0%
have to read the order I have to meet
 
03:51:12.309 --> 03:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
with him it depends on how long the
 
03:51:14.189 --> 03:51:14.199 align:start position:0%
order is as to whether or not I'm going
 
03:51:15.870 --> 03:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
to get a private investigator to go
 
03:51:17.910 --> 03:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
check things out it depends on a lot of
 
03:51:20.309 --> 03:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
specifics but I likely will not be able
 
03:51:23.189 --> 03:51:23.199 align:start position:0%
to take that case and prepare to defend
 
03:51:26.110 --> 03:51:26.120 align:start position:0%
him in that hearing for a month or two
 
03:51:28.550 --> 03:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
so meanwhile we have to wave time limits
 
03:51:30.070 --> 03:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
with the court in order to get a
 
03:51:32.229 --> 03:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
continuance and he is living with that
 
03:51:35.670 --> 03:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
protective order for probably 30 to 60
 
03:51:38.070 --> 03:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
days now during this 30 or 60 days
 
03:51:39.790 --> 03:51:39.800 align:start position:0%
there's some other things have to
 
03:51:41.910 --> 03:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
understand that are in it if in fact
 
03:51:43.830 --> 03:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
they were married he's obligated as I've
 
03:51:45.670 --> 03:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
said to pay all these bills and continue
 
03:51:49.550 --> 03:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
it if in like here they're separated or
 
03:51:51.030 --> 03:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
they're they don't live together that's
 
03:51:52.910 --> 03:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
something different but a lot of times
 
03:51:55.630 --> 03:51:55.640 align:start position:0%
you even have people who were it's like
 
03:51:57.830 --> 03:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
people who are attracted to stars who
 
03:51:59.269 --> 03:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
think they have a relationship with
 
03:52:01.790 --> 03:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
someone they don't and they file these
 
03:52:04.710 --> 03:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
orders and that happens too so meanwhile
 
03:52:07.030 --> 03:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
that person can't have any third- party
 
03:52:08.790 --> 03:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
contact with the person there's all
 
03:52:11.510 --> 03:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
sorts are rules and regulations and so I
 
03:52:14.750 --> 03:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
have to tell all of their per my clients
 
03:52:17.229 --> 03:52:17.239 align:start position:0%
I say you have to call all your friends
 
03:52:19.670 --> 03:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
right now and I said you need to tell
 
03:52:22.590 --> 03:52:22.600 align:start position:0%
every one of them do not call her cuz
 
03:52:23.950 --> 03:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
the first thing their friends want to do
 
03:52:25.870 --> 03:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
is call and say what are you doing he's
 
03:52:27.950 --> 03:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
a great guy why would you do something
 
03:52:30.189 --> 03:52:30.199 align:start position:0%
like this that's considered witness
 
03:52:32.429 --> 03:52:32.439 align:start position:0%
tampering or intimidation and that can
 
03:52:35.309 --> 03:52:35.319 align:start position:0%
get you some new charges so I tell them
 
03:52:37.030 --> 03:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
make sure you call all your friends and
 
03:52:39.790 --> 03:52:39.800 align:start position:0%
family and tell them do not call her do
 
03:52:42.790 --> 03:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
not talk to her do not say anything to
 
03:52:46.189 --> 03:52:46.199 align:start position:0%
her make sure you and this happened to
 
03:52:47.910 --> 03:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
one of my clients make sure you lock her
 
03:52:49.910 --> 03:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
on your phone because how many of us
 
03:52:51.830 --> 03:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
have butt dialed people on cell phones
 
03:52:53.630 --> 03:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
before probably all of us or purse
 
03:52:56.189 --> 03:52:56.199 align:start position:0%
dialed if you accidentally dial their
 
03:52:58.269 --> 03:52:58.279 align:start position:0%
phone number during that time period
 
03:53:00.790 --> 03:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
that's a violation of the protective
 
03:53:04.030 --> 03:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
order so so yes from the very beginning
 
03:53:05.830 --> 03:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
and that person goes and makes a
 
03:53:07.750 --> 03:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
complaint all their weapons are taken
 
03:53:09.040 --> 03:53:09.050 align:start position:0%
from them
 
03:53:09.050 --> 03:53:11.630 align:start position:0%
from them

[Music]
 
03:53:15.070 --> 03:53:15.080 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you thank
 
03:53:30.990 --> 03:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:33.830 --> 03:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
Kylie um good afternoon Mr chair and
 
03:53:35.790 --> 03:53:35.800 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
03:53:37.830 --> 03:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
Pamela kyg and I the public policy
 
03:53:39.070 --> 03:53:39.080 align:start position:0%
specialist at the New Hampshire
 
03:53:40.750 --> 03:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
Coalition against Domestic and Sexual
 
03:53:42.750 --> 03:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
Violence um the Coalition is the
 
03:53:45.070 --> 03:53:45.080 align:start position:0%
umbrella Organization for our state's 12
 
03:53:47.149 --> 03:53:47.159 align:start position:0%
community- based crisis centers and we
 
03:53:49.510 --> 03:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
serve nearly 14,000 victims and
 
03:53:51.110 --> 03:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
survivors of Domestic and Sexual
 
03:53:53.630 --> 03:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
Violence each year um I'm here in
 
03:53:57.070 --> 03:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
opposition to HB 1337 legislation that
 
03:53:58.990 --> 03:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
would change the process for how deadly
 
03:54:00.750 --> 03:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
weapons will be returned to domestic
 
03:54:03.469 --> 03:54:03.479 align:start position:0%
violence abusers um I think first and
 
03:54:04.750 --> 03:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
foremost and I know you've heard this
 
03:54:07.670 --> 03:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
from me before but this bill will place
 
03:54:09.269 --> 03:54:09.279 align:start position:0%
victims at increased risk risk of
 
03:54:11.750 --> 03:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
lethality domestic violence is the most
 
03:54:14.149 --> 03:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
lethal crime in the state and more than
 
03:54:16.990 --> 03:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
50% of homicides are the direct result
 
03:54:19.389 --> 03:54:19.399 align:start position:0%
of domestic violence the majority of
 
03:54:21.910 --> 03:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
these homicides are caused by Firearms
 
03:54:23.790 --> 03:54:23.800 align:start position:0%
we know that domestic violence and
 
03:54:26.670 --> 03:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
Firearms are a deadly combination a
 
03:54:28.750 --> 03:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
victim of domestic violence is five
 
03:54:30.630 --> 03:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
times more likely to be killed by their
 
03:54:33.269 --> 03:54:33.279 align:start position:0%
abuser if there is a gun in the home
 
03:54:35.269 --> 03:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
firearms in the hands of those who have
 
03:54:37.630 --> 03:54:37.640 align:start position:0%
been violent increase the risk of lethal
 
03:54:40.229 --> 03:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
outcomes and serious injuries not only
 
03:54:42.149 --> 03:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
for the person who is protected by a
 
03:54:44.269 --> 03:54:44.279 align:start position:0%
court order but also for the community
 
03:54:46.590 --> 03:54:46.600 align:start position:0%
at large so this is really about Public
 
03:54:51.110 --> 03:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
Safety at its core um this bill puts the
 
03:54:53.110 --> 03:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
burden on a victim to further prevent
 
03:54:55.349 --> 03:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
their abuser from accessing these deadly
 
03:54:57.710 --> 03:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
weapons this can potentially put them in
 
03:55:00.110 --> 03:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
more danger because they will have to go
 
03:55:02.149 --> 03:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
before a judge just before the
 
03:55:04.710 --> 03:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
protective order would expire um I want
 
03:55:06.950 --> 03:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
to clarify some of the statistics that
 
03:55:09.469 --> 03:55:09.479 align:start position:0%
were shared earlier today um according
 
03:55:11.149 --> 03:55:11.159 align:start position:0%
to the most recent report from the
 
03:55:12.790 --> 03:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
domestic violence fatality Review
 
03:55:14.349 --> 03:55:14.359 align:start position:0%
Committee which I have a copy of the
 
03:55:16.870 --> 03:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
report I can pass around um actually
 
03:55:19.670 --> 03:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
only 40% of final protective orders were
 
03:55:22.990 --> 03:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
granted between 2020 and 2021 and that's
 
03:55:24.870 --> 03:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
they do it on a biannual basis so we
 
03:55:27.030 --> 03:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
won't have the next report for another
 
03:55:30.189 --> 03:55:30.199 align:start position:0%
year um so I think it's just really
 
03:55:32.349 --> 03:55:32.359 align:start position:0%
important to clarify that there is a
 
03:55:35.189 --> 03:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
very high bar um in order to get a
 
03:55:36.710 --> 03:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
protective order they're not handed out
 
03:55:39.670 --> 03:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
freely it is not 75%
 
03:55:41.309 --> 03:55:41.319 align:start position:0%
um and so in order to be granted a
 
03:55:43.110 --> 03:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
domestic violence protective order three
 
03:55:45.229 --> 03:55:45.239 align:start position:0%
things need to be true there needs to be
 
03:55:47.870 --> 03:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
a finding that the law has been broken
 
03:55:49.309 --> 03:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
that domestic violence has been
 
03:55:51.670 --> 03:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
committed and this is in a civil process
 
03:55:53.990 --> 03:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
and not a criminal process um there
 
03:55:55.870 --> 03:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be evidence that the victim is
 
03:55:57.830 --> 03:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
in immediate danger and there is a
 
03:56:00.429 --> 03:56:00.439 align:start position:0%
credible threat of further abuse so
 
03:56:02.910 --> 03:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
there is a finding that harm and
 
03:56:05.670 --> 03:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
violence has occurred um and so I think
 
03:56:07.309 --> 03:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
that's really important to emphasize
 
03:56:10.469 --> 03:56:10.479 align:start position:0%
here um and I think what's another just
 
03:56:12.269 --> 03:56:12.279 align:start position:0%
um piece I want to highlight is that
 
03:56:14.469 --> 03:56:14.479 align:start position:0%
this is really about prioritizing uh
 
03:56:17.110 --> 03:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
victim safety in this process so we know
 
03:56:19.189 --> 03:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
that Mo the most dangerous time for
 
03:56:20.910 --> 03:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
victims is when they are trying to leave
 
03:56:23.269 --> 03:56:23.279 align:start position:0%
an abusive situation and when a victim
 
03:56:25.070 --> 03:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
seeks Relief by filing a protective
 
03:56:27.389 --> 03:56:27.399 align:start position:0%
order the process can already place them
 
03:56:30.710 --> 03:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
at risk it is not always safe to seek
 
03:56:33.429 --> 03:56:33.439 align:start position:0%
relief via a protective order that is
 
03:56:35.389 --> 03:56:35.399 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be taken with
 
03:56:37.309 --> 03:56:37.319 align:start position:0%
utmost consideration for their safety
 
03:56:38.469 --> 03:56:38.479 align:start position:0%
and whether or not this is the right
 
03:56:40.349 --> 03:56:40.359 align:start position:0%
time time or if it could escalate
 
03:56:42.990 --> 03:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
violence um this bill would only further
 
03:56:45.910 --> 03:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
place them in an untenable situation in
 
03:56:47.790 --> 03:56:47.800 align:start position:0%
domestic violence cases victims are
 
03:56:50.269 --> 03:56:50.279 align:start position:0%
frequ frequently have to balance their
 
03:56:52.309 --> 03:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
own safety with that of their children
 
03:56:54.349 --> 03:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
and are constantly in fear of making
 
03:56:56.429 --> 03:56:56.439 align:start position:0%
decisions that could further jeopardize
 
03:56:58.550 --> 03:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
their life um when someone has
 
03:57:00.510 --> 03:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
previously exhibited violent behavior
 
03:57:02.149 --> 03:57:02.159 align:start position:0%
and been found by the courts to be a
 
03:57:04.590 --> 03:57:04.600 align:start position:0%
safety risk why are we putting victims
 
03:57:06.429 --> 03:57:06.439 align:start position:0%
in a more vulnerable and potentially
 
03:57:08.910 --> 03:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
left threat threaten sorry I'm so sorry
 
03:57:12.269 --> 03:57:12.279 align:start position:0%
threatening situation um and so again
 
03:57:14.309 --> 03:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
like this is not the appropriate
 
03:57:16.550 --> 03:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
approach um to address some of the the
 
03:57:18.269 --> 03:57:18.279 align:start position:0%
issues that have been brought up today
 
03:57:20.550 --> 03:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
when it comes to returning Firearms so
 
03:57:23.830 --> 03:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
in conclusion HB 1337 is a nightmare for
 
03:57:25.830 --> 03:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
victims and makes unnecessary and
 
03:57:29.429 --> 03:57:29.439 align:start position:0%
potentially dangerous changes um to RSA
 
03:57:33.030 --> 03:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
173b the Civil domestic violence statute
 
03:57:34.870 --> 03:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
and intent which was intentionally
 
03:57:37.030 --> 03:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
written to establish protections and
 
03:57:39.910 --> 03:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
enshrine best practice IES when it comes
 
03:57:41.469 --> 03:57:41.479 align:start position:0%
to responding to domestic violence in
 
03:57:43.309 --> 03:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I urge you all to
 
03:57:48.429 --> 03:57:48.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:50.910 --> 03:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
you representive
 
03:57:53.269 --> 03:57:53.279 align:start position:0%
jamman thank you Mr
 
03:57:56.189 --> 03:57:56.199 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for your testimony um
 
03:57:59.590 --> 03:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
but it spurned a question in my mind um
 
03:58:01.910 --> 03:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
if a
 
03:58:06.189 --> 03:58:06.199 align:start position:0%
person has abused another person and the
 
03:58:08.910 --> 03:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
protective order has been put in place
 
03:58:12.030 --> 03:58:12.040 align:start position:0%
there has been a conviction of domestic
 
03:58:15.189 --> 03:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
violence that person then under the
 
03:58:17.110 --> 03:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
lottenberg amendment that was made many
 
03:58:19.910 --> 03:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
years ago by a by a congressman or a
 
03:58:22.950 --> 03:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
senator from uh Connecticut that person
 
03:58:24.950 --> 03:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
is now a prohibited person they'll never
 
03:58:27.070 --> 03:58:27.080 align:start position:0%
get their Farms back in their lifetime
 
03:58:28.990 --> 03:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm
 
03:58:29.000 --> 03:58:30.990 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm
curious

03:58:30.990 --> 03:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
curious
 
03:58:34.790 --> 03:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
why if the if the You' be
 
03:58:37.990 --> 03:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
opposed if if the domestic violence
 
03:58:40.030 --> 03:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
order had has
 
03:58:43.149 --> 03:58:43.159 align:start position:0%
expired for them to go through the riger
 
03:58:45.070 --> 03:58:45.080 align:start position:0%
role and still not get the they will not
 
03:58:47.149 --> 03:58:47.159 align:start position:0%
get their firearms back are you aware of
 
03:58:49.189 --> 03:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
that um thank you for the question
 
03:58:51.590 --> 03:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative um I'm not I think I'm
 
03:58:54.269 --> 03:58:54.279 align:start position:0%
following I I would just say that this
 
03:58:57.189 --> 03:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
bill just shifts the timeline in a
 
03:59:00.110 --> 03:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
system that is already working just fine
 
03:59:01.710 --> 03:59:01.720 align:start position:0%
there doesn't need to be a change to the
 
03:59:05.030 --> 03:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
law and we have a concern that someone
 
03:59:07.389 --> 03:59:07.399 align:start position:0%
would have to go before a judge to say
 
03:59:09.309 --> 03:59:09.319 align:start position:0%
this person is dangerous
 
03:59:11.750 --> 03:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
days before a a protective order could
 
03:59:14.710 --> 03:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
expire which could trigger retaliation
 
03:59:16.790 --> 03:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
from an abuser so it's it's more about
 
03:59:18.990 --> 03:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
the timing and the safety risk that
 
03:59:21.790 --> 03:59:21.800 align:start position:0%
could then come the we feel firmly that
 
03:59:23.950 --> 03:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
the the statute is doing what it needs
 
03:59:26.950 --> 03:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
to do and was intentionally um designed
 
03:59:26.960 --> 03:59:28.429 align:start position:0%
to do and was intentionally um designed
thank

03:59:28.429 --> 03:59:28.439 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:59:30.550 --> 03:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman for the
 
03:59:32.590 --> 03:59:32.600 align:start position:0%
followup and I don't mean to put you on
 
03:59:35.990 --> 03:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
the spot um if the person that has been
 
03:59:37.750 --> 03:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
abused even if there hasn't been a
 
03:59:39.550 --> 03:59:39.560 align:start position:0%
conviction still believes that that
 
03:59:41.630 --> 03:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
person is still a threat they have the
 
03:59:43.229 --> 03:59:43.239 align:start position:0%
ability to go and renew that order
 
03:59:47.070 --> 03:59:47.080 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct thank
 
03:59:50.149 --> 03:59:50.159 align:start position:0%
you all right representative
 
03:59:52.990 --> 03:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
s thank you and thank you for taking my
 
03:59:54.750 --> 03:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
question I just want to clarify one of
 
03:59:56.990 --> 03:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
the points you made about um the most
 
03:59:59.110 --> 03:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
dangerous time might be just before a
 
04:00:01.990 --> 04:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
victim of domestic violence is ready to
 
04:00:05.469 --> 04:00:05.479 align:start position:0%
leave and I I'm not sure if you heard
 
04:00:07.189 --> 04:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
about the incredibly tragic story out of
 
04:00:09.269 --> 04:00:09.279 align:start position:0%
my town of Durham um where the news
 
04:00:12.070 --> 04:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
broke yesterday where um the victim will
 
04:00:14.309 --> 04:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
not be charged because she was acting in
 
04:00:16.429 --> 04:00:16.439 align:start position:0%
self-defense um but that the
 
04:00:18.070 --> 04:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
circumstances were that her
 
04:00:21.990 --> 04:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
abuser um found her Escape Plan and
 
04:00:24.229 --> 04:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
that's what triggered the final uh fatal
 
04:00:28.630 --> 04:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
attack um I'm curious you know I mean
 
04:00:30.670 --> 04:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
she she didn't have time to get to the
 
04:00:33.550 --> 04:00:33.560 align:start position:0%
protective order stage but whether there
 
04:00:35.830 --> 04:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
are other people who might be in a
 
04:00:39.389 --> 04:00:39.399 align:start position:0%
situation um and how that might relate I
 
04:00:41.750 --> 04:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
guess yeah no thank you so much for that
 
04:00:43.349 --> 04:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
question I won't speak to the specific
 
04:00:45.030 --> 04:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
case but I will speak to the pattern of
 
04:00:46.910 --> 04:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
domestic violence so domestic violence
 
04:00:49.349 --> 04:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
at its core is about power and control
 
04:00:51.950 --> 04:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
and that is why um often times when
 
04:00:51.960 --> 04:00:53.429 align:start position:0%
and that is why um often times when
someone

04:00:53.429 --> 04:00:53.439 align:start position:0%
someone
 
04:00:57.030 --> 04:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
realizes um realizes that um the victim
 
04:00:58.630 --> 04:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
is trying to leave they're trying to
 
04:01:00.590 --> 04:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
then find ways to exert power and
 
04:01:02.349 --> 04:01:02.359 align:start position:0%
control and that can escalate violence
 
04:01:04.269 --> 04:01:04.279 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to share additional
 
04:01:05.630 --> 04:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
materials with you if that would be
 
04:01:07.229 --> 04:01:07.239 align:start position:0%
helpful thank
 
04:01:07.239 --> 04:01:10.189 align:start position:0%
helpful thank
you

04:01:10.189 --> 04:01:10.199 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:01:10.199 --> 04:01:11.750 align:start position:0%
you
representative

04:01:11.750 --> 04:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:01:14.790 --> 04:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you and this just relates
 
04:01:15.950 --> 04:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
to the question of the previous
 
04:01:19.269 --> 04:01:19.279 align:start position:0%
representative asked about the um a
 
04:01:21.550 --> 04:01:21.560 align:start position:0%
prohibited person would have weapons and
 
04:01:25.070 --> 04:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
would never get them back you you said
 
04:01:27.189 --> 04:01:27.199 align:start position:0%
in order to get an order you need a
 
04:01:29.429 --> 04:01:29.439 align:start position:0%
finding that criminal abuse has occurred
 
04:01:32.030 --> 04:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
could you just explain what that means
 
04:01:33.790 --> 04:01:33.800 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you so much for your question
 
04:01:36.389 --> 04:01:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh representative so um RSA
 
04:01:39.590 --> 04:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
173b um has uh the definition of abuse
 
04:01:41.910 --> 04:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
and outlines the qualifications that you
 
04:01:44.269 --> 04:01:44.279 align:start position:0%
need to meet in order to qualify for a
 
04:01:46.429 --> 04:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
protective order there is an an an
 
04:01:49.429 --> 04:01:49.439 align:start position:0%
numerated list um of other crimes like
 
04:01:53.870 --> 04:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty um simple assault uh an
 
04:01:55.910 --> 04:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh stocking and so on it's a long list
 
04:01:57.389 --> 04:01:57.399 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to share the statute with
 
04:02:00.429 --> 04:02:00.439 align:start position:0%
you um and so when one of those things
 
04:02:03.429 --> 04:02:03.439 align:start position:0%
occurs that is part of the protective
 
04:02:07.750 --> 04:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
order thank you to be clear though abuse
 
04:02:09.950 --> 04:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
does not not have to occur to get the
 
04:02:12.110 --> 04:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
ordered only the threat of abuse can get
 
04:02:14.550 --> 04:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
the ordered too is that correct um there
 
04:02:15.710 --> 04:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
are some folks in the room that can
 
04:02:17.309 --> 04:02:17.319 align:start position:0%
probably better explain the legal
 
04:02:19.389 --> 04:02:19.399 align:start position:0%
process but the and I'm sorry I don't
 
04:02:21.110 --> 04:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
have the exact definition in front of me
 
04:02:24.030 --> 04:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
but it you have to demonstrate that
 
04:02:25.630 --> 04:02:25.640 align:start position:0%
there is a credible present threat to
 
04:02:28.389 --> 04:02:28.399 align:start position:0%
your safety um and that has to meet the
 
04:02:31.229 --> 04:02:31.239 align:start position:0%
strict uh criteria in that list okay
 
04:02:35.110 --> 04:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative Stone thank
 
04:02:36.670 --> 04:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:02:39.469 --> 04:02:39.479 align:start position:0%
question so under a civil protective
 
04:02:42.349 --> 04:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
order that is expired an individual is
 
04:02:44.269 --> 04:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
no longer prohibited from purchasing a
 
04:02:47.110 --> 04:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
new firearm or possessing a firearm
 
04:02:49.189 --> 04:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't it make it a moot point to make
 
04:02:51.149 --> 04:02:51.159 align:start position:0%
an additional process to go through
 
04:02:52.990 --> 04:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
returning firearms that were previously
 
04:02:54.790 --> 04:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
owned if they can go out by a brand new
 
04:02:56.950 --> 04:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
one can I get back to you on that
 
04:02:59.229 --> 04:02:59.239 align:start position:0%
question because I don't know the I'm
 
04:03:01.389 --> 04:03:01.399 align:start position:0%
not a law enforcement officer so I don't
 
04:03:03.670 --> 04:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
know the process around return of
 
04:03:06.389 --> 04:03:06.399 align:start position:0%
firearms and um so I'd like to just look
 
04:03:08.110 --> 04:03:08.120 align:start position:0%
a little bit more into that thank you
 
04:03:08.120 --> 04:03:09.790 align:start position:0%
a little bit more into that thank you
than

04:03:09.790 --> 04:03:09.800 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:03:13.389 --> 04:03:13.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:16.590 --> 04:03:16.600 align:start position:0%
testimony chair calls
 
04:03:36.429 --> 04:03:36.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:39.590 --> 04:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
wher good afternoon Mr chairman and and
 
04:03:41.670 --> 04:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'll try to be
 
04:03:43.790 --> 04:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
brief uh I'll start off by saying that I
 
04:03:47.750 --> 04:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
agree with uh um attorney Dean's um
 
04:03:50.429 --> 04:03:50.439 align:start position:0%
analysis of the situation um but I'd
 
04:03:53.790 --> 04:03:53.800 align:start position:0%
like to add a couple of points um when
 
04:03:56.790 --> 04:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
someone is and domestic violence order
 
04:03:58.750 --> 04:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
has expired it hasn't been renewed it
 
04:04:00.990 --> 04:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
hasn't been made permanent then there
 
04:04:03.910 --> 04:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
should be a presumption of innocence so
 
04:04:05.710 --> 04:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
it's my opinion this bill doesn't even
 
04:04:08.309 --> 04:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
go far enough I support this bill but I
 
04:04:10.870 --> 04:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
don't think it goes far enough I would
 
04:04:13.750 --> 04:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
go um down to line
 
04:04:17.070 --> 04:04:17.080 align:start position:0%
29 where it would put the put the burden
 
04:04:20.229 --> 04:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
excuse me 21 put the burden on the court
 
04:04:22.550 --> 04:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
the courot is the one that issued the
 
04:04:25.030 --> 04:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
original domestic violence order put the
 
04:04:27.550 --> 04:04:27.560 align:start position:0%
burden on the court like it says in line
 
04:04:32.630 --> 04:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
21 to do the check to make sure that
 
04:04:34.910 --> 04:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
that person hasn't robbed a bank in the
 
04:04:38.269 --> 04:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
last year um that the prot protective
 
04:04:41.229 --> 04:04:41.239 align:start position:0%
order was in effect and just have
 
04:04:44.870 --> 04:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
languages says if there is no prohibitor
 
04:04:47.590 --> 04:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
the court shall uh issu an order
 
04:04:50.349 --> 04:04:50.359 align:start position:0%
returning the firearms and I understand
 
04:04:52.189 --> 04:04:52.199 align:start position:0%
that the law enforcement has some some
 
04:04:53.950 --> 04:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
issues they want someone else to make
 
04:04:56.030 --> 04:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
this decision so there's no liability on
 
04:04:57.950 --> 04:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
them so I think we could have an
 
04:04:59.670 --> 04:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
agreement with law enforcement I think
 
04:05:01.510 --> 04:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
they might agree with this approach by
 
04:05:03.710 --> 04:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
putting this on the court the one that
 
04:05:06.710 --> 04:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
made the order and the one that says NOP
 
04:05:08.830 --> 04:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
we we checked your back around and you
 
04:05:11.950 --> 04:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
get your Firearms um and and I would
 
04:05:14.670 --> 04:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
suggest that you consider making this
 
04:05:18.950 --> 04:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
bill um even better and and I kind of
 
04:05:22.550 --> 04:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
resent the uh testimony of some others
 
04:05:25.070 --> 04:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
who said whenever there's an order they
 
04:05:28.510 --> 04:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
are still presuming that that person is
 
04:05:31.269 --> 04:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
guilty and if the order isn't extended
 
04:05:33.429 --> 04:05:33.439 align:start position:0%
they are no longer guilty they are
 
04:05:35.870 --> 04:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
innocent so I would ask that you
 
04:05:38.990 --> 04:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
construct this bill um with that in mind
 
04:05:40.670 --> 04:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
maybe a few tweaks here and there be
 
04:05:43.189 --> 04:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
happy to to work with you on that I
 
04:05:46.429 --> 04:05:46.439 align:start position:0%
would also say this about the storage um
 
04:05:49.030 --> 04:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
I don't support removing the liability
 
04:05:52.149 --> 04:05:52.159 align:start position:0%
for for law enforcement from damaging
 
04:05:55.990 --> 04:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
Firearms um in this legislation Firearms
 
04:05:59.590 --> 04:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
are are not only a a defensive tool but
 
04:06:02.309 --> 04:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
they are also an asset some of us buy
 
04:06:03.950 --> 04:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
firearms because it's like putting money
 
04:06:06.870 --> 04:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
in the bank when I graduated from high
 
04:06:10.750 --> 04:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
school I bought a Colt Python paid $300
 
04:06:14.149 --> 04:06:14.159 align:start position:0%
for it that Colt Python today is worth
 
04:06:18.429 --> 04:06:18.439 align:start position:0%
$1,200 if it's in good condition so if
 
04:06:22.229 --> 04:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
you remove the liability from police of
 
04:06:25.309 --> 04:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
not keeping guns in good condition you
 
04:06:28.149 --> 04:06:28.159 align:start position:0%
not only hurt the owner but I don't if
 
04:06:30.110 --> 04:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
you remove that liability I don't think
 
04:06:33.469 --> 04:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
the police will any longer inventory
 
04:06:36.349 --> 04:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
those guns coming in and put a condition
 
04:06:38.630 --> 04:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
on those guns coming coming in it's into
 
04:06:42.229 --> 04:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
their best interest now on the way in to
 
04:06:43.990 --> 04:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
say this gun's in good shape this gun's
 
04:06:45.990 --> 04:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
in Fair shape just in a Layman's you
 
04:06:48.710 --> 04:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
know view but if you remove their
 
04:06:51.349 --> 04:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
liability for keeping these firearms in
 
04:06:54.630 --> 04:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
good condition um I don't think there's
 
04:06:56.790 --> 04:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
any incentive for them to keep them in
 
04:06:58.189 --> 04:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
good condition think you need to keep
 
04:07:00.030 --> 04:07:00.040 align:start position:0%
the incentives there so that's my two
 
04:07:01.349 --> 04:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
cents on this
 
04:07:03.830 --> 04:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you um I think you might be
 
04:07:05.469 --> 04:07:05.479 align:start position:0%
mistaken I think that Python's probably
 
04:07:08.670 --> 04:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
worth about $4,000 yeah it could be but
 
04:07:12.110 --> 04:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
it's a little used now that being said
 
04:07:14.189 --> 04:07:14.199 align:start position:0%
representative Jamber thank you Mr
 
04:07:15.389 --> 04:07:15.399 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you councelor for
 
04:07:18.189 --> 04:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question um my question is is
 
04:07:21.110 --> 04:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
a little bit semantic um if the bill
 
04:07:23.910 --> 04:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
were to call for the State Police
 
04:07:27.030 --> 04:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
gunline to have a report from the spots
 
04:07:29.349 --> 04:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
computer system two or three days before
 
04:07:32.109 --> 04:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
a DV order has expired that tells them
 
04:07:35.429 --> 04:07:35.439 align:start position:0%
to go and run this guy a a gun check and
 
04:07:37.469 --> 04:07:37.479 align:start position:0%
then notify the police department that's
 
04:07:39.990 --> 04:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
holding the firms that the DV order has
 
04:07:42.030 --> 04:07:42.040 align:start position:0%
expired he's passed a gun check give him
 
04:07:43.590 --> 04:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
his guns back do you think that would be
 
04:07:45.870 --> 04:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
workable yeah I but I think that the
 
04:07:47.510 --> 04:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
burden should be on the court to go to
 
04:07:50.030 --> 04:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
the gun line I mean obviously when
 
04:07:52.229 --> 04:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
there's a protective order in place now
 
04:07:55.070 --> 04:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
you become a pro prohibited person on
 
04:07:58.670 --> 04:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
the gun line and um so there's a
 
04:08:00.189 --> 04:08:00.199 align:start position:0%
mechanism now when you're not a
 
04:08:02.670 --> 04:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
prohibited person to get off and there
 
04:08:05.389 --> 04:08:05.399 align:start position:0%
are reports that come from the court um
 
04:08:07.950 --> 04:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
and if my recollection serves me right
 
04:08:11.229 --> 04:08:11.239 align:start position:0%
about 400 a year of of these type of
 
04:08:15.030 --> 04:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
cases um and we have the statistics
 
04:08:17.309 --> 04:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
which I don't have with me when those
 
04:08:18.950 --> 04:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
requests come to the gun line for the
 
04:08:22.229 --> 04:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
check you know the vast majority of them
 
04:08:24.910 --> 04:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
fly right through uh as an innocent
 
04:08:28.189 --> 04:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
person so um I think there is a
 
04:08:29.950 --> 04:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
mechanism you know we could think that
 
04:08:31.990 --> 04:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
through um but I think the burden should
 
04:08:34.429 --> 04:08:34.439 align:start position:0%
be on the court to ask and I think there
 
04:08:36.349 --> 04:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
should be some timelines you know on the
 
04:08:38.790 --> 04:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
court they can't drag their feet
 
04:08:40.710 --> 04:08:40.720 align:start position:0%
but also you know with my executive
 
04:08:43.469 --> 04:08:43.479 align:start position:0%
branch hat on we're wasting a lot of
 
04:08:45.790 --> 04:08:45.800 align:start position:0%
court time requiring hearings for all
 
04:08:48.349 --> 04:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
this that that shouldn't happen we're
 
04:08:50.429 --> 04:08:50.439 align:start position:0%
already short about seven Circuit Court
 
04:08:53.189 --> 04:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
judges and you know we need to see if we
 
04:08:55.349 --> 04:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
can find a way to get rid of some
 
04:08:57.790 --> 04:08:57.800 align:start position:0%
unnecessary work so that the rest of the
 
04:09:01.990 --> 04:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:04.189 --> 04:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
swiftly thank you for your testimony
 
04:09:04.199 --> 04:09:06.510 align:start position:0%
swiftly thank you for your testimony
thank

04:09:06.510 --> 04:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:23.670 --> 04:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:26.269 --> 04:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
brigh good afternoon uh for the record
 
04:09:27.870 --> 04:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
my name is Bill brigh I'm a major with
 
04:09:30.910 --> 04:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire State Police um I just
 
04:09:32.189 --> 04:09:32.199 align:start position:0%
I thank you for hearing my testimony
 
04:09:34.309 --> 04:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
this afternoon I just want to say that
 
04:09:36.830 --> 04:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
um when I signed in I signed in oppos to
 
04:09:38.910 --> 04:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
this bill with the language that it it's
 
04:09:42.710 --> 04:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
written as of now so um I think that
 
04:09:44.429 --> 04:09:44.439 align:start position:0%
this the way the bill is written now it
 
04:09:46.269 --> 04:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
shifts the burden to the victim to
 
04:09:48.389 --> 04:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
request a hearing um which I don't
 
04:09:52.030 --> 04:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily agree with um what uh
 
04:09:54.910 --> 04:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
councelor wheeler suggested in this uh
 
04:09:57.309 --> 04:09:57.319 align:start position:0%
the burden being shifted to the court uh
 
04:09:59.750 --> 04:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
to come up with some sort of way to
 
04:10:01.269 --> 04:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not they can issue
 
04:10:03.790 --> 04:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
an order to return Firearms I think is
 
04:10:05.510 --> 04:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
something that we can work with my my
 
04:10:08.229 --> 04:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
suggestion would be to um give us a
 
04:10:10.630 --> 04:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
little time to work on this bill to see
 
04:10:12.349 --> 04:10:12.359 align:start position:0%
if there's some some middle ground that
 
04:10:15.510 --> 04:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
we can come to on it um I think that the
 
04:10:17.309 --> 04:10:17.319 align:start position:0%
suggestion that everybody that has a
 
04:10:20.109 --> 04:10:20.119 align:start position:0%
protection order is in is innocent that
 
04:10:22.229 --> 04:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
may not always be the case as you know
 
04:10:23.990 --> 04:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
criminal cases have to be proven there's
 
04:10:25.910 --> 04:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
a burden of proof that have to be that
 
04:10:28.349 --> 04:10:28.359 align:start position:0%
has to be met in order to uh get a
 
04:10:30.030 --> 04:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
conviction in those cases and that
 
04:10:32.750 --> 04:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
that's not always possible even when
 
04:10:36.590 --> 04:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
there are um even when abuse has taken
 
04:10:38.990 --> 04:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
place and there may be many different
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh to come to that
 
04:10:43.990 --> 04:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
conclusion um but I think that uh from a
 
04:10:46.670 --> 04:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
law enforcement perspective um a court
 
04:10:48.870 --> 04:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
order is necessary to return these
 
04:10:50.550 --> 04:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
firearms because there has been a
 
04:10:52.790 --> 04:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
determination made by the court that
 
04:10:55.469 --> 04:10:55.479 align:start position:0%
there was a credible threat at whatever
 
04:10:58.429 --> 04:10:58.439 align:start position:0%
point that was um so to put that burden
 
04:11:00.109 --> 04:11:00.119 align:start position:0%
on law enforcement to say Hey you have
 
04:11:01.950 --> 04:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
to give these guns back just because a
 
04:11:04.590 --> 04:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
year passed I think that's a difficult
 
04:11:05.870 --> 04:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
difficult place to put law enforcement
 
04:11:09.070 --> 04:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
in um and and I just think that there
 
04:11:10.950 --> 04:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
there's probably some common ground that
 
04:11:14.469 --> 04:11:14.479 align:start position:0%
we can come to here um whether that's a
 
04:11:16.710 --> 04:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
a hearing and I know additional hearings
 
04:11:19.030 --> 04:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
can be burdensome to the court or if
 
04:11:20.950 --> 04:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
there's some some process that can be
 
04:11:23.389 --> 04:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
built here um so that there's some
 
04:11:25.670 --> 04:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
protections for victims that they
 
04:11:27.429 --> 04:11:27.439 align:start position:0%
they're not put in into a difficult
 
04:11:30.429 --> 04:11:30.439 align:start position:0%
situation uh as this process goes on as
 
04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
well as for those that are accused that
 
04:11:35.590 --> 04:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
um if they truly are innocent that
 
04:11:38.389 --> 04:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
they're not uh that they're able to get
 
04:11:41.590 --> 04:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
their rights restored completely and for
 
04:11:43.189 --> 04:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
law enforcement so that we're not put in
 
04:11:46.389 --> 04:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
that difficult situation um to to make
 
04:11:48.030 --> 04:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
that decision on our own without the
 
04:11:49.750 --> 04:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
Court's input when the court has already
 
04:11:51.870 --> 04:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
had input on this
 
04:11:55.590 --> 04:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
process thank you um to be clear though
 
04:11:57.790 --> 04:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
if if there is no order the orders have
 
04:11:59.349 --> 04:11:59.359 align:start position:0%
been allowed to expire for whatever
 
04:12:01.870 --> 04:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
reason and there's no conviction the
 
04:12:03.630 --> 04:12:03.640 align:start position:0%
state police has no position on whether
 
04:12:05.670 --> 04:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
or not the Firearms are returned it's
 
04:12:07.469 --> 04:12:07.479 align:start position:0%
the question of the burden being on the
 
04:12:10.149 --> 04:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
on the def or the the victim well the
 
04:12:13.149 --> 04:12:13.159 align:start position:0%
way the way the law is now in order for
 
04:12:14.990 --> 04:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
us to return Firearms there has to be a
 
04:12:17.950 --> 04:12:17.960 align:start position:0%
court order right so whether the the
 
04:12:19.790 --> 04:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
just because the protection order
 
04:12:21.830 --> 04:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
expires we still don't return those
 
04:12:23.710 --> 04:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
Firearms without a court order which is
 
04:12:25.830 --> 04:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
why the requirement is is on the
 
04:12:27.790 --> 04:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
defendant to request the hearing to get
 
04:12:30.510 --> 04:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
that court order okay so if there were
 
04:12:33.070 --> 04:12:33.080 align:start position:0%
an automatic mechanism that upon
 
04:12:36.109 --> 04:12:36.119 align:start position:0%
expiration of the order um the court
 
04:12:37.790 --> 04:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
were to issue an order to to return the
 
04:12:39.870 --> 04:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
Firearms would that be sufficient so I
 
04:12:41.590 --> 04:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to I don't want to commit at
 
04:12:44.670 --> 04:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
the moment but we would certainly uh
 
04:12:46.229 --> 04:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
look at the language and and help
 
04:12:49.229 --> 04:12:49.239 align:start position:0%
develop some of that language um so we
 
04:12:51.030 --> 04:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
could get it to a place where everybody
 
04:12:54.149 --> 04:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
could work with okay all right thank you
 
04:12:58.429 --> 04:12:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:01.590 --> 04:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
M isn't part of the reason why a hearing
 
04:13:04.269 --> 04:13:04.279 align:start position:0%
is is part of this process to determine
 
04:13:06.149 --> 04:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
whether or not a creditable threat
 
04:13:08.349 --> 04:13:08.359 align:start position:0%
remains that could be part of the
 
04:13:11.070 --> 04:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
process and and this is this is what I'm
 
04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
talking about maybe that still needs to
 
04:13:15.109 --> 04:13:15.119 align:start position:0%
remain part of the process I'm not sure
 
04:13:16.750 --> 04:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
I just know that there's a lot a lot at
 
04:13:19.229 --> 04:13:19.239 align:start position:0%
stake if this bill um were to go through
 
04:13:20.830 --> 04:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
the way it is right now I think it's
 
04:13:23.630 --> 04:13:23.640 align:start position:0%
worth taking a deeper look at um I also
 
04:13:25.149 --> 04:13:25.159 align:start position:0%
think that uh you know there's some
 
04:13:27.630 --> 04:13:27.640 align:start position:0%
requirements for uh the checks through
 
04:13:29.309 --> 04:13:29.319 align:start position:0%
the gun line and the criminal records
 
04:13:31.429 --> 04:13:31.439 align:start position:0%
and and things like that that should
 
04:13:34.790 --> 04:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
probably take place thank
 
04:13:37.830 --> 04:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
you represent jamon thank you Mr
 
04:13:39.349 --> 04:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you major for taking
 
04:13:41.510 --> 04:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
my question I'll try to speak up a bit
 
04:13:41.520 --> 04:13:42.830 align:start position:0%
my question I'll try to speak up a bit
here

04:13:42.830 --> 04:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:13:45.590 --> 04:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh I I had said earlier to another
 
04:13:48.910 --> 04:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
person that was testifying that if a
 
04:13:50.870 --> 04:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
person had a DV order against them and
 
04:13:53.189 --> 04:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
they Sur they surrendered their
 
04:13:56.590 --> 04:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
firearms and in during that year period
 
04:13:58.910 --> 04:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
they were convicted of a domestic
 
04:14:01.910 --> 04:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
violence criminal statute then they
 
04:14:03.870 --> 04:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
would become a prohibited person is that
 
04:14:06.590 --> 04:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
your understanding as well I believe
 
04:14:08.510 --> 04:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
that that the protection it could become
 
04:14:10.349 --> 04:14:10.359 align:start position:0%
a permanent order uh for the protection
 
04:14:13.269 --> 04:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
order and that uh there may be some some
 
04:14:15.950 --> 04:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
things established with that conviction
 
04:14:18.510 --> 04:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
that would uh prevent them from owning
 
04:14:21.109 --> 04:14:21.119 align:start position:0%
Firearms yes followup thank you Mr
 
04:14:23.429 --> 04:14:23.439 align:start position:0%
chairman and as a follow-up to that if
 
04:14:28.469 --> 04:14:28.479 align:start position:0%
there has been no conviction of the um
 
04:14:31.309 --> 04:14:31.319 align:start position:0%
criminal domestic violence which would
 
04:14:35.510 --> 04:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
trigger the lottenberg uh Amendment and
 
04:14:38.189 --> 04:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
the order has
 
04:14:41.630 --> 04:14:41.640 align:start position:0%
expired um other than liability of the
 
04:14:42.790 --> 04:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
police department that's holding the
 
04:14:46.269 --> 04:14:46.279 align:start position:0%
Farms is there I I I understand you're
 
04:14:48.070 --> 04:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
saying the court told us to take them we
 
04:14:49.590 --> 04:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
want the court to tell tell us to give
 
04:14:52.109 --> 04:14:52.119 align:start position:0%
them back is there anything on your end
 
04:14:53.790 --> 04:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
that you would get a notice that this
 
04:14:56.309 --> 04:14:56.319 align:start position:0%
this DV order is expiring do you get
 
04:14:58.910 --> 04:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
that notice at any point I actually
 
04:15:01.349 --> 04:15:01.359 align:start position:0%
don't have the answer to that um I don't
 
04:15:03.309 --> 04:15:03.319 align:start position:0%
deal with these on a regular basis but I
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
I can find that out I'm not
 
04:15:06.000 --> 04:15:10.109 align:start position:0%
I can find that out I'm not
sure

04:15:10.109 --> 04:15:10.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:13.590 --> 04:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
represent Stone thank you Mr chairman
 
04:15:15.830 --> 04:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
04:15:17.990 --> 04:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
question as I said before you probably
 
04:15:19.710 --> 04:15:19.720 align:start position:0%
heard my last
 
04:15:23.870 --> 04:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
question if we have no legal basis to
 
04:15:25.469 --> 04:15:25.479 align:start position:0%
deny somebody's right to purchase a
 
04:15:28.229 --> 04:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
firearm once the orders are expired what
 
04:15:29.830 --> 04:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
legal basis do we have to retain their
 
04:15:31.950 --> 04:15:31.960 align:start position:0%
property if it was seized other than the
 
04:15:33.870 --> 04:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
current state law which might sound very
 
04:15:35.750 --> 04:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
questionable to some of us on this
 
04:15:38.590 --> 04:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
committee what the current state law
 
04:15:41.109 --> 04:15:41.119 align:start position:0%
requires a court order to return the the
 
04:15:43.670 --> 04:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
firearms and so that's the basis of of
 
04:15:45.349 --> 04:15:45.359 align:start position:0%
my statement
 
04:15:49.349 --> 04:15:49.359 align:start position:0%
so I guess that that is the basis of us
 
04:15:51.429 --> 04:15:51.439 align:start position:0%
keeping those Firearms at that point I
 
04:15:53.109 --> 04:15:53.119 align:start position:0%
don't want to keep somebody's firearms
 
04:15:56.030 --> 04:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
that that we don't have a right to but
 
04:15:57.389 --> 04:15:57.399 align:start position:0%
in that instance the court has
 
04:15:59.389 --> 04:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
determined that we are supposed to take
 
04:16:01.269 --> 04:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
their firearms I think it's reasonable
 
04:16:02.790 --> 04:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
for the court to determine that we give
 
04:16:06.389 --> 04:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
them back if I may just clarify I think
 
04:16:09.910 --> 04:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
what we're we're all asking is if if the
 
04:16:12.950 --> 04:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
orders expired and the person is not a
 
04:16:14.950 --> 04:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
prohibited person and they can go to the
 
04:16:18.070 --> 04:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
gun shop and buy a bunch of new guns why
 
04:16:20.229 --> 04:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
make them go through the hoop of getting
 
04:16:22.710 --> 04:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
the order and all that and you see what
 
04:16:24.670 --> 04:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
I'm saying it seems it seems like it's
 
04:16:26.349 --> 04:16:26.359 align:start position:0%
why do it if they can get them anyway
 
04:16:28.389 --> 04:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
from they're not a prohibited person I
 
04:16:30.189 --> 04:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
see what you're saying now I didn't
 
04:16:32.109 --> 04:16:32.119 align:start position:0%
understand before um so I don't have a
 
04:16:35.070 --> 04:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
good answer to that question
 
04:16:36.550 --> 04:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately can I have a quick
 
04:16:38.550 --> 04:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah go ahead is it more of an
 
04:16:39.870 --> 04:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
administrative thing that there is no
 
04:16:41.389 --> 04:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
mechanism currently in place that
 
04:16:43.710 --> 04:16:43.720 align:start position:0%
notifies your agency that this person's
 
04:16:45.630 --> 04:16:45.640 align:start position:0%
now orders are expired there's nothing
 
04:16:48.149 --> 04:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
prohibiting from receiving the Firearms
 
04:16:49.710 --> 04:16:49.720 align:start position:0%
is that the paperwork concern of your
 
04:16:51.149 --> 04:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
agency is the liability aspect of
 
04:16:52.469 --> 04:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
returning someone's firearm without
 
04:16:54.510 --> 04:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
knowing what the stating in the court is
 
04:16:56.269 --> 04:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
well I I don't want to speak to whether
 
04:16:57.710 --> 04:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
there is a mechanism in place because
 
04:16:59.950 --> 04:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
I'm just not sure that there is or not
 
04:17:02.030 --> 04:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
to let us know that that court order is
 
04:17:04.710 --> 04:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
expiring um there may be I'm not 100%
 
04:17:06.109 --> 04:17:06.119 align:start position:0%
sure and there may be I'm sure that
 
04:17:07.309 --> 04:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
there's somebody in the room that
 
04:17:08.710 --> 04:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
probably knows the answer to that
 
04:17:12.309 --> 04:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
question um and your the rest of your
 
04:17:16.229 --> 04:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
question was just whether or not
 
04:17:18.710 --> 04:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
um can you ask the question again Sor
 
04:17:20.510 --> 04:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
basically I'm asking is it kind of a cya
 
04:17:21.670 --> 04:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
thing to make sure that you're giving
 
04:17:23.670 --> 04:17:23.680 align:start position:0%
the guns back legally to somebody yeah
 
04:17:26.790 --> 04:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
so before we return any firearm in any
 
04:17:29.710 --> 04:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
case I mean I think it's prudent to run
 
04:17:31.590 --> 04:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
the the necessary checks to determine
 
04:17:33.189 --> 04:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
whether or not that person can legally
 
04:17:35.469 --> 04:17:35.479 align:start position:0%
have a firearm and that's that does take
 
04:17:39.630 --> 04:17:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:42.149 --> 04:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
04:17:56.830 --> 04:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:58.910 --> 04:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
Enders good afternoon my name is Stephen
 
04:18:00.750 --> 04:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
andw I'm an assistant County attorney in
 
04:18:02.429 --> 04:18:02.439 align:start position:0%
marac County I've been a prosecutor for
 
04:18:06.790 --> 04:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
over 20 years um I I do disagree with
 
04:18:08.750 --> 04:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
some of the wording in this bill and as
 
04:18:11.990 --> 04:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
we just heard I think a court order is
 
04:18:14.189 --> 04:18:14.199 align:start position:0%
is necessary really to return Firearms
 
04:18:16.590 --> 04:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
when we talked about the process
 
04:18:19.830 --> 04:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
earlier um as many people have said you
 
04:18:22.309 --> 04:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
have to file a motion for return of
 
04:18:25.550 --> 04:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
firearms it's a one-page form that you
 
04:18:27.149 --> 04:18:27.159 align:start position:0%
fill out and I can certainly leave this
 
04:18:29.309 --> 04:18:29.319 align:start position:0%
with the committee it's a standard court
 
04:18:32.590 --> 04:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
form it's nothing uh honorous to fill
 
04:18:34.429 --> 04:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
out it's nothing that really would
 
04:18:36.550 --> 04:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
require an attorney to fill out it's my
 
04:18:37.469 --> 04:18:37.479 align:start position:0%
understand understanding that there's no
 
04:18:39.630 --> 04:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
filing fee associated with filing a
 
04:18:42.030 --> 04:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
motion per return of firearms so there's
 
04:18:46.830 --> 04:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
no cost in doing it in terms of time
 
04:18:50.469 --> 04:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
frames there is a time frame in the
 
04:18:54.070 --> 04:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
statute in RSA
 
04:19:00.510 --> 04:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
173 B5 section Roman section 10A it says
 
04:19:02.830 --> 04:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
you can file that form within 15 days of
 
04:19:04.870 --> 04:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
the expiration of the protective
 
04:19:07.349 --> 04:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
order and upon reing of such a motion
 
04:19:08.750 --> 04:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
the court shall schedule the hearing no
 
04:19:11.229 --> 04:19:11.239 align:start position:0%
later than 50
 
04:19:13.750 --> 04:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
155 days after the expiration of the
 
04:19:17.550 --> 04:19:17.560 align:start position:0%
order so this isn't a a case where you
 
04:19:19.830 --> 04:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
know this lags on for six
 
04:19:22.349 --> 04:19:22.359 align:start position:0%
months with reference
 
04:19:25.590 --> 04:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
to you know the the the term innocent I
 
04:19:29.030 --> 04:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
think that's certainly a loaded term um
 
04:19:30.670 --> 04:19:30.680 align:start position:0%
while these people may not have been
 
04:19:32.550 --> 04:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
committed of a crime there is a Judicial
 
04:19:34.670 --> 04:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
finding that they present a credible
 
04:19:37.109 --> 04:19:37.119 align:start position:0%
threat to the safety of an individual
 
04:19:38.950 --> 04:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
and I think if the court makes the
 
04:19:40.990 --> 04:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
finding that you present a credible
 
04:19:43.189 --> 04:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
threat to the safety of an individual
 
04:19:46.070 --> 04:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
and orders the police to seize your guns
 
04:19:47.870 --> 04:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
it makes sense that the court should be
 
04:19:50.590 --> 04:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
involved in returning those
 
04:19:53.870 --> 04:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
Firearms so to me it makes sense that
 
04:19:56.590 --> 04:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
you would need a court order the motion
 
04:19:59.830 --> 04:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
simply triggers the court order it it
 
04:20:02.469 --> 04:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense for and the hearing
 
04:20:04.910 --> 04:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
on that motion to return to Firearms is
 
04:20:09.910 --> 04:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
very limited in scope again under 173 B5
 
04:20:09.920 --> 04:20:10.990 align:start position:0%
very limited in scope again under 173 B5
Roman

04:20:10.990 --> 04:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
Roman
 
04:20:13.349 --> 04:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
10A there's two things which the court
 
04:20:13.359 --> 04:20:14.550 align:start position:0%
10A there's two things which the court
can

04:20:14.550 --> 04:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:20:16.550 --> 04:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
consider the first thing is whether or
 
04:20:18.030 --> 04:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
not the defendant is subject to any
 
04:20:20.790 --> 04:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
state or federal law or court order that
 
04:20:23.670 --> 04:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
prohibits them from possessing a firearm
 
04:20:25.750 --> 04:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
and the second is whether the plff has
 
04:20:28.109 --> 04:20:28.119 align:start position:0%
requested an extension of the protective
 
04:20:33.870 --> 04:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
order so having the plaintiff start the
 
04:20:36.550 --> 04:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
process to prevent the return of firearm
 
04:20:39.630 --> 04:20:39.640 align:start position:0%
arms almost makes no sense to me because
 
04:20:43.109 --> 04:20:43.119 align:start position:0%
the plff may say look I'm scared for my
 
04:20:44.990 --> 04:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
life I'm not going to renew the
 
04:20:46.670 --> 04:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
protective order but I'm very frightened
 
04:20:50.070 --> 04:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
of this individual well the plaintiff
 
04:20:51.990 --> 04:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't theoretically go to the hearing
 
04:20:53.750 --> 04:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
and say that because that's not one of
 
04:20:55.750 --> 04:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
the things the court is empowered to
 
04:20:58.269 --> 04:20:58.279 align:start position:0%
consider when returning
 
04:21:01.950 --> 04:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
firearms and I presume that the reason
 
04:21:04.510 --> 04:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
the statute reads the way it does now is
 
04:21:06.750 --> 04:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
to prevent essentially like a red flag
 
04:21:09.189 --> 04:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
law situation where it's pretty black
 
04:21:11.309 --> 04:21:11.319 align:start position:0%
and white if you're legally entitled to
 
04:21:13.750 --> 04:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
possess your Firearms the
 
04:21:16.189 --> 04:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
court returns your
 
04:21:16.199 --> 04:21:19.630 align:start position:0%
court returns your
Firearms

04:21:19.630 --> 04:21:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:21.910 --> 04:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
um with reference
 
04:21:26.030 --> 04:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
to the uh striking of the fees and the
 
04:21:27.830 --> 04:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
liability for the police
 
04:21:30.070 --> 04:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
departments really that's a policy issue
 
04:21:33.349 --> 04:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
for you guys to decide I as I said once
 
04:21:36.149 --> 04:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
before I've never heard of fees being
 
04:21:37.990 --> 04:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
being being charged again when you look
 
04:21:41.229 --> 04:21:41.239 align:start position:0%
at the fees statute the police
 
04:21:42.670 --> 04:21:42.680 align:start position:0%
department can't make money on that
 
04:21:44.469 --> 04:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
essentially they can pass fees along if
 
04:21:46.630 --> 04:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
they encounter fees and I can certainly
 
04:21:48.750 --> 04:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
Envision a scenario where a person in a
 
04:21:51.790 --> 04:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
small town um has a very large gun
 
04:21:53.429 --> 04:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
collection and the police department
 
04:21:56.109 --> 04:21:56.119 align:start position:0%
simply can't store it stores it with a
 
04:21:58.389 --> 04:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
either a storage company or has to rent
 
04:22:00.790 --> 04:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
a facility to do that and passes those
 
04:22:03.469 --> 04:22:03.479 align:start position:0%
fees along to the person and I mean
 
04:22:05.070 --> 04:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
really that's a public policy decision
 
04:22:06.790 --> 04:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
whether those fees go to that person or
 
04:22:09.309 --> 04:22:09.319 align:start position:0%
are spread among the uh the taxpayers in
 
04:22:09.319 --> 04:22:11.030 align:start position:0%
are spread among the uh the taxpayers in
the

04:22:11.030 --> 04:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:22:13.070 --> 04:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
community and it's really the same thing
 
04:22:16.309 --> 04:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
with with immunity with reference to you
 
04:22:17.670 --> 04:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
know some of the stories you hear about
 
04:22:20.030 --> 04:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
evidence officers being unavailable or
 
04:22:21.870 --> 04:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
taking time to return
 
04:22:24.229 --> 04:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
Firearms this bill doesn't address that
 
04:22:27.269 --> 04:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
and that's going to occur um you know no
 
04:22:30.109 --> 04:22:30.119 align:start position:0%
matter what happens I I've told people
 
04:22:32.870 --> 04:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
before I ended up having some of my
 
04:22:35.349 --> 04:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
property in a Police Department property
 
04:22:38.229 --> 04:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
Locker and I tried to get it back and
 
04:22:40.149 --> 04:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
I'm the guy who writes the Motions for
 
04:22:42.070 --> 04:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
the police department I'm on a firstname
 
04:22:44.189 --> 04:22:44.199 align:start position:0%
basis with everyone in the police
 
04:22:45.710 --> 04:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
department and it took me about two
 
04:22:48.109 --> 04:22:48.119 align:start position:0%
weeks to try and get an appointment to
 
04:22:49.469 --> 04:22:49.479 align:start position:0%
to get my property back because
 
04:22:51.109 --> 04:22:51.119 align:start position:0%
everyone's busy and everyone has their
 
04:22:54.830 --> 04:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
own schedules but I do think that um it
 
04:22:56.550 --> 04:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
is essential to have a court order and I
 
04:22:59.269 --> 04:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
would just note as well whenever the
 
04:23:01.389 --> 04:23:01.399 align:start position:0%
police department obtains property and
 
04:23:02.910 --> 04:23:02.920 align:start position:0%
we're not just talking about Firearms
 
04:23:04.670 --> 04:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about any property the
 
04:23:07.070 --> 04:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
police department obtains there is a
 
04:23:10.790 --> 04:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
statute under 595 A6 which sort of
 
04:23:14.389 --> 04:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
defaults that the court should request a
 
04:23:16.349 --> 04:23:16.359 align:start position:0%
that the I should say the police
 
04:23:18.229 --> 04:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
department holds the property as the
 
04:23:20.670 --> 04:23:20.680 align:start position:0%
court is directed so in order to get
 
04:23:20.680 --> 04:23:21.910 align:start position:0%
court is directed so in order to get
property

04:23:21.910 --> 04:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:23:24.389 --> 04:23:24.399 align:start position:0%
returned I would seek a court order
 
04:23:27.070 --> 04:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
almost no matter what that property is
 
04:23:29.349 --> 04:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
so I don't think it's unusual to have
 
04:23:32.229 --> 04:23:32.239 align:start position:0%
the the police you know request a court
 
04:23:35.630 --> 04:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
order with reference to sort of the
 
04:23:38.510 --> 04:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
two-part the the question of well if
 
04:23:40.349 --> 04:23:40.359 align:start position:0%
this person can go out and buy a firearm
 
04:23:41.750 --> 04:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
anyway what's the point of the police
 
04:23:43.870 --> 04:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
department not returning their guns to
 
04:23:45.590 --> 04:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
them I think there's a two-part answer
 
04:23:47.950 --> 04:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
to that the first is how does the police
 
04:23:49.510 --> 04:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
department know this person can go out
 
04:23:51.590 --> 04:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
and purchase a firearm because I don't
 
04:23:54.070 --> 04:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
think the police departments can run NX
 
04:23:56.510 --> 04:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
checks on people who come in and say I'm
 
04:23:58.070 --> 04:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
here to retrieve my
 
04:24:00.590 --> 04:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
firearms the second part of that answer
 
04:24:04.309 --> 04:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
is is liability and well you may say
 
04:24:07.630 --> 04:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
well there's no real liability there
 
04:24:09.309 --> 04:24:09.319 align:start position:0%
it's more than liability there's a
 
04:24:12.910 --> 04:24:12.920 align:start position:0%
public perception if you went if if a
 
04:24:15.269 --> 04:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
court made a finding that a person
 
04:24:16.750 --> 04:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
presented a credible threat to the
 
04:24:19.030 --> 04:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
safety of another so much so that the
 
04:24:20.750 --> 04:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
court ordered that they relinquish their
 
04:24:23.750 --> 04:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
firearms to say the conquered police
 
04:24:25.790 --> 04:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
department and that person then went to
 
04:24:27.070 --> 04:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
the conquered police department at the
 
04:24:29.189 --> 04:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
expiration in that order picked up their
 
04:24:32.870 --> 04:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
gun and went and used that gun to kill
 
04:24:32.880 --> 04:24:33.830 align:start position:0%
gun and went and used that gun to kill
their

04:24:33.830 --> 04:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:24:36.389 --> 04:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
victim I guarantee that it's going to be
 
04:24:38.710 --> 04:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
all over not only the local news but the
 
04:24:42.510 --> 04:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
national news that that person received
 
04:24:44.269 --> 04:24:44.279 align:start position:0%
the gun from the conquered police
 
04:24:46.229 --> 04:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
department and whether the conquered
 
04:24:47.710 --> 04:24:47.720 align:start position:0%
Police Department had a legal obligation
 
04:24:50.349 --> 04:24:50.359 align:start position:0%
to return the gun or not nobody wants
 
04:24:52.590 --> 04:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
that exposure nobody wants to be on the
 
04:24:54.149 --> 04:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
news for that
 
04:24:56.790 --> 04:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
so we are always going to default to
 
04:24:59.109 --> 04:24:59.119 align:start position:0%
wanting a court order I'm happy to
 
04:25:01.910 --> 04:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:05.309 --> 04:25:05.319 align:start position:0%
questions I I understand the the concern
 
04:25:06.990 --> 04:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me that it could be much
 
04:25:07.000 --> 04:25:07.870 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me that it could be much
more

04:25:07.870 --> 04:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:25:10.349 --> 04:25:10.359 align:start position:0%
streamlined if someone gets a temporary
 
04:25:13.790 --> 04:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
order um based on allegations they make
 
04:25:16.229 --> 04:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
we know that sometimes they don't follow
 
04:25:17.510 --> 04:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
through and that order is allowed to
 
04:25:19.229 --> 04:25:19.239 align:start position:0%
expire they just never come back for the
 
04:25:21.710 --> 04:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
following hearing yeah so the the person
 
04:25:24.389 --> 04:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
now has to incur the expense of going
 
04:25:25.950 --> 04:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
through another hearing to get the
 
04:25:28.030 --> 04:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
Firearms back that were taken that the
 
04:25:29.670 --> 04:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
person never came through and followed
 
04:25:30.830 --> 04:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
through with the order in the first
 
04:25:33.189 --> 04:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
place it seems that it in the interest
 
04:25:36.109 --> 04:25:36.119 align:start position:0%
of Justice it someone shouldn't have to
 
04:25:37.630 --> 04:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
to go get their property back and pay
 
04:25:39.429 --> 04:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
that kind of money if it could be more
 
04:25:42.349 --> 04:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
streamlined um to it seems that to me if
 
04:25:43.710 --> 04:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
it's not carried through and it's not
 
04:25:47.269 --> 04:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
followed through on well again in order
 
04:25:50.269 --> 04:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
to obtain a temporary order the plain if
 
04:25:52.550 --> 04:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
needs to make a showing as well that
 
04:25:54.590 --> 04:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
there is and it's actually in my opinion
 
04:25:56.670 --> 04:25:56.680 align:start position:0%
a higher showing than a permanent order
 
04:25:58.429 --> 04:25:58.439 align:start position:0%
which again makes sense because it's
 
04:26:00.750 --> 04:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
granted on an xart day basis so the
 
04:26:02.750 --> 04:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
plain if does have to make a showing of
 
04:26:07.590 --> 04:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
abuse and um essentially
 
04:26:11.910 --> 04:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
some some threat that uh they they
 
04:26:11.920 --> 04:26:13.070 align:start position:0%
some some threat that uh they they
needed

04:26:13.070 --> 04:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
needed
 
04:26:16.389 --> 04:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
immediately um so there is a finding
 
04:26:20.189 --> 04:26:20.199 align:start position:0%
made with reference to whether or not
 
04:26:21.910 --> 04:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
that person follows
 
04:26:24.429 --> 04:26:24.439 align:start position:0%
through one of the things I can say is
 
04:26:27.590 --> 04:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
that domestic violence is unlike any
 
04:26:30.990 --> 04:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
other crime it's and it's very
 
04:26:32.830 --> 04:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
frustrating as a prosecutor doing
 
04:26:34.790 --> 04:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
domestic violence cases because I think
 
04:26:36.429 --> 04:26:36.439 align:start position:0%
the national district attorneys
 
04:26:39.550 --> 04:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
Association talks about 80% of victims
 
04:26:41.630 --> 04:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
recanting and certainly that doesn't
 
04:26:43.630 --> 04:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
mean it didn't happen it's that
 
04:26:45.469 --> 04:26:45.479 align:start position:0%
victims's goals in domestic violence
 
04:26:45.479 --> 04:26:48.149 align:start position:0%
victims's goals in domestic violence
cases

04:26:48.149 --> 04:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
cases
 
04:26:50.870 --> 04:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
vary very differently than the normal
 
04:26:53.269 --> 04:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
sort of crime victim if someone breaks
 
04:26:55.550 --> 04:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
into your house you may want that person
 
04:26:57.149 --> 04:26:57.159 align:start position:0%
punished you may want that person to go
 
04:26:59.269 --> 04:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
to jail but with domestic violence
 
04:27:00.710 --> 04:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a person who's an
 
04:27:04.189 --> 04:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
intimate partner so most victims want
 
04:27:07.189 --> 04:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
the abuse to stop and that's their main
 
04:27:11.109 --> 04:27:11.119 align:start position:0%
goal and they may get a temporary order
 
04:27:14.790 --> 04:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
and feel that the abuse has stopped and
 
04:27:17.389 --> 04:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
there may be factors weighing in on them
 
04:27:19.630 --> 04:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
to not get a permanent order and it's
 
04:27:22.670 --> 04:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
not that it didn't happen it's that they
 
04:27:24.349 --> 04:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
think that's the safest thing for them
 
04:27:26.469 --> 04:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
to do at that point is not follow
 
04:27:29.950 --> 04:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
through um so I don't think you should
 
04:27:32.830 --> 04:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
read too far into a temporary order
 
04:27:35.630 --> 04:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
being issued but then a victim perhaps
 
04:27:37.429 --> 04:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
not following through with the process I
 
04:27:39.109 --> 04:27:39.119 align:start position:0%
don't think that means that they're not
 
04:27:41.830 --> 04:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
in in danger I don't think that means
 
04:27:43.469 --> 04:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
that Firearms shouldn't have been seized
 
04:27:45.830 --> 04:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
to begin with no I'm not saying they
 
04:27:47.030 --> 04:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have been seized I'm just
 
04:27:48.429 --> 04:27:48.439 align:start position:0%
curious as to whether or not you think
 
04:27:50.990 --> 04:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
there's a way to streamline it so that
 
04:27:52.950 --> 04:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
in the cases where the person could in
 
04:27:55.429 --> 04:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
fact go buy more firearms that they
 
04:27:57.189 --> 04:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay extra to go back and
 
04:27:59.070 --> 04:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
to court again to get their property
 
04:28:00.670 --> 04:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
back well and I think representative
 
04:28:04.149 --> 04:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
Wheeler's suggestion um essentially that
 
04:28:04.159 --> 04:28:04.830 align:start position:0%
Wheeler's suggestion um essentially that
the

04:28:04.830 --> 04:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:28:07.750 --> 04:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
court begin these
 
04:28:10.550 --> 04:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
supon is is a possibility to streamline
 
04:28:13.030 --> 04:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
that right now as I was saying you have
 
04:28:15.189 --> 04:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
to file a motion to trigger the process
 
04:28:17.229 --> 04:28:17.239 align:start position:0%
you could certainly have upon the
 
04:28:19.269 --> 04:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
expiration of the protective order the
 
04:28:21.830 --> 04:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
court triggers the process on its own
 
04:28:24.910 --> 04:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
but I think that's a a a sizable burden
 
04:28:31.030 --> 04:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:34.349 --> 04:28:34.359 align:start position:0%
court um represent Pratt hold on we have
 
04:28:40.149 --> 04:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:40.159 --> 04:28:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
I'm

04:28:41.750 --> 04:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
04:28:46.750 --> 04:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:51.149 --> 04:28:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:54.389 --> 04:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
Rel yeah thanks for the question uh when
 
04:28:56.389 --> 04:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
you go when a uh an honest person goes
 
04:28:59.229 --> 04:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
to court to release their property back
 
04:29:01.229 --> 04:29:01.239 align:start position:0%
after they've been not charged nothing
 
04:29:03.990 --> 04:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
holding against them uh you recommend a
 
04:29:06.389 --> 04:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
one-page form you recommend going to
 
04:29:08.070 --> 04:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
court without a
 
04:29:10.750 --> 04:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
lawyer I'm saying that the court has
 
04:29:14.870 --> 04:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
created a onepage fill-in-the blank form
 
04:29:16.750 --> 04:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
to streamline the process and make it
 
04:29:18.590 --> 04:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
easier for people so you just fill that
 
04:29:20.630 --> 04:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
out you don't have to go to court you
 
04:29:22.149 --> 04:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
would fill this out file it with the
 
04:29:23.389 --> 04:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
court and the court would give you a
 
04:29:25.550 --> 04:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
hearing notice and then you'd show up at
 
04:29:28.070 --> 04:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
the hearing and again there'd be two
 
04:29:30.269 --> 04:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
things considered at the hearing the
 
04:29:31.630 --> 04:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
first would be whether or not you're a
 
04:29:34.109 --> 04:29:34.119 align:start position:0%
prohibited person which you could stand
 
04:29:36.950 --> 04:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
there quietly and gunline is the one
 
04:29:38.990 --> 04:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
that would have to say you're not a
 
04:29:39.000 --> 04:29:40.109 align:start position:0%
that would have to say you're not a
prohibited

04:29:40.109 --> 04:29:40.119 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
04:29:42.630 --> 04:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
person um and whether or not the orders
 
04:29:44.870 --> 04:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
being uh
 
04:29:47.590 --> 04:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
extended okay I'm only aware of three
 
04:29:49.670 --> 04:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
cases of this happening and uh every one
 
04:29:51.950 --> 04:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
of them was multiple months multiple
 
04:29:54.550 --> 04:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
dollars multiple legal fees more money
 
04:29:55.830 --> 04:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
than the guns were worth in three
 
04:29:57.750 --> 04:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
different cases that's problem I think
 
04:29:59.030 --> 04:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's just of what we're talking about
 
04:30:00.990 --> 04:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
today you also mentioned a police
 
04:30:03.389 --> 04:30:03.399 align:start position:0%
department couldn't run the ncks check
 
04:30:04.830 --> 04:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
why couldn't they before they released
 
04:30:06.950 --> 04:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
the guns run Nick check I they're
 
04:30:08.750 --> 04:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
prohibited by law from doing so really
 
04:30:10.070 --> 04:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
they do it every day I was wondering why
 
04:30:11.950 --> 04:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
they couldn't do it for that they can
 
04:30:13.429 --> 04:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
run a criminal record check every day
 
04:30:16.429 --> 04:30:16.439 align:start position:0%
but to run a a firearm specific the FBI
 
04:30:18.870 --> 04:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't let them do that all right thank
 
04:30:21.990 --> 04:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
you representative stong thank you thank
 
04:30:23.070 --> 04:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
04:30:26.429 --> 04:30:26.439 align:start position:0%
question would it be satisfactory if uh
 
04:30:29.229 --> 04:30:29.239 align:start position:0%
like at a final hearing if the petition
 
04:30:32.309 --> 04:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
was dropped or found not uh sustained
 
04:30:33.670 --> 04:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
that there could be a simple box on the
 
04:30:35.870 --> 04:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
form that could AOC or judicial Branch
 
04:30:38.790 --> 04:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
could Implement to facilitate Firearms
 
04:30:40.550 --> 04:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
being returned since all parties are at
 
04:30:42.550 --> 04:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
that hearing or at least if the other
 
04:30:44.109 --> 04:30:44.119 align:start position:0%
party didn't show at least some of you
 
04:30:45.790 --> 04:30:45.800 align:start position:0%
appeared before the judge would that
 
04:30:48.109 --> 04:30:48.119 align:start position:0%
satisfy the requirement in your mind for
 
04:30:50.429 --> 04:30:50.439 align:start position:0%
at least though that portion of it I
 
04:30:52.950 --> 04:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
think that there's sort of two parts to
 
04:30:54.990 --> 04:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
that I think that you could check a box
 
04:30:57.830 --> 04:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
to initiate the hearing but I still
 
04:31:00.070 --> 04:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
think there should be a nck check prior
 
04:31:03.229 --> 04:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
to returning the Firearms so I think
 
04:31:05.790 --> 04:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
that those two considerations that are
 
04:31:08.910 --> 04:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
currently in 173
 
04:31:13.189 --> 04:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
B5 10A 1 and two the court should still
 
04:31:16.030 --> 04:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
make those findings prior to issuing the
 
04:31:17.550 --> 04:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
order to return
 
04:31:21.030 --> 04:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
Firearms follow up so again it sounds to
 
04:31:24.590 --> 04:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
me like the real issue is deferring the
 
04:31:26.830 --> 04:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
liability onto the court from the agency
 
04:31:27.710 --> 04:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:31:30.790 --> 04:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
correct I think having a court order
 
04:31:33.309 --> 04:31:33.319 align:start position:0%
again is appropriate what triggers that
 
04:31:36.189 --> 04:31:36.199 align:start position:0%
court order I don't know that I care but
 
04:31:38.149 --> 04:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
I don't think it should be on the victim
 
04:31:40.830 --> 04:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
to or the agency to return the Firearms
 
04:31:43.229 --> 04:31:43.239 align:start position:0%
right safe answer thank you thank you
 
04:31:43.239 --> 04:31:44.830 align:start position:0%
right safe answer thank you thank you
repr

04:31:44.830 --> 04:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
repr
 
04:31:49.189 --> 04:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
scitech I have a question and a half um
 
04:31:51.269 --> 04:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
I have an answer in a
 
04:31:55.630 --> 04:31:55.640 align:start position:0%
quarter typical lawyer
 
04:31:59.510 --> 04:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
now first part is this there's something
 
04:32:01.429 --> 04:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
a little slippery in what you had said
 
04:32:04.229 --> 04:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
earlier I'm not sure if it you you
 
04:32:06.710 --> 04:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
buffed it out later but it sounded like
 
04:32:11.269 --> 04:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
this I forget the context but it was um
 
04:32:13.229 --> 04:32:13.239 align:start position:0%
but she's still
 
04:32:15.630 --> 04:32:15.640 align:start position:0%
scared but she's not going to renew the
 
04:32:18.990 --> 04:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
order now wait a minute if you if you
 
04:32:20.990 --> 04:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
had the gumption to get the order in the
 
04:32:24.990 --> 04:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
first place why isn't this order
 
04:32:27.990 --> 04:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
continued it would seem that if the
 
04:32:30.670 --> 04:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
facts circumstances have not materially
 
04:32:33.550 --> 04:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
changed the it's would be an automatic
 
04:32:35.710 --> 04:32:35.720 align:start position:0%
extension I want to talk about that that
 
04:32:37.830 --> 04:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
particular part of what you said the
 
04:32:39.950 --> 04:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
other thing is this and this the half
 
04:32:41.790 --> 04:32:41.800 align:start position:0%
question because others have asked it
 
04:32:43.670 --> 04:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
sounds to me that with a little bit of
 
04:32:45.670 --> 04:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
Education you can do this
 
04:32:49.269 --> 04:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
prosay if you're clean when it's uh
 
04:32:53.149 --> 04:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
after the EXP expiration of the uh
 
04:32:57.030 --> 04:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
order protective order there my I I'm
 
04:32:58.710 --> 04:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
happy to answer your half question first
 
04:33:01.870 --> 04:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
which I I think you can do it prosay um
 
04:33:04.429 --> 04:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
again it's a pre-printed form that you
 
04:33:07.150 --> 04:33:07.160 align:start position:0%
fill out you file it there's no fee you
 
04:33:09.470 --> 04:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
go to the hearing there's two things to
 
04:33:11.349 --> 04:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
be considered at the hearing I'm sure
 
04:33:12.750 --> 04:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
you can find lawyers that are willing to
 
04:33:15.990 --> 04:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
take your money to to do that just like
 
04:33:17.070 --> 04:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
you know you can find lawyers to
 
04:33:19.910 --> 04:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
represent you for a speeding ticket um
 
04:33:21.709 --> 04:33:21.719 align:start position:0%
with reference to your first question
 
04:33:24.189 --> 04:33:24.199 align:start position:0%
about why a person who is in fear for
 
04:33:27.349 --> 04:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
their safety not renew a protective
 
04:33:30.269 --> 04:33:30.279 align:start position:0%
order again my experience has been that
 
04:33:32.789 --> 04:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
domestic violence is a very complex
 
04:33:36.510 --> 04:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
thing and I've seen
 
04:33:39.310 --> 04:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
victims act in ways that wouldn't
 
04:33:42.269 --> 04:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily make sense to you or I but
 
04:33:45.551 --> 04:33:45.561 align:start position:0%
certainly make sense to them in in the
 
04:33:48.629 --> 04:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
circumstances um so I I do think you
 
04:33:52.070 --> 04:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
have people who choose not to continue
 
04:33:59.789 --> 04:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:01.869 --> 04:34:01.879 align:start position:0%
secure thank you for your testimony
 
04:34:03.390 --> 04:34:03.400 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'll leave that form with
 
04:34:05.949 --> 04:34:05.959 align:start position:0%

04:50:45.590 --> 04:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative Terry Roy I represent

Rockingham District 32 and I'm here to
 
04:50:50.230 --> 04:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill
 
04:50:54.350 --> 04:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
1711 1711 um it the reason I brought
 
04:50:57.150 --> 04:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
1711 in the first place as many of you
 
04:50:59.670 --> 04:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
are aware there was a tragic uh killing
 
04:51:01.430 --> 04:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
of a former police chief at the New
 
04:51:04.670 --> 04:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital last year it came to
 
04:51:07.390 --> 04:51:07.400 align:start position:0%
our attention that the person
 
04:51:09.670 --> 04:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
responsible for that shooting had been a
 
04:51:12.150 --> 04:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
previous patient of the hospital and had
 
04:51:14.750 --> 04:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
had Firearms taken from them in the past
 
04:51:16.948 --> 04:51:16.958 align:start position:0%
because of their mental illness they
 
04:51:19.430 --> 04:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
should have never had Firearms after
 
04:51:22.990 --> 04:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
that um we have there's a federal law
 
04:51:25.430 --> 04:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
that says that if you have ever been uh
 
04:51:28.390 --> 04:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
involuntarily commit committed or um
 
04:51:30.030 --> 04:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
determined to be a mental defective
 
04:51:32.708 --> 04:51:32.718 align:start position:0%
which is an ancient term in other words
 
04:51:34.990 --> 04:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
mentally ill and dangerous you are
 
04:51:37.750 --> 04:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
prohibited person from having firearms
 
04:51:40.670 --> 04:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we have up until
 
04:51:44.590 --> 04:51:44.600 align:start position:0%
2016 there was never a law that required
 
04:51:48.230 --> 04:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
reporting of people who have been found
 
04:51:51.110 --> 04:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
um or who have been involuntarily
 
04:51:53.310 --> 04:51:53.320 align:start position:0%
committed because they were dangerous
 
04:51:55.670 --> 04:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
reporting it to nxs to the FBI so that
 
04:51:59.110 --> 04:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
they would be added to the list in 2016
 
04:52:00.868 --> 04:52:00.878 align:start position:0%
uh representative J.R Hull from the New
 
04:52:03.150 --> 04:52:03.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Firearms Coalition put a bill
 
04:52:05.590 --> 04:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
in that said that no one could be
 
04:52:08.590 --> 04:52:08.600 align:start position:0%
reported for being involuntarily
 
04:52:11.070 --> 04:52:11.080 align:start position:0%
committed unless they had been first
 
04:52:13.030 --> 04:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
deemed by a court to be dangerous and
 
04:52:15.310 --> 04:52:15.320 align:start position:0%
there was a court order well that was
 
04:52:17.948 --> 04:52:17.958 align:start position:0%
already law that you had to go before a
 
04:52:20.708 --> 04:52:20.718 align:start position:0%
judge to be involuntary committed the
 
04:52:23.110 --> 04:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
process to be involuntary committed
 
04:52:25.470 --> 04:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
requires that you get an attorney if you
 
04:52:27.510 --> 04:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
can't afford one one's given to you you
 
04:52:29.868 --> 04:52:29.878 align:start position:0%
are allowed to cross-examine Witnesses
 
04:52:32.110 --> 04:52:32.120 align:start position:0%
you are given Fue process before you are
 
04:52:34.750 --> 04:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
involuntarily committed
 
04:52:36.990 --> 04:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
if after that it's found that you are a
 
04:52:38.910 --> 04:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
danger to yourself or others the court
 
04:52:42.030 --> 04:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
will commit you involuntarily at that
 
04:52:44.510 --> 04:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
point you are a prohibited person so
 
04:52:46.190 --> 04:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
before um representative Hall put that
 
04:52:47.868 --> 04:52:47.878 align:start position:0%
bill in in 2016 we didn't have anything
 
04:52:50.110 --> 04:52:50.120 align:start position:0%
that mentioned involuntary commitment
 
04:52:52.548 --> 04:52:52.558 align:start position:0%
and nicks together at that point the
 
04:52:54.830 --> 04:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
Attorney General attempted to start
 
04:52:56.750 --> 04:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
putting people on that list reporting
 
04:52:58.868 --> 04:52:58.878 align:start position:0%
people unfortunately the Hampshire
 
04:53:00.470 --> 04:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court found there was a conflict
 
04:53:02.310 --> 04:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
in the laws where the involuntary
 
04:53:04.750 --> 04:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
commitment statute um had
 
04:53:06.750 --> 04:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
confidentiality in it that wouldn't
 
04:53:08.868 --> 04:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
allow the two laws conflicted and they
 
04:53:09.868 --> 04:53:09.878 align:start position:0%
said it was
 
04:53:13.190 --> 04:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
unclear this law clarifies that what
 
04:53:16.430 --> 04:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
this law does is it makes it so that if
 
04:53:18.670 --> 04:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
you are involuntarily committed and
 
04:53:19.990 --> 04:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
found dangerous because you can be
 
04:53:22.990 --> 04:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
involuntary committed for other reasons
 
04:53:24.628 --> 04:53:24.638 align:start position:0%
um besides being dangerous but if you're
 
04:53:24.638 --> 04:53:25.548 align:start position:0%
um besides being dangerous but if you're
found

04:53:25.548 --> 04:53:25.558 align:start position:0%
found
 
04:53:28.310 --> 04:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
dangerous you are going to have your
 
04:53:30.708 --> 04:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
name put on that list now what's
 
04:53:32.590 --> 04:53:32.600 align:start position:0%
important to understand is also in New
 
04:53:34.948 --> 04:53:34.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire prior to this if you're on
 
04:53:37.190 --> 04:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
that list for a mental health reason
 
04:53:40.190 --> 04:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
there's no way for you to get off ever
 
04:53:41.990 --> 04:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
right now there's hundreds if not
 
04:53:44.270 --> 04:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
thousands of citizens in New Hampshire
 
04:53:47.070 --> 04:53:47.080 align:start position:0%
who cannot buy firearms because either
 
04:53:49.788 --> 04:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
their doctor has reported them because
 
04:53:52.070 --> 04:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
04:53:56.230 --> 04:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
332 I colon 2 a doctor can report you to
 
04:53:58.310 --> 04:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety if you are
 
04:54:00.110 --> 04:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
speaking to your doctor and your doctor
 
04:54:01.750 --> 04:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
says you say to your doctor I'm thinking
 
04:54:04.190 --> 04:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
about killing someone or myself they can
 
04:54:05.910 --> 04:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
report you and you'll end up on that
 
04:54:09.030 --> 04:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
list and there's no way to get off the
 
04:54:11.590 --> 04:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
ATF will not take anyone's name off of
 
04:54:15.230 --> 04:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
that list unless the state has a law in
 
04:54:18.910 --> 04:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
place that establishes how someone can
 
04:54:20.910 --> 04:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
get their rights restored New Hampshire
 
04:54:24.070 --> 04:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
has no such l no such program so anyone
 
04:54:25.390 --> 04:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
who's a citizen of New Hampshire who
 
04:54:27.788 --> 04:54:27.798 align:start position:0%
ends up on that list is there for life
 
04:54:28.948 --> 04:54:28.958 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not their
 
04:54:30.868 --> 04:54:30.878 align:start position:0%
mental health gets better so you could
 
04:54:32.788 --> 04:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
be a college student and go through a
 
04:54:36.590 --> 04:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
rough time you could uh lose a child and
 
04:54:38.470 --> 04:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
you become despondent Anything could
 
04:54:39.990 --> 04:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
happen and you have a rough period in
 
04:54:43.750 --> 04:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
your life where you are endangered to
 
04:54:45.230 --> 04:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
yourself for a short period of time and
 
04:54:47.230 --> 04:54:47.240 align:start position:0%
you do need mental health and you end up
 
04:54:49.990 --> 04:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
on that list you will be there for the
 
04:54:51.948 --> 04:54:51.958 align:start position:0%
rest of your life if this law or
 
04:54:54.190 --> 04:54:54.200 align:start position:0%
something like it does not pass because
 
04:54:55.990 --> 04:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
there's no restoration process in New
 
04:54:58.390 --> 04:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so what this law does it does
 
04:55:00.990 --> 04:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
two things it fixes the Gap that was
 
04:55:04.230 --> 04:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
created after um after representative
 
04:55:06.948 --> 04:55:06.958 align:start position:0%
H's bill came in and said okay we'll
 
04:55:09.548 --> 04:55:09.558 align:start position:0%
report to the Nicks and the court said
 
04:55:11.510 --> 04:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
no you can't because of the confidential
 
04:55:14.030 --> 04:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
now if this law passes people who are
 
04:55:16.270 --> 04:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
involuntary committed their name will be
 
04:55:18.788 --> 04:55:18.798 align:start position:0%
submitted to ni
 
04:55:22.548 --> 04:55:22.558 align:start position:0%
and eventually if they get better they
 
04:55:25.190 --> 04:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
can get their name off that list so it
 
04:55:27.470 --> 04:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
does two things it it it fixes that hole
 
04:55:29.548 --> 04:55:29.558 align:start position:0%
that was created and it also gives
 
04:55:33.030 --> 04:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
people a way to get their rights back um
 
04:55:35.070 --> 04:55:35.080 align:start position:0%
and it's it's incredibly complex I want
 
04:55:37.590 --> 04:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
you to know that we we spoke to everyone
 
04:55:38.910 --> 04:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
we spoke to the mental health
 
04:55:41.350 --> 04:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
professionals we spoke to the Attorney
 
04:55:42.990 --> 04:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
General's office who worked with us on
 
04:55:45.548 --> 04:55:45.558 align:start position:0%
this we we went to um representatives of
 
04:55:48.110 --> 04:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
the Court um any possible stakeholder
 
04:55:50.548 --> 04:55:50.558 align:start position:0%
you can think of that I didn't talk to
 
04:55:52.670 --> 04:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
I'd be shocked we talked to everyone um
 
04:55:53.990 --> 04:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
and many of them here in the audience
 
04:55:56.830 --> 04:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
today um if if their testimony is
 
04:55:59.070 --> 04:55:59.080 align:start position:0%
necessary so with that I'm happy to take
 
04:55:59.080 --> 04:56:01.750 align:start position:0%
necessary so with that I'm happy to take
any

04:56:01.750 --> 04:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:05.070 --> 04:56:05.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:56:07.830 --> 04:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
Muse thank you for taking my question
 
04:56:10.548 --> 04:56:10.558 align:start position:0%
and thank you for partnering on the
 
04:56:13.868 --> 04:56:13.878 align:start position:0%
bill um can you can you briefly run us
 
04:56:16.548 --> 04:56:16.558 align:start position:0%
through the process for uh Firearms
 
04:56:20.868 --> 04:56:20.878 align:start position:0%
restoration under the bill I can try um
 
04:56:24.990 --> 04:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
so the ETF actually has a a form that
 
04:56:27.110 --> 04:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
needs to that has a list of things that
 
04:56:28.548 --> 04:56:28.558 align:start position:0%
have to happen for you to get your
 
04:56:31.390 --> 04:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
rights restored one of them is that you
 
04:56:35.030 --> 04:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
have to get a a a judge to say that you
 
04:56:37.670 --> 04:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
are no longer a danger um an independent
 
04:56:37.680 --> 04:56:38.708 align:start position:0%
are no longer a danger um an independent
medical

04:56:38.708 --> 04:56:38.718 align:start position:0%
medical
 
04:56:43.470 --> 04:56:43.480 align:start position:0%
evaluation um as part of that it has to
 
04:56:46.548 --> 04:56:46.558 align:start position:0%
it has to um be entered into the system
 
04:56:47.750 --> 04:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to think of what else was
 
04:56:49.430 --> 04:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
on that
 
04:56:49.440 --> 04:56:52.390 align:start position:0%
on that
list

04:56:52.390 --> 04:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
list
 
04:56:54.868 --> 04:56:54.878 align:start position:0%
um you have to you have to get the
 
04:56:56.590 --> 04:56:56.600 align:start position:0%
independent medical evaluation the judge
 
04:56:58.070 --> 04:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
has to say that you're no longer a
 
04:57:00.830 --> 04:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
danger and I believe if I'm missing
 
04:57:02.110 --> 04:57:02.120 align:start position:0%
something else you have to help me out
 
04:57:03.708 --> 04:57:03.718 align:start position:0%
but there there's a specific spefic list
 
04:57:05.548 --> 04:57:05.558 align:start position:0%
of things at the ATF and what's
 
04:57:07.990 --> 04:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
important to not in this bill is that I
 
04:57:10.750 --> 04:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
put a mechanism in it that if the ATF
 
04:57:12.430 --> 04:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
the ATF first has to approve our
 
04:57:14.670 --> 04:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
restoration process so the bill
 
04:57:18.548 --> 04:57:18.558 align:start position:0%
specifically says if the ATF doesn't
 
04:57:21.070 --> 04:57:21.080 align:start position:0%
first approve the restoration process no
 
04:57:24.310 --> 04:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
one no one's name goes on the list so
 
04:57:25.590 --> 04:57:25.600 align:start position:0%
we're we're not putting the cart before
 
04:57:27.510 --> 04:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
the horse if no one can get off the list
 
04:57:30.390 --> 04:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
no one goes on the list so the first
 
04:57:31.910 --> 04:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
obligation is going to be on the
 
04:57:33.708 --> 04:57:33.718 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office to get that
 
04:57:36.390 --> 04:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
process approved by the ATF once they
 
04:57:38.310 --> 04:57:38.320 align:start position:0%
say your process to get people's rights
 
04:57:41.270 --> 04:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
restored is okay then people's names can
 
04:57:44.390 --> 04:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
start being reported first that has to
 
04:57:47.230 --> 04:57:47.240 align:start position:0%
happen and um I apologize if I missed
 
04:57:50.948 --> 04:57:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:54.230 --> 04:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
several followup I I think the point was
 
04:57:56.430 --> 04:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
just to have people hear that there
 
04:57:59.910 --> 04:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
there is a process um and that one of
 
04:58:01.910 --> 04:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
the one of the things that this does
 
04:58:03.868 --> 04:58:03.878 align:start position:0%
open the door to is new sure actually
 
04:58:05.510 --> 04:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
being able to get funds from the federal
 
04:58:07.750 --> 04:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
government because we do have things
 
04:58:10.708 --> 04:58:10.718 align:start position:0%
like the relief from disability process
 
04:58:12.590 --> 04:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's true the the federal
 
04:58:15.310 --> 04:58:15.320 align:start position:0%
government up to right as far as um
 
04:58:17.590 --> 04:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
reporting goes the federal government
 
04:58:20.750 --> 04:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
makes funds available to states to help
 
04:58:23.910 --> 04:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
with their Nick system if they report
 
04:58:25.548 --> 04:58:25.558 align:start position:0%
people according to the federal
 
04:58:27.350 --> 04:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
government's wishes well we haven't been
 
04:58:29.110 --> 04:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
reporting people so we haven't had the
 
04:58:30.788 --> 04:58:30.798 align:start position:0%
ability to get those funds to help with
 
04:58:33.868 --> 04:58:33.878 align:start position:0%
our Nick system by reporting and having
 
04:58:35.868 --> 04:58:35.878 align:start position:0%
the way for people to get off that makes
 
04:58:37.510 --> 04:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
us now eligible to get funds from the
 
04:58:39.830 --> 04:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
federal government to help pay for our
 
04:58:41.868 --> 04:58:41.878 align:start position:0%
system so that's also a key important
 
04:58:43.548 --> 04:58:43.558 align:start position:0%
part not the driving one but it's a side
 
04:58:45.548 --> 04:58:45.558 align:start position:0%
bonus that we will be able to get those
 
04:58:49.990 --> 04:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:52.628 --> 04:58:52.638 align:start position:0%
now any further
 
04:58:54.548 --> 04:58:54.558 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much chairman
 
04:59:01.708 --> 04:59:01.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:11.910 --> 04:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:13.868 --> 04:59:13.878 align:start position:0%
Hannon good good afternoon members of
 
04:59:15.868 --> 04:59:15.878 align:start position:0%
the committee allow me to correct myself
 
04:59:19.350 --> 04:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
honorable Dr Hannon don't it's okay
 
04:59:22.390 --> 04:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
Joe's fine thanks um I'm here uh
 
04:59:23.670 --> 04:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of governors of New
 
04:59:26.070 --> 04:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh we're in opposition to
 
04:59:28.430 --> 04:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh this bill as written um there's a few
 
04:59:31.948 --> 04:59:31.958 align:start position:0%
reasons um I I understand the intent and
 
04:59:34.750 --> 04:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
um naming the the bill it's it's I
 
04:59:37.510 --> 04:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
understand this this man was a hero uh
 
04:59:39.230 --> 04:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
nothing against him I think he was uh
 
04:59:41.070 --> 04:59:41.080 align:start position:0%
doing an amazing job in horrible
 
04:59:42.750 --> 04:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
circumstance uh he was an unarmed
 
04:59:44.868 --> 04:59:44.878 align:start position:0%
individual whose job was to stop
 
04:59:46.628 --> 04:59:46.638 align:start position:0%
potentially armed people from entering a
 
04:59:48.708 --> 04:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
secure facility I think that's one of
 
04:59:50.390 --> 04:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
the the most important aspects we have
 
04:59:52.590 --> 04:59:52.600 align:start position:0%
to look at uh when looking at this
 
04:59:55.708 --> 04:59:55.718 align:start position:0%
specific incidents um we have too many
 
04:59:57.150 --> 04:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
dead heroes and I think we need to do
 
04:59:58.670 --> 04:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
things that prevent that from happening
 
04:59:59.948 --> 04:59:59.958 align:start position:0%
people should be allowed to defend
 
05:00:01.830 --> 05:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
themselves if they're charged with uh
 
05:00:04.868 --> 05:00:04.878 align:start position:0%
doing something such as this
 
05:00:09.430 --> 05:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
um a few other things um you know we I I
 
05:00:11.628 --> 05:00:11.638 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh representative Roy talking
 
05:00:13.590 --> 05:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
about uh this is only for people who
 
05:00:17.948 --> 05:00:17.958 align:start position:0%
have been adjudicated uh and considered
 
05:00:19.910 --> 05:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
a potential dangerous danger to
 
05:00:21.910 --> 05:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
themselves or others uh but if you look
 
05:00:27.150 --> 05:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
at the list uh on page where is it on um
 
05:00:31.110 --> 05:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
line 24 on page one uh adjudicated is
 
05:00:32.948 --> 05:00:32.958 align:start position:0%
not guilty of a crime by reason of
 
05:00:34.470 --> 05:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
Insanity well the person could be
 
05:00:36.910 --> 05:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
temporarily insane but their deprivation
 
05:00:38.628 --> 05:00:38.638 align:start position:0%
of rights are permanent at that point
 
05:00:40.310 --> 05:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
and we know that um this is something
 
05:00:43.430 --> 05:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's extremely hard to to undo the be
 
05:00:45.230 --> 05:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
adjudicated and incompetent toand trial
 
05:00:46.708 --> 05:00:46.718 align:start position:0%
and Fel found by the court to be a
 
05:00:48.628 --> 05:00:48.638 align:start position:0%
danger to themselves or others that's
 
05:00:50.948 --> 05:00:50.958 align:start position:0%
sounds nice but then C involuntarily
 
05:00:52.868 --> 05:00:52.878 align:start position:0%
committed to a mental facility pursuant
 
05:00:56.070 --> 05:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
to RSA 135 c34 through
 
05:00:58.750 --> 05:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
54 um and in New Hampshire the
 
05:01:00.548 --> 05:01:00.558 align:start position:0%
involuntary treatment standard the
 
05:01:02.350 --> 05:01:02.360 align:start position:0%
standard to be used by a court physici
 
05:01:03.788 --> 05:01:03.798 align:start position:0%
or psychiatrist in determining whether a
 
05:01:05.110 --> 05:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
person should be admitted to a receiving
 
05:01:06.190 --> 05:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
facility for treatment on an
 
05:01:08.190 --> 05:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
involuntarily basis shall be whether the
 
05:01:09.788 --> 05:01:09.798 align:start position:0%
person is in such mental condition as a
 
05:01:11.310 --> 05:01:11.320 align:start position:0%
result of mental illness as to create
 
05:01:12.948 --> 05:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
the potentially serious likelihood of
 
05:01:14.548 --> 05:01:14.558 align:start position:0%
danger to the themselves themselves or
 
05:01:17.868 --> 05:01:17.878 align:start position:0%
other to others um this person may not
 
05:01:19.150 --> 05:01:19.160 align:start position:0%
have committed any crime they may not
 
05:01:20.788 --> 05:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
have actually said they're going to hurt
 
05:01:22.948 --> 05:01:22.958 align:start position:0%
themselves the standard is is different
 
05:01:24.230 --> 05:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
for criminal prosecutions and
 
05:01:25.708 --> 05:01:25.718 align:start position:0%
deprivation of rights as it is for
 
05:01:26.868 --> 05:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
people that are having their rights
 
05:01:28.310 --> 05:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
deprived under these statutes and I
 
05:01:29.948 --> 05:01:29.958 align:start position:0%
think that's something that needs to be
 
05:01:31.470 --> 05:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
considered there could be someone an
 
05:01:33.708 --> 05:01:33.718 align:start position:0%
individual who is uh young person or or
 
05:01:35.350 --> 05:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
even an older person who was uh
 
05:01:37.390 --> 05:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
involuntarily committed uh because of
 
05:01:39.548 --> 05:01:39.558 align:start position:0%
bulimia uh because of substance use
 
05:01:41.390 --> 05:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
disorder as a you know as a teenager all
 
05:01:44.830 --> 05:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
kinds of things um postpartum depression
 
05:01:46.350 --> 05:01:46.360 align:start position:0%
uh these are things that are temporary
 
05:01:48.110 --> 05:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
that could lead to a a commitment order
 
05:01:50.350 --> 05:01:50.360 align:start position:0%
and under uh section c that I just
 
05:01:51.910 --> 05:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned into voluntary commitment that
 
05:01:55.430 --> 05:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
person would not be able to um to
 
05:01:57.230 --> 05:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
correct that very easily and it's we
 
05:01:58.390 --> 05:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
know we've heard for other other
 
05:01:59.470 --> 05:01:59.480 align:start position:0%
testimony and different bills that it's
 
05:02:01.788 --> 05:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
a very expensive and costly process even
 
05:02:03.150 --> 05:02:03.160 align:start position:0%
if the state does get money the
 
05:02:04.430 --> 05:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
individuals don't get money to hire
 
05:02:07.948 --> 05:02:07.958 align:start position:0%
lawyers that money goes to the state um
 
05:02:10.708 --> 05:02:10.718 align:start position:0%
just a couple of real brief things um
 
05:02:13.628 --> 05:02:13.638 align:start position:0%
you know there were many reasons and I I
 
05:02:14.910 --> 05:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
I don't want to dwell on the fact that
 
05:02:17.430 --> 05:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
this person was unarmed uh defending
 
05:02:19.590 --> 05:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
these uh these people this in this
 
05:02:22.230 --> 05:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
manner but um the person who committed
 
05:02:25.670 --> 05:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
the crime was we we heard that he was um
 
05:02:27.670 --> 05:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
guilty of many other things committed
 
05:02:30.990 --> 05:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
before and uh was charges were dismissed
 
05:02:33.708 --> 05:02:33.718 align:start position:0%
from um probably to competency concerns
 
05:02:34.990 --> 05:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
but they also had protection orders and
 
05:02:36.990 --> 05:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
their firearms not exactly sure the
 
05:02:39.150 --> 05:02:39.160 align:start position:0%
details may have been taken in the past
 
05:02:40.470 --> 05:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
how did they get them back is a question
 
05:02:43.470 --> 05:02:43.480 align:start position:0%
I have to ask and even if charges were
 
05:02:45.070 --> 05:02:45.080 align:start position:0%
dropped why was there no protective
 
05:02:46.590 --> 05:02:46.600 align:start position:0%
order there was an inquiry made I think
 
05:02:49.948 --> 05:02:49.958 align:start position:0%
by the media uh not not long after this
 
05:02:52.390 --> 05:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
to see what the uh court order was and
 
05:02:54.230 --> 05:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
it wasn't released by the court so we
 
05:02:55.310 --> 05:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
don't know if there was a protective
 
05:02:56.548 --> 05:02:56.558 align:start position:0%
order should there have been that could
 
05:02:58.430 --> 05:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
have been enough to prevent that person
 
05:03:00.190 --> 05:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
from obtaining Firearms through a legal
 
05:03:01.868 --> 05:03:01.878 align:start position:0%
means nothing would prevent someone from
 
05:03:03.310 --> 05:03:03.320 align:start position:0%
obtaining them through an illegal means
 
05:03:04.670 --> 05:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
or committing harm to themselves or
 
05:03:07.230 --> 05:03:07.240 align:start position:0%
others through any number of other
 
05:03:11.070 --> 05:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
deadly and dangerous uh means so um I I
 
05:03:13.030 --> 05:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
just ask that um you know we take into
 
05:03:14.990 --> 05:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
consideration uh the the words of
 
05:03:17.708 --> 05:03:17.718 align:start position:0%
William Blackstone um it's better the 10
 
05:03:19.430 --> 05:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
guilty persons Escape then that one
 
05:03:22.548 --> 05:03:22.558 align:start position:0%
innocent person suffer you know it may
 
05:03:24.548 --> 05:03:24.558 align:start position:0%
if it may catch somebody but we're
 
05:03:26.548 --> 05:03:26.558 align:start position:0%
stigmatizing and we're criminalizing by
 
05:03:28.110 --> 05:03:28.120 align:start position:0%
depriving people of their civil rights
 
05:03:29.910 --> 05:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
just by the fact that they have a mental
 
05:03:32.270 --> 05:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
illness in in a lot of cases and I think
 
05:03:35.750 --> 05:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's wrong wrong um I I I'm happy to
 
05:03:37.030 --> 05:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
continue this conversation with the
 
05:03:38.948 --> 05:03:38.958 align:start position:0%
sponsors and see if there's any anything
 
05:03:41.470 --> 05:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
that uh could be done in the future but
 
05:03:44.110 --> 05:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
uh as it stands I think this needs to be
 
05:03:47.830 --> 05:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
ited um
 
05:03:50.910 --> 05:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
and oh the other thing it's a minor
 
05:03:52.670 --> 05:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
issue but it's significant to those
 
05:03:54.350 --> 05:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
officers we're also ordering Court
 
05:03:55.990 --> 05:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
officers to go and take the firearms
 
05:03:58.830 --> 05:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
from a person who has this order uh that
 
05:04:00.470 --> 05:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
potentially puts the officers in danger
 
05:04:02.150 --> 05:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
which is part of their job I understand
 
05:04:04.350 --> 05:04:04.360 align:start position:0%
and they they knowingly do their job
 
05:04:06.350 --> 05:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
well and bravely but it also puts the
 
05:04:07.670 --> 05:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
person who they're taking the firearms
 
05:04:09.590 --> 05:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
from in danger you know what if the
 
05:04:10.910 --> 05:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
person comes to the door with a phone in
 
05:04:12.430 --> 05:04:12.440 align:start position:0%
their hand and they think oh he he
 
05:04:14.548 --> 05:04:14.558 align:start position:0%
that's his gun and they just shoot him
 
05:04:15.830 --> 05:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
these things have happened we've seen it
 
05:04:17.190 --> 05:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
in the media we've seen it in the news
 
05:04:18.628 --> 05:04:18.638 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to put not just the
 
05:04:21.110 --> 05:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
officers at risk but the individuals who
 
05:04:22.670 --> 05:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
are potentially being victimized by
 
05:04:25.030 --> 05:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
having their rights deprived uh through
 
05:04:26.750 --> 05:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
through these means i' be happy to take
 
05:04:26.760 --> 05:04:28.548 align:start position:0%
through these means i' be happy to take
any

05:04:28.548 --> 05:04:28.558 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:04:30.190 --> 05:04:30.200 align:start position:0%

05:06:16.750 --> 05:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities um so this is a
 
05:06:19.190 --> 05:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
challenging um bill for our office
 
05:06:21.350 --> 05:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
frankly because it does represent a
 
05:06:24.590 --> 05:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
departure from some privacy protections
 
05:06:26.270 --> 05:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
that were afforded to people with
 
05:06:30.390 --> 05:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
disabilities um and also it involves
 
05:06:34.230 --> 05:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
potentially removing rights that people
 
05:06:36.510 --> 05:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
all people are guaranteed under our US
 
05:06:39.990 --> 05:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution that said um with the
 
05:06:42.190 --> 05:06:42.200 align:start position:0%
amendment which I'm hoping it looks like
 
05:06:44.390 --> 05:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
what I think it's going to look like I
 
05:06:45.750 --> 05:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
think it's something that our office
 
05:06:49.030 --> 05:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
would not oppose um and I want to um
 
05:06:53.430 --> 05:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
talk about the amendment and what um my
 
05:06:55.510 --> 05:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is about assuming it says
 
05:06:57.868 --> 05:06:57.878 align:start position:0%
what I think it says um the concerns
 
05:07:01.190 --> 05:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
that IT addresses that um I reached out
 
05:07:06.310 --> 05:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
to a couple of you about so this the
 
05:07:09.110 --> 05:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns my office have has
 
05:07:11.948 --> 05:07:11.958 align:start position:0%
involve privacy and confidentiality of
 
05:07:13.110 --> 05:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
05:07:16.948 --> 05:07:16.958 align:start position:0%
records um and the other issue we have
 
05:07:21.788 --> 05:07:21.798 align:start position:0%
has to do with um how traumatic
 
05:07:24.070 --> 05:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
confiscation of weapons could be
 
05:07:26.110 --> 05:07:26.120 align:start position:0%
following an order of dangerousness and
 
05:07:28.628 --> 05:07:28.638 align:start position:0%
an order that someone surrender or have
 
05:07:32.190 --> 05:07:32.200 align:start position:0%
their guns their their firearms removed
 
05:07:35.070 --> 05:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
um um and then because that could happen
 
05:07:36.708 --> 05:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
very quickly under the bill is
 
05:07:38.430 --> 05:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
introduced and the person could be
 
05:07:40.070 --> 05:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
hospitalized and come home to a home
 
05:07:42.868 --> 05:07:42.878 align:start position:0%
that was broken into and thirdly our
 
05:07:45.350 --> 05:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
concern has to do with the time frame
 
05:07:47.788 --> 05:07:47.798 align:start position:0%
and process that someone would follow
 
05:07:50.510 --> 05:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
when they're no longer posing a danger
 
05:07:52.350 --> 05:07:52.360 align:start position:0%
they're no longer committed and how long
 
05:07:54.030 --> 05:07:54.040 align:start position:0%
they might have to wait for restoration
 
05:07:57.708 --> 05:07:57.718 align:start position:0%
of their rights so I'm going to try to
 
05:08:01.510 --> 05:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
multitask here and and read and explain
 
05:08:03.628 --> 05:08:03.638 align:start position:0%
um how I'm hoping that this amendment
 
05:08:05.110 --> 05:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
addresses those
 
05:08:08.270 --> 05:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
concerns so in the bill as
 
05:08:10.510 --> 05:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
introduced there's a provision that has
 
05:08:12.670 --> 05:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
to do with what information is
 
05:08:15.190 --> 05:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
communicated to Nyx once the person has
 
05:08:17.270 --> 05:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
been involuntarily committed or you know
 
05:08:18.910 --> 05:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
Falls within this perview of what this
 
05:08:22.628 --> 05:08:22.638 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to address so what it
 
05:08:26.270 --> 05:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
says right now is um and this is on page
 
05:08:30.750 --> 05:08:30.760 align:start position:0%
to I think it's line 10 it allows for
 
05:08:33.830 --> 05:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
the reporting of the person name an
 
05:08:35.548 --> 05:08:35.558 align:start position:0%
identifier signifying what the
 
05:08:37.470 --> 05:08:37.480 align:start position:0%
prohibition the applicable prohibition
 
05:08:40.310 --> 05:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
is for them to own firearms as well as
 
05:08:43.548 --> 05:08:43.558 align:start position:0%
any non-clinical identifying information
 
05:08:47.310 --> 05:08:47.320 align:start position:0%
that gives me pause because what is that
 
05:08:49.990 --> 05:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
um it NX there's as my understanding is
 
05:08:52.868 --> 05:08:52.878 align:start position:0%
that NYX only requires certain
 
05:08:55.230 --> 05:08:55.240 align:start position:0%
information does require the name of the
 
05:08:57.390 --> 05:08:57.400 align:start position:0%
person does require the applicable
 
05:08:58.990 --> 05:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
provision that would prohibit them from
 
05:09:02.270 --> 05:09:02.280 align:start position:0%
owning or possessing firearms it does
 
05:09:03.990 --> 05:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
include their social security number I
 
05:09:06.230 --> 05:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
think and even their date of birth but
 
05:09:09.788 --> 05:09:09.798 align:start position:0%
nothing else so I think it would be I'm
 
05:09:13.430 --> 05:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
hoping that this amendment does actually
 
05:09:16.708 --> 05:09:16.718 align:start position:0%
remove like remove that um sort of
 
05:09:19.910 --> 05:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
nebulous additional phrase from the bill
 
05:09:22.270 --> 05:09:22.280 align:start position:0%
so that we're not you know opening the
 
05:09:25.150 --> 05:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
doors here to certain other confidential
 
05:09:28.510 --> 05:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
information being
 
05:09:32.628 --> 05:09:32.638 align:start position:0%
available so hopefully that does that um
 
05:09:35.670 --> 05:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
secondly with regard to a person for who
 
05:09:38.350 --> 05:09:38.360 align:start position:0%
is involuntarily committed so what the
 
05:09:41.390 --> 05:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
bill provides for is for a court to have
 
05:09:45.788 --> 05:09:45.798 align:start position:0%
the authority to then order that the if
 
05:09:47.310 --> 05:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
that per to inquire about whether that
 
05:09:50.230 --> 05:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
person actually owns or has access to
 
05:09:52.708 --> 05:09:52.718 align:start position:0%
firearms and then to subsequently order
 
05:09:55.110 --> 05:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
that if they do that those Firearms be
 
05:09:57.350 --> 05:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
seized within 48
 
05:10:01.350 --> 05:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
hours so as I alluded to earlier while
 
05:10:03.310 --> 05:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
that might be a reasonable that that
 
05:10:04.670 --> 05:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
could be a reasonable order that the
 
05:10:07.708 --> 05:10:07.718 align:start position:0%
court might make um it would be
 
05:10:09.868 --> 05:10:09.878 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult as a person who's
 
05:10:12.030 --> 05:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
now in the you know in a mental health
 
05:10:14.150 --> 05:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
crisis getting hospitalized stuck at a
 
05:10:16.868 --> 05:10:16.878 align:start position:0%
hospital involuntarily to then be
 
05:10:18.990 --> 05:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
released come home and their house has
 
05:10:20.990 --> 05:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
been broken into and their stuff has
 
05:10:23.548 --> 05:10:23.558 align:start position:0%
been gone through and you know who knows
 
05:10:26.830 --> 05:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
what kind of state it would be in so
 
05:10:30.788 --> 05:10:30.798 align:start position:0%
what um I suggested to um representative
 
05:10:34.310 --> 05:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
Roy and I hope it's in here forgive me
 
05:10:36.948 --> 05:10:36.958 align:start position:0%
um I'm not a power speed reader is an
 
05:10:39.470 --> 05:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
opport is are two things one is a
 
05:10:42.430 --> 05:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
requirement that at the hearing that the
 
05:10:44.990 --> 05:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
judge would inform the person of this
 
05:10:47.390 --> 05:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
possibility so even before issuing it's
 
05:10:49.270 --> 05:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
there thank you representative Murray
 
05:10:52.910 --> 05:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
even before issuing an order um you know
 
05:10:54.590 --> 05:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
determining whether the person ought to
 
05:10:56.670 --> 05:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
be involuntarily committed and whether
 
05:10:58.670 --> 05:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
you know therefore they might be
 
05:11:00.590 --> 05:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
required to turn over their firearms
 
05:11:02.548 --> 05:11:02.558 align:start position:0%
that the person's put on notice
 
05:11:04.590 --> 05:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
that you know this is this is a likely
 
05:11:06.510 --> 05:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
outcome this is this is a possible
 
05:11:09.190 --> 05:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
outcome I could order I found the judge
 
05:11:11.910 --> 05:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
could order that your AR Firearms be
 
05:11:14.270 --> 05:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
confiscated but you um have an
 
05:11:15.868 --> 05:11:15.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity if you want to Avail
 
05:11:17.548 --> 05:11:17.558 align:start position:0%
yourself of it to make other
 
05:11:19.868 --> 05:11:19.878 align:start position:0%
arrangements and in that process
 
05:11:21.150 --> 05:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
actually so that person will be
 
05:11:23.110 --> 05:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
represented they have a right to counsel
 
05:11:25.590 --> 05:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
in involuntary commitment proceedings so
 
05:11:28.190 --> 05:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
or even if they are you know if they've
 
05:11:30.390 --> 05:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
entered this this realm through the
 
05:11:31.948 --> 05:11:31.958 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system they also have
 
05:11:33.750 --> 05:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
have a right to counsel so their Council
 
05:11:35.788 --> 05:11:35.798 align:start position:0%
can work with them and talk them through
 
05:11:37.750 --> 05:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
what their options are and provide them
 
05:11:39.470 --> 05:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
with an opportunity to make other
 
05:11:41.350 --> 05:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
arrangements to avoid having their homes
 
05:11:41.360 --> 05:11:42.510 align:start position:0%
arrangements to avoid having their homes
broken

05:11:42.510 --> 05:11:42.520 align:start position:0%
broken
 
05:11:45.510 --> 05:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
into the thing what kind of flows from
 
05:11:48.230 --> 05:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
that also is that if the court does in
 
05:11:50.230 --> 05:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
fact rule that they ought to be
 
05:11:52.350 --> 05:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
involuntarily committed and that their
 
05:11:54.590 --> 05:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
firearms that they should not have
 
05:11:57.070 --> 05:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
access to fire Firearms I it just sort
 
05:11:58.990 --> 05:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
of neatens things up a little bit to
 
05:12:01.070 --> 05:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
provide these several options that the
 
05:12:02.510 --> 05:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
person would have
 
05:12:04.708 --> 05:12:04.718 align:start position:0%
so the court could order them to
 
05:12:06.510 --> 05:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
surrender their firearms in accordance
 
05:12:09.190 --> 05:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
with the um Arrangements they've made
 
05:12:11.548 --> 05:12:11.558 align:start position:0%
the court could order that they deliver
 
05:12:14.590 --> 05:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
their firearms to an authorized person
 
05:12:16.270 --> 05:12:16.280 align:start position:0%
this is already in the bill it just kind
 
05:12:18.708 --> 05:12:18.718 align:start position:0%
of sets it out more clearly so an
 
05:12:20.670 --> 05:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
authorized person to who doesn't live
 
05:12:24.310 --> 05:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
with them to hold on to those or if or
 
05:12:28.030 --> 05:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
could order the police to come and seize
 
05:12:29.868 --> 05:12:29.878 align:start position:0%
the Firearms within 48 hours if no
 
05:12:31.830 --> 05:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
suitable Arrangements have been made so
 
05:12:34.110 --> 05:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
so it retains that possibility but it
 
05:12:36.150 --> 05:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
provides a little bit more opportunity
 
05:12:39.350 --> 05:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
for someone to have control over how
 
05:12:42.910 --> 05:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
they choose to dispose of or store their
 
05:12:46.270 --> 05:12:46.280 align:start position:0%
firearms um the third concern had to for
 
05:12:48.628 --> 05:12:48.638 align:start position:0%
my office had to do with the time frame
 
05:12:51.350 --> 05:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
for being able to just petition the
 
05:12:54.310 --> 05:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
court for restoration so remembering
 
05:12:56.470 --> 05:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
that it's the court that is going to
 
05:12:58.830 --> 05:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
ultimately decide whether the person in
 
05:13:01.150 --> 05:13:01.160 align:start position:0%
this predicament or this situation is
 
05:13:03.830 --> 05:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
going to get their firearms back or
 
05:13:06.548 --> 05:13:06.558 align:start position:0%
their ability to own firearms back and
 
05:13:09.470 --> 05:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
what this does is say if you if the
 
05:13:13.548 --> 05:13:13.558 align:start position:0%
person obtains an absolute discharge and
 
05:13:14.868 --> 05:13:14.878 align:start position:0%
I'm going to tell you a little bit more
 
05:13:18.150 --> 05:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
about that um then within they have to
 
05:13:20.190 --> 05:13:20.200 align:start position:0%
wait another 15 days but then they can
 
05:13:23.510 --> 05:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
petition the court for permission to
 
05:13:27.110 --> 05:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
have that right restored now if they do
 
05:13:28.590 --> 05:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
that the court then is going to have to
 
05:13:29.868 --> 05:13:29.878 align:start position:0%
order they're going to have to submit to
 
05:13:31.868 --> 05:13:31.878 align:start position:0%
a mental health evaluation also so so
 
05:13:32.670 --> 05:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
05:13:35.270 --> 05:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
like you there are other processes in
 
05:13:37.310 --> 05:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
place um that mental health evaluation
 
05:13:40.230 --> 05:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
is in the current version of this bill
 
05:13:42.390 --> 05:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
um but just one thing that's really
 
05:13:44.470 --> 05:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
important for you all to know if you're
 
05:13:46.150 --> 05:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
not intimately involved with the mental
 
05:13:48.110 --> 05:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
health system in this state is that when
 
05:13:50.350 --> 05:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
people are involuntarily committed to
 
05:13:52.910 --> 05:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
the mental health system and they are at
 
05:13:55.470 --> 05:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital they may be
 
05:13:57.590 --> 05:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
released conditionally and actually that
 
05:14:00.230 --> 05:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
happens quite frequently so they are
 
05:14:02.750 --> 05:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
stabilized they are to return to their
 
05:14:04.190 --> 05:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
communities but they're not really
 
05:14:06.830 --> 05:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
officially discharged from the hospital
 
05:14:08.670 --> 05:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
they are conditionally discharged
 
05:14:10.350 --> 05:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
conditions typically being that they
 
05:14:12.830 --> 05:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
comply with treatment recommendations or
 
05:14:15.990 --> 05:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
orders actually in this case right so
 
05:14:18.788 --> 05:14:18.798 align:start position:0%
it's generally being connecting with
 
05:14:20.310 --> 05:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
their local Community Mental Health
 
05:14:23.270 --> 05:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
Center participating in treatment with a
 
05:14:25.910 --> 05:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
therapist taking um usually taking some
 
05:14:27.990 --> 05:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
medication those are very common
 
05:14:30.670 --> 05:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
requirements and if the person doesn't
 
05:14:33.470 --> 05:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
comply with those requirements they can
 
05:14:36.110 --> 05:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
be hauled back to the hospital the other
 
05:14:38.110 --> 05:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
thing that's really important to know is
 
05:14:41.150 --> 05:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
that when people are determined when
 
05:14:42.470 --> 05:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
it's when it's determined appropriate to
 
05:14:45.110 --> 05:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
involuntarily commit someone to the
 
05:14:46.628 --> 05:14:46.638 align:start position:0%
State Mental Health System and to the
 
05:14:48.510 --> 05:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
hospital this these commitment orders
 
05:14:52.110 --> 05:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
can be for up to five years and they're
 
05:14:55.030 --> 05:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
I I I've never seen one less than a year
 
05:14:58.750 --> 05:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
I mean and they get renewed so what
 
05:15:00.590 --> 05:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
happens is you know someone is
 
05:15:03.948 --> 05:15:03.958 align:start position:0%
essentially not really discharged when
 
05:15:06.470 --> 05:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
they are physically allowed to return
 
05:15:10.110 --> 05:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
home and an absolute discharge happens
 
05:15:13.868 --> 05:15:13.878 align:start position:0%
when that person has demonstrated that
 
05:15:15.510 --> 05:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
they've successfully engaged with the
 
05:15:16.510 --> 05:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
mental health system they've
 
05:15:17.948 --> 05:15:17.958 align:start position:0%
demonstrated that they are taking their
 
05:15:19.708 --> 05:15:19.718 align:start position:0%
medications or and they no longer
 
05:15:21.868 --> 05:15:21.878 align:start position:0%
present a danger that's when they get an
 
05:15:24.670 --> 05:15:24.680 align:start position:0%
absolute discharge for that reason it
 
05:15:28.510 --> 05:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
seemed really discriminatory to you know
 
05:15:31.150 --> 05:15:31.160 align:start position:0%
prolong the time period even further for
 
05:15:33.070 --> 05:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
which some someone could be just even
 
05:15:35.470 --> 05:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
eligible to petition
 
05:15:39.030 --> 05:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
for restoration of their rights and so
 
05:15:41.628 --> 05:15:41.638 align:start position:0%
um that's why the amendment shrinks that
 
05:15:46.350 --> 05:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
down to 15 days um it also there's
 
05:15:48.350 --> 05:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
another little adjustment that reflects
 
05:15:50.868 --> 05:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
current practice which is that generally
 
05:15:52.990 --> 05:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
in these involuntarily involuntary
 
05:15:54.990 --> 05:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
commitment cases when there's an
 
05:15:56.910 --> 05:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
evaluation ordered and there are always
 
05:15:58.670 --> 05:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
evaluations ordered independent
 
05:16:01.150 --> 05:16:01.160 align:start position:0%
evaluations the court has a panel of
 
05:16:03.868 --> 05:16:03.878 align:start position:0%
Psych christs that do these evaluations
 
05:16:05.548 --> 05:16:05.558 align:start position:0%
and courts generally order these
 
05:16:07.708 --> 05:16:07.718 align:start position:0%
evaluations and then arrange for them to
 
05:16:10.070 --> 05:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
happen so that's just a small adjustment
 
05:16:13.310 --> 05:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
to reflect what current practice is and
 
05:16:16.628 --> 05:16:16.638 align:start position:0%
then as after Consulting with Dr feder
 
05:16:19.110 --> 05:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
Who's the chief medical um director at
 
05:16:21.030 --> 05:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
the state hospital and also with one of
 
05:16:23.070 --> 05:16:23.080 align:start position:0%
the attorneys I know who represents
 
05:16:25.190 --> 05:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
people in involuntary commitment cases
 
05:16:26.910 --> 05:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
what I learned is that generally these
 
05:16:29.070 --> 05:16:29.080 align:start position:0%
evaluations are scheduled pretty quickly
 
05:16:32.030 --> 05:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
usually within 15 days so the bill
 
05:16:34.590 --> 05:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
right now provides for 45 days which is
 
05:16:37.190 --> 05:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
retained but the the the technical
 
05:16:39.788 --> 05:16:39.798 align:start position:0%
adjustment is and this is in line with I
 
05:16:41.868 --> 05:16:41.878 align:start position:0%
believe what Dr feder had in mind and I
 
05:16:45.510 --> 05:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
think he will confirm this I hope is
 
05:16:47.030 --> 05:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
that the thinking was that these
 
05:16:49.868 --> 05:16:49.878 align:start position:0%
evaluations would be completed within 45
 
05:16:52.990 --> 05:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
days not just scheduled within 45 days
 
05:16:55.510 --> 05:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
so that's the small Tinker about the
 
05:16:58.670 --> 05:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
timing and then the other um timing that
 
05:17:02.230 --> 05:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
I inserted or well hopefully will
 
05:17:05.190 --> 05:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
insert that's in this amendment is to
 
05:17:07.150 --> 05:17:07.160 align:start position:0%
also create a time frame for these
 
05:17:10.628 --> 05:17:10.638 align:start position:0%
hearings to occur because you know like
 
05:17:12.948 --> 05:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
I said someone could be unconditional
 
05:17:15.910 --> 05:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
discharg for years and years and now
 
05:17:18.110 --> 05:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
they're absolutely discharged how long
 
05:17:20.628 --> 05:17:20.638 align:start position:0%
is it reasonable to prolong you know
 
05:17:22.270 --> 05:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
their opportunity to have their day in
 
05:17:24.230 --> 05:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
court and so what this would do would
 
05:17:28.030 --> 05:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
say Okay 15 days you file your petition
 
05:17:30.750 --> 05:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
45 days later you have you know you've
 
05:17:32.390 --> 05:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
had your evaluation ation is reported
 
05:17:35.310 --> 05:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
and 15 days after the completion of the
 
05:17:37.070 --> 05:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
evaluation is when the court would
 
05:17:39.470 --> 05:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
schedule a hearing So within 60 days the
 
05:17:42.270 --> 05:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
court schedules the hearing it seems
 
05:17:43.590 --> 05:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
fair because you've already waited a
 
05:17:46.030 --> 05:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
pretty long time to have your day in
 
05:17:47.788 --> 05:17:47.798 align:start position:0%
court and you'll have an opportunity to
 
05:17:50.548 --> 05:17:50.558 align:start position:0%
review the results of the evaluation the
 
05:17:52.750 --> 05:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
last thing it does is it maintains a
 
05:17:56.150 --> 05:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
provision that generally if the person
 
05:17:58.548 --> 05:17:58.558 align:start position:0%
loses theyve filed their petition they
 
05:18:00.830 --> 05:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
lose generally they would have to wait
 
05:18:03.628 --> 05:18:03.638 align:start position:0%
two more years to file again but what
 
05:18:07.270 --> 05:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
this does is it inserts some um it it
 
05:18:08.788 --> 05:18:08.798 align:start position:0%
basically puts some discretion on the
 
05:18:09.868 --> 05:18:09.878 align:start position:0%
part of the court if there's a
 
05:18:12.470 --> 05:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
compelling reason why the person ought
 
05:18:15.430 --> 05:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
to be afforded an earlier opportunity to
 
05:18:17.390 --> 05:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
petition again the court would have that
 
05:18:19.470 --> 05:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
authority to Grant it and that could
 
05:18:22.350 --> 05:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
come up in a situation where someone's
 
05:18:24.910 --> 05:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
situation changes like maybe their
 
05:18:26.510 --> 05:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
behavior was attributable to a brain
 
05:18:29.868 --> 05:18:29.878 align:start position:0%
tumor that you know was operable and and
 
05:18:31.470 --> 05:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
and that's why they behave the way they
 
05:18:33.270 --> 05:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
did and ended up in the hospital you
 
05:18:35.548 --> 05:18:35.558 align:start position:0%
know so it just basically gives some
 
05:18:36.990 --> 05:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
discretion to the court it doesn't
 
05:18:39.708 --> 05:18:39.718 align:start position:0%
require them to do anything so I think
 
05:18:43.948 --> 05:18:43.958 align:start position:0%
that explains everything that's in here
 
05:18:46.270 --> 05:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
and please ask
 
05:18:49.150 --> 05:18:49.160 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much that's
 
05:18:51.230 --> 05:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
there is a lot to take in here uh
 
05:18:53.430 --> 05:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler thank you madam
 
05:18:55.070 --> 05:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question I
 
05:18:56.470 --> 05:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
actually have a really simple question
 
05:18:59.990 --> 05:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
and it's just I can't write as fast as I
 
05:19:01.590 --> 05:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
would like to and I didn't get what
 
05:19:03.310 --> 05:19:03.320 align:start position:0%
organization you work oh sorry I'm with
 
05:19:04.910 --> 05:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
the disability rights Center of New
 
05:19:06.470 --> 05:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you very much and thank
 
05:19:07.628 --> 05:19:07.638 align:start position:0%
you work that you're doing that was a
 
05:19:10.788 --> 05:19:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:14.390 --> 05:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:17.708 --> 05:19:17.718 align:start position:0%
Muse and I wanted to thank you for your
 
05:19:20.390 --> 05:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh for your input uh both before uh and
 
05:19:22.430 --> 05:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
after the hearing
 
05:19:26.390 --> 05:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to one of the things that I
 
05:19:28.110 --> 05:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
I I wanted to try to get into a little
 
05:19:30.830 --> 05:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
bit because it's it's we we it in a
 
05:19:32.510 --> 05:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
hearing like like this we get so mucked
 
05:19:36.628 --> 05:19:36.638 align:start position:0%
up in the details but why why is it
 
05:19:39.708 --> 05:19:39.718 align:start position:0%
important that we we're paying as much
 
05:19:42.150 --> 05:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
attention as we're paying in the in this
 
05:19:45.910 --> 05:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
bill and in this process um to the
 
05:19:48.510 --> 05:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
people who the bill would actually
 
05:19:51.430 --> 05:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
prohibit from from possessing firearms I
 
05:19:57.230 --> 05:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:00.628 --> 05:20:00.638 align:start position:0%
we kind of an inelegant way of of asking
 
05:20:02.190 --> 05:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
but um
 
05:20:05.310 --> 05:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
why why is this why is what we're doing
 
05:20:09.190 --> 05:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
here by by creating this amendment by
 
05:20:11.310 --> 05:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
making sure we get these processes right
 
05:20:13.670 --> 05:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
what what are we accomplishing for
 
05:20:17.430 --> 05:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
people I I think that what we need to
 
05:20:19.548 --> 05:20:19.558 align:start position:0%
recognize is
 
05:20:22.628 --> 05:20:22.638 align:start position:0%
that people with mental illness ought
 
05:20:25.390 --> 05:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
not to be stigmatized unnecessarily or
 
05:20:27.788 --> 05:20:27.798 align:start position:0%
discriminated against in terms of their
 
05:20:31.310 --> 05:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
access to and ability to enjoy the same
 
05:20:33.750 --> 05:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
civil rights that everybody else can
 
05:20:37.788 --> 05:20:37.798 align:start position:0%
enjoy and and and I think that's what's
 
05:20:41.708 --> 05:20:41.718 align:start position:0%
the and that's why it's important to get
 
05:20:43.470 --> 05:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
this right and pay attention to those
 
05:20:48.350 --> 05:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
people because we as a society often
 
05:20:50.788 --> 05:20:50.798 align:start position:0%
look upon someone who has experienced a
 
05:20:52.548 --> 05:20:52.558 align:start position:0%
mental health crisis or experiences
 
05:20:55.070 --> 05:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
mental illness as less than and less
 
05:20:59.270 --> 05:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
entitled to the same lives that the you
 
05:21:00.548 --> 05:21:00.558 align:start position:0%
know that are enshrined in our
 
05:21:03.310 --> 05:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
constitution ution and that's
 
05:21:05.708 --> 05:21:05.718 align:start position:0%
wrong and and that's why we ought to
 
05:21:09.910 --> 05:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
care about making sure that you know yes
 
05:21:11.750 --> 05:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
if someone is dangerous and they are
 
05:21:13.948 --> 05:21:13.958 align:start position:0%
actively dangerous and actively posing a
 
05:21:18.310 --> 05:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
risk we have a mechanism to to respond
 
05:21:20.670 --> 05:21:20.680 align:start position:0%
to that and can make a rational and
 
05:21:23.910 --> 05:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
decisions might be made that are that
 
05:21:25.350 --> 05:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
that are that we do this with people who
 
05:21:29.590 --> 05:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
are felons right courts will if you
 
05:21:31.470 --> 05:21:31.480 align:start position:0%
convict you know committed a a violent
 
05:21:32.990 --> 05:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
crime and you're a felon a court will
 
05:21:37.230 --> 05:21:37.240 align:start position:0%
remove your right to possess Firearms
 
05:21:38.628 --> 05:21:38.638 align:start position:0%
you will because of
 
05:21:40.750 --> 05:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
dangerousness and I think that it's a
 
05:21:42.868 --> 05:21:42.878 align:start position:0%
mistake to assume that just because
 
05:21:45.708 --> 05:21:45.718 align:start position:0%
someone has a mental illness that they
 
05:21:48.230 --> 05:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
are dangerous it's an assumption that's
 
05:21:48.240 --> 05:21:50.070 align:start position:0%
are dangerous it's an assumption that's
really

05:21:50.070 --> 05:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:21:54.070 --> 05:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
unfair thank you thanks representative
 
05:21:56.510 --> 05:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
n thank you Mrs chair and thank you for
 
05:21:57.708 --> 05:21:57.718 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
05:22:00.708 --> 05:22:00.718 align:start position:0%
question as the um I think I said Miss
 
05:22:00.718 --> 05:22:01.590 align:start position:0%
question as the um I think I said Miss
anyway

05:22:01.590 --> 05:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
05:22:05.830 --> 05:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
um Madam Madam chair um my question is
 
05:22:07.910 --> 05:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
around confidentiality and especially
 
05:22:09.510 --> 05:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
when we're we're discussing the
 
05:22:11.270 --> 05:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
stigmatization and of course we don't
 
05:22:13.270 --> 05:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
want to put anyone in that position I
 
05:22:15.628 --> 05:22:15.638 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you're here to to Really
 
05:22:17.270 --> 05:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
um guide us and help us make sure that
 
05:22:19.430 --> 05:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
we do the best we can for uh people with
 
05:22:22.990 --> 05:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities my question is um in to
 
05:22:24.590 --> 05:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
your understanding having worked with
 
05:22:27.030 --> 05:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
the sponsors to to bring forth this
 
05:22:30.470 --> 05:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
amendment um when it is reported if if
 
05:22:33.750 --> 05:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
someone uh goes to purchase a a weapon
 
05:22:35.390 --> 05:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
and then they cannot because of a
 
05:22:37.868 --> 05:22:37.878 align:start position:0%
situation like this does the Privacy
 
05:22:40.708 --> 05:22:40.718 align:start position:0%
provide for um that information not to
 
05:22:42.030 --> 05:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
be conveyed to the person that they're
 
05:22:44.350 --> 05:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
trying to to purchase a weapon from the
 
05:22:48.390 --> 05:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
the reason so my understand I have I've
 
05:22:50.868 --> 05:22:50.878 align:start position:0%
had zero personal experience with NYX
 
05:22:52.430 --> 05:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
but my understanding from people who
 
05:22:55.708 --> 05:22:55.718 align:start position:0%
know more than I is that when someone
 
05:22:57.590 --> 05:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
goes to purchase the firearm and if they
 
05:23:01.270 --> 05:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
are on the nck list the deal the um the
 
05:23:03.590 --> 05:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
licensed Firearms dealer would get a
 
05:23:05.628 --> 05:23:05.638 align:start position:0%
notification that they are not eligible
 
05:23:07.430 --> 05:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
to purchase the firearm I don't think
 
05:23:09.548 --> 05:23:09.558 align:start position:0%
that they would receive information
 
05:23:13.670 --> 05:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
about the reason why thank you you are
 
05:23:13.680 --> 05:23:15.910 align:start position:0%
about the reason why thank you you are
correct

05:23:15.910 --> 05:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:23:18.990 --> 05:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
pH representative celik thank you madam
 
05:23:20.150 --> 05:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:23:22.030 --> 05:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
question I I just want to clarify you
 
05:23:25.350 --> 05:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
made a reference um a few moments ago to
 
05:23:27.070 --> 05:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
withholding weapons from convicted
 
05:23:29.470 --> 05:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
felons you are not equating people with
 
05:23:31.430 --> 05:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
mental illness you sure to make a
 
05:23:33.670 --> 05:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
distinction between those two I just oh
 
05:23:35.310 --> 05:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
my goodness no I oh thank you no I
 
05:23:36.548 --> 05:23:36.558 align:start position:0%
didn't mean to do that at all I think
 
05:23:38.910 --> 05:23:38.920 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to say is that courts
 
05:23:42.430 --> 05:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
know how to remove you know weapons from
 
05:23:44.750 --> 05:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
people who are dangerous and I
 
05:23:46.830 --> 05:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
understand how that might be necessary
 
05:23:50.030 --> 05:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
at times and I just use that as you know
 
05:23:53.310 --> 05:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
an example okay and can we ask a quick
 
05:23:55.750 --> 05:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
followup and and people with mental
 
05:23:58.510 --> 05:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
health illnesses can presumably recover
 
05:24:00.548 --> 05:24:00.558 align:start position:0%
yes oh oh thank you for asking that
 
05:24:03.670 --> 05:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
question yes all the time people with
 
05:24:06.830 --> 05:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
mental illness can recover fully can
 
05:24:08.948 --> 05:24:08.958 align:start position:0%
also you know if if it's more of a
 
05:24:11.110 --> 05:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
chronic nature can manage their symptoms
 
05:24:13.510 --> 05:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
with medication and treatment I mean
 
05:24:18.948 --> 05:24:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:21.190 --> 05:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
time seeing no further questions thank
 
05:24:26.070 --> 05:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:28.750 --> 05:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
you Victoria
 
05:24:31.270 --> 05:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
Sullivan had to leave
 
05:24:31.280 --> 05:24:32.270 align:start position:0%
Sullivan had to leave
she

05:24:32.270 --> 05:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
she
 
05:24:39.190 --> 05:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:39.200 --> 05:24:42.910 align:start position:0%
 
right

05:24:42.910 --> 05:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:51.310 --> 05:24:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:54.990 --> 05:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
burrow um I I am I am for this bill uh
 
05:24:56.788 --> 05:24:56.798 align:start position:0%
if you could just let just state your
 
05:24:59.548 --> 05:24:59.558 align:start position:0%
name I know I did Steven buau
 
05:25:02.470 --> 05:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
representing myself
 
05:25:04.548 --> 05:25:04.558 align:start position:0%
um I think there should be other
 
05:25:07.628 --> 05:25:07.638 align:start position:0%
amendments uh to this bill uh because
 
05:25:08.868 --> 05:25:08.878 align:start position:0%
there's people that are having
 
05:25:10.310 --> 05:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
adjudicated or committed mental
 
05:25:12.750 --> 05:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
defective added to their next background
 
05:25:15.390 --> 05:25:15.400 align:start position:0%
check um but were never found
 
05:25:19.628 --> 05:25:19.638 align:start position:0%
incompetent never um found to be a
 
05:25:21.788 --> 05:25:21.798 align:start position:0%
danger to themselves or others and were
 
05:25:24.628 --> 05:25:24.638 align:start position:0%
never involuntarily
 
05:25:27.190 --> 05:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
committed but yet they have adjudicated
 
05:25:28.708 --> 05:25:28.718 align:start position:0%
or committed mental defective on their
 
05:25:30.830 --> 05:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
record where it doesn't apply and
 
05:25:33.430 --> 05:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
there's no way to remedy that and that's
 
05:25:37.548 --> 05:25:37.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:40.830 --> 05:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
denied because of you know such a a
 
05:25:42.910 --> 05:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
finding on their record there should be
 
05:25:44.830 --> 05:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
justification for that information to be
 
05:25:46.868 --> 05:25:46.878 align:start position:0%
there and I'll I'll give you a couple
 
05:25:49.470 --> 05:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
instances there's a person who was
 
05:25:51.390 --> 05:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
denied a permit to
 
05:25:55.670 --> 05:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
carry they actually received the federal
 
05:25:57.070 --> 05:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
background check which they're not
 
05:25:58.990 --> 05:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to receive that's not supposed
 
05:26:01.190 --> 05:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
to be copied or disseminated to anybody
 
05:26:03.750 --> 05:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
including who the check is done on
 
05:26:06.628 --> 05:26:06.638 align:start position:0%
however the the Nicks background check
 
05:26:09.150 --> 05:26:09.160 align:start position:0%
came back with adjudicated committed uh
 
05:26:12.430 --> 05:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
adjudicated committed mental
 
05:26:17.430 --> 05:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
defective and it showed the uh the court
 
05:26:20.830 --> 05:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
the case number the charge ID and when
 
05:26:22.948 --> 05:26:22.958 align:start position:0%
that information was
 
05:26:26.030 --> 05:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
referenced looking at the case summary
 
05:26:28.390 --> 05:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
it showed that that person had the
 
05:26:30.948 --> 05:26:30.958 align:start position:0%
charge dismissed there was never a
 
05:26:33.390 --> 05:26:33.400 align:start position:0%
question of competence there was never a
 
05:26:34.590 --> 05:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
finding of
 
05:26:36.990 --> 05:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
dangerousness the person was never
 
05:26:39.270 --> 05:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
involuntarily committed or had any other
 
05:26:41.830 --> 05:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
prohibiting factors but yet had
 
05:26:44.110 --> 05:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
adjudicated committed or adjudicated or
 
05:26:47.190 --> 05:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
committed mental defective on their
 
05:26:49.470 --> 05:26:49.480 align:start position:0%
record how's that person supposed to
 
05:26:51.708 --> 05:26:51.718 align:start position:0%
have that removed from their record it
 
05:26:53.110 --> 05:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
it should have never been there to begin
 
05:26:54.590 --> 05:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
with so I think there should be
 
05:26:58.190 --> 05:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
amendments in this bill for people
 
05:27:01.190 --> 05:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
who have false information added to
 
05:27:04.948 --> 05:27:04.958 align:start position:0%
their next background check to have that
 
05:27:07.070 --> 05:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
removed and they shouldn't have to jump
 
05:27:08.910 --> 05:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
through all the Hoops if if that
 
05:27:10.350 --> 05:27:10.360 align:start position:0%
information is false and it shouldn't be
 
05:27:12.390 --> 05:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
on the record a person shouldn't have to
 
05:27:14.750 --> 05:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
go through a trial in court and then an
 
05:27:16.990 --> 05:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
evaluation to prove
 
05:27:20.070 --> 05:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
that they're competent there was never a
 
05:27:22.708 --> 05:27:22.718 align:start position:0%
proper finding for that to be there
 
05:27:22.718 --> 05:27:24.628 align:start position:0%
proper finding for that to be there
another

05:27:24.628 --> 05:27:24.638 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:27:24.638 --> 05:27:26.390 align:start position:0%
another
instance

05:27:26.390 --> 05:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
instance
 
05:27:32.310 --> 05:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
um a person had another court case
 
05:27:33.548 --> 05:27:33.558 align:start position:0%
the charge was
 
05:27:36.030 --> 05:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
dismissed the person was allegedly found
 
05:27:38.070 --> 05:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
incompetent to stand trial but not a
 
05:27:39.868 --> 05:27:39.878 align:start position:0%
danger to themselves or
 
05:27:42.628 --> 05:27:42.638 align:start position:0%
others they were never involuntarily
 
05:27:44.990 --> 05:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
committed and in fact that person turned
 
05:27:48.788 --> 05:27:48.798 align:start position:0%
around had that charge
 
05:27:50.910 --> 05:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
annulled once something's an olded the
 
05:27:52.230 --> 05:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
person is to be treated as if that
 
05:27:54.750 --> 05:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
arrest has never taken place but the
 
05:27:57.390 --> 05:27:57.400 align:start position:0%

05:28:07.510 --> 05:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
one of getting access to sealed
 
05:28:11.788 --> 05:28:11.798 align:start position:0%
documents pertaining to an a
 
05:28:14.030 --> 05:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
evaluation the state turned around and
 
05:28:16.190 --> 05:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
then had adjudicated or committed mental
 
05:28:19.830 --> 05:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:23.590 --> 05:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
record there's no finding of
 
05:28:25.350 --> 05:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
dangerousness the person was never
 
05:28:26.910 --> 05:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
committed to a mental institution and
 
05:28:28.190 --> 05:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
didn't have any other prohibiting
 
05:28:33.390 --> 05:28:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:35.110 --> 05:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
and the question of competence is being
 
05:28:39.430 --> 05:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:42.230 --> 05:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
much there was a case in I believe it
 
05:28:44.548 --> 05:28:44.558 align:start position:0%
was 2007 in the New Hampshire Supreme

Scott
 
05:28:50.470 --> 05:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
Buchanan and the Supreme Court made it
 
05:28:52.708 --> 05:28:52.718 align:start position:0%
perfectly clear
 
05:28:55.868 --> 05:28:55.878 align:start position:0%
that incompetent to stand trial cannot
 
05:28:58.190 --> 05:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
be equated with adjudicated or committed
 
05:29:00.470 --> 05:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
mental defective there has to be the
 
05:29:04.350 --> 05:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:06.990 --> 05:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
dangerousness the state continues to
 
05:29:08.910 --> 05:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
equate incompetent to stand trial
 
05:29:10.990 --> 05:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
regardless of if you were found not to
 
05:29:13.628 --> 05:29:13.638 align:start position:0%
be a danger to yourself or others or
 
05:29:16.390 --> 05:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
even involuntarily committed the state
 
05:29:18.948 --> 05:29:18.958 align:start position:0%
is still equating incompetent to stand
 
05:29:21.070 --> 05:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
trial with adjudicated committed mental
 
05:29:24.110 --> 05:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
defective and having that placed on
 
05:29:27.750 --> 05:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
people's background check denying them
 
05:29:29.310 --> 05:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
their constitutional
 
05:29:29.320 --> 05:29:32.590 align:start position:0%
their constitutional
rights

05:29:32.590 --> 05:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:35.990 --> 05:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
now in order for a person if a person
 
05:29:38.030 --> 05:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
was found adjudicated or committed
 
05:29:41.070 --> 05:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
mental defective pertaining to a um
 
05:29:42.948 --> 05:29:42.958 align:start position:0%
criminal case that person wouldn't be
 
05:29:48.230 --> 05:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:48.240 --> 05:29:50.868 align:start position:0%
 
annulled

05:29:50.868 --> 05:29:50.878 align:start position:0%
annulled
 
05:29:53.628 --> 05:29:53.638 align:start position:0%
um another thing is if there's a
 
05:29:55.030 --> 05:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
question of
 
05:29:57.628 --> 05:29:57.638 align:start position:0%
competence that denies a person the
 
05:30:01.190 --> 05:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
right to file suit against
 
05:30:03.190 --> 05:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
say the police if it was an unlawful
 
05:30:05.590 --> 05:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
arrest on false charges and the person
 
05:30:07.030 --> 05:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
had their rights
 
05:30:10.628 --> 05:30:10.638 align:start position:0%
violated that person no longer can file
 
05:30:14.110 --> 05:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
suit in the United States District Court
 
05:30:16.548 --> 05:30:16.558 align:start position:0%
uh under section 1983 for rights
 
05:30:19.948 --> 05:30:19.958 align:start position:0%
violations it deprives them of that
 
05:30:22.868 --> 05:30:22.878 align:start position:0%
right now there's another instance where
 
05:30:26.590 --> 05:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
a person had a criminal case they
 
05:30:29.190 --> 05:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
represented themselves if there's a
 
05:30:30.910 --> 05:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
question of competence
 
05:30:32.868 --> 05:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
a person cannot represent themselves
 
05:30:34.868 --> 05:30:34.878 align:start position:0%
even if it's a Class B misdemeanor and
 
05:30:36.430 --> 05:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
they typically wouldn't be
 
05:30:39.590 --> 05:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
afforded uh appointment of councel if
 
05:30:41.830 --> 05:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
there's a question of competence raised
 
05:30:43.948 --> 05:30:43.958 align:start position:0%
not only is the judge
 
05:30:47.310 --> 05:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
obligated to file for
 
05:30:51.030 --> 05:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:53.990 --> 05:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
evaluation but that person
 
05:30:56.230 --> 05:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
can't represent
 
05:30:58.708 --> 05:30:58.718 align:start position:0%
themselves but on a criminal case where
 
05:31:00.708 --> 05:31:00.718 align:start position:0%
an individual represented
 
05:31:03.548 --> 05:31:03.558 align:start position:0%
themselves there was no question of
 
05:31:05.788 --> 05:31:05.798 align:start position:0%
competence there was no
 
05:31:09.590 --> 05:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
finding um M Mr bur if I if I could
 
05:31:13.708 --> 05:31:13.718 align:start position:0%
just are you speaking on House Bill 1711
 
05:31:13.718 --> 05:31:14.590 align:start position:0%
just are you speaking on House Bill 1711
or

05:31:14.590 --> 05:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:31:22.590 --> 05:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:25.510 --> 05:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
dis now on on that on that case a person
 
05:31:28.430 --> 05:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
represented themselves and there was an
 
05:31:30.150 --> 05:31:30.160 align:start position:0%
alleged finding of incompetent to stand
 
05:31:34.948 --> 05:31:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:37.590 --> 05:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
dangerous what's to stop the state from
 
05:31:40.670 --> 05:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
taking that and placing incompetent to
 
05:31:43.910 --> 05:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
stand trial on that person's record
 
05:31:46.270 --> 05:31:46.280 align:start position:0%
there was another case where and the
 
05:31:48.510 --> 05:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
question of competence only pertains to
 
05:31:48.520 --> 05:31:49.590 align:start position:0%
question of competence only pertains to
criminal

05:31:49.590 --> 05:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
05:31:51.868 --> 05:31:51.878 align:start position:0%
cases but yet there there's a case where
 
05:31:54.350 --> 05:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
an individual had a speeding ticket
 
05:31:56.628 --> 05:31:56.638 align:start position:0%
represented themselves and the judge
 
05:31:59.670 --> 05:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
dismissed the the uh speeding ticket
 
05:32:00.948 --> 05:32:00.958 align:start position:0%
claiming that the defendant was
 
05:32:02.470 --> 05:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
incompetent to stand
 
05:32:05.470 --> 05:32:05.480 align:start position:0%
trial that doesn't make any sense what's
 
05:32:07.030 --> 05:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
to stop the state from taking that
 
05:32:09.628 --> 05:32:09.638 align:start position:0%
incompetent to stand trial even though
 
05:32:12.030 --> 05:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't apply to such a case and the
 
05:32:14.590 --> 05:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
person is not a danger to the themselves
 
05:32:16.830 --> 05:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
or others was to stop the state from
 
05:32:19.910 --> 05:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
adding adjudicated or committed mental
 
05:32:22.350 --> 05:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
defective to that person's record so
 
05:32:24.070 --> 05:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
there should be some sort of remedy for
 
05:32:27.390 --> 05:32:27.400 align:start position:0%
people who have had adjudicated or
 
05:32:29.110 --> 05:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
committed mental defective added to
 
05:32:30.628 --> 05:32:30.638 align:start position:0%
their record
 
05:32:32.390 --> 05:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
but that's incorrect it doesn't even
 
05:32:33.430 --> 05:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
apply to
 
05:32:37.470 --> 05:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
them so that so I'm just asking that
 
05:32:39.470 --> 05:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
there be some other amendments made to
 
05:32:41.868 --> 05:32:41.878 align:start position:0%
this so that people who have had
 
05:32:43.230 --> 05:32:43.240 align:start position:0%
adjudicated or committed mental
 
05:32:45.430 --> 05:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
defective to their record and it does
 
05:32:45.440 --> 05:32:46.910 align:start position:0%
defective to their record and it does
not

05:32:46.910 --> 05:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:32:50.548 --> 05:32:50.558 align:start position:0%
apply there should be some remedy that
 
05:32:53.990 --> 05:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
or process that a person can go through
 
05:32:56.110 --> 05:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
and have that false information
 
05:33:00.430 --> 05:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
removed I I I just I I think some I I
 
05:33:03.110 --> 05:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
think there's parts of the system that
 
05:33:05.470 --> 05:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
are being abused and people are being
 
05:33:07.310 --> 05:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
denied their rights and
 
05:33:09.990 --> 05:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
privileges so I don't know if there's
 
05:33:12.868 --> 05:33:12.878 align:start position:0%
any questions we'll find out for
 
05:33:16.390 --> 05:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
you Representative
 
05:33:20.788 --> 05:33:20.798 align:start position:0%
no um if I and remembering from um what
 
05:33:23.070 --> 05:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
chairman Roy introduced in the beginning
 
05:33:24.948 --> 05:33:24.958 align:start position:0%
he what he was talking about one of the
 
05:33:27.270 --> 05:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
things benefits of this bill was that it
 
05:33:29.270 --> 05:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
did allow for someone to adjudicate and
 
05:33:31.270 --> 05:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
be removed from it if it were a
 
05:33:34.150 --> 05:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
temporary situation so if that is indeed
 
05:33:37.510 --> 05:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
the case is are you in support of this
 
05:33:41.390 --> 05:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
bill I'm I'm sorry I'm I'm I'm it it
 
05:33:44.470 --> 05:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
sounds to me um like you are you're
 
05:33:47.670 --> 05:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
discussing uh your concern is around uh
 
05:33:49.470 --> 05:33:49.480 align:start position:0%
whether someone can be removed and if
 
05:33:51.030 --> 05:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
there is a process for someone to be
 
05:33:53.150 --> 05:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
removed from that and then and therefore
 
05:33:56.350 --> 05:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
restore their right um to possess
 
05:33:58.830 --> 05:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
Firearms so my my question is if that is
 
05:34:01.708 --> 05:34:01.718 align:start position:0%
provided for in this Bill a remedy and a
 
05:34:03.948 --> 05:34:03.958 align:start position:0%
process uh for that to be adjudicated
 
05:34:05.470 --> 05:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
are you in support of the rest of the
 
05:34:08.788 --> 05:34:08.798 align:start position:0%
bill yeah absolutely but the the but
 
05:34:11.350 --> 05:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
what the bill covers is for people who
 
05:34:14.948 --> 05:34:14.958 align:start position:0%
have been through a legitimate
 
05:34:17.868 --> 05:34:17.878 align:start position:0%
process and been found incompetent to
 
05:34:20.990 --> 05:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
stand trial and dangerous to themselves
 
05:34:23.910 --> 05:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
or others which would fit the criteria
 
05:34:27.030 --> 05:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
for involuntary
 
05:34:30.310 --> 05:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
commitment but if a person hasn't been
 
05:34:32.070 --> 05:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
found to be a danger to themselves or
 
05:34:34.750 --> 05:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
others nor have they been involuntarily
 
05:34:36.948 --> 05:34:36.958 align:start position:0%
committed then it shouldn't be on the
 
05:34:39.430 --> 05:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
record only a person who's been through
 
05:34:41.390 --> 05:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
the process and had a finding of
 
05:34:43.270 --> 05:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
incompetent and dangerous to themselves
 
05:34:45.990 --> 05:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
or others or has been involuntarily
 
05:34:49.990 --> 05:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
committed or others other things that
 
05:34:52.788 --> 05:34:52.798 align:start position:0%
are that are covered it only applies to
 
05:34:56.868 --> 05:34:56.878 align:start position:0%
them it doesn't apply to people who have
 
05:34:59.230 --> 05:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
had the information falsely placed on
 
05:35:01.190 --> 05:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
the record where it doesn't apply
 
05:35:03.390 --> 05:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
because then that person who's had the
 
05:35:06.030 --> 05:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
information added to their record
 
05:35:08.310 --> 05:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
falsely would also have to go through
 
05:35:10.030 --> 05:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
the same process which means they'd have
 
05:35:11.948 --> 05:35:11.958 align:start position:0%
to go to court they'd have to be
 
05:35:15.030 --> 05:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
evaluated and a person who has
 
05:35:17.350 --> 05:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
never you know what I mean if the
 
05:35:19.750 --> 05:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
information isn't correct a person
 
05:35:20.788 --> 05:35:20.798 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to go through an
 
05:35:23.590 --> 05:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
evaluation and this and that because it
 
05:35:25.948 --> 05:35:25.958 align:start position:0%
it never applied to begin with okay
 
05:35:28.788 --> 05:35:28.798 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
05:35:30.708 --> 05:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:35:35.070 --> 05:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
that all right thank you very
 
05:35:52.868 --> 05:35:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:55.470 --> 05:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
simkin good afternoon Madame chairwoman
 
05:35:57.628 --> 05:35:57.638 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee thank you
 
05:35:59.990 --> 05:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
for giving an giving me an opportunity
 
05:36:00.000 --> 05:36:01.190 align:start position:0%
for giving an giving me an opportunity
to

05:36:01.190 --> 05:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:36:04.430 --> 05:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
testify um I make it my mission when I
 
05:36:07.270 --> 05:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
testify to bring information that I'm
 
05:36:10.590 --> 05:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
fairly certain will not otherwise reach
 
05:36:13.350 --> 05:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
you um in the interest of full
 
05:36:16.750 --> 05:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
disclosure I'm a federal firearms LIC e
 
05:36:20.110 --> 05:36:20.120 align:start position:0%
and have been so for a tad over 40 years
 
05:36:24.990 --> 05:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:27.670 --> 05:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
agency I want to again repeat a
 
05:36:31.110 --> 05:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
foundational fact which often is
 
05:36:34.788 --> 05:36:34.798 align:start position:0%
overlooked or not known at all which is
 
05:36:36.150 --> 05:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
as that end
 
05:36:39.510 --> 05:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
2022 there were approximately 474
 
05:36:42.868 --> 05:36:42.878 align:start position:0%
million firearms in the United States
 
05:36:45.350 --> 05:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
these are firearms made
 
05:36:49.868 --> 05:36:49.878 align:start position:0%
after one on or after 1 January 1898 to
 
05:36:52.470 --> 05:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
present their various
 
05:36:57.110 --> 05:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
exclusions and I could list them if you
 
05:37:00.708 --> 05:37:00.718 align:start position:0%
wish anything so numerous cannot be
 
05:37:04.270 --> 05:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
controlled everyone here seems to assume
 
05:37:08.110 --> 05:37:08.120 align:start position:0%
that someone who is prohibited has to go
 
05:37:10.670 --> 05:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
to a dealer to get a firearm this is
 
05:37:14.110 --> 05:37:14.120 align:start position:0%
simply wrong criminals own and rent or
 
05:37:17.628 --> 05:37:17.638 align:start position:0%
sell firearms people can borrow firearms
 
05:37:21.948 --> 05:37:21.958 align:start position:0%
from Neighbors so the notion that oh
 
05:37:24.788 --> 05:37:24.798 align:start position:0%
we're going to enact this and it's going
 
05:37:27.788 --> 05:37:27.798 align:start position:0%
to stop those who
 
05:37:30.990 --> 05:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
are mentally defective Ive and dangerous
 
05:37:33.470 --> 05:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
from getting Firearms this is simply
 
05:37:36.270 --> 05:37:36.280 align:start position:0%
Pulp Fiction it will stop some of them
 
05:37:40.110 --> 05:37:40.120 align:start position:0%
but it will not stop all of them now to
 
05:37:42.430 --> 05:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
come to the specifics of this bill and I
 
05:37:46.590 --> 05:37:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:50.548 --> 05:37:50.558 align:start position:0%
testimony this bill if
 
05:37:54.830 --> 05:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
enacted in effect in fact will ensure
 
05:37:56.830 --> 05:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
that those who have a spell of mental
 
05:38:00.548 --> 05:38:00.558 align:start position:0%
distress forever lose their right to be
 
05:38:03.910 --> 05:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
armed the bill should be subtitled the
 
05:38:06.910 --> 05:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
roach motel gun control
 
05:38:11.270 --> 05:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
Bill and it should as it is and even as
 
05:38:15.868 --> 05:38:15.878 align:start position:0%
amended should be voted in expedient to
 
05:38:18.548 --> 05:38:18.558 align:start position:0%
legislate the Bill's proponent set forth
 
05:38:20.150 --> 05:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
ways for a person who has been
 
05:38:23.990 --> 05:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
involuntarily committed
 
05:38:27.310 --> 05:38:27.320 align:start position:0%
to regain their civil right to be armed
 
05:38:29.948 --> 05:38:29.958 align:start position:0%
but those pathways are a fiction they're
 
05:38:33.190 --> 05:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
a a fiction because a person who has
 
05:38:35.788 --> 05:38:35.798 align:start position:0%
been involuntarily committed cannot
 
05:38:39.750 --> 05:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
choose his or her own attorney and key
 
05:38:42.468 --> 05:38:42.478 align:start position:0%
Point follows and they cannot have that
 
05:38:45.190 --> 05:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees and costs reimbursed
 
05:38:48.110 --> 05:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
from taxpayer funds at that attorney's
 
05:38:52.110 --> 05:38:52.120 align:start position:0%
normal hourly rate so
 
05:38:54.430 --> 05:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
basically once someone has been
 
05:38:54.440 --> 05:38:57.468 align:start position:0%
basically once someone has been
involuntarily

05:38:57.468 --> 05:38:57.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:00.230 --> 05:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
committed they are in the road Motel
 
05:39:03.110 --> 05:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
they check in they can never check out
 
05:39:07.230 --> 05:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:09.670 --> 05:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
testimony I will actually direct you to
 
05:39:12.510 --> 05:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
the website for this Black Flag product
 
05:39:18.750 --> 05:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:26.910 --> 05:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
1981 the idea here that a court or a
 
05:39:30.868 --> 05:39:30.878 align:start position:0%
doctor is going to make a finding that
 
05:39:33.030 --> 05:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
an adjudicated person has regained
 
05:39:35.750 --> 05:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
mental health and is eligible to own
 
05:39:39.030 --> 05:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
firearms I suspect this Pulp
 
05:39:41.150 --> 05:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
Fiction uh those of you with long
 
05:39:44.310 --> 05:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
memories may recall that in the 1988
 
05:39:44.320 --> 05:39:46.110 align:start position:0%
memories may recall that in the 1988
presidential

05:39:46.110 --> 05:39:46.120 align:start position:0%
presidential
 
05:39:50.030 --> 05:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
campaign much was made of the fact that
 
05:39:52.868 --> 05:39:52.878 align:start position:0%
a Massachusetts governor had granted a
 
05:39:55.310 --> 05:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
Furlow to a convicted
 
05:39:57.468 --> 05:39:57.478 align:start position:0%
murderer and while this convicted
 
05:39:59.708 --> 05:39:59.718 align:start position:0%
murderer was furloughed from prison he
 
05:40:04.030 --> 05:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:08.390 --> 05:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
crimes the idea that a public official
 
05:40:11.708 --> 05:40:11.718 align:start position:0%
whether a judge or a doctor is going to
 
05:40:15.548 --> 05:40:15.558 align:start position:0%
put their good name and their financial
 
05:40:18.350 --> 05:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
well-being on the line by certifying
 
05:40:22.070 --> 05:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
that someone is cured it may happen I
 
05:40:23.628 --> 05:40:23.638 align:start position:0%
don't think it happens
 
05:40:26.390 --> 05:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
often um why do I come to this
 
05:40:29.350 --> 05:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
conclusion well here in New Hampshire
 
05:40:29.360 --> 05:40:30.990 align:start position:0%
conclusion well here in New Hampshire
since

05:40:30.990 --> 05:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
since
 
05:40:35.190 --> 05:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
1996 pardons have been few likely fewer
 
05:40:38.390 --> 05:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
than five so few I can't find
 
05:40:43.070 --> 05:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
any official data so if the governor or
 
05:40:45.468 --> 05:40:45.478 align:start position:0%
the governors of New Hampshire have not
 
05:40:50.468 --> 05:40:50.478 align:start position:0%
been willing to Grant pardons very
 
05:40:52.788 --> 05:40:52.798 align:start position:0%
often why would one think that other
 
05:40:57.430 --> 05:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:02.868 --> 05:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
pardon I I'm deeply skeptical of
 
05:41:05.310 --> 05:41:05.320 align:start position:0%
that the other
 
05:41:08.868 --> 05:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
issue that I think is not well
 
05:41:11.310 --> 05:41:11.320 align:start position:0%
understood has to do with the costs of
 
05:41:13.190 --> 05:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
litigating with a
 
05:41:16.510 --> 05:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
state I have some relevant
 
05:41:19.070 --> 05:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
experience this is a Massachusetts
 
05:41:22.548 --> 05:41:22.558 align:start position:0%
temporary non-resident license to carry
 
05:41:22.558 --> 05:41:23.510 align:start position:0%
temporary non-resident license to carry
its

05:41:23.510 --> 05:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
its
 
05:41:27.948 --> 05:41:27.958 align:start position:0%
predecessor was revoked wrongly in
 
05:41:31.670 --> 05:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
2009 I spent about
 
05:41:35.310 --> 05:41:35.320 align:start position:0%
$125,000 to recoup the license which I
 
05:41:38.990 --> 05:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
did by virtue of the unanimous decision
 
05:41:41.468 --> 05:41:41.478 align:start position:0%
in order and Order of the Supreme
 
05:41:42.990 --> 05:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
Judicial Court of
 
05:41:46.390 --> 05:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in
 
05:41:49.948 --> 05:41:49.958 align:start position:0%
mid3 the cost would have been far higher
 
05:41:53.708 --> 05:41:53.718 align:start position:0%
had I not done most of the law and
 
05:41:57.030 --> 05:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
legislative history research so the idea
 
05:42:00.270 --> 05:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
that a person who has been a adjudicated
 
05:42:00.280 --> 05:42:01.110 align:start position:0%
that a person who has been a adjudicated
can

05:42:01.110 --> 05:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
can
 
05:42:04.350 --> 05:42:04.360 align:start position:0%
somehow handle this on their you know on
 
05:42:05.628 --> 05:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
their own
 
05:42:08.670 --> 05:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
resources it may be occasionally
 
05:42:11.628 --> 05:42:11.638 align:start position:0%
true um but I think that would be by far
 
05:42:13.868 --> 05:42:13.878 align:start position:0%
the exception that proves the
 
05:42:13.878 --> 05:42:15.548 align:start position:0%
the exception that proves the
rule

05:42:15.548 --> 05:42:15.558 align:start position:0%
rule
 
05:42:17.910 --> 05:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
further there's another assumption
 
05:42:21.030 --> 05:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
behind this bill that I believe is
 
05:42:21.040 --> 05:42:22.468 align:start position:0%
behind this bill that I believe is
factually

05:42:22.468 --> 05:42:22.478 align:start position:0%
factually
 
05:42:26.030 --> 05:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
wrong and that error will have
 
05:42:26.040 --> 05:42:27.910 align:start position:0%
wrong and that error will have
catastrophic

05:42:27.910 --> 05:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
catastrophic
 
05:42:31.110 --> 05:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
consequences one once a person's name is
 
05:42:34.430 --> 05:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
put into the federal FBI Nicks databases
 
05:42:37.230 --> 05:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
as having been adjudicated New Hampshire
 
05:42:39.830 --> 05:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
has no way to compel the federal
 
05:42:43.350 --> 05:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
authorities to recognize any restoration
 
05:42:45.670 --> 05:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
of their civil right to be armed I
 
05:42:47.270 --> 05:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
understand in the bill there's this
 
05:42:50.230 --> 05:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
provision we'll make a deal with ATF but
 
05:42:54.310 --> 05:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
ATF can change its mind and it does for
 
05:42:59.788 --> 05:42:59.798 align:start position:0%
example there was Circa 1990 a type of
 
05:43:03.190 --> 05:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
shotgun that was fed by a 12 round
 
05:43:06.150 --> 05:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
revolving cylinder so each shot the
 
05:43:09.230 --> 05:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
cylinder just like a a revolver and a
 
05:43:13.708 --> 05:43:13.718 align:start position:0%
handgun ATF allowed it to be sold then
 
05:43:17.030 --> 05:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
ATF said wait a minute there's no quote
 
05:43:19.150 --> 05:43:19.160 align:start position:0%
sporting purpose end quote for such a
 
05:43:22.030 --> 05:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
shotgun we are going to reclassify it as
 
05:43:24.708 --> 05:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
a destructive device so every time that
 
05:43:28.110 --> 05:43:28.120 align:start position:0%
it changes hands a $200 tax has to be
 
05:43:28.120 --> 05:43:29.948 align:start position:0%
it changes hands a $200 tax has to be
paid

05:43:29.948 --> 05:43:29.958 align:start position:0%
paid
 
05:43:32.830 --> 05:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
ATF can change its mind it did and I can
 
05:43:34.628 --> 05:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
prove it and they
 
05:43:38.590 --> 05:43:38.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't argue with me fast forward
 
05:43:40.948 --> 05:43:40.958 align:start position:0%
you've probably heard about arm braces
 
05:43:44.510 --> 05:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
being used on certain types of pistols
 
05:43:47.708 --> 05:43:47.718 align:start position:0%
ATF initially said no problem then they
 
05:43:50.548 --> 05:43:50.558 align:start position:0%
said no we think putting one of these
 
05:43:53.150 --> 05:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
onto certain pistols makes a short
 
05:43:55.270 --> 05:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
barrel rifle then they went back to
 
05:43:57.868 --> 05:43:57.878 align:start position:0%
saying well maybe they are permissible
 
05:44:00.430 --> 05:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
under certain circumstan an es so the
 
05:44:03.270 --> 05:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
notion that a deal that you make or that
 
05:44:06.190 --> 05:44:06.200 align:start position:0%

they gave him a letter so
 
05:44:54.788 --> 05:44:54.798 align:start position:0%

exact I am I am right on Madam chairman
 
05:45:19.708 --> 05:45:19.718 align:start position:0%
I am right on target so I'll sum it up
 
05:45:22.110 --> 05:45:22.120 align:start position:0%
really quickly thank
 
05:45:25.510 --> 05:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
you even though he was totally honest
 
05:45:27.628 --> 05:45:27.638 align:start position:0%
with Department of Safety they revoked
 
05:45:30.150 --> 05:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
his license he sued food they restored
 
05:45:34.270 --> 05:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
it then after that safety probably the
 
05:45:36.830 --> 05:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
behest of the US Bureau of Alcohol
 
05:45:39.310 --> 05:45:39.320 align:start position:0%
Tobacco firearms and explosives again
 
05:45:40.670 --> 05:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
revoke the
 
05:45:43.788 --> 05:45:43.798 align:start position:0%
license on the basis that the department
 
05:45:45.868 --> 05:45:45.878 align:start position:0%
didn't want its employees to
 
05:45:48.990 --> 05:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
risk being prosecuted for issuing a
 
05:45:51.468 --> 05:45:51.478 align:start position:0%
license to a person whom the
 
05:45:55.390 --> 05:45:55.400 align:start position:0%
feds considered to be
 
05:45:58.430 --> 05:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
prohibited now this matter ended up
 
05:46:00.868 --> 05:46:00.878 align:start position:0%
litig litigated before the New Hampshire
 
05:46:04.310 --> 05:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court that found that
 
05:46:06.670 --> 05:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts had restored a civil right
 
05:46:09.830 --> 05:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
to be armed and his armed guard security
 
05:46:13.070 --> 05:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
license was given back to him I know
 
05:46:16.548 --> 05:46:16.558 align:start position:0%
because I wrote his brief and was before
 
05:46:19.468 --> 05:46:19.478 align:start position:0%
the court to make his
 
05:46:21.990 --> 05:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
case key
 
05:46:26.190 --> 05:46:26.200 align:start position:0%
point the feds do not have to accept
 
05:46:29.030 --> 05:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
anything that New Hampshire does the
 
05:46:31.788 --> 05:46:31.798 align:start position:0%
Attorney General of New Hampshire tried
 
05:46:34.350 --> 05:46:34.360 align:start position:0%
to get the US Supreme Court to
 
05:46:36.548 --> 05:46:36.558 align:start position:0%
overturn the New Hampshire Supreme
 
05:46:39.910 --> 05:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
Court's decision restoring his license
 
05:46:42.390 --> 05:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
the US Supreme Court denied the petition
 
05:46:42.400 --> 05:46:43.948 align:start position:0%
the US Supreme Court denied the petition
for

05:46:43.948 --> 05:46:43.958 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:46:47.548 --> 05:46:47.558 align:start position:0%
curari why that was done I have no
 
05:46:47.558 --> 05:46:49.190 align:start position:0%
curari why that was done I have no
clue

05:46:49.190 --> 05:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
clue
 
05:46:52.030 --> 05:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
so any
 
05:46:55.788 --> 05:46:55.798 align:start position:0%
enactment that relies on the feds
 
05:46:59.030 --> 05:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
respecting what you enact here is based
 
05:47:03.350 --> 05:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
on error and this bill is so based and
 
05:47:06.830 --> 05:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
it should be deemed inexpedient to
 
05:47:10.270 --> 05:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
legislate um for those who are skeptical
 
05:47:13.110 --> 05:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
I attach a copy of a letter to the
 
05:47:16.350 --> 05:47:16.360 align:start position:0%
attorney general from the then acting us
 
05:47:19.468 --> 05:47:19.478 align:start position:0%
attorney for New Hampshire providing
 
05:47:23.110 --> 05:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
immunity to State officials who would
 
05:47:27.708 --> 05:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
act to restore this gentleman's revoked
 
05:47:31.910 --> 05:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
license but he and we're now 10 years
 
05:47:35.230 --> 05:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
down the road still will not go to a
 
05:47:38.868 --> 05:47:38.878 align:start position:0%
licy to acquire a firearm for fear that
 
05:47:41.430 --> 05:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
the feds still deem him
 
05:47:44.190 --> 05:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
prohibited he will be denied and then he
 
05:47:46.310 --> 05:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
will have committed a felony because the
 
05:47:49.590 --> 05:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
feds will argue you knew you were denied
 
05:47:52.270 --> 05:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
and that we paid no attention to what
 
05:47:54.750 --> 05:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
the US to what the New Hampshire Supreme
 
05:47:54.760 --> 05:47:57.628 align:start position:0%
the US to what the New Hampshire Supreme
Court

05:47:57.628 --> 05:47:57.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:57.638 --> 05:48:00.030 align:start position:0%
 
decided

05:48:00.030 --> 05:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
decided
 
05:48:03.310 --> 05:48:03.320 align:start position:0%
I will cheerfully answer questions on
 
05:48:07.788 --> 05:48:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:11.150 --> 05:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
related thank you very much um one final

Bill
 
05:49:04.548 --> 05:49:04.558 align:start position:0%
1711 as an important legislation to
 
05:49:08.190 --> 05:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
reduce the public safety problems of gun
 
05:49:10.948 --> 05:49:10.958 align:start position:0%
violence and
 
05:49:13.670 --> 05:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
suicide I have worked as a psychiatrist
 
05:49:16.468 --> 05:49:16.478 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire hospital over the past
 
05:49:19.510 --> 05:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
29 years and I was working at New
 
05:49:22.190 --> 05:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital on November
 
05:49:26.910 --> 05:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
17th when gunshots were heard in our
 
05:49:29.590 --> 05:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
lobby all the paat patients and staff
 
05:49:31.310 --> 05:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
had to shelter in
 
05:49:34.510 --> 05:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
place because an active shooter was in
 
05:49:34.520 --> 05:49:36.230 align:start position:0%
place because an active shooter was in
our

05:49:36.230 --> 05:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:49:40.788 --> 05:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
building only later I found out that
 
05:49:40.798 --> 05:49:42.510 align:start position:0%
building only later I found out that
security

05:49:42.510 --> 05:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
security
 
05:49:46.070 --> 05:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
officer Bradley hos had died
 
05:49:48.390 --> 05:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
heroically while protecting all the
 
05:49:51.590 --> 05:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
patients and staff at New Hampshire
 
05:49:53.750 --> 05:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
hospital when I first started working at
 
05:49:55.510 --> 05:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital I thought that
 
05:49:58.510 --> 05:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
individuals who were committed because
 
05:50:00.548 --> 05:50:00.558 align:start position:0%
were danger to themselves or others were
 
05:50:02.830 --> 05:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
being reported to a background check
 
05:50:05.510 --> 05:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
system to prevent them from purchasing
 
05:50:07.628 --> 05:50:07.638 align:start position:0%
or possessing
 
05:50:09.868 --> 05:50:09.878 align:start position:0%
firearms I thought New Hampshire was
 
05:50:12.948 --> 05:50:12.958 align:start position:0%
complying with the federal Brady
 
05:50:16.230 --> 05:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
Law eventually I found out that New
 
05:50:19.190 --> 05:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was not complying with this
 
05:50:23.310 --> 05:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
federal law and this has resulted in an
 
05:50:26.390 --> 05:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
unsafe Public Safety
 
05:50:29.270 --> 05:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
situation House Bill 7
 
05:50:32.628 --> 05:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
1711 is a solution to this
 
05:50:35.310 --> 05:50:35.320 align:start position:0%
problem the American Psychiatric
 
05:50:37.510 --> 05:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
association has called for
 
05:50:40.468 --> 05:50:40.478 align:start position:0%
legislation to utilize background checks
 
05:50:42.628 --> 05:50:42.638 align:start position:0%
as a way to reduce gun violence and
 
05:50:44.628 --> 05:50:44.638 align:start position:0%

05:50:47.948 --> 05:50:47.958 align:start position:0%
Safety Research on background checks
 
05:50:51.468 --> 05:50:51.478 align:start position:0%
suggests that denying firearm purchase
 
05:50:54.190 --> 05:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
to individuals legally prohibited from
 
05:50:58.110 --> 05:50:58.120 align:start position:0%
gun ownership leads to reduction in the

committee New Hampshire the Live Free or

Die state has historically been opposed
 
05:53:04.750 --> 05:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
to the overreach by the federal
 
05:53:06.270 --> 05:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
government and has previously taken
 
05:53:08.628 --> 05:53:08.638 align:start position:0%
action to uphold this principle of uh
 
05:53:10.910 --> 05:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
honoring State's rights one way in which
 
05:53:12.708 --> 05:53:12.718 align:start position:0%
the state was has done this is by
 
05:53:13.708 --> 05:53:13.718 align:start position:0%
passing the Second Amendment
 
05:53:15.910 --> 05:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
preservation act barring the enforcement
 
05:53:17.948 --> 05:53:17.958 align:start position:0%
of unconstitutional federal gun control
 
05:53:20.628 --> 05:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
laws in the state of New Hampshire this
 
05:53:22.670 --> 05:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
law protects law-abiding citizens and
 
05:53:24.350 --> 05:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
law-abiding gun owners from falling
 
05:53:26.350 --> 05:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
victim to radical ideas of California
 
05:53:28.628 --> 05:53:28.638 align:start position:0%
and New York that we must put reasonable
 
05:53:30.868 --> 05:53:30.878 align:start position:0%
barriers in place and jump through many
 
05:53:32.788 --> 05:53:32.798 align:start position:0%
hoops and hurdles before being allowed
 
05:53:34.468 --> 05:53:34.478 align:start position:0%
to exercise our god-given Second
 
05:53:36.468 --> 05:53:36.478 align:start position:0%
Amendment rights another way in which
 
05:53:38.070 --> 05:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has defended gun owners in
 
05:53:40.030 --> 05:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
the past was by passing constitutional
 
05:53:42.628 --> 05:53:42.638 align:start position:0%
carry allowing graned Staters to carry a
 
05:53:44.628 --> 05:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
firearm that they are legally allowed to
 
05:53:47.110 --> 05:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
possess this law has not only saved
 
05:53:49.070 --> 05:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
lives here in New Hampshire but has also
 
05:53:51.030 --> 05:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
saved lives in the 26 other current
 
05:53:53.590 --> 05:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
states where it has been
 
05:53:55.948 --> 05:53:55.958 align:start position:0%
enacted as a resident of the communist
 
05:53:57.708 --> 05:53:57.718 align:start position:0%
state of New York uh I thank New
 
05:53:59.590 --> 05:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for taking these actions to
 
05:54:02.150 --> 05:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
save lives and protect C citizens uh
 
05:54:04.708 --> 05:54:04.718 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights but now Democrats
 
05:54:06.270 --> 05:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
and Republicans alike are coming
 
05:54:08.750 --> 05:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
together to support House Bill 1711 and
 
05:54:10.310 --> 05:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
undo the progress that they've made in
 
05:54:12.390 --> 05:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
upholding the Second Amendment this
 
05:54:13.750 --> 05:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
comes in the wake of the shooting at the
 
05:54:15.788 --> 05:54:15.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital in November where
 
05:54:17.468 --> 05:54:17.478 align:start position:0%
a mentally deranged individual would
 
05:54:18.948 --> 05:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
take the life of security officer
 
05:54:21.628 --> 05:54:21.638 align:start position:0%
Bradley hos while I am for reducing
 
05:54:23.788 --> 05:54:23.798 align:start position:0%
these types of tragic events this bill
 
05:54:26.230 --> 05:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
will not do a single thing to prevent
 
05:54:27.750 --> 05:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
this type of shooting from happening
 
05:54:27.760 --> 05:54:28.590 align:start position:0%
this type of shooting from happening
again

05:54:28.590 --> 05:54:28.600 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:54:30.750 --> 05:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
the shooter John Mador previously had
 
05:54:32.910 --> 05:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
his guns taken away in 2016 and was
 
05:54:34.910 --> 05:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
taken into custody by tra by straford
 
05:54:37.030 --> 05:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
police following his arrest and
 
05:54:38.910 --> 05:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
psychological evaluation at the New
 
05:54:40.830 --> 05:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital he was released back
 
05:54:42.948 --> 05:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
into society and subsequently gained
 
05:54:45.510 --> 05:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
access to Firearms once again proponents
 
05:54:47.270 --> 05:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
of this bill say that by passing it it
 
05:54:48.868 --> 05:54:48.878 align:start position:0%
will prevent people like Mador from
 
05:54:51.030 --> 05:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
Gaining access to firearms because their
 
05:54:53.110 --> 05:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
purchases will be checked against the
 
05:54:55.390 --> 05:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
Nick system and will be denied will be
 
05:54:58.468 --> 05:54:58.478 align:start position:0%
denied from purchasing the firearm there
 
05:55:00.350 --> 05:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
are problems that arise with this check
 
05:55:02.590 --> 05:55:02.600 align:start position:0%
though including people being falsely
 
05:55:04.670 --> 05:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
reported as not being able to own a
 
05:55:06.350 --> 05:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
firearm when it's really somebody else
 
05:55:08.948 --> 05:55:08.958 align:start position:0%
with a similar name and identity if this
 
05:55:11.150 --> 05:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
does happen it becomes a lengthly and
 
05:55:13.628 --> 05:55:13.638 align:start position:0%
costly process to appeal the decision
 
05:55:16.430 --> 05:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
and also the fact that Dylan rof the
 
05:55:18.990 --> 05:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
shooter from uh South Carolina who shot
 
05:55:21.230 --> 05:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
up the black owned Church uh should have
 
05:55:23.190 --> 05:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
been flagged by the nck system but
 
05:55:24.910 --> 05:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't because his arrest was never
 
05:55:28.708 --> 05:55:28.718 align:start position:0%
reported to ncks so this only provides a
 
05:55:30.750 --> 05:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
false sense of security to the general
 
05:55:33.468 --> 05:55:33.478 align:start position:0%
public besides the unconstitutionality
 
05:55:35.708 --> 05:55:35.718 align:start position:0%
of the Nick system the bill simply put
 
05:55:38.190 --> 05:55:38.200 align:start position:0%
will not uh will not work because of
 
05:55:40.628 --> 05:55:40.638 align:start position:0%
other ways to purchase a firearm asides
 
05:55:42.510 --> 05:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
from commercial sales criminals will
 
05:55:44.110 --> 05:55:44.120 align:start position:0%
still be able to get their hands on guns
 
05:55:45.670 --> 05:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
through private transfers the black
 
05:55:48.468 --> 05:55:48.478 align:start position:0%
market or through Flatout theft this is
 
05:55:51.590 --> 05:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
proven by a 2019 report from the US doj
 
05:55:53.990 --> 05:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
showing that only 10% of firearm related
 
05:55:55.708 --> 05:55:55.718 align:start position:0%
crimes were committed with a gun
 
05:55:57.430 --> 05:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
purchased through commercial means while
 
05:55:59.430 --> 05:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
90% % were committed with a firearm
 
05:56:00.990 --> 05:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
obtained through private transferred
 
05:56:03.868 --> 05:56:03.878 align:start position:0%
theft or off the street the only thing
 
05:56:05.590 --> 05:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
that this bill will do is dismantle law
 
05:56:07.788 --> 05:56:07.798 align:start position:0%
abiding gred stator rights to privacy
 
05:56:09.868 --> 05:56:09.878 align:start position:0%
and disincentivize them from exercising
 
05:56:11.990 --> 05:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
their second amendment rights overall
 
05:56:13.510 --> 05:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
our main points of contention with this
 
05:56:15.628 --> 05:56:15.638 align:start position:0%
bill are one the historical framework of
 
05:56:17.030 --> 05:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire fighting back against
 
05:56:18.868 --> 05:56:18.878 align:start position:0%
Federal overreach two the
 
05:56:20.750 --> 05:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
unconstitutionality of the Nick system
 
05:56:22.910 --> 05:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
and O other federal gun control laws and
 
05:56:25.430 --> 05:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
systems and three that it will only
 
05:56:27.310 --> 05:56:27.320 align:start position:0%
affect law-abiding citizens and not
 
05:56:28.628 --> 05:56:28.638 align:start position:0%
actual Criminal criminals from getting
 
05:56:31.548 --> 05:56:31.558 align:start position:0%
their hands on a firearm with this I Ur
 
05:56:33.468 --> 05:56:33.478 align:start position:0%
I urge the committee to Mark House Bill
 
05:56:36.110 --> 05:56:36.120 align:start position:0%
1711 as inexpedient to legislate and
 
05:56:38.150 --> 05:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
stop the bipartisan attack on gun owners
 
05:56:40.548 --> 05:56:40.558 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire instead of placing more
 
05:56:42.310 --> 05:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
restrictions on law abiding gun owners
 
05:56:43.750 --> 05:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
you should seek to let people like
 
05:56:45.990 --> 05:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
security officer Bradley hos defend
 
05:56:47.868 --> 05:56:47.878 align:start position:0%
their institutions by carrying a firearm
 
05:56:49.830 --> 05:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
for self-defense thank you and we'll
 
05:56:53.310 --> 05:56:53.320 align:start position:0%
keep our members informed of your
 
05:56:55.310 --> 05:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
decisions thank you very much
 
05:56:55.320 --> 05:56:56.788 align:start position:0%

05:57:13.910 --> 05:57:13.920 align:start position:0%

emotionally written Bill does nothing to
 
05:58:36.548 --> 05:58:36.558 align:start position:0%
stop criminals from number one
 
05:58:38.590 --> 05:58:38.600 align:start position:0%
committing murder and number two from
 
05:58:41.150 --> 05:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
getting Firearms one of the biggest
 
05:58:43.110 --> 05:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
issues we have in this state and across
 
05:58:45.670 --> 05:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
the country is mental health if someone
 
05:58:48.788 --> 05:58:48.798 align:start position:0%
is violently mentally ill why would be
 
05:58:50.628 --> 05:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
they be even released from a secure
 
05:58:53.070 --> 05:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
mental health facility rather than
 
05:58:55.030 --> 05:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
pushing more discriminatory gun
 
05:58:57.310 --> 05:58:57.320 align:start position:0%
confiscation bills why don't we actually
 
05:58:59.510 --> 05:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
do do something to address the serious
 
05:59:02.150 --> 05:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
mental health issues we have we should
 
05:59:04.628 --> 05:59:04.638 align:start position:0%
be open reopening mental institutions so
 
05:59:06.190 --> 05:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
that those who are violently mentally
 
05:59:08.590 --> 05:59:08.600 align:start position:0%
ill can have a safe place to live where
 
05:59:10.830 --> 05:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
they won't hurt themselves or others
 
05:59:12.510 --> 05:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
contrary to what psychiatrists said in
 
05:59:14.910 --> 05:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
the 70s and 80s when they pushed closing
 
05:59:17.070 --> 05:59:17.080 align:start position:0%
all of these institutions some people
 
05:59:19.150 --> 05:59:19.160 align:start position:0%
cannot live in society because they are
 
05:59:21.670 --> 05:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
too dangerous and we have seen this on
 
05:59:23.270 --> 05:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
multiple occasions with mass Killers
 
05:59:25.628 --> 05:59:25.638 align:start position:0%
across the country we need to stop
 
05:59:27.310 --> 05:59:27.320 align:start position:0%
handing out psychotropic drugs like
 
05:59:27.320 --> 05:59:28.150 align:start position:0%
handing out psychotropic drugs like
candy

05:59:28.150 --> 05:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
candy
 
05:59:29.628 --> 05:59:29.638 align:start position:0%
many mess Killers have been on these
 
05:59:31.910 --> 05:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
drugs these two were pushed by the same
 
05:59:33.948 --> 05:59:33.958 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist who claimed without
 
05:59:35.708 --> 05:59:35.718 align:start position:0%
actually knowing that these drugs would
 
05:59:37.590 --> 05:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
make it so violently mentally ill people
 
05:59:40.270 --> 05:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
could live happily in society we need to
 
05:59:42.390 --> 05:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
have more and easier access to mental
 
05:59:45.150 --> 05:59:45.160 align:start position:0%
health care and make no mistake a
 
05:59:46.868 --> 05:59:46.878 align:start position:0%
majority of people with mental illness
 
05:59:49.670 --> 05:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
are not violently ill in fact a majority
 
05:59:51.868 --> 05:59:51.878 align:start position:0%
are more likely to be victims of crime
 
05:59:54.670 --> 05:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
than commit crimes pushing gun control
 
05:59:56.510 --> 05:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
as a mental health issue is an affront
 
05:59:59.270 --> 05:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
to Common Sense the mentally ill and our
 
06:00:02.030 --> 06:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
fundamental human right to self-defense
 
06:00:04.430 --> 06:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
please vote in expedient to legislate on
 
06:00:06.510 --> 06:00:06.520 align:start position:0%

to help solve the serious mental health
 
06:00:13.070 --> 06:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:17.548 --> 06:00:17.558 align:start position:0%

sentences say exactly what your problem
 
06:00:27.788 --> 06:00:27.798 align:start position:0%
is with the bill not I I don't want as
 
06:00:30.350 --> 06:00:30.360 align:start position:0%
as succinct as you can make it please
 
06:00:32.310 --> 06:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
it's a gun confiscation bill and it's
 
06:00:37.590 --> 06:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:40.030 --> 06:00:40.040 align:start position:0%

representative scitec please if you

06:01:10.708 --> 06:01:10.718 align:start position:0%
could
 
06:01:12.990 --> 06:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
highlight if your intention was to read
 
06:01:14.270 --> 06:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
everything that you're passing out if
 
06:01:15.830 --> 06:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
you could just highlight those parts
 
06:01:16.990 --> 06:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
since you're passing it out that would
 
06:01:20.190 --> 06:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
be great what I'm passing around is the
 
06:01:22.030 --> 06:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
APA position statement from the American
 
06:01:26.430 --> 06:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:29.150 --> 06:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
testimony good afternoon Madam chair
 
06:01:31.110 --> 06:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
honorable committee members my name is
 
06:01:33.750 --> 06:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
Dr Samantha sweater I'm the associate
 
06:01:36.030 --> 06:01:36.040 align:start position:0%
medical director and a psychiatrist at
 
06:01:38.190 --> 06:01:38.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital however today I
 
06:01:39.468 --> 06:01:39.478 align:start position:0%
am not representing New Hampshire
 
06:01:40.910 --> 06:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
hospital but I'm representing the New
 
06:01:42.750 --> 06:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Psychiatric
 
06:01:45.030 --> 06:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
Society the New Hampshire Psychiatric
 
06:01:46.910 --> 06:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
Society is in strong support of House
 
06:01:49.910 --> 06:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
Bill 1711 and we would also like to
 
06:01:52.548 --> 06:01:52.558 align:start position:0%
recognize the Monumental bipartisan
 
06:01:54.590 --> 06:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
legislation on such an important
 
06:01:57.590 --> 06:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
topic I also want to refer to the APA a
 
06:01:59.750 --> 06:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
position statement on firearms in
 
06:02:01.430 --> 06:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
support of my testimony that I'm passing
 
06:02:05.350 --> 06:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
out and will not delve into during my
 
06:02:08.670 --> 06:02:08.680 align:start position:0%
testimony one important
 
06:02:10.468 --> 06:02:10.478 align:start position:0%
distinguish one thing I think is
 
06:02:12.750 --> 06:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
important to distinguish is an iea
 
06:02:15.948 --> 06:02:15.958 align:start position:0%
versus an non-emergent involuntary
 
06:02:20.830 --> 06:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
admission so this bill would only report
 
06:02:25.510 --> 06:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
people that have been found to have a
 
06:02:27.350 --> 06:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
mental illness and be dangerous to them
 
06:02:28.750 --> 06:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
M themselves or others by clearing
 
06:02:28.760 --> 06:02:31.030 align:start position:0%
M themselves or others by clearing
convincing

06:02:31.030 --> 06:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
convincing
 
06:02:34.948 --> 06:02:34.958 align:start position:0%
evidence in an non-emergent involuntary
 
06:02:36.868 --> 06:02:36.878 align:start position:0%
admission which means they have already
 
06:02:36.878 --> 06:02:37.708 align:start position:0%
admission which means they have already
gone

06:02:37.708 --> 06:02:37.718 align:start position:0%
gone
 
06:02:37.718 --> 06:02:39.750 align:start position:0%
gone
through

06:02:39.750 --> 06:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
through
 
06:02:42.830 --> 06:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
the is different from the emergency
 
06:02:44.310 --> 06:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
involuntary admission so the emergency
 
06:02:47.310 --> 06:02:47.320 align:start position:0%
and voluntary admission is the iea and
 
06:02:51.750 --> 06:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
that is 135c 27-33 it is not included in
 
06:02:55.390 --> 06:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
this bill which is 34 to 3 54 and the
 
06:02:58.110 --> 06:02:58.120 align:start position:0%
iea is for people who
 
06:02:59.948 --> 06:02:59.958 align:start position:0%
that's the prayer and complaint that you
 
06:03:01.190 --> 06:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
file and you send someone to the
 
06:03:03.468 --> 06:03:03.478 align:start position:0%
emergency room or anyone can file um and
 
06:03:04.670 --> 06:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
send someone that you're concerned about
 
06:03:06.030 --> 06:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
to the emergency room and then a
 
06:03:07.990 --> 06:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
provider will evaluate that person and
 
06:03:10.030 --> 06:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
then send them to a designated receiving
 
06:03:12.788 --> 06:03:12.798 align:start position:0%
facility on an emergency basis and then
 
06:03:17.030 --> 06:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
they are detained for up to 10 business
 
06:03:20.150 --> 06:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
days if the person goes to a designated
 
06:03:22.590 --> 06:03:22.600 align:start position:0%
receiving facility and they're found to
 
06:03:24.948 --> 06:03:24.958 align:start position:0%
have a mental illness and be a danger to
 
06:03:26.468 --> 06:03:26.478 align:start position:0%
themselves or others due to that mental
 
06:03:29.548 --> 06:03:29.558 align:start position:0%
illness then the provider can petition
 
06:03:32.390 --> 06:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
with the team for an non-emergency
 
06:03:34.948 --> 06:03:34.958 align:start position:0%
involuntary admission and that's the
 
06:03:36.590 --> 06:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
conditional discharge that you already
 
06:03:39.548 --> 06:03:39.558 align:start position:0%
heard other people speak about today um
 
06:03:41.468 --> 06:03:41.478 align:start position:0%
so that would be an involuntary
 
06:03:48.190 --> 06:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:51.628 --> 06:03:51.638 align:start position:0%
discharge outside of that um I do think
 
06:03:54.030 --> 06:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
it's important to distinguish that a
 
06:03:56.708 --> 06:03:56.718 align:start position:0%
temporary emergency involuntary
 
06:03:58.910 --> 06:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
admission order is not covered in this
 
06:04:03.310 --> 06:04:03.320 align:start position:0%
bill as it's currently written um and so
 
06:04:05.628 --> 06:04:05.638 align:start position:0%
therefore the only people who are
 
06:04:08.548 --> 06:04:08.558 align:start position:0%
adjudicated to be found to have a mental
 
06:04:10.310 --> 06:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
illness and be danger to themselves or
 
06:04:13.750 --> 06:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:15.868 --> 06:04:15.878 align:start position:0%
bill outside of the other comments that
 
06:04:17.350 --> 06:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
have been said today I don't have
 
06:04:20.110 --> 06:04:20.120 align:start position:0%
anything else to add other than to
 
06:04:23.430 --> 06:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
recount The Experience on November 17th
 
06:04:25.510 --> 06:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
as I was also there at New Hampshire
 
06:04:29.948 --> 06:04:29.958 align:start position:0%
hospital um when shortly after
 
06:04:32.788 --> 06:04:32.798 align:start position:0%
3:00 I heard a
 
06:04:36.510 --> 06:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
scream and someone sprinted into my
 
06:04:39.190 --> 06:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
office flew open my
 
06:04:41.750 --> 06:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
door ran into my office and slammed the
 
06:04:44.150 --> 06:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
door behind herself hiding behind the
 
06:04:46.150 --> 06:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
door and she
 
06:04:50.190 --> 06:04:50.200 align:start position:0%
said there's an active shooter call
 
06:04:53.830 --> 06:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
911 I grabbed my phone started calling
 
06:04:58.070 --> 06:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
911 and after I was done I realized that
 
06:05:00.548 --> 06:05:00.558 align:start position:0%
there had been no code silver called
 
06:05:02.830 --> 06:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
there had been no announcement no one
 
06:05:05.310 --> 06:05:05.320 align:start position:0%
else in this building where there's
 
06:05:08.788 --> 06:05:08.798 align:start position:0%
hundreds of employees knew what was
 
06:05:11.070 --> 06:05:11.080 align:start position:0%
happening and everyone was in
 
06:05:14.628 --> 06:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
danger so I tried to call the paging
 
06:05:17.628 --> 06:05:17.638 align:start position:0%
system and it was down we couldn't
 
06:05:17.638 --> 06:05:20.628 align:start position:0%
system and it was down we couldn't
notify

06:05:20.628 --> 06:05:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:23.270 --> 06:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
anyone I've been working
 
06:05:26.830 --> 06:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
there for over 5 years these people
 
06:05:29.230 --> 06:05:29.240 align:start position:0%
aren't just people I work with they're
 
06:05:29.240 --> 06:05:30.310 align:start position:0%
aren't just people I work with they're
my

06:05:30.310 --> 06:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
my
 
06:05:33.150 --> 06:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
family and I couldn't tell them that
 
06:05:35.948 --> 06:05:35.958 align:start position:0%
they were in danger and it was an hour
 
06:05:35.958 --> 06:05:36.830 align:start position:0%
they were in danger and it was an hour
of

06:05:36.830 --> 06:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:05:40.030 --> 06:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
that I tried to notify everyone I could
 
06:05:42.510 --> 06:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
you know trying to text people and
 
06:05:44.708 --> 06:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out ways of notifying
 
06:05:47.868 --> 06:05:47.878 align:start position:0%
you trying to remember and off the top
 
06:05:50.110 --> 06:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
of our heads the numbers to the units
 
06:05:53.590 --> 06:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
and call them to just try and tell
 
06:05:53.600 --> 06:05:55.110 align:start position:0%
and call them to just try and tell
people

06:05:55.110 --> 06:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:05:57.548 --> 06:05:57.558 align:start position:0%
and it was genuinely one of the worst
 
06:06:00.430 --> 06:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
moments of my life just not being able
 
06:06:03.468 --> 06:06:03.478 align:start position:0%
to protect people I'm a healthc care
 
06:06:06.548 --> 06:06:06.558 align:start position:0%
professional to help people and I
 
06:06:09.110 --> 06:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't for an hour I just had to sit
 
06:06:14.868 --> 06:06:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:17.910 --> 06:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
danger and then after an hour we were
 
06:06:23.150 --> 06:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
evacuated and it it wasn't better and we
 
06:06:26.708 --> 06:06:26.718 align:start position:0%
were all in a room big room I suppose um
 
06:06:28.150 --> 06:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
many of us crowded in a hallway or
 
06:06:32.510 --> 06:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
outside in the cold um and then that's
 
06:06:34.670 --> 06:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
when we found out
 
06:06:38.430 --> 06:06:38.440 align:start position:0%
that Chief hos had
 
06:06:38.440 --> 06:06:41.310 align:start position:0%
that Chief hos had
died

06:06:41.310 --> 06:06:41.320 align:start position:0%
died
 
06:06:44.628 --> 06:06:44.638 align:start position:0%
and that was someone that many of
 
06:06:48.948 --> 06:06:48.958 align:start position:0%
us saw almost every day um leaving the
 
06:06:48.958 --> 06:06:52.830 align:start position:0%
us saw almost every day um leaving the
facility

06:06:52.830 --> 06:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:58.190 --> 06:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
and someone a coworker was murdered
 
06:07:01.310 --> 06:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
100t from my office while I stood there
 
06:07:04.230 --> 06:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
and then I had to sit there while other
 
06:07:05.910 --> 06:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
people I loved were in danger and I
 
06:07:10.590 --> 06:07:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:13.750 --> 06:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
them if something like Bradley's law had
 
06:07:16.350 --> 06:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
existed it's possible that that wouldn't
 
06:07:22.070 --> 06:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:26.548 --> 06:07:26.558 align:start position:0%
and so I urge you to vote ought to pass
 
06:07:30.150 --> 06:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
to try and prevent similar tragedies
 
06:07:34.110 --> 06:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
from occurring in the future thank
 
06:07:36.230 --> 06:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
you thank you doctor on behalf of the
 
06:07:37.788 --> 06:07:37.798 align:start position:0%
committee please accept our condolences
 
06:07:39.868 --> 06:07:39.878 align:start position:0%
for your loss thank you there won't be
 
06:07:39.878 --> 06:07:44.750 align:start position:0%
for your loss thank you there won't be
any

06:07:44.750 --> 06:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:55.830 --> 06:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:55.840 --> 06:08:09.910 align:start position:0%
 
Dean

06:08:09.910 --> 06:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:11.548 --> 06:08:11.558 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
06:08:16.910 --> 06:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
after a long day um Penny Dean
 
06:08:21.150 --> 06:08:21.160 align:start position:0%
yeah and I oppose this bill for two well
 
06:08:23.430 --> 06:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
several reasons the first reason of
 
06:08:24.830 --> 06:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
course is
 
06:08:27.590 --> 06:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
ideological but the second reason is
 
06:08:30.190 --> 06:08:30.200 align:start position:0%
mechanical and
 
06:08:33.750 --> 06:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
practical this bill is poorly drafted so
 
06:08:35.030 --> 06:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
even if you
 
06:08:38.070 --> 06:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
support the concept and even if you
 
06:08:41.788 --> 06:08:41.798 align:start position:0%
support what what it purports to
 
06:08:45.830 --> 06:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
do you've got huge problems with it now
 
06:08:48.150 --> 06:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
I have a copy of the amendment and I was
 
06:08:50.190 --> 06:08:50.200 align:start position:0%
trying to follow the bouncing
 
06:08:52.830 --> 06:08:52.840 align:start position:0%
ball and make sure I'm speaking to what
 
06:08:55.910 --> 06:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
I believe is the amendment and not the
 
06:08:59.030 --> 06:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
original bill so if I make a mistake I
 
06:09:01.910 --> 06:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
apologize but I'm trying to follow which
 
06:09:04.868 --> 06:09:04.878 align:start position:0%
one replaces
 
06:09:08.430 --> 06:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
what and so I want to start talking
 
06:09:13.150 --> 06:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
about on page one how they never on page
 
06:09:16.548 --> 06:09:16.558 align:start position:0%
one is that this applies to people who
 
06:09:18.990 --> 06:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
it's a danger to
 
06:09:21.708 --> 06:09:21.718 align:start position:0%
themselves and I have a huge problem
 
06:09:24.030 --> 06:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
with this
 
06:09:26.708 --> 06:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
because each person has a right to make
 
06:09:29.628 --> 06:09:29.638 align:start position:0%
their own autonomic decisions I mean
 
06:09:32.070 --> 06:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
there are those who cry say listen women
 
06:09:33.750 --> 06:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
have a right to make choices over their
 
06:09:35.628 --> 06:09:35.638 align:start position:0%
own body well if I have a right to make
 
06:09:37.670 --> 06:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
a choice over my own body the womb I
 
06:09:39.110 --> 06:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
have a right to make a choice over all
 
06:09:42.708 --> 06:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
of my body what I do or what I don't do
 
06:09:45.910 --> 06:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
so you might think you know me running
 
06:09:48.110 --> 06:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
out and banging my head against the wall
 
06:09:49.830 --> 06:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
of my house is really bad and it's going
 
06:09:52.708 --> 06:09:52.718 align:start position:0%
to cause a brain injury but that's my
 
06:09:54.948 --> 06:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
right you might mind think it's another
 
06:09:57.070 --> 06:09:57.080 align:start position:0%
hagendaz when I need to lose a few might
 
06:10:00.548 --> 06:10:00.558 align:start position:0%
be bad but again my body my
 
06:10:03.110 --> 06:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
choice and so I want you to consider
 
06:10:07.190 --> 06:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
that sometimes people are if you will
 
06:10:09.628 --> 06:10:09.638 align:start position:0%
would come under this bill because of a
 
06:10:11.868 --> 06:10:11.878 align:start position:0%
danger to themselves not a danger of
 
06:10:16.230 --> 06:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
others and that's a big big deal but
 
06:10:19.110 --> 06:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
secondly to think that anybody can't get
 
06:10:20.910 --> 06:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
guns elsewhere I think someone should
 
06:10:22.230 --> 06:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
get in the car with me we'll go to
 
06:10:24.628 --> 06:10:24.638 align:start position:0%
Manchester the city of your choice I bet
 
06:10:26.270 --> 06:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
within 10 minutes we can score some
 
06:10:28.390 --> 06:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
cocaine heroin or any other illicit
 
06:10:30.990 --> 06:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
substance you want they're illegal get
 
06:10:33.110 --> 06:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
them no problem just have to find the
 
06:10:35.390 --> 06:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
right street corner it's the same way
 
06:10:37.468 --> 06:10:37.478 align:start position:0%
with these drugs doesn't make or I'm
 
06:10:38.948 --> 06:10:38.958 align:start position:0%
sorry some way with Firearms there's
 
06:10:40.350 --> 06:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
still people who are going to sell
 
06:10:43.590 --> 06:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
illegal Firearms no matter
 
06:10:46.548 --> 06:10:46.558 align:start position:0%
what but the other thing you have to
 
06:10:50.390 --> 06:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
look up at is that this allows the
 
06:10:52.990 --> 06:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
current bill if I'm reading the version
 
06:10:57.468 --> 06:10:57.478 align:start position:0%
correctly that I have on page two line
 
06:11:02.430 --> 06:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:05.708 --> 06:11:05.718 align:start position:0%
supon to order that the person's
 
06:11:08.390 --> 06:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
information be transmitted to the next
 
06:11:10.910 --> 06:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
system I have a huge problem with this
 
06:11:12.788 --> 06:11:12.798 align:start position:0%
so we supposedly are going to rely on
 
06:11:15.270 --> 06:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
the doctors we're going to lie rely on
 
06:11:18.110 --> 06:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
the court whoever's on the other side so
 
06:11:20.070 --> 06:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
anybody in the world gets to make a
 
06:11:21.788 --> 06:11:21.798 align:start position:0%
decision except for
 
06:11:23.830 --> 06:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
me about
 
06:11:27.030 --> 06:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
me I don't think that's Equitable or
 
06:11:30.230 --> 06:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
Fair the other problem that I have and
 
06:11:33.468 --> 06:11:33.478 align:start position:0%
it's a very serious mechanical problem
 
06:11:38.548 --> 06:11:38.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:41.708 --> 06:11:41.718 align:start position:0%
15 15 I'm making sure I'm following the
 
06:11:44.548 --> 06:11:44.558 align:start position:0%
original verses the amended um it's the
 
06:11:47.150 --> 06:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
original version I think that still is
 
06:11:50.350 --> 06:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
those parts page 2 line 15 says talk
 
06:11:53.270 --> 06:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
about court transmitting it to the
 
06:11:56.510 --> 06:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety for IND um entering
 
06:11:58.110 --> 06:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
to the nxs
 
06:12:01.750 --> 06:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
indices I think this is such a huge job
 
06:12:03.868 --> 06:12:03.878 align:start position:0%
that when I used to have employees in my
 
06:12:05.788 --> 06:12:05.798 align:start position:0%
office there were certain things that
 
06:12:08.270 --> 06:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
only I would do because the buck stops
 
06:12:11.110 --> 06:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
here so the question is and I'm in no
 
06:12:14.030 --> 06:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
way maligning any hardworking Court
 
06:12:16.708 --> 06:12:16.718 align:start position:0%
employees but do they understand the
 
06:12:19.548 --> 06:12:19.558 align:start position:0%
implications of incorrectly faxing or
 
06:12:22.868 --> 06:12:22.878 align:start position:0%
transmitting the wrong name to the Nyx
 
06:12:26.708 --> 06:12:26.718 align:start position:0%
indices and I would say they maybe don't
 
06:12:29.468 --> 06:12:29.478 align:start position:0%
so we don't have a designated person
 
06:12:32.468 --> 06:12:32.478 align:start position:0%
here that's doing this for example with
 
06:12:35.070 --> 06:12:35.080 align:start position:0%
petitions to anull and nulled files
 
06:12:37.830 --> 06:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
those are kept in a lot clerk's office
 
06:12:39.990 --> 06:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
and on the electronic system only
 
06:12:42.030 --> 06:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
certain people with passwords can see
 
06:12:44.628 --> 06:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
those are we going to let any front
 
06:12:47.468 --> 06:12:47.478 align:start position:0%
office clerk backs these things over
 
06:12:49.670 --> 06:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
electronically send them over what if
 
06:12:52.430 --> 06:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
they mistakingly hear what the judge
 
06:12:54.990 --> 06:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
said that's that's a huge deal this has
 
06:12:58.990 --> 06:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
to be handled by a specific designated
 
06:13:02.230 --> 06:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
highlevel person that really understands
 
06:13:06.230 --> 06:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:11.030 --> 06:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:14.830 --> 06:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
at lines this is on page two still lines
 
06:13:19.070 --> 06:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
17 through lines 23 particularly lines
 
06:13:20.910 --> 06:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
22 through
 
06:13:24.150 --> 06:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
23 and I know there's been some changes
 
06:13:26.468 --> 06:13:26.478 align:start position:0%
that's part of the amended version but
 
06:13:28.948 --> 06:13:28.958 align:start position:0%
it still doesn't solve the problem we
 
06:13:31.270 --> 06:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
have a couple three things here it is
 
06:13:34.868 --> 06:13:34.878 align:start position:0%
perfectly lawful in this country I could
 
06:13:36.910 --> 06:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
find a convicted felon boyfriend or
 
06:13:39.190 --> 06:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
husband tomorrow morning at 8:00 they
 
06:13:41.910 --> 06:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
could live in my house full with my guns
 
06:13:45.030 --> 06:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
and ammunition I would just have to keep
 
06:13:48.548 --> 06:13:48.558 align:start position:0%
them inaccessible to that felon in other
 
06:13:50.310 --> 06:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
words I can still have my guns I can
 
06:13:52.350 --> 06:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
still have my ammunition my powder my
 
06:13:54.708 --> 06:13:54.718 align:start position:0%
primer my brass they just have to be
 
06:13:57.670 --> 06:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
inaccessible to that person
 
06:14:00.390 --> 06:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here in taking this
 
06:14:03.310 --> 06:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
person's guns and it's very
 
06:14:05.910 --> 06:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
explicit they cannot be in a house with
 
06:14:08.030 --> 06:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
guns so you're going to treat a mentally
 
06:14:11.110 --> 06:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
ill person less than you would a
 
06:14:11.120 --> 06:14:12.350 align:start position:0%
ill person less than you would a
convicted

06:14:12.350 --> 06:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
convicted
 
06:14:15.350 --> 06:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
felon that's got to be wrong on so many
 
06:14:19.310 --> 06:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
levels so many levels because we talk
 
06:14:21.948 --> 06:14:21.958 align:start position:0%
about the authority the court is going
 
06:14:25.230 --> 06:14:25.240 align:start position:0%
to have to take their firearms so what
 
06:14:26.830 --> 06:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
if that felon's fire
 
06:14:28.788 --> 06:14:28.798 align:start position:0%
Firearms or I'm sorry what if the
 
06:14:32.230 --> 06:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
mentally ill person's Firearms are in my
 
06:14:35.070 --> 06:14:35.080 align:start position:0%
house so the police according to this
 
06:14:36.990 --> 06:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
are going to have right to come into my
 
06:14:40.110 --> 06:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
house and go through my house there has
 
06:14:42.468 --> 06:14:42.478 align:start position:0%
to be specifications that if it isn't
 
06:14:44.670 --> 06:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
the mentally ill person's house that
 
06:14:46.150 --> 06:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
they've got to get a warrant there has
 
06:14:49.030 --> 06:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
to be some sort of hearing and finding
 
06:14:51.628 --> 06:14:51.638 align:start position:0%
because a lot of mentally ill people
 
06:14:53.230 --> 06:14:53.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes end up on the street and
 
06:14:55.070 --> 06:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes they end up couch serving
 
06:14:56.708 --> 06:14:56.718 align:start position:0%
couch surfing rather
 
06:14:58.670 --> 06:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
through the homes of friends and family
 
06:15:00.230 --> 06:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
because they simply some of them can't
 
06:15:02.708 --> 06:15:02.718 align:start position:0%
maintain employment or whatever and so
 
06:15:04.910 --> 06:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
that'll be a true case of no good deed
 
06:15:04.920 --> 06:15:06.190 align:start position:0%
that'll be a true case of no good deed
goes

06:15:06.190 --> 06:15:06.200 align:start position:0%
goes
 
06:15:08.670 --> 06:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
unpunished you've got to make sure and
 
06:15:11.590 --> 06:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
this legislation does not do it to find
 
06:15:14.030 --> 06:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
out if you're going to Johnny Joe's
 
06:15:16.110 --> 06:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
house where they're couch surfing that
 
06:15:18.230 --> 06:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
you need a warrant and ask Johnny Joe
 
06:15:19.628 --> 06:15:19.638 align:start position:0%
first you're going to come through and
 
06:15:22.030 --> 06:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
take my guns too because that's what
 
06:15:22.040 --> 06:15:23.070 align:start position:0%
take my guns too because that's what
this

06:15:23.070 --> 06:15:23.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:15:25.708 --> 06:15:25.718 align:start position:0%
says just because I let him stay in my
 
06:15:27.150 --> 06:15:27.160 align:start position:0%
house or I'm my
 
06:15:31.590 --> 06:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
couch you have to look further um we
 
06:15:36.310 --> 06:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
look on lines 2425 and 26 of page
 
06:15:38.868 --> 06:15:38.878 align:start position:0%
two and it says law enforcement shall
 
06:15:40.510 --> 06:15:40.520 align:start position:0%
carry out the order of the Court as soon
 
06:15:44.910 --> 06:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
as possible but in no cases 48 hours
 
06:15:47.510 --> 06:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
after the order was
 
06:15:50.430 --> 06:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
issued that is a very short period of
 
06:15:54.190 --> 06:15:54.200 align:start position:0%
time and we're still not talking about
 
06:15:56.150 --> 06:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
how that is going to be accomplished
 
06:15:58.628 --> 06:15:58.638 align:start position:0%
because again they come in with a no
 
06:16:00.070 --> 06:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
knock warrant is this going to be a
 
06:16:02.190 --> 06:16:02.200 align:start position:0%
nighttime warrant there's a huge
 
06:16:03.788 --> 06:16:03.798 align:start position:0%
difference when you apply for a search
 
06:16:05.990 --> 06:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
warrant a judge has a right to say if
 
06:16:08.708 --> 06:16:08.718 align:start position:0%
it's a daytime warrant or a nighttime
 
06:16:10.708 --> 06:16:10.718 align:start position:0%
warrant I think they should be only
 
06:16:12.750 --> 06:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
daytime warrants allowed number one in
 
06:16:15.670 --> 06:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
this situation number two I don't think
 
06:16:17.868 --> 06:16:17.878 align:start position:0%
no knock warrant should be allowed here
 
06:16:20.110 --> 06:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
no knock warrants are dangerous and it's
 
06:16:21.590 --> 06:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
presumed they're no knock they should be
 
06:16:24.270 --> 06:16:24.280 align:start position:0%
knock warrants that's a huge difference
 
06:16:28.030 --> 06:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
if it's your house but here's the other
 
06:16:31.948 --> 06:16:31.958 align:start position:0%
issue what if the person again because
 
06:16:34.070 --> 06:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
mentally people do make mistakes or
 
06:16:36.628 --> 06:16:36.638 align:start position:0%
deliberately do things do essentially
 
06:16:39.070 --> 06:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
like swatting does say their guns are
 
06:16:40.708 --> 06:16:40.718 align:start position:0%
located at my house and I don't even
 
06:16:42.948 --> 06:16:42.958 align:start position:0%
know them if we don't have a hearing
 
06:16:45.230 --> 06:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
procedure we have cops coming and
 
06:16:48.990 --> 06:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
knocking or quite frankly breaking down
 
06:16:51.230 --> 06:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
my door to get guns for a person who
 
06:16:54.110 --> 06:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
never lived there we're just taking that
 
06:16:56.190 --> 06:16:56.200 align:start position:0%
person's word and that person we're
 
06:16:58.110 --> 06:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
claiming is so Mill we got to lock them
 
06:16:59.868 --> 06:16:59.878 align:start position:0%
up and we're going to take their word
 
06:17:02.350 --> 06:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
for something like this there has to be
 
06:17:06.868 --> 06:17:06.878 align:start position:0%
some verification there's no procedures
 
06:17:10.390 --> 06:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
there the other issue which is really
 
06:17:12.948 --> 06:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
huge and one of the other Witnesses test
 
06:17:15.150 --> 06:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
touched upon it is this is all
 
06:17:18.430 --> 06:17:18.440 align:start position:0%
contingent on approval from
 
06:17:22.708 --> 06:17:22.718 align:start position:0%
ATF ATF speaks with fork tongue and that
 
06:17:24.990 --> 06:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
is the kindest thing I can say about
 
06:17:30.030 --> 06:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
them ATF over the years has changed
 
06:17:31.670 --> 06:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
their position on what was called street
 
06:17:33.990 --> 06:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
sweepers and they changed it in such a
 
06:17:35.150 --> 06:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
way and you have to understand the
 
06:17:36.868 --> 06:17:36.878 align:start position:0%
mechanical thing people went to normal
 
06:17:39.150 --> 06:17:39.160 align:start position:0%
gun stores bought street sweepers had
 
06:17:41.310 --> 06:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
them for years and if you weren't part
 
06:17:43.510 --> 06:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
of the gun Community or checked regular
 
06:17:45.868 --> 06:17:45.878 align:start position:0%
gun regulations you didn't know that you
 
06:17:48.510 --> 06:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
had 30 days from the date they gave an
 
06:17:49.750 --> 06:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
wait wait strike that I can't remember
 
06:17:51.430 --> 06:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
it's 30 days or the number of days but a
 
06:17:54.270 --> 06:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
very few number of days from when ATF
 
06:17:56.868 --> 06:17:56.878 align:start position:0%
made the announcements to register
 
06:17:58.590 --> 06:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
your street
 
06:18:01.430 --> 06:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
sweeper as an NFA device or it was
 
06:18:01.440 --> 06:18:02.548 align:start position:0%
sweeper as an NFA device or it was
considered

06:18:02.548 --> 06:18:02.558 align:start position:0%
considered
 
06:18:04.670 --> 06:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
contraband and after that you couldn't
 
06:18:06.750 --> 06:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
register it and if you got caught with
 
06:18:09.030 --> 06:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
it felon here you go Federal felon
 
06:18:10.628 --> 06:18:10.638 align:start position:0%
because you're in possession of
 
06:18:12.708 --> 06:18:12.718 align:start position:0%
prohibited property no reasonable person
 
06:18:14.190 --> 06:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
would have ever thought that would have
 
06:18:16.868 --> 06:18:16.878 align:start position:0%
happened but worse yet the ATF has
 
06:18:19.628 --> 06:18:19.638 align:start position:0%
issued opinion letters to Federal Farms
 
06:18:22.590 --> 06:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
licenses and manufacturers said ATF were
 
06:18:24.948 --> 06:18:24.958 align:start position:0%
building these um they did it with the
 
06:18:27.070 --> 06:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
arm brace they did it with the reset
 
06:18:29.430 --> 06:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
triggers and most recently cases I'm
 
06:18:32.110 --> 06:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
working on in federal court in Boston
 
06:18:33.310 --> 06:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
they did it with what's called
 
06:18:35.350 --> 06:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
suppressor wipes where the manufacturers
 
06:18:37.230 --> 06:18:37.240 align:start position:0%
went to ATF and said this is what we
 
06:18:39.708 --> 06:18:39.718 align:start position:0%
want to do please give us written
 
06:18:41.708 --> 06:18:41.718 align:start position:0%
guidance so we can make sure what we're
 
06:18:44.030 --> 06:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturing is within the law they
 
06:18:45.910 --> 06:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
gave them written guidance they said you
 
06:18:48.230 --> 06:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
have to apply for a form one and build
 
06:18:51.310 --> 06:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
your suppressors ATF is now about a year
 
06:18:53.510 --> 06:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
later some two or 3 years later we're
 
06:18:55.230 --> 06:18:55.240 align:start position:0%
calling those form ones that they
 
06:18:57.788 --> 06:18:57.798 align:start position:0%
approved saying we changed our
 
06:19:01.070 --> 06:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
mind they do they have years and years
 
06:19:03.270 --> 06:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
of history of not honoring their words
 
06:19:05.628 --> 06:19:05.638 align:start position:0%
with nothing changing on the other party
 
06:19:06.990 --> 06:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
side and this is what's important to
 
06:19:09.110 --> 06:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
know there were no changes in the wipes
 
06:19:10.628 --> 06:19:10.638 align:start position:0%
there were no changes in the
 
06:19:14.190 --> 06:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and so we are going to now
 
06:19:17.750 --> 06:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
put our citizens names in a system where
 
06:19:20.788 --> 06:19:20.798 align:start position:0%
ATF can change their mind about what's
 
06:19:22.548 --> 06:19:22.558 align:start position:0%
acceptable they did that with Greg
 
06:19:25.070 --> 06:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
Dupont in Massachusetts they first said
 
06:19:26.468 --> 06:19:26.478 align:start position:0%
it's acceptable
 
06:19:28.468 --> 06:19:28.478 align:start position:0%
that the Firearms licensing review board
 
06:19:31.230 --> 06:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
restore his right to carry his second
 
06:19:32.990 --> 06:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
amendment rights they then changed their
 
06:19:35.590 --> 06:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
mind years later for no reason so what
 
06:19:37.548 --> 06:19:37.558 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to say is we are playing a
 
06:19:40.510 --> 06:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
very very dangerous game here when we
 
06:19:43.510 --> 06:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
rely on ATF to say this is going to be
 
06:19:45.310 --> 06:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
okay and that our process and our
 
06:19:48.350 --> 06:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
procedure is okay because here's the
 
06:19:52.948 --> 06:19:52.958 align:start position:0%
problem once you get people's names into
 
06:19:56.190 --> 06:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
the federal indices we cannot make them
 
06:19:58.788 --> 06:19:58.798 align:start position:0%
pull them out and sometimes they refuse
 
06:20:01.468 --> 06:20:01.478 align:start position:0%
to pull them out so you have to think
 
06:20:02.830 --> 06:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
about what are we going to do for these
 
06:20:07.468 --> 06:20:07.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:12.350 --> 06:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
forever if you go to the next p i want
 
06:20:13.750 --> 06:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure I'm following the pages
 
06:20:17.548 --> 06:20:17.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:20.590 --> 06:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
um the other things the other problems
 
06:20:22.750 --> 06:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
that we have at least from my
 
06:20:26.510 --> 06:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
perspective as a practical problem
 
06:20:29.468 --> 06:20:29.478 align:start position:0%
is at these hearings there's nothing
 
06:20:30.670 --> 06:20:30.680 align:start position:0%
here that says they're going to be
 
06:20:34.910 --> 06:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
closed hearings or confidential by law
 
06:20:37.830 --> 06:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
so just like these hearings here or
 
06:20:40.150 --> 06:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
courtrooms they are public anybody in
 
06:20:42.948 --> 06:20:42.958 align:start position:0%
the public can walk in and walk out and
 
06:20:46.670 --> 06:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
hear and see everything that's happening
 
06:20:48.628 --> 06:20:48.638 align:start position:0%
so you are now going to take this
 
06:20:51.948 --> 06:20:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:54.708 --> 06:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
confidential and you're going to make it
 
06:20:56.310 --> 06:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
public cuz you're going to Force these
 
06:20:58.390 --> 06:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
people to make it public if and when
 
06:21:00.270 --> 06:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
they want their rights
 
06:21:03.990 --> 06:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
restored and so you look at that and you
 
06:21:07.788 --> 06:21:07.798 align:start position:0%
say why do I want to make this
 
06:21:10.390 --> 06:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
public and that's going to be my only
 
06:21:13.548 --> 06:21:13.558 align:start position:0%
chance to get my rights back but I think
 
06:21:15.510 --> 06:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
the other thing that always has amazed
 
06:21:19.670 --> 06:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
me and it's disgusted me and upset me is
 
06:21:21.230 --> 06:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
everyone makes a big deal about oh they
 
06:21:22.788 --> 06:21:22.798 align:start position:0%
have to be locked up by clear and
 
06:21:25.468 --> 06:21:25.478 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence we don't lock people
 
06:21:27.190 --> 06:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
up in the state prison other than Beyond
 
06:21:29.990 --> 06:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
A Reasonable Doubt last time I checked
 
06:21:32.230 --> 06:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
but yet we lock these people up and
 
06:21:33.910 --> 06:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
that's what you're doing if any Of You'
 
06:21:35.390 --> 06:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
have never been to the New Hampshire
 
06:21:38.510 --> 06:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
hospital or conquered Hospital their
 
06:21:40.708 --> 06:21:40.718 align:start position:0%
special a w you should go there you
 
06:21:42.708 --> 06:21:42.718 align:start position:0%
won't like it
 
06:21:45.070 --> 06:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
much and
 
06:21:48.150 --> 06:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
say that standard is good enough to put
 
06:21:50.990 --> 06:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
these people away and you look
 
06:21:53.590 --> 06:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
about and I'm asking myself when they
 
06:21:55.628 --> 06:21:55.638 align:start position:0%
say the emergency inv voluntary of
 
06:21:57.190 --> 06:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
admission is not part of this well
 
06:22:00.070 --> 06:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
that's not quite telling the whole truth
 
06:22:03.150 --> 06:22:03.160 align:start position:0%
because the emergency one becomes a
 
06:22:05.510 --> 06:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
regular one after the next process and
 
06:22:07.948 --> 06:22:07.958 align:start position:0%
procedure and it becomes one so the
 
06:22:10.788 --> 06:22:10.798 align:start position:0%
initial one yes is not covered but that
 
06:22:13.230 --> 06:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
morphs into second ones and I argue that
 
06:22:16.750 --> 06:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
it is covered by this so to say the
 
06:22:19.350 --> 06:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
initial one isn't as technically true
 
06:22:21.510 --> 06:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
but it's not telling the whole story and
 
06:22:23.030 --> 06:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
that's what you have to do in these type
 
06:22:26.628 --> 06:22:26.638 align:start position:0%
of things is tell the whole story
 
06:22:29.190 --> 06:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
the next thing we look at is Page
 
06:22:32.628 --> 06:22:32.638 align:start position:0%
four and we look at lines
 
06:22:35.708 --> 06:22:35.718 align:start position:0%
two I want someone from the Department
 
06:22:38.110 --> 06:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services Behavioral
 
06:22:41.150 --> 06:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
Health evaluating my mental health the
 
06:22:43.070 --> 06:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
same day I want Sarah Brady and Gabby
 
06:22:45.788 --> 06:22:45.798 align:start position:0%
gord's doing it you got no
 
06:22:48.590 --> 06:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
chance because there are some people
 
06:22:51.628 --> 06:22:51.638 align:start position:0%
that think the mere thought that we love
 
06:22:53.150 --> 06:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
guns is
 
06:22:55.670 --> 06:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
wrong and particularly in the medical
 
06:22:57.070 --> 06:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
Community there seems to be a high
 
06:22:59.708 --> 06:22:59.718 align:start position:0%
number of those individuals but here's
 
06:23:02.150 --> 06:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
what I'm asking myself as a practical
 
06:23:04.708 --> 06:23:04.718 align:start position:0%
matter and it goes back to
 
06:23:07.070 --> 06:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
money and a lot of these people don't
 
06:23:07.080 --> 06:23:08.990 align:start position:0%
money and a lot of these people don't
have

06:23:08.990 --> 06:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:23:11.670 --> 06:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
money if we want an independent
 
06:23:14.788 --> 06:23:14.798 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist to evaluate our client and
 
06:23:17.788 --> 06:23:17.798 align:start position:0%
to say in open court with essentially
 
06:23:20.030 --> 06:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
their licenses on the
 
06:23:22.750 --> 06:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
line that they're not going to act in a
 
06:23:24.948 --> 06:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
manner dangerous to Public Safety I'm
 
06:23:26.468 --> 06:23:26.478 align:start position:0%
going to suggest just a couple three
 
06:23:28.110 --> 06:23:28.120 align:start position:0%
things will happen and I will bet a
 
06:23:30.190 --> 06:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
nickel on it and I rarely bet my hard
 
06:23:30.200 --> 06:23:31.150 align:start position:0%
nickel on it and I rarely bet my hard
earn

06:23:31.150 --> 06:23:31.160 align:start position:0%
earn
 
06:23:34.390 --> 06:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
nickels and that is that somebody who's
 
06:23:36.590 --> 06:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
anti-gun trying to shut down the gun
 
06:23:38.948 --> 06:23:38.958 align:start position:0%
people again are going to go to the
 
06:23:40.750 --> 06:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
malpractice carriers that write
 
06:23:42.430 --> 06:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
malpractice insurance for these
 
06:23:44.708 --> 06:23:44.718 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists and psychologists and
 
06:23:46.390 --> 06:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
they're going to ask a question on their
 
06:23:49.628 --> 06:23:49.638 align:start position:0%
malpractice renewal do you do these
 
06:23:52.230 --> 06:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
types of hearings and they're either
 
06:23:54.548 --> 06:23:54.558 align:start position:0%
going to refuse to insure them or they
 
06:23:56.510 --> 06:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
are going to escalate their rates
 
06:23:59.110 --> 06:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
through the roof because if you're an
 
06:24:01.110 --> 06:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier who tends to be
 
06:24:03.030 --> 06:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
cautious and wants to make a lot of
 
06:24:06.390 --> 06:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
money ask yourself what you're going to
 
06:24:08.590 --> 06:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
say to your friendly psychiatrist who is
 
06:24:10.948 --> 06:24:10.958 align:start position:0%
now writing evaluations and going to
 
06:24:12.590 --> 06:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
court and testifying as an expert
 
06:24:15.030 --> 06:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
witness that you believe these people
 
06:24:16.390 --> 06:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
are now
 
06:24:19.390 --> 06:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
okay I think that's a huge thing so how
 
06:24:21.830 --> 06:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
many psychiatrists and psychologists are
 
06:24:23.310 --> 06:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
we going to be able to find who are
 
06:24:26.030 --> 06:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
going to work for us and testify and at
 
06:24:26.040 --> 06:24:26.990 align:start position:0%
going to work for us and testify and at
what

06:24:26.990 --> 06:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
what
 
06:24:30.910 --> 06:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
price that's one thing um the next thing
 
06:24:32.948 --> 06:24:32.958 align:start position:0%
that I think is really problematic on
 
06:24:38.948 --> 06:24:38.958 align:start position:0%
page 4 is lines 11 12 and
 
06:24:42.390 --> 06:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
13 and they want the court to review the
 
06:24:44.788 --> 06:24:44.798 align:start position:0%
circumstances minimum mental health and
 
06:24:47.750 --> 06:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
any criminal record so you're not asking
 
06:24:49.948 --> 06:24:49.958 align:start position:0%
the court actually you're not mandating
 
06:24:52.390 --> 06:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
that the court can review only this
 
06:24:54.830 --> 06:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
instance that brought them there you're
 
06:24:56.948 --> 06:24:56.958 align:start position:0%
letting the court review their entire
 
06:25:00.350 --> 06:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
criminal record you're letting the court
 
06:25:03.628 --> 06:25:03.638 align:start position:0%
review the reputation and num these two
 
06:25:07.468 --> 06:25:07.478 align:start position:0%
words here character witness and
 
06:25:10.390 --> 06:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
character evidence lawyers go by the
 
06:25:11.868 --> 06:25:11.878 align:start position:0%
rules of evidence and a lot of people
 
06:25:13.430 --> 06:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
don't know by The Rules of Evidence but
 
06:25:14.708 --> 06:25:14.718 align:start position:0%
the Rules of Evidence are all these
 
06:25:17.468 --> 06:25:17.478 align:start position:0%
court rules that allow what comes in and
 
06:25:20.270 --> 06:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
comes out and character and reputation
 
06:25:22.788 --> 06:25:22.798 align:start position:0%
evidence with certain exceptions are
 
06:25:24.750 --> 06:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
like the things you're just you you try
 
06:25:26.150 --> 06:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
and bring those in and everybody's on
 
06:25:27.708 --> 06:25:27.718 align:start position:0%
their feet going that's reputation
 
06:25:29.750 --> 06:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's character that's propensity with
 
06:25:31.310 --> 06:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
exceptions there's always
 
06:25:33.150 --> 06:25:33.160 align:start position:0%
exceptions and that's what you're going
 
06:25:34.590 --> 06:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
to bring in so are we going to have
 
06:25:37.350 --> 06:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
swearing contests here where if I can
 
06:25:39.070 --> 06:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
line up 10 people that says I'm a good
 
06:25:40.990 --> 06:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
girl now and I'm all better and you can
 
06:25:43.110 --> 06:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
line up 50 that say I'm still some crazy
 
06:25:45.548 --> 06:25:45.558 align:start position:0%
old woman does that mean I don't get my
 
06:25:48.628 --> 06:25:48.638 align:start position:0%
gun rights back I mean really what are
 
06:25:52.510 --> 06:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
we looking at here and it's just really
 
06:25:52.520 --> 06:25:53.750 align:start position:0%
we looking at here and it's just really
there's

06:25:53.750 --> 06:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
there's
 
06:25:55.868 --> 06:25:55.878 align:start position:0%
no specific
 
06:25:58.350 --> 06:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
times about how quickly they have to
 
06:26:00.990 --> 06:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
have these hearings there's no specific
 
06:26:04.310 --> 06:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
limits and how long they can be judges
 
06:26:06.070 --> 06:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
want to rush things in and out in 15
 
06:26:08.110 --> 06:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
minutes short on court time I sometimes
 
06:26:10.708 --> 06:26:10.718 align:start position:0%
want 3 days for a hearing to bring an
 
06:26:13.830 --> 06:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
adequate record forward we don't have
 
06:26:16.230 --> 06:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
any specific timelines the other things
 
06:26:18.230 --> 06:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
that courts say all the time in all
 
06:26:21.548 --> 06:26:21.558 align:start position:0%
fairness to them is these are statutory
 
06:26:23.510 --> 06:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
things we have to have this hearing this
 
06:26:25.030 --> 06:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
hearing and this hearing with in this
 
06:26:26.910 --> 06:26:26.920 align:start position:0%
mon Mone days anything that's not
 
06:26:28.548 --> 06:26:28.558 align:start position:0%
statutory you get pushed out in the
 
06:26:30.548 --> 06:26:30.558 align:start position:0%
weeds cuz we don't have to have your
 
06:26:32.948 --> 06:26:32.958 align:start position:0%
hearing within days so what are we going
 
06:26:35.190 --> 06:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
to have here 5 years later we get a
 
06:26:37.788 --> 06:26:37.798 align:start position:0%
hearing one year later I don't know will
 
06:26:39.270 --> 06:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
that be enough stress on someone who's
 
06:26:41.750 --> 06:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
trying to get their firearm rights back
 
06:26:43.390 --> 06:26:43.400 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
06:26:46.990 --> 06:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
know the other thing that you really
 
06:26:48.708 --> 06:26:48.718 align:start position:0%
want to look at which
 
06:26:52.708 --> 06:26:52.718 align:start position:0%
is laughable in a black humor such away
 
06:26:57.150 --> 06:26:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:00.310 --> 06:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
if the final court order grants relief
 
06:27:02.590 --> 06:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
the court shall as soon as possible
 
06:27:05.150 --> 06:27:05.160 align:start position:0%
request that the Nicks entry be redacted
 
06:27:06.910 --> 06:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
and shall notify the United States
 
06:27:09.070 --> 06:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
Attorney General that the basis for the
 
06:27:11.670 --> 06:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
record being made available no
 
06:27:11.680 --> 06:27:14.110 align:start position:0%
record being made available no
longer

06:27:14.110 --> 06:27:14.120 align:start position:0%
longer
 
06:27:17.708 --> 06:27:17.718 align:start position:0%
applies that's not how we do things
 
06:27:21.510 --> 06:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
now right now they have um in New
 
06:27:22.750 --> 06:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they report it through the
 
06:27:24.270 --> 06:27:24.280 align:start position:0%
state police criminal justice
 
06:27:26.030 --> 06:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
information service
 
06:27:28.430 --> 06:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
and I've asked a million times over the
 
06:27:31.510 --> 06:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
past 20 years if data is exchanged
 
06:27:35.468 --> 06:27:35.478 align:start position:0%
hourly daily by the minute every 24
 
06:27:37.548 --> 06:27:37.558 align:start position:0%
hours I have never been able to get an
 
06:27:40.150 --> 06:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
answer so how frequently that data is
 
06:27:42.708 --> 06:27:42.718 align:start position:0%
exchanged I do not know I would love to
 
06:27:45.030 --> 06:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
know I've never been able to learn that
 
06:27:47.430 --> 06:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is I've got to tell
 
06:27:49.270 --> 06:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
you if you sit at a court sometimes and
 
06:27:52.150 --> 06:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
a DVP comes in they are at that fax
 
06:27:54.628 --> 06:27:54.638 align:start position:0%
machine faxing overtaking the guy's guns
 
06:27:57.548 --> 06:27:57.558 align:start position:0%
they're doing that in record time and
 
06:27:59.788 --> 06:27:59.798 align:start position:0%
I've seen them be not so quick when
 
06:28:02.590 --> 06:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
they're dismissed to take them back so
 
06:28:05.750 --> 06:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
the question is when they say as soon as
 
06:28:08.230 --> 06:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
possible we don't have a timeline here
 
06:28:09.948 --> 06:28:09.958 align:start position:0%
if you don't have a timeline you could
 
06:28:11.628 --> 06:28:11.638 align:start position:0%
press that little fact button a minute
 
06:28:13.110 --> 06:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
before why can't you press that little
 
06:28:15.110 --> 06:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
fax button or electronic thing in a
 
06:28:18.310 --> 06:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
minute now so I think that's going to
 
06:28:21.948 --> 06:28:21.958 align:start position:0%
matter but again what's really huge is
 
06:28:24.548 --> 06:28:24.558 align:start position:0%
are these public or private when you
 
06:28:26.510 --> 06:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
appeal to the Supreme Court which is
 
06:28:28.468 --> 06:28:28.478 align:start position:0%
line 20 on page
 
06:28:32.390 --> 06:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:34.868 --> 06:28:34.878 align:start position:0%
denied I don't know if anyone has talked
 
06:28:36.830 --> 06:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
to the court about this but the Supreme
 
06:28:38.990 --> 06:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
Court shall review the case do noo and
 
06:28:41.548 --> 06:28:41.558 align:start position:0%
has the discretion to review additional
 
06:28:44.070 --> 06:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
evidence the Supreme Court is not a
 
06:28:46.030 --> 06:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
trial court in New Hampshire anyhow it's
 
06:28:48.150 --> 06:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
an appell at court I don't know if
 
06:28:49.910 --> 06:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
anyone's talked to the court about how
 
06:28:51.910 --> 06:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to handle this and again
 
06:28:53.670 --> 06:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
we're going back to are these public or
 
06:28:55.750 --> 06:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
are these private
 
06:28:58.390 --> 06:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
um as we know Juvenile and certain other
 
06:29:01.110 --> 06:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
matters are private they're closed
 
06:29:03.230 --> 06:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
literally they they have M you know the
 
06:29:04.788 --> 06:29:04.798 align:start position:0%
Bay's at the door you're not coming in
 
06:29:08.070 --> 06:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:11.310 --> 06:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
it when you look at page
 
06:29:14.868 --> 06:29:14.878 align:start position:0%
425 through 33 I've addressed and I
 
06:29:17.910 --> 06:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
think it's huge what the ATF has done
 
06:29:20.468 --> 06:29:20.478 align:start position:0%
and that alone should give everyone
 
06:29:23.270 --> 06:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
pause to say do we want to go down this
 
06:29:26.070 --> 06:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
path this way because we really can't
 
06:29:26.080 --> 06:29:27.830 align:start position:0%
path this way because we really can't
trust

06:29:27.830 --> 06:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
trust
 
06:29:30.750 --> 06:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
them and it isn't just me with my
 
06:29:32.390 --> 06:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
distrust for them we have years and
 
06:29:34.990 --> 06:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
years of practical actions that they
 
06:29:37.190 --> 06:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
have taken and things they have done
 
06:29:39.468 --> 06:29:39.478 align:start position:0%
where they have changed their mind to
 
06:29:41.830 --> 06:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
say that we have to
 
06:29:46.150 --> 06:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:49.030 --> 06:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
good part of
 
06:29:53.190 --> 06:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment still from what I can see
 
06:29:55.510 --> 06:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
still treats
 
06:29:57.110 --> 06:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
the mentally ill person that they can't
 
06:29:58.548 --> 06:29:58.558 align:start position:0%
live with other people that have
 
06:30:01.430 --> 06:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
firearms that's a again the huge problem
 
06:30:02.788 --> 06:30:02.798 align:start position:0%
and I don't see a change in the
 
06:30:05.910 --> 06:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
amendment I see it still being set that
 
06:30:07.750 --> 06:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
way which again restricts how many
 
06:30:09.670 --> 06:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
people they can live with or the people
 
06:30:10.990 --> 06:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to live with have to be
 
06:30:13.270 --> 06:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
willing to give up their firearms and I
 
06:30:15.548 --> 06:30:15.558 align:start position:0%
don't know even my best friends or
 
06:30:16.910 --> 06:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
whatever if I'm willing to give up my
 
06:30:18.868 --> 06:30:18.878 align:start position:0%
firearms to give them a place to live
 
06:30:20.590 --> 06:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
maybe I'll Pony up some money from an
 
06:30:21.868 --> 06:30:21.878 align:start position:0%
apartment for
 
06:30:25.468 --> 06:30:25.478 align:start position:0%
him but I think when you look at this
 
06:30:28.190 --> 06:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
and you look at the standards it's
 
06:30:30.628 --> 06:30:30.638 align:start position:0%
almost like a popularity
 
06:30:32.750 --> 06:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
contest to
 
06:30:36.910 --> 06:30:36.920 align:start position:0%
get the rights back and more importantly
 
06:30:39.110 --> 06:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
there's not a timeline this is another
 
06:30:40.830 --> 06:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
thing that's hugely
 
06:30:43.750 --> 06:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
important courts do not have with rare
 
06:30:46.270 --> 06:30:46.280 align:start position:0%
instances a time in which they have to
 
06:30:48.310 --> 06:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
issue an order so if you look at the New
 
06:30:50.110 --> 06:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court at the US
 
06:30:52.230 --> 06:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court It's Not Unusual that they
 
06:30:54.270 --> 06:30:54.280 align:start position:0%
will hear a matter and they won't issue
 
06:30:56.510 --> 06:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
a decision for 6 months a year year and
 
06:30:59.190 --> 06:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
a half and that's the right there's no
 
06:31:02.230 --> 06:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
timeline I don't see a timeline in here
 
06:31:04.270 --> 06:31:04.280 align:start position:0%
so you put your evidence before the
 
06:31:07.310 --> 06:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
court they can take a year to decide
 
06:31:09.548 --> 06:31:09.558 align:start position:0%
they can take however long they want
 
06:31:11.030 --> 06:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's huge when you're the person
 
06:31:12.430 --> 06:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
waiting for your
 
06:31:15.350 --> 06:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
rights so you have to ask
 
06:31:17.510 --> 06:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
yourself I always put myself in the
 
06:31:19.310 --> 06:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
shoes if I were the person going through
 
06:31:22.030 --> 06:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
this this process how fair would I think
 
06:31:24.030 --> 06:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
it is how how well would it address my
 
06:31:27.110 --> 06:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
needs and I respectfully say it wouldn't
 
06:31:28.990 --> 06:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
but I think the other practical thing
 
06:31:30.670 --> 06:31:30.680 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done there has to be a
 
06:31:33.388 --> 06:31:33.398 align:start position:0%
list of licensed psychiatrists that we
 
06:31:35.788 --> 06:31:35.798 align:start position:0%
think would be acceptable to courts to
 
06:31:39.030 --> 06:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
opine um pursuant to page
 
06:31:42.670 --> 06:31:42.680 align:start position:0%
three um lines 1 through
 
06:31:45.388 --> 06:31:45.398 align:start position:0%
six and ask how many of them would be
 
06:31:48.510 --> 06:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
willing to do these type of exams and
 
06:31:50.708 --> 06:31:50.718 align:start position:0%
once we see that list I can tell you
 
06:31:53.030 --> 06:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
from my experience there was only a
 
06:31:55.350 --> 06:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
couple that I think I could call in this
 
06:31:58.230 --> 06:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
state and one of them unfortunately is
 
06:32:00.548 --> 06:32:00.558 align:start position:0%
deceased that would give my client a
 
06:32:03.350 --> 06:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
fair hearing that would be
 
06:32:05.948 --> 06:32:05.958 align:start position:0%
objective and that didn't hate guns and
 
06:32:07.628 --> 06:32:07.638 align:start position:0%
that would make a professional opinion
 
06:32:08.990 --> 06:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
about whether or not my client should
 
06:32:12.270 --> 06:32:12.280 align:start position:0%
have guns and so I just respectfully say
 
06:32:15.070 --> 06:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
to you that even if you're for this
 
06:32:17.708 --> 06:32:17.718 align:start position:0%
concept which I'm not and for this
 
06:32:19.868 --> 06:32:19.878 align:start position:0%
process they want to do it this is not
 
06:32:21.708 --> 06:32:21.718 align:start position:0%
the vehicle it's deeply
 
06:32:24.110 --> 06:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
flawed and I'm happy to answer any
 
06:32:26.190 --> 06:32:26.200 align:start position:0%
questions I can for
 
06:32:28.430 --> 06:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
anybody thank you attorney I I just
 
06:32:30.830 --> 06:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to um ask one question just for
 
06:32:33.430 --> 06:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
clarification when you were speaking of
 
06:32:36.350 --> 06:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
whether it would be an open or a closed
 
06:32:40.030 --> 06:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
hearing on the the very first sentence
 
06:32:41.830 --> 06:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
on the top of page line two on the
 
06:32:43.510 --> 06:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
original Bill where it says
 
06:32:45.070 --> 06:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding any other provision of
 
06:32:46.468 --> 06:32:46.478 align:start position:0%
law including the requirement of a
 
06:32:49.230 --> 06:32:49.240 align:start position:0%
closed hearing and file under blah blah
 
06:32:52.708 --> 06:32:52.718 align:start position:0%
blah is that what you referring to or is
 
06:32:54.150 --> 06:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
there is that something different where
 
06:32:58.230 --> 06:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
you r able to find that um let let me
 
06:33:01.350 --> 06:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
you said we're on page the very top of
 
06:33:03.388 --> 06:33:03.398 align:start position:0%
page two the very first sentence not
 
06:33:06.628 --> 06:33:06.638 align:start position:0%
withing any other provision of law of
 
06:33:06.638 --> 06:33:14.750 align:start position:0%
withing any other provision of law of
law

06:33:14.750 --> 06:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:17.788 --> 06:33:17.798 align:start position:0%
including um no I would I'm sorry I was
 
06:33:19.070 --> 06:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
referring to when the person's
 
06:33:21.270 --> 06:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
attempting to get their rights back okay
 
06:33:23.910 --> 06:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
this is this is the process there and
 
06:33:27.430 --> 06:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:30.150 --> 06:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
um I see problems there but I was trying
 
06:33:33.110 --> 06:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
to highlight what I consider to be the
 
06:33:35.350 --> 06:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
largest problems if I were doing what I
 
06:33:39.070 --> 06:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
call a proper job I would you guys
 
06:33:40.590 --> 06:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even get dinner you know what
 
06:33:42.750 --> 06:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
I'm saying in other words I I would I
 
06:33:46.310 --> 06:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
would go through this and really
 
06:33:48.948 --> 06:33:48.958 align:start position:0%
really what I call bird dog and do a
 
06:33:50.750 --> 06:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
proper lawyer job so I'm I'm not going
 
06:33:52.548 --> 06:33:52.558 align:start position:0%
to represent that I did a proper lawyer
 
06:33:54.990 --> 06:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
job on this I hit what I called
 
06:33:57.430 --> 06:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
the biggest things that I think any one
 
06:33:58.868 --> 06:33:58.878 align:start position:0%
of them alone
 
06:34:01.468 --> 06:34:01.478 align:start position:0%
should make this bill fatal it should
 
06:34:03.590 --> 06:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
should not go anywhere but with all of
 
06:34:05.628 --> 06:34:05.638 align:start position:0%
those without even me going into what I
 
06:34:08.910 --> 06:34:08.920 align:start position:0%
call the minutia of it even more it's
 
06:34:14.270 --> 06:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:18.670 --> 06:34:18.680 align:start position:0%

06:35:28.510 --> 06:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
incredibly saddened we were with the
 
06:35:31.510 --> 06:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
events on November 17th and the loss of

how caring and kind he was to them when

hospital so on behalf of Nami New
 
06:35:48.910 --> 06:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm here to offer testimony in
 
06:35:53.310 --> 06:35:53.320 align:start position:0%
what I would call cautious support of HB
 
06:35:55.910 --> 06:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
1711 there are indeed several key
 
06:35:57.990 --> 06:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
Provisions in the bill that we feel are
 
06:36:00.670 --> 06:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
critical to preventing discrimination
 
06:36:02.788 --> 06:36:02.798 align:start position:0%
and protecting the civil liberties of
 
06:36:04.990 --> 06:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
people living with mental illness as
 
06:36:07.868 --> 06:36:07.878 align:start position:0%
well as helping to ensure the safety of
 
06:36:10.350 --> 06:36:10.360 align:start position:0%
both individuals and law
 
06:36:12.388 --> 06:36:12.398 align:start position:0%
enforcement according to the National
 
06:36:14.548 --> 06:36:14.558 align:start position:0%
Institute on Mental Health one in five
 
06:36:16.590 --> 06:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
Americans is living with a mental
 
06:36:18.868 --> 06:36:18.878 align:start position:0%
illness one in
 
06:36:21.190 --> 06:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
five the vast majority of people living
 
06:36:22.430 --> 06:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
with mental illness get up in the
 
06:36:24.990 --> 06:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
morning put their kids on the bus go to
 
06:36:27.388 --> 06:36:27.398 align:start position:0%
work come home make dinner help the kids
 
06:36:30.270 --> 06:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
with homework do the laundry go to bed
 
06:36:33.310 --> 06:36:33.320 align:start position:0%
get up and do it all over
 
06:36:36.110 --> 06:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
again given
 
06:36:38.750 --> 06:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
this it is critical that the language in
 
06:36:41.468 --> 06:36:41.478 align:start position:0%
this bill limits who would be prevented
 
06:36:44.350 --> 06:36:44.360 align:start position:0%
from purchasing a firearm to individuals
 
06:36:47.110 --> 06:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
who have been found to be a danger to
 
06:36:49.468 --> 06:36:49.478 align:start position:0%
themselves or others after probate
 
06:36:53.030 --> 06:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
commitment hearing and to people who may
 
06:36:54.788 --> 06:36:54.798 align:start position:0%
have been found not guilty to stand
 
06:36:58.468 --> 06:36:58.478 align:start position:0%
trial but who have also been found to be
 
06:37:00.670 --> 06:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
dangerous to themselves or
 
06:37:04.190 --> 06:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
others in addition to those conditions
 
06:37:06.070 --> 06:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
at Nami New Hampshire there we feel
 
06:37:08.270 --> 06:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
strongly that several Provisions that
 
06:37:10.548 --> 06:37:10.558 align:start position:0%
are in the Bill and that appear to be in
 
06:37:13.030 --> 06:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment is my first read through
 
06:37:15.150 --> 06:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
um that are really essential to its fair
 
06:37:16.548 --> 06:37:16.558 align:start position:0%
and appropriate
 
06:37:19.350 --> 06:37:19.360 align:start position:0%
implementation is these include that the
 
06:37:22.990 --> 06:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
report made to the nck system be made by
 
06:37:25.230 --> 06:37:25.240 align:start position:0%
law enforcement or the judicial branch
 
06:37:27.468 --> 06:37:27.478 align:start position:0%
in order to protect that therapeutic
 
06:37:30.510 --> 06:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
relation relationship between providers
 
06:37:30.520 --> 06:37:31.670 align:start position:0%
relation relationship between providers
and

06:37:31.670 --> 06:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:37:33.990 --> 06:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
patients that there is a process by
 
06:37:36.430 --> 06:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
which a person can petition the court
 
06:37:38.910 --> 06:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
for Relief and to have their rights
 
06:37:42.190 --> 06:37:42.200 align:start position:0%
restored and that any removal of firearm
 
06:37:44.670 --> 06:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
should be done in a way that limits
 
06:37:47.150 --> 06:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
engagement of the individuals in law
 
06:37:50.990 --> 06:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement in order to avoid dangerous
 
06:37:53.150 --> 06:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
confrontations the reality is that for
 
06:37:56.030 --> 06:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
many people the initial diagnosis of a
 
06:37:58.948 --> 06:37:58.958 align:start position:0%
major mental illness is a crisis yet
 
06:38:01.510 --> 06:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
treatment works and making sure that
 
06:38:03.948 --> 06:38:03.958 align:start position:0%
people understand that there is help and
 
06:38:08.190 --> 06:38:08.200 align:start position:0%
hope is a critical part of the recovery
 
06:38:11.468 --> 06:38:11.478 align:start position:0%
process this bill as written helps
 
06:38:12.830 --> 06:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
ensure that people who have been
 
06:38:14.670 --> 06:38:14.680 align:start position:0%
determined to be a danger to themselves
 
06:38:17.548 --> 06:38:17.558 align:start position:0%
or others do not have access to Firearms
 
06:38:19.708 --> 06:38:19.718 align:start position:0%
when they are on well yet does not
 
06:38:22.190 --> 06:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
permanently deny them a constitutional
 
06:38:24.708 --> 06:38:24.718 align:start position:0%
right and offers the promise of recovery
 
06:38:26.430 --> 06:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
and the ability to live a full life in
 
06:38:26.440 --> 06:38:27.350 align:start position:0%
and the ability to live a full life in
the

ensure that any bill on this matter on
 
06:38:38.070 --> 06:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
which you vote ought to pass addresses
 
06:38:40.110 --> 06:38:40.120 align:start position:0%

scitec you said 44,000 people represent
 
06:38:57.430 --> 06:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
who are these 44,000 we served last year
 
06:39:00.430 --> 06:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
nearly 44,000 individuals demographic of
 
06:39:02.510 --> 06:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
what that looks like um that is
 
06:39:04.788 --> 06:39:04.798 align:start position:0%
individuals who are impacted by mental
 
06:39:05.948 --> 06:39:05.958 align:start position:0%
illness they could be living with a
 
06:39:07.310 --> 06:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
mental illness they could have a loved
 
06:39:09.708 --> 06:39:09.718 align:start position:0%
one who has a mental illness it also
 
06:39:11.030 --> 06:39:11.040 align:start position:0%

substance use disorder it is a broad
 
06:39:20.948 --> 06:39:20.958 align:start position:0%
array of people who are impacted as we
 
06:39:22.868 --> 06:39:22.878 align:start position:0%
know I don't think there's any one of us
 
06:39:24.788 --> 06:39:24.798 align:start position:0%
who is not impacted in some way in our
 
06:39:24.798 --> 06:39:27.510 align:start position:0%
who is not impacted in some way in our
personal

06:39:27.510 --> 06:39:27.520 align:start position:0%

have two cards left so if you are
 
06:39:37.230 --> 06:39:37.240 align:start position:0%
holding on to a card now is the time to
 
06:39:40.230 --> 06:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
turn it in uh because after these guys
 
06:39:42.070 --> 06:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
are called we will be closing this
 
06:39:44.548 --> 06:39:44.558 align:start position:0%
public hearing we still have one more
 
06:39:47.590 --> 06:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
left after this
 
06:39:51.388 --> 06:39:51.398 align:start position:0%
um Jeffrey Jeffrey
 
06:39:59.388 --> 06:39:59.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:01.788 --> 06:40:01.798 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
06:40:04.230 --> 06:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
committee this time as I come before you
 
06:40:06.430 --> 06:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
I am uh representing the New Hampshire
 
06:40:08.430 --> 06:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
Psychiatric Society and New Hampshire
 
06:40:12.270 --> 06:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
Medical Society I am so glad to be able
 
06:40:14.388 --> 06:40:14.398 align:start position:0%
to testify today because I think this is
 
06:40:16.868 --> 06:40:16.878 align:start position:0%
important legislation on an issue that
 
06:40:20.868 --> 06:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
I've been thinking about for a long time
 
06:40:23.468 --> 06:40:23.478 align:start position:0%
this bill is tailored to New Hampshire's
 
06:40:25.310 --> 06:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
approach to mental health
 
06:40:28.110 --> 06:40:28.120 align:start position:0%
law rather than targeting the mentally
 
06:40:30.468 --> 06:40:30.478 align:start position:0%
defective as the Brady Bill does this
 
06:40:33.150 --> 06:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
bill uses procedural triggers for legal
 
06:40:35.830 --> 06:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
events that demonstrate a patients
 
06:40:38.270 --> 06:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
dangerousness this approach is important
 
06:40:40.468 --> 06:40:40.478 align:start position:0%
to minimize the stigma of people with
 
06:40:43.830 --> 06:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
mental illness advocats often point out
 
06:40:45.468 --> 06:40:45.478 align:start position:0%
that people with mental illness are more
 
06:40:47.628 --> 06:40:47.638 align:start position:0%
likely to be victims than perpetrators
 
06:40:50.310 --> 06:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
of violence and this is true initially
 
06:40:53.190 --> 06:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
proved in the 1998 MacArthur Study and
 
06:40:55.868 --> 06:40:55.878 align:start position:0%
replicated several times since but I
 
06:40:58.190 --> 06:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
think we can be nuanced in how we talk
 
06:41:02.468 --> 06:41:02.478 align:start position:0%
about this patients are more vulnerable
 
06:41:04.910 --> 06:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
um than they are dangerous over time but
 
06:41:06.948 --> 06:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
there are such things as behavioral
 
06:41:09.270 --> 06:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
crisises and that is why psychiatric
 
06:41:09.280 --> 06:41:11.590 align:start position:0%
crisises and that is why psychiatric
hospitals

06:41:11.590 --> 06:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
06:41:13.628 --> 06:41:13.638 align:start position:0%
exist there have been a number of
 
06:41:16.590 --> 06:41:16.600 align:start position:0%
objections raised I'd like to briefly um
 
06:41:19.990 --> 06:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
address um one is the idea that um
 
06:41:23.190 --> 06:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
because of the availability of guns uh
 
06:41:25.270 --> 06:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
in our society that this bill would do
 
06:41:25.280 --> 06:41:26.110 align:start position:0%
in our society that this bill would do
no

06:41:26.110 --> 06:41:26.120 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:41:29.350 --> 06:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
good I feel that potentially is an an
 
06:41:30.948 --> 06:41:30.958 align:start position:0%
instance of stigmatization the
 
06:41:33.310 --> 06:41:33.320 align:start position:0%
conflation of the mentally ill with
 
06:41:36.110 --> 06:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
criminals most patients who come through
 
06:41:38.230 --> 06:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
our Hospital are not criminals they
 
06:41:40.388 --> 06:41:40.398 align:start position:0%
would not know where to go to pick up an
 
06:41:43.628 --> 06:41:43.638 align:start position:0%
illegal gun any more than any other uh
 
06:41:44.948 --> 06:41:44.958 align:start position:0%
person without a mental illness who's
 
06:41:46.430 --> 06:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
not a criminal
 
06:41:50.270 --> 06:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
what um there objections been raised
 
06:41:52.948 --> 06:41:52.958 align:start position:0%
regarding reluctance to pronounce a
 
06:41:54.430 --> 06:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
person cured
 
06:41:56.468 --> 06:41:56.478 align:start position:0%
when I am done with my testimony I'm
 
06:41:59.868 --> 06:41:59.878 align:start position:0%
going to pass out to you a um resource
 
06:42:01.990 --> 06:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
document from the American Psychiatric
 
06:42:05.190 --> 06:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
association from 2020 regarding to
 
06:42:08.150 --> 06:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
restoring access to
 
06:42:10.830 --> 06:42:10.840 align:start position:0%
Firearms excuse me this document
 
06:42:12.830 --> 06:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
provides guidelines to allow
 
06:42:14.948 --> 06:42:14.958 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists to have a framework and a
 
06:42:16.510 --> 06:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
standard of care for which to perform
 
06:42:19.430 --> 06:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
these evaluations a resource document to
 
06:42:22.628 --> 06:42:22.638 align:start position:0%
refer to when to allow the judge to
 
06:42:24.230 --> 06:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
understand the limitations of of their
 
06:42:26.468 --> 06:42:26.478 align:start position:0%
evaluation and recommendations of how to
 
06:42:27.868 --> 06:42:27.878 align:start position:0%
proceed with that
 
06:42:31.468 --> 06:42:31.478 align:start position:0%
evaluation moreover as I suppose
 
06:42:33.750 --> 06:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
everyone knows doctors take calculated
 
06:42:36.110 --> 06:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
risks all the time every time we
 
06:42:38.150 --> 06:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
discharge a patient from the hospital we
 
06:42:41.190 --> 06:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
are taking a calculated risk to society
 
06:42:43.510 --> 06:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
and to the patient and to our
 
06:42:46.310 --> 06:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
liability um that is not something that
 
06:42:48.948 --> 06:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
we are totally averse to we we have to
 
06:42:50.708 --> 06:42:50.718 align:start position:0%
do that that's part of our
 
06:42:54.388 --> 06:42:54.398 align:start position:0%
job um and I might might add that if one
 
06:42:56.910 --> 06:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
were to do as a psychiatrist if you were
 
06:42:58.910 --> 06:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
to do one of these restoration
 
06:43:00.910 --> 06:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
evaluations you would be doing it as a
 
06:43:03.310 --> 06:43:03.320 align:start position:0%
forensic evaluation you would not have a
 
06:43:05.070 --> 06:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
doctor patient relationship with the
 
06:43:07.150 --> 06:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
patient the way that this bill is
 
06:43:08.948 --> 06:43:08.958 align:start position:0%
written therefore you would not have
 
06:43:11.030 --> 06:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
malpractice liability you would actually
 
06:43:13.468 --> 06:43:13.478 align:start position:0%
not need malpractice insurance to do a
 
06:43:15.430 --> 06:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
forensic evaluation because by
 
06:43:19.150 --> 06:43:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:19.160 --> 06:43:20.830 align:start position:0%
 
patient

06:43:20.830 --> 06:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
patient
 
06:43:24.070 --> 06:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
um some objections were also raised to
 
06:43:27.788 --> 06:43:27.798 align:start position:0%
some of the language on page 3 13 to 15
 
06:43:29.670 --> 06:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
um and also the language around
 
06:43:33.070 --> 06:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
dnovo um um uh review by the Supreme
 
06:43:35.590 --> 06:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
Court all of that was carefully selected
 
06:43:38.270 --> 06:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
language in order to meet the atf's
 
06:43:41.310 --> 06:43:41.320 align:start position:0%
requirements to take a patient off the
 
06:43:44.190 --> 06:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
Nicks list if it were not there and it's
 
06:43:46.708 --> 06:43:46.718 align:start position:0%
not there in current New Hampshire law
 
06:43:48.948 --> 06:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
you they won't comply with a request to
 
06:43:51.510 --> 06:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
take the patient off the Nicks list we
 
06:43:54.430 --> 06:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
thought this through this is designed to
 
06:43:56.670 --> 06:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
work to protect the patient's right to
 
06:43:56.680 --> 06:43:58.150 align:start position:0%
work to protect the patient's right to
be

06:43:58.150 --> 06:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:44:01.468 --> 06:44:01.478 align:start position:0%
restored sp sp 171's intention is to
 
06:44:03.510 --> 06:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
prevent events like what happened on
 
06:44:06.708 --> 06:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
November 17th 2023 you've already heard
 
06:44:08.628 --> 06:44:08.638 align:start position:0%
some accounts of that so I'm not going
 
06:44:10.510 --> 06:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
to go through my account it'll be in my
 
06:44:12.948 --> 06:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
written testimony and you can read it
 
06:44:14.868 --> 06:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
it's a little different but it's always
 
06:44:16.750 --> 06:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
the same but I do want to talk a little
 
06:44:18.990 --> 06:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
bit about the
 
06:44:21.628 --> 06:44:21.638 align:start position:0%
aftermath since November 17th there have
 
06:44:23.868 --> 06:44:23.878 align:start position:0%
been both expected and unexpected Ed
 
06:44:25.788 --> 06:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
Fallout there's been patients who have
 
06:44:28.230 --> 06:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
been stabilized for long years and now
 
06:44:30.670 --> 06:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
have lost many of their gains there
 
06:44:32.788 --> 06:44:32.798 align:start position:0%
staff who have had to take time off to
 
06:44:34.788 --> 06:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
seek help for the stress of living with
 
06:44:38.270 --> 06:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
what they have seen for three of us this
 
06:44:41.788 --> 06:44:41.798 align:start position:0%
was our second a active shooter event
 
06:44:43.310 --> 06:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
there was one in darmouth Hitchcock a
 
06:44:45.110 --> 06:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
few years ago as
 
06:44:48.270 --> 06:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
well for me I was deeply
 
06:44:50.750 --> 06:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
angry angry that I could not help a man
 
06:44:53.628 --> 06:44:53.638 align:start position:0%
who was down in my own Hospital angry
 
06:44:55.350 --> 06:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
that a man who honorably served his
 
06:44:58.030 --> 06:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
community would lose his life and their
 
06:45:01.030 --> 06:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
and his family lose their time with him
 
06:45:02.788 --> 06:45:02.798 align:start position:0%
angry that we had not somehow been able
 
06:45:05.270 --> 06:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
to prevent this as a hospital as a
 
06:45:07.868 --> 06:45:07.878 align:start position:0%
mental health system or as a society
 
06:45:10.468 --> 06:45:10.478 align:start position:0%
angry that we've spent years trying to
 
06:45:14.110 --> 06:45:14.120 align:start position:0%
build this Hospital into something good
 
06:45:15.750 --> 06:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
where people with mental illness can
 
06:45:18.310 --> 06:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
find care where families can feel
 
06:45:20.548 --> 06:45:20.558 align:start position:0%
comfortable leaving their loved ones
 
06:45:22.270 --> 06:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
where people can spend a productive
 
06:45:24.510 --> 06:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
career Advan ing the field and doing
 
06:45:26.430 --> 06:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
meaningful work and then to think that
 
06:45:28.910 --> 06:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
on November 17th so much of that was
 
06:45:32.510 --> 06:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
lost and that perhaps it could have been
 
06:45:35.270 --> 06:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
prevented two psychiatrists and a judge
 
06:45:36.750 --> 06:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
had determined that this shooter was
 
06:45:38.990 --> 06:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
dangerous if you count the Ia an
 
06:45:40.708 --> 06:45:40.718 align:start position:0%
additional psychiatrist and
 
06:45:44.030 --> 06:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
judge his guns were seized but there was
 
06:45:46.510 --> 06:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
no system in but there is a system in
 
06:45:48.230 --> 06:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
place to ensure that there would he
 
06:45:50.350 --> 06:45:50.360 align:start position:0%
would not be able to buy another gun but
 
06:45:52.948 --> 06:45:52.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire had no way to report this
 
06:45:56.868 --> 06:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
information to that system HB 1711
 
06:45:59.388 --> 06:45:59.398 align:start position:0%
allows us to join the majority of states
 
06:45:59.398 --> 06:46:01.750 align:start position:0%
allows us to join the majority of states
which

06:46:01.750 --> 06:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:05.270 --> 06:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
do you can't help but relive it from
 
06:46:07.628 --> 06:46:07.638 align:start position:0%
formal event reviews reminders around
 
06:46:10.150 --> 06:46:10.160 align:start position:0%

06:46:17.150 --> 06:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
mind every day remembering the surprise
 
06:46:21.830 --> 06:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
of the thought I could really die
 
06:46:25.310 --> 06:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
today the helpless n of being trapped
 
06:46:28.110 --> 06:46:28.120 align:start position:0%
and the guilty worry I hope I'm doing
 
06:46:31.548 --> 06:46:31.558 align:start position:0%
everything I can to not let my people
 
06:46:34.708 --> 06:46:34.718 align:start position:0%
down and yet the very next day with the
 
06:46:37.350 --> 06:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
Franklin shooting the world had already

every week where any reasonable person
 
06:46:49.388 --> 06:46:49.398 align:start position:0%
would say well that guy shouldn't have a
 
06:46:51.868 --> 06:46:51.878 align:start position:0%
gun where a patient's family member
 
06:46:53.628 --> 06:46:53.638 align:start position:0%
would thank you for making sure they
 
06:46:56.590 --> 06:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
can't have a gun or patients themselves
 
06:46:59.230 --> 06:46:59.240 align:start position:0%
later in a different state of mind would
 
06:47:01.548 --> 06:47:01.558 align:start position:0%
be grateful that they couldn't buy a gun
 
06:47:04.750 --> 06:47:04.760 align:start position:0%

we're going to nickname a bill after
 
06:48:49.230 --> 06:48:49.240 align:start position:0%

officer that I know carries privately
 
06:48:53.948 --> 06:48:53.958 align:start position:0%
because they understand and the society
 
06:48:56.628 --> 06:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
that we've come to live in and it would
 
06:49:00.190 --> 06:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
be really a real tragedy if it was the
 
06:49:02.468 --> 06:49:02.478 align:start position:0%
state that denied him the ability to
 
06:49:03.830 --> 06:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
protect himself and the others in the
 
06:49:06.230 --> 06:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
hospital that day I really think that
 
06:49:07.510 --> 06:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
this committee should do the
 
06:49:09.750 --> 06:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
investigation to find out why a former
 
06:49:11.948 --> 06:49:11.958 align:start position:0%
law enforcement in this case the chief
 
06:49:15.670 --> 06:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
of police was disarmed when managing the
 
06:49:17.750 --> 06:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
metal detector and being the first
 
06:49:20.190 --> 06:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
primary defense for the
 
06:49:22.270 --> 06:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
hospital that alone should be the only
 
06:49:23.548 --> 06:49:23.558 align:start position:0%
thing that comes out of this bill is to
 
06:49:29.190 --> 06:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:31.510 --> 06:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
servant his family is owed more than
 
06:49:33.590 --> 06:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to give them because he lost
 
06:49:35.230 --> 06:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
that his life that day because he
 
06:49:37.830 --> 06:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't defend
 
06:49:37.840 --> 06:49:40.190 align:start position:0%
couldn't defend
himself

06:49:40.190 --> 06:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
himself
 
06:49:43.230 --> 06:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
next I had the chance this past fall to
 
06:49:44.468 --> 06:49:44.478 align:start position:0%
learn a lot more about mental health
 
06:49:47.388 --> 06:49:47.398 align:start position:0%
than I ever wanted to um a dear family
 
06:49:49.430 --> 06:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
member had a mental health crisis that I
 
06:49:53.708 --> 06:49:53.718 align:start position:0%
hadn't expected um I learned a lot learn
 
06:49:55.670 --> 06:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
that diet actually believe it or not
 
06:49:58.230 --> 06:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
what you eat is highly tied to how you
 
06:50:00.910 --> 06:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
do mentally there's a big there's a big
 
06:50:03.230 --> 06:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
understanding of of the gut Mental
 
06:50:03.240 --> 06:50:04.430 align:start position:0%
understanding of of the gut Mental
Health

06:50:04.430 --> 06:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
Health
 
06:50:07.750 --> 06:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
Link apparently 50% of EP epilepsy cases
 
06:50:10.150 --> 06:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
can be solved just by changing someone's
 
06:50:13.548 --> 06:50:13.558 align:start position:0%
diet I had no idea I learned a
 
06:50:17.190 --> 06:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
lot so with that said um we do have a
 
06:50:18.910 --> 06:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
mental health crisis in the US and in
 
06:50:21.270 --> 06:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we need to do something
 
06:50:21.280 --> 06:50:22.030 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we need to do something
about

06:50:22.030 --> 06:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:50:24.910 --> 06:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
it changing the diet is is is clearly a
 
06:50:28.070 --> 06:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
first day but these are not ill sorry
 
06:50:30.708 --> 06:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
these are not violent patients for the
 
06:50:32.750 --> 06:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
most part there are exceptions but I
 
06:50:34.868 --> 06:50:34.878 align:start position:0%
want to be clear in my testimony that
 
06:50:37.230 --> 06:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of people that have me
 
06:50:40.388 --> 06:50:40.398 align:start position:0%
mental health issues are not
 
06:50:44.070 --> 06:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
vient okay there are exceptions to that
 
06:50:46.310 --> 06:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
and what this bill will do is allow
 
06:50:48.310 --> 06:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
those that are exceptions to go into
 
06:50:50.468 --> 06:50:50.478 align:start position:0%
society unrestrained because we put a
 
06:50:51.830 --> 06:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
piece of paper and says well they're not
 
06:50:55.230 --> 06:50:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:59.030 --> 06:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
Timothy McVey was not ruled a mentally
 
06:51:02.270 --> 06:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
handicapped or deranged individual but
 
06:51:03.670 --> 06:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
he managed to take
 
06:51:06.150 --> 06:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
fertilizer and diesel fuel and end the
 
06:51:12.430 --> 06:51:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:15.190 --> 06:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
people these people need our help they
 
06:51:16.750 --> 06:51:16.760 align:start position:0%
don't need to have their firearms
 
06:51:19.948 --> 06:51:19.958 align:start position:0%
restricted that's not the solution the
 
06:51:21.468 --> 06:51:21.478 align:start position:0%
way we help them is to give them the
 
06:51:25.628 --> 06:51:25.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:28.190 --> 06:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
next I want to report on nck since Nick
 
06:51:29.868 --> 06:51:29.878 align:start position:0%
seems to be the foundation that we're
 
06:51:31.548 --> 06:51:31.558 align:start position:0%
going to the Magic Bullet the magic
 
06:51:33.510 --> 06:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
Silver Bullet we're going to solve this
 
06:51:35.990 --> 06:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph one on page two right we're
 
06:51:37.270 --> 06:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
going to be entered these names are
 
06:51:39.670 --> 06:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
going to be entered into Nick's indices
 
06:51:43.150 --> 06:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
for those who the court for those found
 
06:51:44.830 --> 06:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
by the court to be a danger to himself
 
06:51:46.430 --> 06:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
or herself or
 
06:51:48.830 --> 06:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
others in 2018 the government
 
06:51:50.628 --> 06:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
accountability office did a report I
 
06:51:52.430 --> 06:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
have sent this to all of you via email I
 
06:51:53.910 --> 06:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
would enter ask that that be entered
 
06:51:55.910 --> 06:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
into the into the file because I think
 
06:51:55.920 --> 06:51:57.468 align:start position:0%
into the into the file because I think
it's

06:51:57.468 --> 06:51:57.478 align:start position:0%
it's
 
06:51:59.830 --> 06:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
important what the GAO found the
 
06:52:02.990 --> 06:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
government accountability agency in 2018
 
06:52:05.150 --> 06:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
was quote few individuals denied
 
06:52:07.628 --> 06:52:07.638 align:start position:0%
Firearms purchases are prosecuted and
 
06:52:09.628 --> 06:52:09.638 align:start position:0%
the ATF should assess the use of warning
 
06:52:12.548 --> 06:52:12.558 align:start position:0%
notices in Le of prosecutions
 
06:52:16.868 --> 06:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
first um it is a federal crime to
 
06:52:19.868 --> 06:52:19.878 align:start position:0%
knowingly fill out a for 4473 as a
 
06:52:19.878 --> 06:52:21.350 align:start position:0%
knowingly fill out a for 4473 as a
prohibited

06:52:21.350 --> 06:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
06:52:25.070 --> 06:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
person there were 80 sorry 8.6 million
 
06:52:28.830 --> 06:52:28.840 align:start position:0%
Federal Nicks transactions in 2017 there
 
06:52:28.840 --> 06:52:29.948 align:start position:0%
Federal Nicks transactions in 2017 there
was

06:52:29.948 --> 06:52:29.958 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:52:29.958 --> 06:52:32.788 align:start position:0%
was
111,000

06:52:32.788 --> 06:52:32.798 align:start position:0%
111,000
 
06:52:36.628 --> 06:52:36.638 align:start position:0%
denials there was 12,000 roughly in
 
06:52:38.830 --> 06:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
order of magnitude
 
06:52:40.910 --> 06:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
investigations and would you believe
 
06:52:42.990 --> 06:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
there was 12
 
06:52:46.230 --> 06:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
prosecutions say that again 112,000
 
06:52:49.548 --> 06:52:49.558 align:start position:0%
people who Den not were denied 12,000
 
06:52:51.468 --> 06:52:51.478 align:start position:0%
who warranted an
 
06:52:56.388 --> 06:52:56.398 align:start position:0%
investigation and 1% sorry .1% of those
 
06:52:59.430 --> 06:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
12 people were prosecuted now this is a
 
06:53:02.350 --> 06:53:02.360 align:start position:0%
felony level offense and we're saying
 
06:53:04.548 --> 06:53:04.558 align:start position:0%
that this is the magic cure to to the
 
06:53:08.190 --> 06:53:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:11.190 --> 06:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
hand I think we can do better than that
 
06:53:13.430 --> 06:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
I think we should first find out why the
 
06:53:15.670 --> 06:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
chief was disarmed this bill should be
 
06:53:17.270 --> 06:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
completely Rewritten and we should find
 
06:53:20.830 --> 06:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
out which St state agency prohibit him
 
06:53:23.270 --> 06:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
from protecting himself we owe that we
 
06:53:27.270 --> 06:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:30.548 --> 06:53:30.558 align:start position:0%
family we also know that the Nicks list
 
06:53:33.548 --> 06:53:33.558 align:start position:0%
is is not being managed well based on
 
06:53:35.708 --> 06:53:35.718 align:start position:0%
what the GAO found it is not the
 
06:53:38.388 --> 06:53:38.398 align:start position:0%
solution that everybody thinks it is so
 
06:53:39.948 --> 06:53:39.958 align:start position:0%
just because names get entered doesn't
 
06:53:42.030 --> 06:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
mean that people are actually prohibited
 
06:53:44.548 --> 06:53:44.558 align:start position:0%
and those that are prohibited okay if
 
06:53:46.948 --> 06:53:46.958 align:start position:0%
they were truly prohibited no one's
 
06:53:48.788 --> 06:53:48.798 align:start position:0%
bothering to do any
 
06:53:50.750 --> 06:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
prosecution so it's not going to solve
 
06:53:54.270 --> 06:53:54.280 align:start position:0%
any anything real we also know that if
 
06:53:56.310 --> 06:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
you are prohibited by a federal agency
 
06:53:58.070 --> 06:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how this ties into this
 
06:53:59.990 --> 06:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
bill this is not my area of expertise
 
06:54:02.190 --> 06:54:02.200 align:start position:0%
either in law or medical but if at the
 
06:54:04.310 --> 06:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
VA Hospital were part of the process and
 
06:54:06.948 --> 06:54:06.958 align:start position:0%
they were the agency that that actually
 
06:54:09.468 --> 06:54:09.478 align:start position:0%
was part of the recommendation by which
 
06:54:12.708 --> 06:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
you were reported there might not be a
 
06:54:14.548 --> 06:54:14.558 align:start position:0%
way to get off through a state level
 
06:54:17.628 --> 06:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
form as someone mentioned
 
06:54:19.750 --> 06:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
before that means we put our our
 
06:54:21.670 --> 06:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
veterans at a
 
06:54:25.190 --> 06:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
disadvantage I truly want to solve abuse
 
06:54:28.670 --> 06:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
suicide issues there are we we've seen a
 
06:54:32.548 --> 06:54:32.558 align:start position:0%
lot of suicides that's unfortunately
 
06:54:38.468 --> 06:54:38.478 align:start position:0%
unfortunate um in um uh uh Miss Fallon
 
06:54:40.070 --> 06:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
who's a state employee sends out a
 
06:54:42.388 --> 06:54:42.398 align:start position:0%
monthly report on the number of of
 
06:54:44.990 --> 06:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
opioid overdoses I would encourage you
 
06:54:47.150 --> 06:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
all to get that it's a good report last
 
06:54:49.070 --> 06:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
one that happens from early
 
06:54:52.030 --> 06:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
January we had 201 people who died of
 
06:54:52.040 --> 06:54:53.948 align:start position:0%
January we had 201 people who died of
Fentanyl

06:54:53.948 --> 06:54:53.958 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl
 
06:54:57.350 --> 06:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
last year now I'm not a drug user I
 
06:54:58.750 --> 06:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
don't know that many people who are but
 
06:55:00.070 --> 06:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
I don't think fentanyl is high on the
 
06:55:01.590 --> 06:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
list because everybody knows the real
 
06:55:03.628 --> 06:55:03.638 align:start position:0%
term the real consequences of using
 
06:55:06.190 --> 06:55:06.200 align:start position:0%
fentanyl okay that was fentanyl alone
 
06:55:07.830 --> 06:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
that wasn't mixed with some other drug
 
06:55:09.948 --> 06:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
that was fentanyl alone these are people
 
06:55:11.948 --> 06:55:11.958 align:start position:0%
who have given up on life and are
 
06:55:14.510 --> 06:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
choosing to end it if we truly want to
 
06:55:16.468 --> 06:55:16.478 align:start position:0%
solve suicide let's look at the
 
06:55:17.830 --> 06:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
prominant killer in the state of New
 
06:55:21.590 --> 06:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is opioid AB abuse not
 
06:55:23.868 --> 06:55:23.878 align:start position:0%
firearms I would ask that you would find
 
06:55:26.548 --> 06:55:26.558 align:start position:0%
this bill inexpedient to legislate I do
 
06:55:27.910 --> 06:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
think this committee should call for an
 
06:55:31.590 --> 06:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
investigation of why Chief hos okay was
 
06:55:33.990 --> 06:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
was unarmed at when he was providing SEC
 
06:55:35.910 --> 06:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
security detail with that I'll end my
 
06:55:37.910 --> 06:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
06:55:39.868 --> 06:55:39.878 align:start position:0%
you any
 
06:55:43.230 --> 06:55:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:45.830 --> 06:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative I'm closing the hearing

07:12:30.670 --> 07:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
intentions of limiting testimony but I
 
07:12:33.030 --> 07:12:33.040 align:start position:0%

committee my name is Tom Manion

representing Hillsboro one the town of
 
07:12:59.628 --> 07:12:59.638 align:start position:0%
pelum this bill is also a a result of a
 
07:13:02.310 --> 07:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
constituent request um its purpose is to
 
07:13:04.110 --> 07:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
anull involuntary commitments of
 
07:13:05.430 --> 07:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
individuals that have been deemed
 
07:13:07.150 --> 07:13:07.160 align:start position:0%
potentially harmful to themselves and
 
07:13:09.628 --> 07:13:09.638 align:start position:0%
required psychiatric treatment uh and to
 
07:13:11.150 --> 07:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
be abundantly clear this bill
 
07:13:13.150 --> 07:13:13.160 align:start position:0%
specifically excludes commitments as
 
07:13:15.468 --> 07:13:15.478 align:start position:0%
punishment for crimes pursuant to RSA
 
07:13:18.708 --> 07:13:18.718 align:start position:0%
chapter 651 as being eligible for the
 
07:13:21.788 --> 07:13:21.798 align:start position:0%
analment um there are those Society they
 
07:13:23.548 --> 07:13:23.558 align:start position:0%
go through life experiences that they
 
07:13:26.070 --> 07:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
are unable to cope with trauma grief
 
07:13:28.070 --> 07:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
devastating financial problems the list
 
07:13:31.070 --> 07:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
is extensive uh in some instances these
 
07:13:32.948 --> 07:13:32.958 align:start position:0%
problems lead to people uh lead people
 
07:13:34.788 --> 07:13:34.798 align:start position:0%
into a dark
 
07:13:37.510 --> 07:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
place where the state must intervene to
 
07:13:39.310 --> 07:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
prevent the worst from happening
 
07:13:43.990 --> 07:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:46.430 --> 07:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
resilient and many people can bounce
 
07:13:48.070 --> 07:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
back from what could have been another
 
07:13:51.150 --> 07:13:51.160 align:start position:0%
tragedy however the stigma of receiving
 
07:13:52.628 --> 07:13:52.638 align:start position:0%
that care follows you for the rest of
 
07:13:55.708 --> 07:13:55.718 align:start position:0%
your life uh this bill creates an Avenue
 
07:13:58.110 --> 07:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
for people to petition the court after
 
07:14:00.030 --> 07:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
enough time has pass to have the
 
07:14:02.670 --> 07:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
commitment annulled and and treated as
 
07:14:04.868 --> 07:14:04.878 align:start position:0%
though it never occurred I remember when
 
07:14:07.230 --> 07:14:07.240 align:start position:0%
I enlisted in the Marine Corps in 2004
 
07:14:08.708 --> 07:14:08.718 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that they were waving
 
07:14:10.910 --> 07:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
all kinds of prerequisites the recruiter
 
07:14:13.070 --> 07:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
was extremely inquisitive about whether
 
07:14:15.430 --> 07:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
I'd received any kind of psychiatric uh
 
07:14:17.910 --> 07:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
care as it would be a disqualifier for
 
07:14:20.190 --> 07:14:20.200 align:start position:0%
enlistment it's understandable at face
 
07:14:22.388 --> 07:14:22.398 align:start position:0%
value but implies that Rehabilitation is
 
07:14:24.750 --> 07:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
impossible which to me is a discredit to
 
07:14:26.350 --> 07:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
the mental health profession and the
 
07:14:29.350 --> 07:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
resiliency of the human mind uh in a
 
07:14:31.468 --> 07:14:31.478 align:start position:0%
somewhat parallel path the uh Nicks
 
07:14:32.948 --> 07:14:32.958 align:start position:0%
background check which I've stated
 
07:14:34.510 --> 07:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
before this committee violates our right
 
07:14:36.030 --> 07:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
to not self-incriminate under the Fifth
 
07:14:36.948 --> 07:14:36.958 align:start position:0%
Amendment of the United States
 
07:14:40.350 --> 07:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution also requires divulging in
 
07:14:44.110 --> 07:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
uh involuntary commitments why the
 
07:14:46.670 --> 07:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
ATF which shouldn't exist has a
 
07:14:48.990 --> 07:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
mechanism for relief from disability we
 
07:14:51.468 --> 07:14:51.478 align:start position:0%
do not qualify and don't and shouldn't
 
07:14:53.830 --> 07:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
submit names to them in the first place
 
07:14:56.430 --> 07:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
I believe this bill similar to our
 
07:15:00.590 --> 07:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis annulments uh RSA Reserve uh
 
07:15:02.150 --> 07:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
serves as a clean path to keep the
 
07:15:04.190 --> 07:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
federal government out of this intimate
 
07:15:06.628 --> 07:15:06.638 align:start position:0%
intimate matter and allows recovering
 
07:15:08.868 --> 07:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
individual a recovered individual to
 
07:15:11.910 --> 07:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
regain their rights I ask that the vote
 
07:15:14.708 --> 07:15:14.718 align:start position:0%
uh the committee vote OTP on HB 1701 and
 
07:15:17.750 --> 07:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:20.350 --> 07:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative um
 
07:15:21.590 --> 07:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
can you
 
07:15:24.270 --> 07:15:24.280 align:start position:0%
maybe just give us a a little bit of
 
07:15:27.670 --> 07:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
a synopsis of what this bill does yeah
 
07:15:29.510 --> 07:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
so the the bill it it it allows for
 
07:15:31.388 --> 07:15:31.398 align:start position:0%
annulment of involuntary Commitment if
 
07:15:32.788 --> 07:15:32.798 align:start position:0%
as long as it's nonviolent right so
 
07:15:34.628 --> 07:15:34.638 align:start position:0%
there's a the punishment section where
 
07:15:36.948 --> 07:15:36.958 align:start position:0%
if you're committed for a violent crime
 
07:15:39.270 --> 07:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
to a psychiatric care all of that is
 
07:15:41.110 --> 07:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
excluded this instead allows you to
 
07:15:42.788 --> 07:15:42.798 align:start position:0%
anull it and treat your commitment as if
 
07:15:44.548 --> 07:15:44.558 align:start position:0%
it never happened to include like if you
 
07:15:46.350 --> 07:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
were to approach a military recruiter
 
07:15:47.670 --> 07:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
you can treat it as though it never
 
07:15:49.590 --> 07:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
happened you could be like I'm fine and
 
07:15:51.510 --> 07:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
when you fill out the the check the the
 
07:15:53.430 --> 07:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
Nicks background check there's also the
 
07:15:55.788 --> 07:15:55.798 align:start position:0%
check box like I've ever been committed
 
07:15:58.070 --> 07:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
you could say no honestly because as far
 
07:16:00.270 --> 07:16:00.280 align:start position:0%
as our laws law is concerned it has been
 
07:16:02.628 --> 07:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
analled with the analment okay thank you
 
07:16:05.110 --> 07:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
very much representative
 
07:16:08.910 --> 07:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
scitec um I like to ask you about uh
 
07:16:11.990 --> 07:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
Roman 7 uh I want to be sure I
 
07:16:13.670 --> 07:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
understand it a journalist or reporter
 
07:16:16.788 --> 07:16:16.798 align:start position:0%
shall not be subject to penalties for
 
07:16:19.110 --> 07:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
broadcasting that a person has been
 
07:16:20.990 --> 07:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
involuntarily committed subject to a
 
07:16:22.628 --> 07:16:22.638 align:start position:0%
commitment order that has been ened
 
07:16:24.830 --> 07:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
including the content of the record does
 
07:16:27.350 --> 07:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
that mean that the reporter is free to
 
07:16:29.750 --> 07:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
say this person has an En olded record
 
07:16:31.788 --> 07:16:31.798 align:start position:0%
and it contained the following
 
07:16:33.910 --> 07:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
information yeah when I filed this the
 
07:16:36.190 --> 07:16:36.200 align:start position:0%
the OS had asked if I wanted to mimic
 
07:16:37.990 --> 07:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
exactly like how the the Cannabis one
 
07:16:39.948 --> 07:16:39.958 align:start position:0%
had been and that I believe that's there
 
07:16:41.628 --> 07:16:41.638 align:start position:0%
to just kind of make it so if a reporter
 
07:16:43.070 --> 07:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
ever reports on it they're not guilty of
 
07:16:46.430 --> 07:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
any crime for divulging the information
 
07:16:48.270 --> 07:16:48.280 align:start position:0%
like I'm I'm assuming if they got a hold
 
07:16:49.388 --> 07:16:49.398 align:start position:0%
of the information they may have got it
 
07:16:50.830 --> 07:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
through nefarious means there may a
 
07:16:53.750 --> 07:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
criminal thing there but if I can follow
 
07:16:56.030 --> 07:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
so that means that while it may be
 
07:16:58.070 --> 07:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
public you they can broadcast it as
 
07:17:00.468 --> 07:17:00.478 align:start position:0%
public information nothing can be done
 
07:17:03.190 --> 07:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
legally about this they're subject to
 
07:17:04.628 --> 07:17:04.638 align:start position:0%
they can get their job go in the Marine
 
07:17:06.670 --> 07:17:06.680 align:start position:0%
Corp do whatever sure even though this
 
07:17:09.030 --> 07:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
is known it's been en olded I would say
 
07:17:10.628 --> 07:17:10.638 align:start position:0%
under the state statute like it it
 
07:17:10.638 --> 07:17:11.548 align:start position:0%
under the state statute like it it
shouldn't

07:17:11.548 --> 07:17:11.558 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
07:17:13.628 --> 07:17:13.638 align:start position:0%
concern as far as the law is concerned
 
07:17:14.788 --> 07:17:14.798 align:start position:0%
it didn't happen right that's the
 
07:17:18.110 --> 07:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:21.590 --> 07:17:21.600 align:start position:0%

07:18:08.110 --> 07:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
Fields um you may be surprised to see me
 
07:18:10.788 --> 07:18:10.798 align:start position:0%
as a co-sponsor on this bill it is odd
 
07:18:13.350 --> 07:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
um I entered as a co-sponsor with a very
 
07:18:14.868 --> 07:18:14.878 align:start position:0%
clear agreement with the prime sponsor
 
07:18:16.388 --> 07:18:16.398 align:start position:0%
that I would come and testify that I'm
 
07:18:19.070 --> 07:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
not okay with the current language as it
 
07:18:21.030 --> 07:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
is written and I will not support it as
 
07:18:23.270 --> 07:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
currently written on the floor but it
 
07:18:25.270 --> 07:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
does need an amendment and I do think
 
07:18:26.750 --> 07:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
with the amendment it is worth
 
07:18:29.910 --> 07:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
supporting and I will tell you why um
 
07:18:32.230 --> 07:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
first I need to State because the one of
 
07:18:34.510 --> 07:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
the rights the main right probably
 
07:18:36.150 --> 07:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
that's being restored here is the
 
07:18:38.868 --> 07:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
ability to own a gun uh I need to State
 
07:18:41.030 --> 07:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
my position generally on guns I see them
 
07:18:44.230 --> 07:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
as a tool um a tool that hopefully you
 
07:18:47.030 --> 07:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
don't ever really need usually I think
 
07:18:48.670 --> 07:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
people who are obsessed with that
 
07:18:51.230 --> 07:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
particular tool are kind of weird
 
07:18:54.230 --> 07:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
um however there are proper uses for
 
07:18:57.030 --> 07:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
that tool and I also taught American
 
07:18:59.468 --> 07:18:59.478 align:start position:0%
government at college for four years
 
07:19:01.830 --> 07:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
which meant I taught the Constitution so
 
07:19:03.388 --> 07:19:03.398 align:start position:0%
the other side of that is the Second
 
07:19:05.750 --> 07:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment does exist I understand it
 
07:19:08.548 --> 07:19:08.558 align:start position:0%
exists I understand why that it why it
 
07:19:11.070 --> 07:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
exists and when I taught that I would
 
07:19:13.110 --> 07:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
frequently show my students footage of
 
07:19:16.430 --> 07:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
tianan square um and unarmed people
 
07:19:20.230 --> 07:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
being mowed down uh I will say also that
 
07:19:22.628 --> 07:19:22.638 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court has backed up the
 
07:19:24.628 --> 07:19:24.638 align:start position:0%
meaning of the Second Amendment because
 
07:19:26.788 --> 07:19:26.798 align:start position:0%
it does refer to a well-regulated
 
07:19:29.110 --> 07:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
militia however just as everybody in
 
07:19:31.670 --> 07:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
this room I'm sure would not question
 
07:19:33.150 --> 07:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
the right of a Sovereign Nation to
 
07:19:35.190 --> 07:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
defend itself it turns out that that
 
07:19:37.510 --> 07:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
right as Supreme Court has stated is
 
07:19:39.468 --> 07:19:39.478 align:start position:0%
built on the inherent human right to
 
07:19:42.628 --> 07:19:42.638 align:start position:0%
defend your own self your own body uh
 
07:19:45.868 --> 07:19:45.878 align:start position:0%
from harm and so therefore um my
 
07:19:49.110 --> 07:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
position may seem nuanced on guns in
 
07:19:51.548 --> 07:19:51.558 align:start position:0%
general so as I said I signed on to this
 
07:19:54.510 --> 07:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
bill specifically that I understand that
 
07:19:56.830 --> 07:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
the language says that if it's someone
 
07:19:58.670 --> 07:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
that the rights are restored after 5
 
07:20:01.270 --> 07:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
years after an involuntary commitment
 
07:20:04.110 --> 07:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
unless the person plad Guilty by reason
 
07:20:06.150 --> 07:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
of insanity to a violent offense I think
 
07:20:08.270 --> 07:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
that needs to go a little bit further
 
07:20:12.628 --> 07:20:12.638 align:start position:0%
and actually no one who was um
 
07:20:14.750 --> 07:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
involuntarily committed in in relation
 
07:20:17.590 --> 07:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
to any violent offense whether they plad
 
07:20:20.510 --> 07:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh Not Guilty by reason and insanity
 
07:20:22.468 --> 07:20:22.478 align:start position:0%
or not should be excluded from this
 
07:20:23.910 --> 07:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
restoration of Rights if there was a
 
07:20:25.750 --> 07:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
violent offense committed you should not
 
07:20:29.590 --> 07:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
be getting your firearm back however and
 
07:20:30.708 --> 07:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
this is where I'm going to get into my
 
07:20:33.788 --> 07:20:33.798 align:start position:0%
personal story the vast majority as I
 
07:20:36.150 --> 07:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
understand it of involuntary commitments
 
07:20:38.110 --> 07:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
across the country and I cannot speak
 
07:20:40.788 --> 07:20:40.798 align:start position:0%
specifically to New Hampshire um are
 
07:20:43.670 --> 07:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
72-hour holds after someone has tried to
 
07:20:43.680 --> 07:20:46.270 align:start position:0%
72-hour holds after someone has tried to
kill

07:20:46.270 --> 07:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:48.468 --> 07:20:48.478 align:start position:0%
themselves I've actually told some of
 
07:20:50.830 --> 07:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
this story before in my first term in
 
07:20:54.990 --> 07:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
favor of a gun safety measure um and I
 
07:20:56.510 --> 07:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
think it's funny I have to tell the same
 
07:20:59.150 --> 07:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
story kind of almost on the other
 
07:21:02.590 --> 07:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
side so my story is when I was 18 and I
 
07:21:06.310 --> 07:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
didn't have a lot of um social education
 
07:21:08.388 --> 07:21:08.398 align:start position:0%
I didn't really know a lot of things
 
07:21:10.190 --> 07:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
about the world I got involved with my
 
07:21:12.350 --> 07:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
first major boyfriend who turned out to
 
07:21:14.628 --> 07:21:14.638 align:start position:0%
be extremely violent for a year and a
 
07:21:18.910 --> 07:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
half I was beaten repeatedly um he held
 
07:21:21.270 --> 07:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
me captive for 3 days in an apartment he
 
07:21:24.510 --> 07:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
hit me with a car um when the cops saved
 
07:21:25.910 --> 07:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
me from one instance they said it was
 
07:21:27.590 --> 07:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
the worst case of domestic violence
 
07:21:29.110 --> 07:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
they' ever seen where someone didn't die
 
07:21:31.948 --> 07:21:31.958 align:start position:0%
and if I didn't leave I would definitely
 
07:21:31.958 --> 07:21:33.990 align:start position:0%
and if I didn't leave I would definitely
die

07:21:33.990 --> 07:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
die
 
07:21:38.948 --> 07:21:38.958 align:start position:0%
um this went on uh until actually uh he
 
07:21:40.628 --> 07:21:40.638 align:start position:0%
had a warrant he ended up with a warrant
 
07:21:42.430 --> 07:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
and I got away from him in a
 
07:21:44.270 --> 07:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
relationship sense but he continued to
 
07:21:47.310 --> 07:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
to stalk me and send me uh threatening
 
07:21:49.510 --> 07:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
messages until there was a warrant taken
 
07:21:51.030 --> 07:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
out on him in the state and then he was
 
07:21:52.788 --> 07:21:52.798 align:start position:0%
forced out of the state and he continued
 
07:21:54.430 --> 07:21:54.440 align:start position:0%
this was when I was in college he
 
07:21:56.830 --> 07:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
continued to send me death threats um to
 
07:21:59.070 --> 07:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
the point that and apparently he had
 
07:22:00.830 --> 07:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
other warrants in other states as well
 
07:22:02.910 --> 07:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
the FBI got involved I literally had two
 
07:22:06.190 --> 07:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
FBI agents in my dorm room as a college
 
07:22:08.910 --> 07:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
student um and it didn't end until I
 
07:22:11.388 --> 07:22:11.398 align:start position:0%
moved to Japan for three years where he
 
07:22:16.708 --> 07:22:16.718 align:start position:0%
lost track of me um during that time of
 
07:22:19.310 --> 07:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of upheaval and me not really at
 
07:22:21.150 --> 07:22:21.160 align:start position:0%
18-year-old me not really knowing how to
 
07:22:23.788 --> 07:22:23.798 align:start position:0%
handle things uh in a particularly low
 
07:22:26.750 --> 07:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
moment I took an entire bottle of my
 
07:22:31.110 --> 07:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
brother's uh clonin which is an anti- um
 
07:22:35.190 --> 07:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
spasmodic uh drug um because I just
 
07:22:37.070 --> 07:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
didn't know what else to do my life had
 
07:22:40.230 --> 07:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
become so bad at the age of 18 and I was
 
07:22:42.868 --> 07:22:42.878 align:start position:0%
rushed to the hospital uh
 
07:22:45.190 --> 07:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
apparently they couldn't find my blood
 
07:22:47.548 --> 07:22:47.558 align:start position:0%
pressure apparently my temperature was
 
07:22:50.948 --> 07:22:50.958 align:start position:0%
84 and the point of all this is that I
 
07:22:53.350 --> 07:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
was put into a 72-hour involuntary
 
07:22:55.910 --> 07:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
commitment because I had tried to kill
 
07:22:59.788 --> 07:22:59.798 align:start position:0%
myself the irony is I get through that I
 
07:23:03.270 --> 07:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
get away I go to Japan I come back to
 
07:23:05.070 --> 07:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
the States I get my Master's Degree in
 
07:23:07.590 --> 07:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I you know have this kind
 
07:23:10.948 --> 07:23:10.958 align:start position:0%
of much much much better healthier life
 
07:23:14.948 --> 07:23:14.958 align:start position:0%
and um after 11 years he found me and he
 
07:23:17.350 --> 07:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
started sending me threats again to the
 
07:23:19.308 --> 07:23:19.318 align:start position:0%
point regularly until to the point that
 
07:23:21.230 --> 07:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
the police offic officers in New Market
 
07:23:23.628 --> 07:23:23.638 align:start position:0%
had to get a warrant for his phone
 
07:23:25.070 --> 07:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
records so that they could find his
 
07:23:26.788 --> 07:23:26.798 align:start position:0%
location to deliver an order of
 
07:23:28.868 --> 07:23:28.878 align:start position:0%
protection against him turns out he was
 
07:23:30.308 --> 07:23:30.318 align:start position:0%
in Texas by the
 
07:23:34.708 --> 07:23:34.718 align:start position:0%
way so at that time I was scared and I
 
07:23:36.708 --> 07:23:36.718 align:start position:0%
went to go shop for a
 
07:23:39.030 --> 07:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
gun as one might
 
07:23:43.388 --> 07:23:43.398 align:start position:0%
do and um I personally like I said it's
 
07:23:47.628 --> 07:23:47.638 align:start position:0%
a tool uh I personally don't like guns
 
07:23:49.510 --> 07:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
but at that point I thought maybe I
 
07:23:52.510 --> 07:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
should be familiar with this Tool uh I
 
07:23:55.350 --> 07:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
ended up not purchasing one but it turns
 
07:23:58.548 --> 07:23:58.558 align:start position:0%
out I wouldn't have been able to so very
 
07:24:01.350 --> 07:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
ironically the very cause of the reason
 
07:24:04.030 --> 07:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
I almost killed myself was the reason I
 
07:24:07.150 --> 07:24:07.160 align:start position:0%
needed protection later and here at the
 
07:24:09.948 --> 07:24:09.958 align:start position:0%
age of 44 because of me being in a low
 
07:24:12.308 --> 07:24:12.318 align:start position:0%
point at the age of 18 I would not be
 
07:24:14.948 --> 07:24:14.958 align:start position:0%
able to buy a firearm today if I was
 
07:24:18.030 --> 07:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
honest on those Rec on those forms and
 
07:24:22.788 --> 07:24:22.798 align:start position:0%
that is why I agreed to co-sponsor
 
07:24:28.230 --> 07:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:31.910 --> 07:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
second so to the point of
 
07:24:34.948 --> 07:24:34.958 align:start position:0%
suicide um five years is is a good time
 
07:24:37.788 --> 07:24:37.798 align:start position:0%
to wait for someone after they've hit a
 
07:24:41.708 --> 07:24:41.718 align:start position:0%
low spot and I know that mathematically
 
07:24:43.430 --> 07:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
because insurance companies when you go
 
07:24:46.190 --> 07:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
to buy life insurance that would cover
 
07:24:47.708 --> 07:24:47.718 align:start position:0%
uh accidents and the like they will
 
07:24:50.868 --> 07:24:50.878 align:start position:0%
cover suicide but only after 2 years
 
07:24:52.868 --> 07:24:52.878 align:start position:0%
after you've had the policy which means
 
07:24:55.030 --> 07:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
that the insurance industry has
 
07:24:57.430 --> 07:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
mathematically figured out that you are
 
07:25:00.030 --> 07:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
no more of a risk of suicide two years
 
07:25:02.270 --> 07:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
after being suicidal than the general
 
07:25:03.990 --> 07:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
public because they are willing to pay
 
07:25:06.150 --> 07:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
you for that life insurance policy even
 
07:25:10.948 --> 07:25:10.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:15.150 --> 07:25:15.160 align:start position:0%
years suicide is a problem
 
07:25:17.788 --> 07:25:17.798 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that we take away the
 
07:25:20.110 --> 07:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
risk of suicide simply by taking away
 
07:25:22.070 --> 07:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
what we think of as the means of suicide
 
07:25:23.590 --> 07:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
because when people are determined like
 
07:25:26.628 --> 07:25:26.638 align:start position:0%
I was in that moment they will find a
 
07:25:28.910 --> 07:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
way I think the way you deal with
 
07:25:30.948 --> 07:25:30.958 align:start position:0%
suicide is you provide people who are
 
07:25:34.030 --> 07:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
struggling with robust Health Care
 
07:25:36.030 --> 07:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Care physical health care
 
07:25:37.990 --> 07:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
I think you provide them with the basic
 
07:25:40.430 --> 07:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
needs of living and the tools to improve
 
07:25:42.190 --> 07:25:42.200 align:start position:0%
their lives I think you provide them
 
07:25:45.750 --> 07:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
with compassion stigma free compassion
 
07:25:47.670 --> 07:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
and dignity and
 
07:25:50.388 --> 07:25:50.398 align:start position:0%
support and in case you think speaking
 
07:25:53.430 --> 07:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
callously or without experience from
 
07:25:56.070 --> 07:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
suicide that boyfriend that I mentioned
 
07:25:58.110 --> 07:25:58.120 align:start position:0%
he ended up killing himself in 2016 the
 
07:26:00.990 --> 07:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
same year that I I got elected so he's
 
07:26:03.350 --> 07:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
no longer a threat in my life my uncle
 
07:26:05.468 --> 07:26:05.478 align:start position:0%
also killed himself but more importantly
 
07:26:07.750 --> 07:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
I wasn't very very close to my uncle my
 
07:26:09.948 --> 07:26:09.958 align:start position:0%
dad who I was very very close to killed
 
07:26:11.468 --> 07:26:11.478 align:start position:0%
himself when I was
 
07:26:16.150 --> 07:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
21 and as much as I would love to have
 
07:26:18.788 --> 07:26:18.798 align:start position:0%
him with me
 
07:26:21.468 --> 07:26:21.478 align:start position:0%
today he was very depressed and if he
 
07:26:23.868 --> 07:26:23.878 align:start position:0%
asked me in the moments before he did
 
07:26:27.150 --> 07:26:27.160 align:start position:0%
that give me another option how do I end
 
07:26:29.270 --> 07:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
this suffering I wouldn't have been able
 
07:26:30.990 --> 07:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
to give him one because those supports
 
07:26:33.230 --> 07:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
that I just listed for you we don't give
 
07:26:33.240 --> 07:26:36.150 align:start position:0%
that I just listed for you we don't give
to

07:26:36.150 --> 07:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:39.548 --> 07:26:39.558 align:start position:0%
people so even though it pains me to
 
07:26:42.070 --> 07:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
say I do believe in people's bodily
 
07:26:43.548 --> 07:26:43.558 align:start position:0%
autonomy and I do believe in the right
 
07:26:45.430 --> 07:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
to die because I don't have a better
 
07:26:46.868 --> 07:26:46.878 align:start position:0%
option for people who are suffering
 
07:26:51.548 --> 07:26:51.558 align:start position:0%
unless we provide them with health care
 
07:26:55.270 --> 07:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
so if what you want to do is prevent
 
07:26:57.308 --> 07:26:57.318 align:start position:0%
violence then you focus on the people
 
07:26:59.388 --> 07:26:59.398 align:start position:0%
who were violent which is why I ask you
 
07:27:02.190 --> 07:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
to amend this bill focus on the people
 
07:27:04.990 --> 07:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
like that boyfriend that I had but you
 
07:27:06.548 --> 07:27:06.558 align:start position:0%
don't punish
 
07:27:09.070 --> 07:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
people from having their constitutional
 
07:27:11.150 --> 07:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
and human right to defend
 
07:27:12.948 --> 07:27:12.958 align:start position:0%
themselves just because they went
 
07:27:16.590 --> 07:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
through a bad time 10 or 15 or 20 or 30
 
07:27:16.600 --> 07:27:18.708 align:start position:0%
through a bad time 10 or 15 or 20 or 30
years

07:27:18.708 --> 07:27:18.718 align:start position:0%
years
 
07:27:18.718 --> 07:27:21.190 align:start position:0%
years
ago

07:27:21.190 --> 07:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
ago
 
07:27:22.708 --> 07:27:22.718 align:start position:0%
sometimes to defend themselves from the
 
07:27:24.030 --> 07:27:24.040 align:start position:0%
very reason they went through the bad
 
07:27:26.430 --> 07:27:26.440 align:start position:0%
time to begin with and especially when
 
07:27:28.350 --> 07:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
there's no evidence that they are any
 
07:27:30.388 --> 07:27:30.398 align:start position:0%
more likely to take their lives after
 
07:27:32.110 --> 07:27:32.120 align:start position:0%
two years but in this case five years
 
07:27:38.030 --> 07:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:40.150 --> 07:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
questions thank you represent I shut
 
07:27:43.868 --> 07:27:43.878 align:start position:0%

um and and representative just so you
 
07:27:52.670 --> 07:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
know we try really hard to um Let It Be
 
07:27:55.350 --> 07:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
the sponsor if you think that a that an
 
07:27:58.230 --> 07:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
amendment is necessary we would ask that
 
07:28:00.788 --> 07:28:00.798 align:start position:0%
you take care of the amendment and not
 
07:28:02.788 --> 07:28:02.798 align:start position:0%
ask the the committee to do that just so
 
07:28:04.670 --> 07:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to to offer my assistance
 
07:28:04.680 --> 07:28:05.948 align:start position:0%

Dunbarton Dunbarton hooks at Allenstown
 
07:28:26.708 --> 07:28:26.718 align:start position:0%
in Epsom um I would like to thank
 
07:28:29.190 --> 07:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
representative Reed for her testimony as
 
07:28:31.270 --> 07:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
I said in the prior
 
07:28:34.070 --> 07:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
Bell I had the chance to have a a deep
 
07:28:36.388 --> 07:28:36.398 align:start position:0%
dive into mental health in the last six
 
07:28:40.190 --> 07:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
months um not on my roadmap not for me
 
07:28:42.070 --> 07:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
personally but someone I care about
 
07:28:43.468 --> 07:28:43.478 align:start position:0%
learned a
 
07:28:47.510 --> 07:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
lot um I'm here in support of this bill
 
07:28:49.150 --> 07:28:49.160 align:start position:0%
back to the same rationale that I gave
 
07:28:50.788 --> 07:28:50.798 align:start position:0%
before most of the people who have
 
07:28:53.070 --> 07:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
mental health issues are not
 
07:28:55.548 --> 07:28:55.558 align:start position:0%
violent I had a discussion with an
 
07:28:57.350 --> 07:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
attorney several years ago we were
 
07:29:00.468 --> 07:29:00.478 align:start position:0%
talking about um in Broad Strokes that
 
07:29:01.990 --> 07:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
attorney's client and that attorney's
 
07:29:04.388 --> 07:29:04.398 align:start position:0%
client basically couldn't fix an issue
 
07:29:07.670 --> 07:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
but if it was tied to a crime they could
 
07:29:11.830 --> 07:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
so if there's a criminal element to this
 
07:29:11.840 --> 07:29:12.750 align:start position:0%
so if there's a criminal element to this
mental

07:29:12.750 --> 07:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
mental
 
07:29:15.948 --> 07:29:15.958 align:start position:0%
health um adjudication at all then you
 
07:29:17.830 --> 07:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
can get the whole thing en
 
07:29:21.548 --> 07:29:21.558 align:start position:0%
olded but if there's no not you're
 
07:29:24.830 --> 07:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
stuck why is our society have a policy
 
07:29:26.510 --> 07:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
in place that it's better to be a
 
07:29:28.190 --> 07:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
criminal so you can clean up your record
 
07:29:30.510 --> 07:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
than having a health issue in this case
 
07:29:33.190 --> 07:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
mental health issue so you can't this
 
07:29:35.670 --> 07:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
seems like a clean simple thing going
 
07:29:38.230 --> 07:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
forward um representative Reed I'd like
 
07:29:41.270 --> 07:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
to see her amendment in terms of
 
07:29:43.670 --> 07:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
excluding certain
 
07:29:46.670 --> 07:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
individuals I from at a high level I I
 
07:29:48.590 --> 07:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
don't see a major concern about that I
 
07:29:52.190 --> 07:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
mean if if you plead Insanity to a
 
07:29:55.350 --> 07:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
violent crime and that's how you believe
 
07:29:57.070 --> 07:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
at the time your Council LED you to
 
07:29:58.628 --> 07:29:58.638 align:start position:0%
believe that that was the right thing
 
07:30:00.868 --> 07:30:00.878 align:start position:0%
and you're in the mental health um
 
07:30:02.750 --> 07:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
Hospital in
 
07:30:05.190 --> 07:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
conquered I'm not sure upon release you
 
07:30:08.110 --> 07:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
get a chance to get that an old but
 
07:30:11.030 --> 07:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
outside of that small narrow scope as I
 
07:30:13.468 --> 07:30:13.478 align:start position:0%
said before most mentally ill patients
 
07:30:16.868 --> 07:30:16.878 align:start position:0%
are not violent why are we giving Pro
 
07:30:18.628 --> 07:30:18.638 align:start position:0%
and in some cases they may have been
 
07:30:22.628 --> 07:30:22.638 align:start position:0%
depressed nailed it right she had a bad
 
07:30:25.708 --> 07:30:25.718 align:start position:0%
experience had about an an episode of
 
07:30:28.350 --> 07:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
depression of some sort and then that
 
07:30:30.388 --> 07:30:30.398 align:start position:0%
triggered her inability to defend
 
07:30:32.628 --> 07:30:32.638 align:start position:0%
herself this happens a lot more often
 
07:30:34.070 --> 07:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
than we might think and I would ask that
 
07:30:36.030 --> 07:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
you would pass this bill I will gladly
 
07:30:37.510 --> 07:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
join if there's a subcommittee to work
 
07:30:38.708 --> 07:30:38.718 align:start position:0%
on the language I don't know if this is
 
07:30:40.788 --> 07:30:40.798 align:start position:0%
an early bill or not it's an FN so it
 
07:30:44.308 --> 07:30:44.318 align:start position:0%
probably is um but no matter what I'm
 
07:30:46.308 --> 07:30:46.318 align:start position:0%
willing to help Shepherd this through
 
07:30:47.670 --> 07:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
because I think it matters we should not
 
07:30:49.150 --> 07:30:49.160 align:start position:0%
require people to be criminals so they
 
07:30:52.708 --> 07:30:52.718 align:start position:0%
can get and a record and old thank
 
07:31:01.628 --> 07:31:01.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:03.708 --> 07:31:03.718 align:start position:0%
representative before I Slaughter this
 
07:31:14.270 --> 07:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:14.280 --> 07:31:18.350 align:start position:0%

the wording with regard to the analment
 
07:31:45.110 --> 07:31:45.120 align:start position:0%

never been involuntarily committed um we
 
07:32:20.468 --> 07:32:20.478 align:start position:0%
just would like to see some more clear
 
07:32:23.190 --> 07:32:23.200 align:start position:0%

admitted to us in the
 
07:32:33.388 --> 07:32:33.398 align:start position:0%
past and
 
07:32:38.830 --> 07:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
then section six C court records and any

or his or her medical professional and
 
07:32:52.270 --> 07:32:52.280 align:start position:0%
just um his or her medical professional
 
07:32:55.548 --> 07:32:55.558 align:start position:0%
is is kind of a vague term as well we're
 
07:32:57.430 --> 07:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
not quite sure what that means does that
 
07:32:59.628 --> 07:32:59.638 align:start position:0%
mean the medical professional at the
 
07:33:03.948 --> 07:33:03.958 align:start position:0%
hospital if you are um committed in in
 
07:33:05.830 --> 07:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
the future to New Hampshire hospital
 
07:33:07.430 --> 07:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
does that mean you're outpatient
 
07:33:09.788 --> 07:33:09.798 align:start position:0%
provider um just some more clarity
 
07:33:15.270 --> 07:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:18.150 --> 07:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
terms thank
 
07:33:18.160 --> 07:33:20.150 align:start position:0%
terms thank
you

07:33:20.150 --> 07:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:33:22.388 --> 07:33:22.398 align:start position:0%
um if I may just add I have a pink slip
 
07:33:24.150 --> 07:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
in too but I can just quick quickly spit
 
07:33:28.110 --> 07:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
it out if you want um so the the impact
 
07:33:31.190 --> 07:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
of the potential to have um that
 
07:33:35.308 --> 07:33:35.318 align:start position:0%
language around um having to what is the
 
07:33:38.270 --> 07:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
language the impact of
 
07:33:42.468 --> 07:33:42.478 align:start position:0%
6A is that if if taken a total face
 
07:33:44.708 --> 07:33:44.718 align:start position:0%
value we would not be able to use prior
 
07:33:46.910 --> 07:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
medical records if the person needs to
 
07:33:49.270 --> 07:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
come in for another commitment if the
 
07:33:50.830 --> 07:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
patient needs to have a dangerousness
 
07:33:53.110 --> 07:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
assessment if the person needs to have a
 
07:33:55.388 --> 07:33:55.398 align:start position:0%
competency to stand trial assessment all
 
07:33:57.388 --> 07:33:57.398 align:start position:0%
those records would be unavailable to
 
07:34:00.468 --> 07:34:00.478 align:start position:0%
forensic assessors and essentially
 
07:34:02.990 --> 07:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
really their ability to render a
 
07:34:04.910 --> 07:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
um informed opinion to the court
 
07:34:06.910 --> 07:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
regarding those types of questions so
 
07:34:09.350 --> 07:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's a concern regarding um our
 
07:34:15.708 --> 07:34:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:17.788 --> 07:34:17.798 align:start position:0%
135c hold on one sec representative
 
07:34:20.308 --> 07:34:20.318 align:start position:0%
Newman could you just remind us of your
 
07:34:22.670 --> 07:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
you said you did turn in a pain card I I
 
07:34:24.150 --> 07:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
did okay could you just remind us of
 
07:34:25.468 --> 07:34:25.478 align:start position:0%
your name as we're just trying to get
 
07:34:27.708 --> 07:34:27.718 align:start position:0%
I'm so sorry Jeffrey feder thank you
 
07:34:29.910 --> 07:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
that's representative
 
07:34:32.548 --> 07:34:32.558 align:start position:0%
Newman could you just comment on how we
 
07:34:35.670 --> 07:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
how the wording might be changed what
 
07:34:38.270 --> 07:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
you think about how it could be changed
 
07:34:40.910 --> 07:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
to to address that where an En elment
 
07:34:42.388 --> 07:34:42.398 align:start position:0%
means it's gone and you can't keep it
 
07:34:44.910 --> 07:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
and there's no absolutely no record so
 
07:34:47.510 --> 07:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
how can you have an adelement without
 
07:34:50.150 --> 07:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
that I don't have language at the top of
 
07:34:56.990 --> 07:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:03.468 --> 07:35:03.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:07.388 --> 07:35:07.398 align:start position:0%
you Dr Hannon still
 
07:35:10.708 --> 07:35:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:17.990 --> 07:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:18.000 --> 07:35:33.308 align:start position:0%
 
Dean

07:35:33.308 --> 07:35:33.318 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:35.230 --> 07:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee I
 
07:35:37.628 --> 07:35:37.638 align:start position:0%
mistakenly understood that this bill was
 
07:35:40.948 --> 07:35:40.958 align:start position:0%
tied to um
 
07:35:44.628 --> 07:35:44.638 align:start position:0%
1701 1711 I apologize it is not I'm very
 
07:35:46.628 --> 07:35:46.638 align:start position:0%
much in support of it knowing that it's
 
07:35:48.910 --> 07:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
a stand or believing that it's a
 
07:35:52.110 --> 07:35:52.120 align:start position:0%
Standalone Bill if that makes sense so
 
07:35:53.910 --> 07:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
yeah just so the card can be corrected I
 
07:35:56.510 --> 07:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to thank you and I apologize
 
07:35:59.430 --> 07:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
for making the mistake this bill is a
 
07:36:02.910 --> 07:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
fabulous bill and it's too bad that one
 
07:36:02.920 --> 07:36:03.708 align:start position:0%
fabulous bill and it's too bad that one
of

07:36:03.708 --> 07:36:03.718 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:36:07.388 --> 07:36:07.398 align:start position:0%
the um sponsors couldn't hear me testify
 
07:36:09.468 --> 07:36:09.478 align:start position:0%
because I think all of her concerns
 
07:36:13.230 --> 07:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
would be elate and here is why there is
 
07:36:16.230 --> 07:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
already massive Provisions in the
 
07:36:20.270 --> 07:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
current annulment statute which is RSA
 
07:36:24.230 --> 07:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
6515 that solves I believe all of her
 
07:36:26.910 --> 07:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
concerns and specifically I would direct
 
07:36:32.150 --> 07:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
you to but not limited to RSA 651 colon
 
07:36:39.110 --> 07:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
5 Roman 3 sub number two sub the letter
 
07:36:42.030 --> 07:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
B is in boy the letters H is in Harry
 
07:36:44.868 --> 07:36:44.878 align:start position:0%
the letter H is ey is an ice cream and
 
07:36:44.878 --> 07:36:46.628 align:start position:0%
the letter H is ey is an ice cream and
specifically

07:36:46.628 --> 07:36:46.638 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
07:36:49.430 --> 07:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
6515 Roman 13
 
07:36:53.948 --> 07:36:53.958 align:start position:0%
a through H is in Harry and 6515 Roman
 
07:36:57.468 --> 07:36:57.478 align:start position:0%
14 there's many many many exceptions for
 
07:36:59.628 --> 07:36:59.638 align:start position:0%
all sorts of violent crimes and rape and
 
07:37:01.510 --> 07:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
robbery you know giant lists that I
 
07:37:04.230 --> 07:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
won't read to you that cannot be en
 
07:37:07.030 --> 07:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
olded this statute or this bill would
 
07:37:09.868 --> 07:37:09.878 align:start position:0%
not change that but I would just ask you
 
07:37:11.350 --> 07:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
briefly one thing because I know it's
 
07:37:12.590 --> 07:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
the end of the day so I'm not going to
 
07:37:14.830 --> 07:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
bird dog this one either but I'm going
 
07:37:18.308 --> 07:37:18.318 align:start position:0%
to explain to you that if a person
 
07:37:19.590 --> 07:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
commits a
 
07:37:22.670 --> 07:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
crime and their iea I can get the record
 
07:37:24.948 --> 07:37:24.958 align:start position:0%
of null and get the rights back but let
 
07:37:26.510 --> 07:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
me tell you what some mean police
 
07:37:28.990 --> 07:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
departments do they deliberately get
 
07:37:31.230 --> 07:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
people iea and do not charge them with a
 
07:37:32.708 --> 07:37:32.718 align:start position:0%
crime even though they can charge them
 
07:37:34.788 --> 07:37:34.798 align:start position:0%
with several because they know they
 
07:37:36.270 --> 07:37:36.280 align:start position:0%
won't be able to get their gun rights
 
07:37:39.350 --> 07:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
back and I had a case years ago and I
 
07:37:41.510 --> 07:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
called the chief and I begged him to
 
07:37:43.750 --> 07:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
charge my client with something anything
 
07:37:45.150 --> 07:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
he could even make it bad and he had a
 
07:37:46.468 --> 07:37:46.478 align:start position:0%
whole list of crimes he could have
 
07:37:49.110 --> 07:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
legitimately charged my client with he
 
07:37:50.910 --> 07:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
says you want me to charge your client I
 
07:37:52.270 --> 07:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
said' I do
 
07:37:56.548 --> 07:37:56.558 align:start position:0%
please and he says why my mistake was
 
07:37:59.110 --> 07:37:59.120 align:start position:0%
telling him why he's like absolutely not
 
07:38:00.910 --> 07:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
it's a good thing to know and I'm sure
 
07:38:03.590 --> 07:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
he passed the word along I thought by
 
07:38:06.150 --> 07:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
being forthright and reasonable with him
 
07:38:08.468 --> 07:38:08.478 align:start position:0%
that I would get a good response well
 
07:38:11.750 --> 07:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
that didn't happen but here's the larger
 
07:38:14.548 --> 07:38:14.558 align:start position:0%
issue we actually tried it I still told
 
07:38:16.150 --> 07:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
the client I said listen you buying an
 
07:38:17.628 --> 07:38:17.638 align:start position:0%
expensive lottery ticket we're going to
 
07:38:19.270 --> 07:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
go to conquered District courts where it
 
07:38:22.830 --> 07:38:22.840 align:start position:0%
at judge Bole and judge Bole said to me
 
07:38:24.948 --> 07:38:24.958 align:start position:0%
bless his heart he said attorney Dean
 
07:38:26.548 --> 07:38:26.558 align:start position:0%
can you show me any statute that gives
 
07:38:29.150 --> 07:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
me authority to do this I said I can't
 
07:38:31.350 --> 07:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
but it's plain all wrong and it should
 
07:38:33.670 --> 07:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
be covered you know we we can find a way
 
07:38:37.030 --> 07:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
and he was like yeah nice try and so my
 
07:38:39.990 --> 07:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
point is that if you commit a crime any
 
07:38:42.388 --> 07:38:42.398 align:start position:0%
crime be it large or small absent rape
 
07:38:44.670 --> 07:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
robbery and a whole bunch of crimes you
 
07:38:46.510 --> 07:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
can get your record anull and your gun
 
07:38:48.230 --> 07:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
rights back but if you just have a
 
07:38:51.230 --> 07:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
really bad day you can't and that's just
 
07:38:53.670 --> 07:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
plain not fair so I respectfully say
 
07:38:56.110 --> 07:38:56.120 align:start position:0%
this bill should be ought to pass and I
 
07:38:58.230 --> 07:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
can answer questions and you say how can
 
07:38:59.788 --> 07:38:59.798 align:start position:0%
this be that can't be right and the
 
07:39:02.150 --> 07:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
answer is it's not right it's the way it
 
07:39:07.590 --> 07:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:10.628 --> 07:39:10.638 align:start position:0%
that thank you there any questions we're
 
07:39:15.590 --> 07:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:17.628 --> 07:39:17.638 align:start position:0%

speakers between us but I'd like to
 
07:40:06.510 --> 07:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
piggy back on what New Hampshire
 
07:40:09.070 --> 07:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
hospital said with regard to some of the
 
07:40:11.150 --> 07:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
definitional matters pertaining to this
 
07:40:13.308 --> 07:40:13.318 align:start position:0%
bill we too don't understand what is
 
07:40:15.868 --> 07:40:15.878 align:start position:0%
meant by medical professional or who
 
07:40:18.308 --> 07:40:18.318 align:start position:0%
selects the medical professional in some
 
07:40:21.670 --> 07:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
of these uh Court proceedings the courts
 
07:40:24.670 --> 07:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
um appoint people to make evaluations is
 
07:40:27.230 --> 07:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
that that person's Medical Professional
 
07:40:29.590 --> 07:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know by looking at this bill
 
07:40:35.110 --> 07:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
another um definitional issue is um um
 
07:40:38.548 --> 07:40:38.558 align:start position:0%
the the analment of is when we speak
 
07:40:40.548 --> 07:40:40.558 align:start position:0%
about annulment we're talking about
 
07:40:42.510 --> 07:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
getting rid of something completely but
 
07:40:44.670 --> 07:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
it's unclear to us are we talking about
 
07:40:46.830 --> 07:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
annulling court paperwork or we talking
 
07:40:49.230 --> 07:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
about the attempt to in all medical
 
07:40:52.270 --> 07:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
records which may be tied to those
 
07:40:54.670 --> 07:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
proceedings um as someone who's worked
 
07:40:56.468 --> 07:40:56.478 align:start position:0%
in behavioral health for a number of
 
07:40:58.708 --> 07:40:58.718 align:start position:0%
years both at New Hampshire hospital and
 
07:41:00.468 --> 07:41:00.478 align:start position:0%
now for the Department of Corrections I
 
07:41:02.750 --> 07:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
can tell you these are very complex
 
07:41:05.628 --> 07:41:05.638 align:start position:0%
processes there are a lot of things that
 
07:41:07.670 --> 07:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
happen from the point of time whether
 
07:41:09.350 --> 07:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
someone is being receiving an
 
07:41:11.990 --> 07:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
involuntary commitment under RSA
 
07:41:15.388 --> 07:41:15.398 align:start position:0%
135c or the ngri process which is
 
07:41:17.990 --> 07:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
excluded from this bill and it's very
 
07:41:20.110 --> 07:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
that is very clearly
 
07:41:23.430 --> 07:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
stated um the other issue is is that
 
07:41:26.430 --> 07:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
these processes are not pigeon hold
 
07:41:29.430 --> 07:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
people can be over here over here
 
07:41:31.190 --> 07:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
getting this H there can be multiple
 
07:41:34.030 --> 07:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
things happening at once and all of
 
07:41:35.948 --> 07:41:35.958 align:start position:0%
these require people to be making
 
07:41:38.590 --> 07:41:38.600 align:start position:0%
decisions specifically with involuntary
 
07:41:41.190 --> 07:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
commitments with the ngri process the
 
07:41:45.708 --> 07:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
court and with incomplete
 
07:41:47.830 --> 07:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
records as any of you know if you don't
 
07:41:49.628 --> 07:41:49.638 align:start position:0%
have all the information it's really
 
07:41:53.590 --> 07:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
hard to make a decision and this bill
 
07:41:55.628 --> 07:41:55.638 align:start position:0%
though as well- intended as it appears
 
07:41:58.910 --> 07:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
to be will result we believe in
 
07:42:00.670 --> 07:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
confusion without cleaning up a lot of
 
07:42:03.150 --> 07:42:03.160 align:start position:0%
the language without understanding the
 
07:42:05.990 --> 07:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
processes under which these decisions
 
07:42:08.708 --> 07:42:08.718 align:start position:0%
are made it is incredibly important for
 
07:42:11.350 --> 07:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
those evaluating and treating people who
 
07:42:13.830 --> 07:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
may need help in these situations to
 
07:42:15.628 --> 07:42:15.638 align:start position:0%
have all the information at their
 
07:42:19.948 --> 07:42:19.958 align:start position:0%
disposal to make those decisions a
 
07:42:24.350 --> 07:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
additionally my fear our fear is that um
 
07:42:26.670 --> 07:42:26.680 align:start position:0%
we for with an absence of Records or
 
07:42:28.590 --> 07:42:28.600 align:start position:0%
records that may be spotty as a result
 
07:42:30.670 --> 07:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
of the way this current legislation is
 
07:42:34.388 --> 07:42:34.398 align:start position:0%
or proposed legislation is written um it
 
07:42:36.628 --> 07:42:36.638 align:start position:0%
could have a detrimental impact on
 
07:42:40.510 --> 07:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
future evaluations for anybody um um in
 
07:42:43.230 --> 07:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
our system uh so it could result in
 
07:42:45.190 --> 07:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
dangerous persons going free it could
 
07:42:47.230 --> 07:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
result in people who need mental health
 
07:42:49.030 --> 07:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
treatment not getting it or being
 
07:42:53.270 --> 07:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
released um and um I would encourage the
 
07:42:56.628 --> 07:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
committee to uh vote this in expedient
 
07:42:59.350 --> 07:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
to legislate without much clarification
 
07:43:01.590 --> 07:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
needed around how we're going to manage
 
07:43:03.948 --> 07:43:03.958 align:start position:0%
medical records Healthcare records for
 
07:43:06.030 --> 07:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
the population being
 
07:43:08.670 --> 07:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
considered and that's the end of my
 
07:43:10.910 --> 07:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
testimony and we are happy to take
 
07:43:12.910 --> 07:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
questions if there are
 
07:43:14.948 --> 07:43:14.958 align:start position:0%
any representative
 
07:43:17.590 --> 07:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
jandan thank you madam chair and thank
 
07:43:20.030 --> 07:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question question uh I
 
07:43:21.948 --> 07:43:21.958 align:start position:0%
I took some notes which is very unusual
 
07:43:25.788 --> 07:43:25.798 align:start position:0%
for me but um it sounds to me like the
 
07:43:28.708 --> 07:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
the hospital the state hospital the
 
07:43:31.110 --> 07:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
psych secure psychiatric unit and
 
07:43:32.308 --> 07:43:32.318 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
07:43:35.110 --> 07:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
Corrections still want to have access to
 
07:43:38.190 --> 07:43:38.200 align:start position:0%
the medical records for any involuntary
 
07:43:41.350 --> 07:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
commitments is is that correct I can
 
07:43:43.628 --> 07:43:43.638 align:start position:0%
speak for the New Hampshire Department
 
07:43:45.788 --> 07:43:45.798 align:start position:0%
of Corrections under which the secure
 
07:43:48.708 --> 07:43:48.718 align:start position:0%
psychiatric unit or spu is managed and
 
07:43:50.308 --> 07:43:50.318 align:start position:0%
the answer is
 
07:43:52.830 --> 07:43:52.840 align:start position:0%
yes New Hampshire hospital course
 
07:43:54.948 --> 07:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
representative is under Department of
 
07:43:56.750 --> 07:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and I believe
 
07:43:59.750 --> 07:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
they've left thank
 
07:44:03.070 --> 07:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
you representative Stone thank you madam
 
07:44:04.190 --> 07:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
07:44:06.150 --> 07:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
question typically how long do you
 
07:44:08.670 --> 07:44:08.680 align:start position:0%
retain records under your current
 
07:44:11.708 --> 07:44:11.718 align:start position:0%
policies upon uh an individual leaving
 
07:44:15.670 --> 07:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
your custody for our health care records
 
07:44:18.910 --> 07:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections has a
 
07:44:22.110 --> 07:44:22.120 align:start position:0%
7year window I want to be clear that
 
07:44:24.350 --> 07:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
means that if someone were released from
 
07:44:27.510 --> 07:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
our custody today we never saw them
 
07:44:29.548 --> 07:44:29.558 align:start position:0%
again at the point of seven years from
 
07:44:33.468 --> 07:44:33.478 align:start position:0%
today we would um uh uh destroy that
 
07:44:35.110 --> 07:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
record we would shred it it's
 
07:44:36.628 --> 07:44:36.638 align:start position:0%
confidential Health Care information we
 
07:44:38.590 --> 07:44:38.600 align:start position:0%
would shred it but we have obviously
 
07:44:40.468 --> 07:44:40.478 align:start position:0%
have people in our custody who have been
 
07:44:42.750 --> 07:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
there for quite a while those records
 
07:44:45.350 --> 07:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
are from start to finish you'll have we
 
07:44:47.110 --> 07:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
we have people who are in our system 20
 
07:44:49.110 --> 07:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
years we have a complete health record
 
07:44:51.750 --> 07:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
for the care we've provided to them
 
07:44:55.510 --> 07:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
followup followup so it's very common
 
07:44:57.708 --> 07:44:57.718 align:start position:0%
practice to see an individual that may
 
07:45:00.590 --> 07:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
be uh sporadic but over a longer span of
 
07:45:03.990 --> 07:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
time such as the 20 years be a repeat
 
07:45:06.030 --> 07:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
visitor it is not un commmon
 
07:45:08.948 --> 07:45:08.958 align:start position:0%
representative thank you representative
 
07:45:11.190 --> 07:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you madam chair and thank
 
07:45:12.590 --> 07:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
07:45:16.308 --> 07:45:16.318 align:start position:0%
question do you believe that that this
 
07:45:18.910 --> 07:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
CH something like this to go would it
 
07:45:20.910 --> 07:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
would it need a new definition or a
 
07:45:23.190 --> 07:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
special definition of En helment to be
 
07:45:26.548 --> 07:45:26.558 align:start position:0%
able to maybe carve out what you
 
07:45:30.628 --> 07:45:30.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:33.670 --> 07:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
um a special definition of En nment I
 
07:45:36.430 --> 07:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
think uh that is in statute already and
 
07:45:38.030 --> 07:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not an attorney I want to be very
 
07:45:40.388 --> 07:45:40.398 align:start position:0%
clear about that so I think I'd want to
 
07:45:44.030 --> 07:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
defer that uh answer to someone who has
 
07:45:46.030 --> 07:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
more expertise and understanding in that
 
07:45:47.430 --> 07:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
kind in that part of the New Hampshire
 
07:45:51.070 --> 07:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
statute thank you thank you for your
 
07:45:51.080 --> 07:45:53.030 align:start position:0%
statute thank you thank you for your
questions

07:45:53.030 --> 07:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:45:55.430 --> 07:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
07:45:58.510 --> 07:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
Ms did someone else okay representative
 
07:46:01.230 --> 07:46:01.240 align:start position:0%
Muse followed by representative Stone
 
07:46:03.750 --> 07:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
thanks what what kind of problems do you
 
07:46:06.948 --> 07:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
think it would create to not have access
 
07:46:09.070 --> 07:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
to records like this for
 
07:46:11.150 --> 07:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
you it would
 
07:46:15.350 --> 07:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
be troubling from the perspective of not
 
07:46:17.788 --> 07:46:17.798 align:start position:0%
knowing the kind of History so that we
 
07:46:22.030 --> 07:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
can help people um both in the let me
 
07:46:23.868 --> 07:46:23.878 align:start position:0%
say like this a lot of the folks that
 
07:46:28.670 --> 07:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
come to us have long histories of either
 
07:46:31.750 --> 07:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
mental illness arising from genetic
 
07:46:34.548 --> 07:46:34.558 align:start position:0%
predispositions or from trauma without
 
07:46:36.308 --> 07:46:36.318 align:start position:0%
having all the information so that we
 
07:46:38.430 --> 07:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
can understand what is Baseline for them
 
07:46:41.628 --> 07:46:41.638 align:start position:0%
I.E what is to be expected on a dayt day
 
07:46:44.230 --> 07:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
or what has been helpful to them in the
 
07:46:46.230 --> 07:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
past what hasn't been helpful to them in
 
07:46:48.670 --> 07:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
the past that continuity of the record
 
07:46:51.110 --> 07:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
is critical if you are in the position
 
07:46:52.868 --> 07:46:52.878 align:start position:0%
of doing an
 
07:46:55.708 --> 07:46:55.718 align:start position:0%
evaluation either for um something such
 
07:46:58.910 --> 07:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
as competency which happens in our state
 
07:47:01.708 --> 07:47:01.718 align:start position:0%
it makes for a better informed more
 
07:47:04.750 --> 07:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive evaluation if we know this
 
07:47:06.670 --> 07:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
person if we have all the information
 
07:47:09.548 --> 07:47:09.558 align:start position:0%
plus frankly from just a human
 
07:47:12.388 --> 07:47:12.398 align:start position:0%
perspective making having people tell
 
07:47:14.270 --> 07:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
their story over and over again is not
 
07:47:16.308 --> 07:47:16.318 align:start position:0%
always helpful it's very frustrating to
 
07:47:19.948 --> 07:47:19.958 align:start position:0%
people typically um it can it can not it
 
07:47:22.990 --> 07:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
can trigger them it can cause some more
 
07:47:25.308 --> 07:47:25.318 align:start position:0%
problems in terms of the immediacy of
 
07:47:28.350 --> 07:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
that whereas a good evaluator a good
 
07:47:30.150 --> 07:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
clinician can look at the records and
 
07:47:32.590 --> 07:47:32.600 align:start position:0%
say this this go through it and
 
07:47:34.190 --> 07:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
understand the person and pick up where
 
07:47:36.270 --> 07:47:36.280 align:start position:0%
the last person left off so that
 
07:47:37.708 --> 07:47:37.718 align:start position:0%
continuity is
 
07:47:39.830 --> 07:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
critical thanks for helping me
 
07:47:40.788 --> 07:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
understand I'm afraid that was a bit

project of gr State progress our
 
07:49:57.948 --> 07:49:57.958 align:start position:0%
organization has weighed on state and
 
07:50:01.388 --> 07:50:01.398 align:start position:0%
federal firearms policy since 2009 House
 
07:50:03.708 --> 07:50:03.718 align:start position:0%
Bill 1701 seeks to establish a relief
 
07:50:05.388 --> 07:50:05.398 align:start position:0%
from disabilities program for people
 
07:50:07.430 --> 07:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
whose mental health treatment has ended
 
07:50:09.628 --> 07:50:09.638 align:start position:0%
so they can restore their gun rights
 
07:50:11.150 --> 07:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
while our organization supports that
 
07:50:13.070 --> 07:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
intent we cannot support the process
 
07:50:15.990 --> 07:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
outlined in this bill uh it is flawed
 
07:50:18.628 --> 07:50:18.638 align:start position:0%
and it also does not meet the guidelines
 
07:50:20.430 --> 07:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
by the US Department of Justice Bureau
 
07:50:22.670 --> 07:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and
 
07:50:25.868 --> 07:50:25.878 align:start position:0%
explosives to fully provide
 
07:50:28.270 --> 07:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
Relief by not meeting those standards an
 
07:50:29.788 --> 07:50:29.798 align:start position:0%
individual who seeks and finds relief
 
07:50:32.430 --> 07:50:32.440 align:start position:0%
under the process outlined in this bill
 
07:50:34.628 --> 07:50:34.638 align:start position:0%
may still be unable to restore Firearms
 
07:50:36.788 --> 07:50:36.798 align:start position:0%
rights at the federal level and worse
 
07:50:38.510 --> 07:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
May mistakenly attempt to purchase a
 
07:50:40.750 --> 07:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
firearm thinking they have satisfied the
 
07:50:43.308 --> 07:50:43.318 align:start position:0%
requirements and thus subject themselves
 
07:50:45.990 --> 07:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
to both legal and financial trouble
 
07:50:47.990 --> 07:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
these are not new concerns our
 
07:50:49.628 --> 07:50:49.638 align:start position:0%
organization has testified on versions
 
07:50:52.190 --> 07:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
of this particular Bill since at least
 
07:50:54.468 --> 07:50:54.478 align:start position:0%
2014 and there's a reason why for the
 
07:50:56.350 --> 07:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
last decade this policy has not been
 
07:50:58.350 --> 07:50:58.360 align:start position:0%
passed and conquered regardless of the
 
07:51:00.190 --> 07:51:00.200 align:start position:0%
makeup of the state legislature or the
 
07:51:02.910 --> 07:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
originating chamber instead we support
 
07:51:05.708 --> 07:51:05.718 align:start position:0%
the process outlined in House Bill 1711
 
07:51:07.270 --> 07:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
which meets the federal guidelines and
 
07:51:09.468 --> 07:51:09.478 align:start position:0%
adequately restores Firearms rights for
 
07:51:11.430 --> 07:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
granite Staters whose Mental Health
 
07:51:13.830 --> 07:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
crisis has passed here are just a few of
 
07:51:16.510 --> 07:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
the problems with House Bill 1701 it
 
07:51:17.990 --> 07:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
erodes the quality of the relief from
 
07:51:19.910 --> 07:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
disabilities program for people whose
 
07:51:21.990 --> 07:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment has ended it
 
07:51:23.548 --> 07:51:23.558 align:start position:0%
diminishes the state's ability to
 
07:51:25.190 --> 07:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
determine when a person should get
 
07:51:27.150 --> 07:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
relief and does not provide the court
 
07:51:29.670 --> 07:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
with appropriate evidence to deter to
 
07:51:31.548 --> 07:51:31.558 align:start position:0%
consider when making these
 
07:51:34.628 --> 07:51:34.638 align:start position:0%
determinations section four reads when a
 
07:51:36.750 --> 07:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
petition for enement is timely brought
 
07:51:37.830 --> 07:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
the court shall require the New
 
07:51:39.750 --> 07:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital or secure psychiatric
 
07:51:42.190 --> 07:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
unit to report to the court concerning
 
07:51:44.070 --> 07:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
any other recent commitments of the
 
07:51:46.510 --> 07:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
petitioner and any other information
 
07:51:47.948 --> 07:51:47.958 align:start position:0%
which the court believes May Aid in
 
07:51:50.230 --> 07:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
making a det determination on the
 
07:51:52.430 --> 07:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
petition no documentation is
 
07:51:54.910 --> 07:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
specifically required in statute
 
07:51:56.628 --> 07:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
regarding the initial commitment or
 
07:51:59.308 --> 07:51:59.318 align:start position:0%
treatment including whether it is
 
07:52:01.830 --> 07:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
ongoing complicating things section two
 
07:52:03.548 --> 07:52:03.558 align:start position:0%
states a petition for annulment may be
 
07:52:04.948 --> 07:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
made 5 Years From the date of the
 
07:52:08.430 --> 07:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
commitment order not after it has ended
 
07:52:09.910 --> 07:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
it also does not require that a mental
 
07:52:11.430 --> 07:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
health provider assess the person's
 
07:52:13.788 --> 07:52:13.798 align:start position:0%
mental health and suitability to possess
 
07:52:15.830 --> 07:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
Firearms it does not specifically
 
07:52:17.430 --> 07:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
require consideration of the person's
 
07:52:19.430 --> 07:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
mental health history or the person's
 
07:52:20.948 --> 07:52:20.958 align:start position:0%
reputation as developed through
 
07:52:23.468 --> 07:52:23.478 align:start position:0%
character Witnesses or character
 
07:52:26.548 --> 07:52:26.558 align:start position:0%
evidence House Bill 1701 Section 5
 
07:52:28.750 --> 07:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
further reads the petition shall be
 
07:52:31.190 --> 07:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
granted until upon a showing that there
 
07:52:33.388 --> 07:52:33.398 align:start position:0%
have been no additional commitments
 
07:52:34.830 --> 07:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
since the time of the commitment order
 
07:52:36.990 --> 07:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
that the petitioner seeking to anull
 
07:52:40.590 --> 07:52:40.600 align:start position:0%
I'll emphasize shall or unless the court
 
07:52:42.750 --> 07:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
finds by clearing convincing evidence
 
07:52:43.990 --> 07:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
that such an nment is not in the
 
07:52:46.708 --> 07:52:46.718 align:start position:0%
interest of Justice discussing only
 
07:52:48.468 --> 07:52:48.478 align:start position:0%
additional commit ments gives no regard
 
07:52:51.070 --> 07:52:51.080 align:start position:0%
or conversation around ongoing mental
 
07:52:52.350 --> 07:52:52.360 align:start position:0%
health treatment and
 
07:52:54.150 --> 07:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
suitability what we should be looking
 
07:52:56.230 --> 07:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
for is when someone has an absolute
 
07:52:58.548 --> 07:52:58.558 align:start position:0%
discharge as is the standard established
 
07:53:01.708 --> 07:53:01.718 align:start position:0%
in housef 1711 which you just heard
 
07:53:03.388 --> 07:53:03.398 align:start position:0%
requiring the court to show by clear and
 
07:53:05.388 --> 07:53:05.398 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence which is a higher
 
07:53:07.468 --> 07:53:07.478 align:start position:0%
standard that the enement is not in the
 
07:53:09.990 --> 07:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
interest of Justice puts the B burden on
 
07:53:11.628 --> 07:53:11.638 align:start position:0%
the court without ensuring the proper
 
07:53:14.150 --> 07:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
documentation and expert input to
 
07:53:16.430 --> 07:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
certain that if treatment is ongoing
 
07:53:18.868 --> 07:53:18.878 align:start position:0%
that's one thing but what if it is ended
 
07:53:21.548 --> 07:53:21.558 align:start position:0%
in the absence of information here or it
 
07:53:23.270 --> 07:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
is the absence of information here that
 
07:53:25.868 --> 07:53:25.878 align:start position:0%
is worrisome the court cannot know what
 
07:53:27.510 --> 07:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
it does not know about the suitability
 
07:53:29.788 --> 07:53:29.798 align:start position:0%
of the petitioner which is why adequate
 
07:53:31.830 --> 07:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
policies outline what must be considered
 
07:53:33.948 --> 07:53:33.958 align:start position:0%
in a true relief from disability
 
07:53:37.990 --> 07:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
program this bill would not meet the ATF
 
07:53:40.468 --> 07:53:40.478 align:start position:0%
standards for relief from disability the
 
07:53:44.388 --> 07:53:44.398 align:start position:0%
ATF Form States the state use uh the ATF
 
07:53:46.948 --> 07:53:46.958 align:start position:0%
Form that a state uses to certify that
 
07:53:48.670 --> 07:53:48.680 align:start position:0%
his established a qualifying mental
 
07:53:50.628 --> 07:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
health relief from Firearms disabilities
 
07:53:53.510 --> 07:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
program makes it clear that the
 
07:53:55.670 --> 07:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
disabilities program must satisfy
 
07:53:58.308 --> 07:53:58.318 align:start position:0%
certain minimum criteria I'm happy to
 
07:54:00.150 --> 07:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
forward a copy to the committee of what
 
07:54:03.510 --> 07:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
that form looks like it's two-page form
 
07:54:05.388 --> 07:54:05.398 align:start position:0%
very clearly at the top it says these
 
07:54:08.388 --> 07:54:08.398 align:start position:0%
minimum standards have to be met section
 
07:54:10.388 --> 07:54:10.398 align:start position:0%

07:54:46.548 --> 07:54:46.558 align:start position:0%
which other states with relief from
 
07:54:48.990 --> 07:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
disability programs meet in order to not
 
07:54:51.670 --> 07:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
endanger Public Safety or the safety of
 
07:54:53.910 --> 07:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
the petitioner by inappropriately

granting relief too
 
07:54:57.750 --> 07:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
soon we
 
07:55:00.230 --> 07:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
support having a process and that's why
 
07:55:01.830 --> 07:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
we support the process outline in House
 
07:55:04.670 --> 07:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
Bill 1711 we have supported that process
 
07:55:06.830 --> 07:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
for the last 10 years we're excited that
 
07:55:08.270 --> 07:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
the committee is entertaining A bill
 
07:55:10.670 --> 07:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
that would include that this process
 
07:55:13.510 --> 07:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
before you actually jeopardizes rights
 
07:55:15.430 --> 07:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
restoration and we would encourage the
 
07:55:17.788 --> 07:55:17.798 align:start position:0%
committee to put your energy towards a
 
07:55:19.708 --> 07:55:19.718 align:start position:0%
build that actually provides what you

hi everybody it's uh Steven andris I'm
 
07:56:24.430 --> 07:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
from the maram county attorney's office
 
07:56:26.190 --> 07:56:26.200 align:start position:0%
I'm an assistant County attorney I've
 
07:56:29.030 --> 07:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
been a prosecutor for over 20 years I'm
 
07:56:31.110 --> 07:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
sure you're all happy to hear from me
 
07:56:36.030 --> 07:56:36.040 align:start position:0%
last on a Friday on a noon
 
07:56:40.308 --> 07:56:40.318 align:start position:0%
bill um I I do the involuntary civil
 
07:56:42.468 --> 07:56:42.478 align:start position:0%
commitments for our office under 135c
 
07:56:43.868 --> 07:56:43.878 align:start position:0%
and I also do a lot of
 
07:56:48.150 --> 07:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
Competency um evaluations and litigation
 
07:56:51.670 --> 07:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
I have two real concerns with with the
 
07:56:55.070 --> 07:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
language in this as proposed the first
 
07:56:57.548 --> 07:56:57.558 align:start position:0%
is paragraph two which is line nine
 
07:56:59.030 --> 07:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
where it talks about no petition shall
 
07:57:01.270 --> 07:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
be brought until five years from the
 
07:57:03.308 --> 07:57:03.318 align:start position:0%
date of the commitment order the
 
07:57:04.670 --> 07:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
difficulty with that language is that
 
07:57:06.070 --> 07:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
you can be committed to the state
 
07:57:09.468 --> 07:57:09.478 align:start position:0%
hospital for a period of five years so
 
07:57:10.990 --> 07:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
you can have your
 
07:57:13.510 --> 07:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
hearing spend five years in the state
 
07:57:16.388 --> 07:57:16.398 align:start position:0%
hospital and then get out after five
 
07:57:19.430 --> 07:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
years and the day you exit the state
 
07:57:21.350 --> 07:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
hospital you could then file for an
 
07:57:24.230 --> 07:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
enement because it's 5 years after your
 
07:57:26.548 --> 07:57:26.558 align:start position:0%
commitment um if the state hospital is
 
07:57:29.388 --> 07:57:29.398 align:start position:0%
reporting on any subsequent commitments
 
07:57:30.990 --> 07:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be any subsequent
 
07:57:32.468 --> 07:57:32.478 align:start position:0%
commitments because you literally would
 
07:57:34.830 --> 07:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
have been committed three days
 
07:57:38.030 --> 07:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
earlier um I would suggest to either
 
07:57:40.670 --> 07:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
change that to a much larger time frame
 
07:57:43.230 --> 07:57:43.240 align:start position:0%
after the date of commitment or to
 
07:57:45.350 --> 07:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
change that from five years after the
 
07:57:47.590 --> 07:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
date of perhaps absolute discharge from
 
07:57:49.708 --> 07:57:49.718 align:start position:0%
the designated receiving
 
07:57:52.948 --> 07:57:52.958 align:start position:0%
facility um which would be the date that
 
07:57:54.788 --> 07:57:54.798 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire hospital or whatever
 
07:57:56.510 --> 07:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
the designated receiving facility
 
07:57:59.468 --> 07:57:59.478 align:start position:0%
essentially closes your case the other
 
07:58:03.388 --> 07:58:03.398 align:start position:0%
concern I have is um on the second page
 
07:58:07.190 --> 07:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
those first three lines in paragraph C
 
07:58:10.190 --> 07:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
of subsection six court records and any
 
07:58:11.788 --> 07:58:11.798 align:start position:0%
medical records relating to the en old
 
07:58:14.590 --> 07:58:14.600 align:start position:0%
inv voluntary commitment shall be sealed
 
07:58:16.190 --> 07:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
the concern I have there is I understand
 
07:58:17.468 --> 07:58:17.478 align:start position:0%
that this bill was was essentially
 
07:58:20.548 --> 07:58:20.558 align:start position:0%
copied from the criminal statute and in
 
07:58:22.270 --> 07:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
the criminal statute it makes sense to
 
07:58:25.110 --> 07:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
seal court records because at this point
 
07:58:27.150 --> 07:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
any one of us could walk into you know
 
07:58:28.910 --> 07:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
maramont County Superior Court and say I
 
07:58:31.750 --> 07:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
want to see State versus Jane Doe's file
 
07:58:33.628 --> 07:58:33.638 align:start position:0%
and the clerk's going to hand it to you
 
07:58:35.150 --> 07:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
and you can sit there and thumb through
 
07:58:36.990 --> 07:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
it and look at all those records the
 
07:58:38.388 --> 07:58:38.398 align:start position:0%
same is not true for New Hampshire
 
07:58:40.270 --> 07:58:40.280 align:start position:0%
Hospital medical records are already
 
07:58:42.628 --> 07:58:42.638 align:start position:0%
statutorily protected you can't just
 
07:58:44.110 --> 07:58:44.120 align:start position:0%
walk up to New Hampshire hospital and
 
07:58:46.350 --> 07:58:46.360 align:start position:0%
say I'd like to see Jane Do's file
 
07:58:49.110 --> 07:58:49.120 align:start position:0%
obviously won't give it to you um
 
07:58:52.670 --> 07:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
there's some exceptions to that but even
 
07:58:55.110 --> 07:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
if you are the caregiver that lives with
 
07:58:57.590 --> 07:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
Jane Doe when she's released New
 
07:58:58.910 --> 07:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital isn't going to give
 
07:59:01.788 --> 07:59:01.798 align:start position:0%
you her file without her consent except
 
07:59:03.510 --> 07:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
under certain limited
 
07:59:05.708 --> 07:59:05.718 align:start position:0%
circumstances my concern with sealing
 
07:59:08.628 --> 07:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
the court records as people have alluded
 
07:59:12.150 --> 07:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
to Prior is that we use those records to
 
07:59:14.670 --> 07:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
help determine competency to help
 
07:59:17.510 --> 07:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
determine um sanity if people are
 
07:59:20.190 --> 07:59:20.200 align:start position:0%
raising sanity to help determine
 
07:59:22.670 --> 07:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
dangerousness or mental illness if we're
 
07:59:25.190 --> 07:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
pursuing involuntary civil commitments
 
07:59:27.708 --> 07:59:27.718 align:start position:0%
and I'd hate to have a situation where
 
07:59:29.910 --> 07:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
the office of the forensic examiner or a
 
07:59:32.350 --> 07:59:32.360 align:start position:0%
doctor we hire in order to do um an
 
07:59:34.788 --> 07:59:34.798 align:start position:0%
evaluation says I can't do a full
 
07:59:38.308 --> 07:59:38.318 align:start position:0%
evaluation because there's there's um a
 
07:59:40.430 --> 07:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
gap in medical records because they had
 
07:59:44.468 --> 07:59:44.478 align:start position:0%
been sealed due to an enement um I happy
 
07:59:45.750 --> 07:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
to answer any
 
07:59:45.760 --> 07:59:48.548 align:start position:0%
to answer any
questions

07:59:48.548 --> 07:59:48.558 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:59:50.830 --> 07:59:50.840 align:start position:0%
we saved you for last just for that
 
07:59:58.150 --> 07:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
08:00:00.868 --> 08:00:00.878 align:start position:0%
questions I appreciate
 
08:00:04.190 --> 08:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
that it has it has been a very long day
 
08:00:06.070 --> 08:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh it appears we do not have any
 
08:00:08.708 --> 08:00:08.718 align:start position:0%
questions actually wait don't leave I do
 
08:00:10.510 --> 08:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned I I was looking on
 
08:00:12.190 --> 08:00:12.200 align:start position:0%
page two and I thought you had said line
 
08:00:14.190 --> 08:00:14.200 align:start position:0%
nine but I didn't see anything there
 
08:00:16.350 --> 08:00:16.360 align:start position:0%
about the the days you were talking
 
08:00:20.350 --> 08:00:20.360 align:start position:0%
about yeah so the line nine is the first
 
08:00:24.388 --> 08:00:24.398 align:start position:0%
page paragraph 2 first page line nine it
 
08:00:26.110 --> 08:00:26.120 align:start position:0%
talks about five years from the date of
 
08:00:28.070 --> 08:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
the commitment
 
08:00:31.070 --> 08:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
order page one I'm sorry thank you yeah
 
08:00:33.590 --> 08:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
and then page two is the ceiling of the
 
08:00:36.190 --> 08:00:36.200 align:start position:0%
records that I don't like and how long
 
08:00:37.948 --> 08:00:37.958 align:start position:0%
did you say so it where it says until
 
08:00:39.230 --> 08:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
five years from the date what was your
 
08:00:42.150 --> 08:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation I would I mean for me I
 
08:00:44.468 --> 08:00:44.478 align:start position:0%
would probably either do that 10 years
 
08:00:47.590 --> 08:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
from the date of the commitment order or
 
08:00:50.510 --> 08:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
change it to 5 Years From the date of
 
08:00:53.590 --> 08:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
absolute discharge from the designated
 
08:00:55.548 --> 08:00:55.558 align:start position:0%
receiving facility which is where they'd
 
08:00:58.628 --> 08:00:58.638 align:start position:0%
be committed to okay and I mean if
 
08:01:01.708 --> 08:01:01.718 align:start position:0%
you're also interested in Crossing Out
 
08:01:04.548 --> 08:01:04.558 align:start position:0%
Lines six and 7 it talks about
 
08:01:07.350 --> 08:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
proceedings initiated pursuant to 13517
 
08:01:10.270 --> 08:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
a there are no proceedings initiated
 
08:01:15.030 --> 08:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
pursuant to 135 17A 1351 17A refers back
 
08:01:19.990 --> 08:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
to 135c so it's impossible to actually
 
08:01:23.628 --> 08:01:23.638 align:start position:0%
commit a person under 13517
 
08:01:26.230 --> 08:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
a thank you very much that was
 
08:01:28.468 --> 08:01:28.478 align:start position:0%

08:01:40.270 --> 08:01:40.280 align:start position:0%

amendments that we're going to pass out

I did not pass these out earlier just
 
08:12:13.990 --> 08:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
because there were so many papers being
 
08:12:15.430 --> 08:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
flying around I didn't want them to get
 
08:12:18.150 --> 08:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
lost in the shuffle
 
08:12:22.388 --> 08:12:22.398 align:start position:0%
um the first one is an amendment for the
 
08:12:25.708 --> 08:12:25.718 align:start position:0%

08:12:27.190 --> 08:12:27.200 align:start position:0%

08:12:30.350 --> 08:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
there and the other amendment is for the
 
08:12:32.788 --> 08:12:32.798 align:start position:0%

08:12:33.910 --> 08:12:33.920 align:start position:0%

of consequences we uh found that in the

subcommittee this is would be very
 
08:15:31.910 --> 08:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
incendiary causing um potential violence
 
08:15:34.468 --> 08:15:34.478 align:start position:0%
and flare up of um the people being
 
08:15:37.468 --> 08:15:37.478 align:start position:0%

Amendment what am I
 
08:19:34.120 --> 08:19:38.388 align:start position:0%
Amendment what am I
2024

08:19:38.388 --> 08:19:38.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:19:41.030 --> 08:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
d419 and I will just speak to my
 
08:19:44.308 --> 08:19:44.318 align:start position:0%
Amendment briefly if you all remember we
 
08:19:45.590 --> 08:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
held the
 
08:19:47.788 --> 08:19:47.798 align:start position:0%
the hearing on this bill and it was uh
 
08:19:50.190 --> 08:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
the invasions of privacy if the person
 
08:19:52.350 --> 08:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
was a minor that the Privacy had been
 
08:19:54.308 --> 08:19:54.318 align:start position:0%
invaded and one of the things that I
 
08:19:56.270 --> 08:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
would like to to correct a little bit
 
08:19:58.030 --> 08:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
was representative Muse had asked me a
 
08:20:00.590 --> 08:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
question when I was presenting the bill
 
08:20:02.910 --> 08:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
and he had asked if this essentially was
 
08:20:05.270 --> 08:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
an increased penalty and I answered yes
 
08:20:08.590 --> 08:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
because it is however what I didn't
 
08:20:11.510 --> 08:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
stress enough with that was the way the
 
08:20:14.150 --> 08:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
bill was written at the time did not
 
08:20:16.910 --> 08:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
offer any kind
 
08:20:19.868 --> 08:20:19.878 align:start position:0%
of any kind of I should say wrong and
 
08:20:20.990 --> 08:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
that's not really the right word right
 
08:20:22.948 --> 08:20:22.958 align:start position:0%
now if the person that was being invaded
 
08:20:26.910 --> 08:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
was a child and the bill originally was
 
08:20:29.868 --> 08:20:29.878 align:start position:0%
looking to make that be you know a
 
08:20:33.070 --> 08:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
little bit more egregious so yes it does
 
08:20:34.948 --> 08:20:34.958 align:start position:0%
offer an increased penalty however
 
08:20:36.388 --> 08:20:36.398 align:start position:0%
children were not recognized in the
 
08:20:38.868 --> 08:20:38.878 align:start position:0%
first place so now they're going to be
 
08:20:40.628 --> 08:20:40.638 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we're
 
08:20:43.388 --> 08:20:43.398 align:start position:0%
offering will essentially if it is a
 
08:20:45.590 --> 08:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
repeat offender
 
08:20:48.190 --> 08:20:48.200 align:start position:0%
if it's a child so initially it will be
 
08:20:51.830 --> 08:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
a a f a class B felony but if it is a
 
08:20:54.788 --> 08:20:54.798 align:start position:0%
repeat offender for the invasion of
 
08:20:57.910 --> 08:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
privacy for a minor it will be a class a
 
08:21:00.270 --> 08:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
felony which is basically the the
 
08:21:02.948 --> 08:21:02.958 align:start position:0%
questions that we had uh during the the
 
08:21:05.070 --> 08:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
hearing additionally I just wanted to
 
08:21:07.830 --> 08:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
mention there were some questions around
 
08:21:10.590 --> 08:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
the sex offender list that had been
 
08:21:13.308 --> 08:21:13.318 align:start position:0%
discussed I actually did go through with
 
08:21:15.430 --> 08:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
an amendment for that as well
 
08:21:17.910 --> 08:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
and upon further consideration we
 
08:21:19.788 --> 08:21:19.798 align:start position:0%
realized it really just was not the bill
 
08:21:21.228 --> 08:21:21.238 align:start position:0%
to put it on and we thought that that
 
08:21:22.628 --> 08:21:22.638 align:start position:0%
would do better to just be a whole
 
08:21:25.350 --> 08:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
separate bill alog together and we will
 
08:21:27.150 --> 08:21:27.160 align:start position:0%
explore that at a later time but not
 
08:21:29.468 --> 08:21:29.478 align:start position:0%
with this particular bill um with that I
 
08:21:31.350 --> 08:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
would ask or take any questions if
 
08:21:32.548 --> 08:21:32.558 align:start position:0%
there's any on
 
08:21:35.708 --> 08:21:35.718 align:start position:0%
that representative selig may I second
 
08:21:35.718 --> 08:21:38.070 align:start position:0%
that representative selig may I second
your

08:21:38.070 --> 08:21:38.080 align:start position:0%

yes thanks for bearing with me all okay
 
08:25:05.110 --> 08:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
we we got this so um while I believe
 
08:25:06.948 --> 08:25:06.958 align:start position:0%
there was a point of order and I I
 
08:25:08.628 --> 08:25:08.638 align:start position:0%
should have I should have addressed that
 
08:25:09.670 --> 08:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
right away but we were in the middle of
 
08:25:10.830 --> 08:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
another bill and I didn't want to get
 
08:25:13.388 --> 08:25:13.398 align:start position:0%
confused so representative uh brought up
 
08:25:15.510 --> 08:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
that she thinks the count was was off on
 
08:25:17.430 --> 08:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
our first bill which was
 
08:25:20.070 --> 08:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
1025 and the clerk will just let us know
 
08:25:23.468 --> 08:25:23.478 align:start position:0%
where we're at with that you are correct
 
08:25:28.990 --> 08:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
so the vote for House Bill 1025 is 18 to
 
08:25:33.510 --> 08:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
zero and we are 180 on the amendment for
 
08:25:36.430 --> 08:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
1260 and 18 to Z
 
08:25:41.150 --> 08:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
on on ought to pass as
 
08:25:41.160 --> 08:25:43.388 align:start position:0%

08:27:04.670 --> 08:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
anybody have any any comments
 
08:27:07.750 --> 08:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
on representative Willer thank you madam
 
08:27:09.548 --> 08:27:09.558 align:start position:0%
chair I I would just like to Echo what
 
08:27:11.308 --> 08:27:11.318 align:start position:0%
representative Stone said and say that
 
08:27:12.910 --> 08:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
if the sponsor is going to bring forward
 
08:27:15.510 --> 08:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
a bill and be off offered the exact
 
08:27:17.270 --> 08:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
language for the amendment that he needs
 
08:27:19.190 --> 08:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
to fix it I think it'd be prudent for
 
08:27:21.430 --> 08:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
that sponsor to address that and change
 
08:27:23.350 --> 08:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
it and otherwise we're going to have to
 
08:27:25.990 --> 08:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
itl it and that's what we'll do thank
 
08:27:26.990 --> 08:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
you representative wheeler
 
08:27:29.030 --> 08:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative scitec we could have
 
08:27:33.228 --> 08:27:33.238 align:start position:0%
 
08:27:35.388 --> 08:27:35.398 align:start position:0%
too he said we could have interim
 
08:27:36.830 --> 08:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
studied it as
 
08:27:40.150 --> 08:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
well I would just like to say that
 
08:27:43.670 --> 08:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
during the the testimony I was a little
 
08:27:45.070 --> 08:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
bit concerned
 
08:27:46.308 --> 08:27:46.318 align:start position:0%
to think
 
08:27:48.948 --> 08:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
that there's possibly something that is
 
08:27:50.190 --> 08:27:50.200 align:start position:0%
sitting there that would prove
 
08:27:53.830 --> 08:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
somebody's innocence or guilt and that
 
08:27:57.830 --> 08:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
it may be done away with um for various
 
08:27:59.430 --> 08:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
of reasons and I actually would like to
 
08:28:01.590 --> 08:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
have seen an amendment as well and one
 
08:28:04.150 --> 08:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
of the things that I really would like
 
08:28:05.990 --> 08:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
the members of our entire body to
 
08:28:07.868 --> 08:28:07.878 align:start position:0%
understand is just with a lot of other
 
08:28:10.708 --> 08:28:10.718 align:start position:0%
committees we hear a lot of bills and we
 
08:28:13.110 --> 08:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
do our best to give every single one to
 
08:28:15.510 --> 08:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
doe process and and and do everything we
 
08:28:19.670 --> 08:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
can to either kill it or to pass it and
 
08:28:20.910 --> 08:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
you know really just isn't something
 
08:28:22.228 --> 08:28:22.238 align:start position:0%
that we're able to take on to amend
 
08:28:23.510 --> 08:28:23.520 align:start position:0%

08:28:26.788 --> 08:28:26.798 align:start position:0%

amendment um if I may briefly I'll just
 
08:30:42.590 --> 08:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
speak to the
 
08:30:45.350 --> 08:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
amendment again during the the public
 
08:30:48.350 --> 08:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
hearing it seemed like that we had um
 
08:30:49.708 --> 08:30:49.718 align:start position:0%
pretty much support from the committee
 
08:30:51.548 --> 08:30:51.558 align:start position:0%
on the bill uh basically what we're
 
08:30:53.308 --> 08:30:53.318 align:start position:0%
trying to say is that the covered
 
08:30:55.228 --> 08:30:55.238 align:start position:0%
bridges are pretty much his historical
 
08:30:59.030 --> 08:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
markers they are used for um great
 
08:30:59.040 --> 08:31:00.270 align:start position:0%
markers they are used for um great
tourist

08:31:00.270 --> 08:31:00.280 align:start position:0%
tourist
 
08:31:02.510 --> 08:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
attractions so so many things all the
 
08:31:03.788 --> 08:31:03.798 align:start position:0%
way around when these bridges are
 
08:31:06.468 --> 08:31:06.478 align:start position:0%
destroyed or damaged if there's any kind
 
08:31:08.110 --> 08:31:08.120 align:start position:0%
of recklessness involved there's a great
 
08:31:10.030 --> 08:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
amount of Commerce that is lost to the
 
08:31:12.590 --> 08:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
town and there is nothing that the that
 
08:31:14.350 --> 08:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
the town can do to even try to recoup
 
08:31:17.070 --> 08:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
any of the the Lost damages there uh
 
08:31:18.788 --> 08:31:18.798 align:start position:0%
what this amendment will do that
 
08:31:21.388 --> 08:31:21.398 align:start position:0%
representative Jan had brought up was
 
08:31:24.110 --> 08:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
actually just put a sign in front of the
 
08:31:27.430 --> 08:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
bridge within 100 ft to let the
 
08:31:29.628 --> 08:31:29.638 align:start position:0%
pedestrians or I'm sorry to let the um
 
08:31:31.548 --> 08:31:31.558 align:start position:0%
the drivers know that that they very
 
08:31:34.868 --> 08:31:34.878 align:start position:0%
well could be being recorded um the one
 
08:31:36.430 --> 08:31:36.440 align:start position:0%
thing I would like to address as far as
 
08:31:39.750 --> 08:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
privacy I know that that comes up a lot
 
08:31:41.430 --> 08:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
as far as a public
 
08:31:43.548 --> 08:31:43.558 align:start position:0%
road I really can't think of anything
 
08:31:45.590 --> 08:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
that's more public than a than a public
 
08:31:48.948 --> 08:31:48.958 align:start position:0%
Highway um and the other thing that this
 
08:31:52.430 --> 08:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
amendment does is because so many so
 
08:31:54.910 --> 08:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
many of the roads are actually
 
08:31:56.948 --> 08:31:56.958 align:start position:0%
state-owned leading to these covered
 
08:31:59.910 --> 08:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
bridges this is actually going to put
 
08:32:02.510 --> 08:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
that cost onto the state and they will
 
08:32:05.548 --> 08:32:05.558 align:start position:0%
have to be the ones to put up the
 
08:32:07.708 --> 08:32:07.718 align:start position:0%
sign representative jener would you like
 
08:32:11.030 --> 08:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
to speak to that yes as a young man I I
 
08:32:12.430 --> 08:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
served in the New Hampshire Conservation
 
08:32:15.030 --> 08:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
Corps in Cornish New Hampshire and uh
 
08:32:17.110 --> 08:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
Cornish is known for as Cornish Windsor
 
08:32:19.510 --> 08:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
bridge and I remember that particular
 
08:32:22.110 --> 08:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
summer it was struck by a truck they
 
08:32:23.750 --> 08:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
never found out who it was it took them
 
08:32:25.590 --> 08:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
seven years to raise the funding to fix
 
08:32:28.190 --> 08:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
it and there was an argument is Vermont
 
08:32:30.388 --> 08:32:30.398 align:start position:0%
responsible or is New Hampshire So to
 
08:32:32.308 --> 08:32:32.318 align:start position:0%
avoid that I think that it's it's good
 
08:32:35.708 --> 08:32:35.718 align:start position:0%
to have this bill um but the the
 
08:32:37.510 --> 08:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
amendment the reason for the amendment
 
08:32:40.190 --> 08:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
is I was here when this the house the
 
08:32:43.070 --> 08:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
Senate and the the people of the state
 
08:32:45.430 --> 08:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
passed Amendment to be which is the
 
08:32:47.628 --> 08:32:47.638 align:start position:0%
right of privacy and if you're going to
 
08:32:49.190 --> 08:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
a business here in New Hampshire and
 
08:32:51.110 --> 08:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
you're under video surveillance they
 
08:32:53.070 --> 08:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
have to give you notice so I think that
 
08:32:55.110 --> 08:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
this amendment accomplishes giving
 
08:32:58.190 --> 08:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
notice and somebody asked me about the
 
08:33:00.350 --> 08:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
100 foot why would why would you say 100
 
08:33:02.388 --> 08:33:02.398 align:start position:0%
feet here's why if I want to go and take
 
08:33:04.070 --> 08:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
a picture of a historic bridge I don't
 
08:33:06.190 --> 08:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
want a picture of that sign 100 feet
 
08:33:08.030 --> 08:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
away gives me room to get that picture
 
08:33:10.110 --> 08:33:10.120 align:start position:0%
without getting the sign in it so that I
 
08:33:12.750 --> 08:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
I fully support the
 
08:33:15.190 --> 08:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
amendment that was actually a great
 
08:33:17.590 --> 08:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
definition I'm glad that you that you
 
08:33:18.868 --> 08:33:18.878 align:start position:0%
gave us all that Insight I didn't even
 
08:33:21.030 --> 08:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
think of that uh does anybody else would
 
08:33:22.910 --> 08:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
any of else like to
 
08:33:25.308 --> 08:33:25.318 align:start position:0%
speak representative
 
08:33:27.350 --> 08:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
wheeler do you have something you'd like
 
08:33:31.270 --> 08:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
08:33:33.070 --> 08:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
class Madam
 
08:33:37.270 --> 08:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
chair that is not ask mad chair but I do
 
08:33:38.948 --> 08:33:38.958 align:start position:0%
I mean if you're going to put me on the
 
08:33:40.388 --> 08:33:40.398 align:start position:0%
hot seat I do just want to say that
 
08:33:42.510 --> 08:33:42.520 align:start position:0%
these bridges are such an important
 
08:33:44.708 --> 08:33:44.718 align:start position:0%
piece to New England's hist hist and
 
08:33:46.150 --> 08:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
when people think of New England they
 
08:33:47.830 --> 08:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
think of these hidden Bridges these
 
08:33:49.708 --> 08:33:49.718 align:start position:0%
covered bridges that picture of you know
 
08:33:52.628 --> 08:33:52.638 align:start position:0%
the orange leaves with the nice bridge
 
08:33:55.430 --> 08:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
over it and the idea that people would
 
08:33:57.150 --> 08:33:57.160 align:start position:0%
posit that they have the Privacy to
 
08:33:59.510 --> 08:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
vandalize these Bridges is absurd so I
 
08:34:01.830 --> 08:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
like what you said uh the priv no one
