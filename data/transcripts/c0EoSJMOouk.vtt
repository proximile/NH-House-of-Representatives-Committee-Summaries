senator waters bill on a different
 
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
subject it was re-referred and the
 
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
committee ultimately decided not to go

forward with it
 
00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
however chairman gray
 
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
decided to take the opportunity to use
 
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
this as a vehicle for some technical
 
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.070 align:start position:0%

to the department of revenue
 
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
administration the bill is amended would
 
00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 align:start position:0%
now clarify certain exemptions from rsa
 
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
21j 14 4
 
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
the confidentiality of department

municipal services and regulatory
 
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
responsibilities this would not only
 
00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
clarify existing law but increase
 
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
transparency for the public
 
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
is necessary considering the
 
00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:05.510 align:start position:0%
is necessary considering the
we've

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
we've
 
00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 align:start position:0%
recommended moving the department of the
 
00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
assessing board out of the dra is this
 
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 align:start position:0%

yes thank you so i'm not sure how this
 
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
would play with the other bill
 
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
but i would assume we would if if you
 
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
move the dra the senate would recommend
 
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
this change moving along with it thank

in support of senate bill 53
 
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
the asb was charged in 2001 to set the
 
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
requirements for certification and
 
00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:21.759 align:start position:0%
decertification of assessors in their
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
duties of making appraisals of a
 
00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:25.270 align:start position:0%
duties of making appraisals of a
municipality

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
for tax purposes which is rsa 21j14f
 
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
these certifications and
 
00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
decertifications were never intended to
 
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
be confidential or unavailable to the
 
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
public or the municipalities
 
00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:44.879 align:start position:0%
if a complaint was found to be incorrect
 
00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:45.670 align:start position:0%
if a complaint was found to be incorrect
and

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
then it would have been dismissed by it
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
would be dismissed by dra
 
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is a result of a situation
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
where the certification records of a dra
 
00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
employee were requested and that request
 
00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:03.919 align:start position:0%
was denied based on rsa 21j14
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
which as grant has said is the
 
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
department's authority for confidential
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of department records
 
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
the change in senate bill 353
 
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
will add the regulated responsibilities
 
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
of recessors i.e the certification and
 
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
decertification records to the
 
00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:25.639 align:start position:0%
exemptions to the department's
 
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
confidentiality statute
 
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
again i would like to emphasize that all
 
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:32.360 align:start position:0%
the records of certification and
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
decertification were never intended by
 
00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
the asb to be kept confidential
 
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
all assessors need to be accountable to
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers and municipalities they
 
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
non-germain amendment the sponsors on
 
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
never change no matter what you do to
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
and so i from i got the impression that
 
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
this was a bill that they killed
 
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you miss patton is there anyone
 
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
else who wishes to testify on senate
 
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'm going to close the
 
00:11:24.079 --> 00:11:30.389 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'm going to close the
hearing

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt do you have a
 
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.949 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt do you have a
motion

00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
if we're going into executive session
 
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
madam chair i would absolutely take the
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
recommend how senate bill 53 ought to
 
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.110 align:start position:0%
recommend how senate bill 53 ought to
pass

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
schmidt and i think rhodes was first
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your motion
 
00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.269 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your motion
uh

00:11:59.269 --> 00:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
just to emphasize the point that uh
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
chairman patton uh did uh
 
00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
inform us about and that is
 
00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:08.389 align:start position:0%
inform us about and that is
that

00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
senate bill uh 155
 
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 1552 that this committee
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
heard uh
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
was heard
 
00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
was and during the course of that
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
bill it was referenced that the
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
assessing standards board as i say on
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
which i serve and have for
 
00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:29.839 align:start position:0%
about the past 16 years
 
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that bill was brought
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons that senator gray
 
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
has brought this bill
 
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
is because it was never the intention of
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
the assessing standards board or the uh
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
the assessor community that the
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
certification and decertification
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
information was going to be
 
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
withheld from the public it was always
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
the intention that that record
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
those records should be
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
open to the public
 
00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.670 align:start position:0%
open to the public
and

00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
in the fact that
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
that the dra overseas
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
under current arrangements oversees the
 
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
the assessor community winds up because
 
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
they are a very confidential
 
00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:14.550 align:start position:0%
they are a very confidential
entity

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
entity
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
and have a requirement to
 
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
maintain confidentiality of their
 
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
records they are doing the same thing to
 
00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.949 align:start position:0%
records they are doing the same thing to
assessors

00:13:22.949 --> 00:13:22.959 align:start position:0%
assessors
 
00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:25.839 align:start position:0%
uh and assessing officials
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
records namely withholding them from the
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
public and this the purpose of this bill
 
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
is to undo that and make that
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
information available to the public
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
so i i fully endorse the uh the bill and
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
hope that all of you will support it as
 
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
well thank you thank you brookson of
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
rhodes do you wish to speak to a second
 
00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
no thank you madam chair representative
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
schmidt covered it okay is there any
 
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
the the only concern i have is
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
in passing this
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
we took a stance on moving the
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
assassin's standards board into oplc
 
00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
for the reason of transparency
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
and if we pass this today
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
my concern is it gives the senate a
 
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
reason to vote down a position that we
 
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
have taken moving them to oplc
 
00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
because we've taken care of the
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
confidentiality portion of it
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
that's the only concern i see about
 
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
doing this right now and moving it along
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
okay that's a reasonable point to make
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
representative lackas
 
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
thank you i understand that concern i
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
think there was another reason which was
 
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
a concern about the appearance of a
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
conflict so
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
it's not the only reason but
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
you're right it could be an issue
 
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:45.670 align:start position:0%
you're right it could be an issue
yeah

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
release from their confidentiality rules
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
not only
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
actions going forward but actions in the
 
00:14:59.519 --> 00:15:01.030 align:start position:0%
actions going forward but actions in the
past

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:02.959 align:start position:0%
which and i think that we would want to
 
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
have those open to the public regardless
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
of where the board is is located
 
00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:11.839 align:start position:0%
but uh yeah i see your point
 
00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:14.870 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
um

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
i i think uh that
 
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
the point is very germane but the one
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
1552 is not just about the availability
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
of the records
 
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
the question is whether the assessment
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
the certification process certification
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
and decertification process
 
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
will be under the authority and the
 
00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
oversight of the dra
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
the dra will continue to monitor and and
 
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
and serve as a
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
oversight board with regard to the
 
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.389 align:start position:0%
oversight board with regard to the
totality

00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
totality
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
of assessment
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
the thing that 1552 does it takes the
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
certification and decertification
 
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
process and the records
 
00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
that this bill
 
00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
speaks to
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
it takes the decertification and
 
00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
certification process
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
away from the dra because that
 
00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
that confidentiality aspect is something
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
that the assessing standard board and
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
the assessor community
 
00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
never intended and do not wish to have
 
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
the the totality of the thing still
 
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
stays under dra it's the decertification
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
and certification process
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
that will be removed by 1552 so even
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
though representative goalie's point is
 
00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:33.910 align:start position:0%
though representative goalie's point is
germaine

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
germaine
 
00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:38.020 align:start position:0%
because it does not address the totality
 
00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:39.269 align:start position:0%
because it does not address the totality
[Music]

00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't it only does the
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
records this is just about the
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
availability to the public of the
 
00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:47.829 align:start position:0%
availability to the public of the
assessor

00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
assessor
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
records of
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
their certification and decertification
 
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
that's why it's more specific and this
 
00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079 align:start position:0%
bill is still needed
 
00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
um so it's a there's it's a point to be
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
raised but the argument against it is
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
that this this is only the record part
 
00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
the senate has heard house bill 1552 but
 
00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
they have not yet voted on it i know
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
they're considering an amendment
 
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.549 align:start position:0%
they're considering an amendment
so

00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
what's the feeling of the committee do
 
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
you wish to proceed with this or should
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
we wait until the senate has moved on
 
00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:32.710 align:start position:0%
we wait until the senate has moved on
1552

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
yeah remember sign up goalie
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
i guess the one point i will make is if
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
they do amend it it will have to come
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
back to us for approval and if it's not
 
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
to our liking we can
 
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.549 align:start position:0%
move forward
okay

00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
good point
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
all right in that case we'll we'll
 
00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.549 align:start position:0%
all right in that case we'll we'll

proceed
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on
 
00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:58.160 align:start position:0%

back with edna
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
and for the record i'm senator tom
 
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
sherman district 24 representing 11
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
towns on the
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
seacoast of new hampshire
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
and sb 220 came out of a series of
 
00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.950 align:start position:0%
and sb 220 came out of a series of
discussions

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh with people in the field of
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
psychology psychotherapy psychiatry
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
and also the director of oplc
 
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
lindsey courtney who can't be here today
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
but i think she has someone who is
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
coming to testify at least that's what i
 
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
was told
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
sb 220
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
reflects the concern
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
that one of the speed bumps to workforce
 
00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
development in the state of new
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire is
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
that the licensing boards there are
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
multiple that deal with
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
licensing and they
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
can represent a significant speed bump
 
00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.349 align:start position:0%
can represent a significant speed bump
just

00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
one example is that
 
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
if you if your license lapses
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
because you didn't receive notice or
 
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
there's a problem you have to start the
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
whole process over again
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
in one of the boards
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
another board
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
requires that if you've been in practice
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
for 35 years in massachusetts
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
and you come to new hampshire
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
they want a letter from the person who
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
trained you and that person may well be
 
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:02.790 align:start position:0%
trained you and that person may well be
dead

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
dead
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
so that's problematic
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
so these are the kind of issues um oh
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
and one other point is that
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
other boards function really well
 
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
like in psychiatry it's the board of
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
medicine which is similar to the board
 
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
of nursing they move along fairly
 
00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
quickly the turnaround time is
 
00:37:23.359 --> 00:37:24.630 align:start position:0%
quickly the turnaround time is
reasonable

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
having been through the board of
 
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
medicine myself
 
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:28.370 align:start position:0%
medicine myself
and

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.230 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
you can have a reasonable expectation of
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
adjudication of your licensure
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
application whereas some of the others
 
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
it really seems to represent more of a
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
hurdle rather than something to just to
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
so we are all aware of the critical
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
shortage of licensed mental health
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
professionals in the state
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
this pressure has only been exacerbated
 
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
by covid
 
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh they're in in the medical profession
 
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a 20 retirement rate
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
over the next two years nationally
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
so these challenges are not going to get
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
better and we want to make sure the
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
process of licensure isn't one of the
 
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
impediments to having a
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
so the bill creates a study committee to
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
look at ways to address these issues
 
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
by number one reviewing the licensure
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
criteria for mental health professionals
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
regulated by the board of licensing for
 
00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
alcohol and other drug use counselors
 
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
the board of medicine board of mental
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
health practice board of nursing board
 
00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
of psychologists
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
including how such criteria relates to
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
requirements in neighboring states
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
reviewing the licensure processes of the
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
office of the oplc as it relates to
 
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
mental health professionals including
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
how the statutory and regulatory
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
framework may impact
 
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
timely and efficient licensure of
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
qualified applicants
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
identifying and making recommendations
 
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
for joining available licensure compacts
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
regarding mental health professionals
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
which both decreases the cost
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
to the applicant as well as the
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
cost to
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
the process of licensing
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
exploring licensure barriers to
 
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
attracting qualified mental health
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
professionals to new hampshire
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
and making recommendations if necessary
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
for changes to the licensure regarding
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
the board of licensing for alcohol and
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
other drug use counselors and all the
 
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
other boards that i've already listed
 
00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.230 align:start position:0%
other boards that i've already listed
um

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
i worked with oplc very closely on
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
crafting the
 
00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
language of the bill
 
00:39:56.069 --> 00:39:56.079 align:start position:0%
and if there are specific oplc questions
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully they will be here to answer
 
00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.109 align:start position:0%
hopefully they will be here to answer
those

00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
but i would also refer you to the
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
committee report from the senate
 
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
since this did not change
 
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
uh from as introduced
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm happy to take any questions
 
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative scientech
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
senator sherman you talked
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
he talked very fast so let me make i'm
 
00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.150 align:start position:0%
he talked very fast so let me make i'm
sorry

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
but i'm very slow of hearing
 
00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.829 align:start position:0%
but i'm very slow of hearing
um

00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
this is administrative in intent is it
 
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
not you're not going to water down any
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
of the uh
 
00:40:38.309 --> 00:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely so
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
the goal is to keep
 
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
the high level of
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
quality of providers in the state but
 
00:40:46.079 --> 00:40:47.589 align:start position:0%
quality of providers in the state but
not

00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
but right now some of the
 
00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:51.510 align:start position:0%
but right now some of the
boards

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
appear to have processes that may
 
00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.069 align:start position:0%
appear to have processes that may
block

00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
block
 
00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
qualified individuals from coming to new
 
00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:01.829 align:start position:0%
qualified individuals from coming to new
hampshire

00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.839 --> 00:41:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
we have heard heard that before
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
senator representatives thank you
 
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
um i'm just wondering about terminology
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
i i hear on the radio like
 
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
ads for you can get a therapist to help
 
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:20.950 align:start position:0%
ads for you can get a therapist to help
you

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
using telemedicine
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
and there are these this company says
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
that they have 17 000 of them available
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
are therapists the same as counselors or
 
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
would they be covered by this
 
00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:35.839 align:start position:0%
well i think the consumer has to be very
 
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
careful um or patients need to be very
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
careful to make sure they check the
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
credentials of the person
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
with whom they are
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
being counseled
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
there are all sorts of different degrees
 
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
that qualify you there's bachelor's
 
00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.750 align:start position:0%
that qualify you there's bachelor's
masters

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
masters
 
00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
there's a masters of public health in
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
counseling there's a counseling a
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
master's in counseling which my mom had
 
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
and she did counseling most of her
 
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
second part of her career
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
so all of these qualify you for some
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
level of licensure
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
and then there are others
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
who may provide pastoral counseling so
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
it might be somebody and
 
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that's licensed through any
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
of these boards but that's also the
 
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
board of mental health practice is it
 
00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:29.839 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
so there are
 
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
lots of different degrees and
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
qualifications and i'm glad to hear that
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
from the chair because
 
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
all of the you know competency is really
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
important because
 
00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
you can do more harm than good if you
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
but it's the intent that you're going to
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair and honorable
 
00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
committee members uh
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
director courtney had a scheduling
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
conflict this morning so i am here
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
i did drop off a letter
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
expressing oplc support
 
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to rehash everything
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
senator sherman just said but
 
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
we agree that you know this is really an
 
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
attempt to remove barriers
 
00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
to address the workforce shortages and
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
director courtney did spell out and
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
provide you with some percentages of
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
increase in licensure that happened
 
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
in the letter here
 
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
you know oplc does agree that these
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
changes need to be made
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
however it's not clear exactly what
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
changes need to be made and we do
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
believe a study committee
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
would help
 
00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
address that
 
00:43:59.910 --> 00:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
you know we are looking to other states
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
you know we're always looking for ways
 
00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.109 align:start position:0%
you know we're always looking for ways
to

00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
increase the ability portability and so
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
forth without reducing the quality and i
 
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
think that's important so
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
i'll try to answer any questions if not
 
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
i can i can bring them back to director
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
courtney um
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
and she can respond back to you
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
all right thank you are there any
 
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative schmidt
 
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am sure i'm wondering
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
because uh the this issue is the
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
colloquy up to this point has shown uh
 
00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:33.589 align:start position:0%
colloquy up to this point has shown uh
has

00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
been something that this committee has
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
been working with for a long time
 
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
these issues and sometimes kind of some
 
00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:42.790 align:start position:0%
these issues and sometimes kind of some
nastiness

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
nastiness
 
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
among some of the professions especially
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
psychologists at one time we're a member
 
00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
of the board of health
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
mental health practice now they have
 
00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
their own board
 
00:44:53.119 --> 00:44:53.910 align:start position:0%
their own board
so

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
one of the questions i have is of the
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
chair do we have time to have this go to
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee for any dialogue at all
 
00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.230 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee for any dialogue at all
or

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt are all our
 
00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
senate bills have to be voted out of
 
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
that's what what i thought the
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
implication of that deadline was
 
00:45:15.839 --> 00:45:17.109 align:start position:0%
implication of that deadline was
so

00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:19.109 --> 00:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
of course it is a study committee and so

i represent the national association of

as well as the new hampshire

psychological association
 
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
i don't have a tremendous amount to add
 
00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
so i'll be brief i'd be happy to answer
 
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
any questions i do want to point out
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
that social workers are part of the
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
board of mental health practice
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
psychologists do in fact have their own
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
board i want to make the make sure the
 
00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:18.470 align:start position:0%
board i want to make the make sure the
committee

00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
recalls that psychologists have their
 
00:46:21.119 --> 00:46:21.910 align:start position:0%
recalls that psychologists have their
own

00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:46:25.109 --> 00:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
national interstate compact cypact
 
00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
that has been it's been it's expanding i
 
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
believe it's up over uh 26
 
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
closer to 30 states now either are part
 
00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
of sci pact or actively legislating to
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
become part of scipect uh that helps
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
with the portability we're just hearing
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
about in terms of licensure
 
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
mental health counselors who i do not
 
00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:50.079 align:start position:0%
represent but they have a bill that just
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
went through this committee looking for
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
a compact for mental health counselors
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
and social workers would be looking for
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
a similar compact bill all intended to
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
assist with the portability of licensure
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
from state to state
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
with that if there are questions i'd be
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of the in terms of the
 
00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.150 align:start position:0%
in terms of the in terms of the
committee

00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
we will monitor the committee and
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
participate in any way that we can
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079 align:start position:0%
uh committees in a second year are often
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
difficult they're difficult to to staff
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
they're difficult to meet
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
but i think the
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
content of the
 
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
of the bill is very important to
 
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
understand the workforce shortage to
 
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
understand and there and i will point
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
out there are a significant number of
 
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
issues many of which belong in commerce
 
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
not even in edna the issues about parity
 
00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:49.839 align:start position:0%
the issues about compensation of parity
 
00:47:49.839 --> 00:47:50.950 align:start position:0%
the issues about compensation of parity
uh

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
so it may be that there's a need for
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
this committee and commerce to work more
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
closely on this broader issue to try to
 
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
really understand the
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
the issues that are getting in the way
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
of folks having access to needed mental
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
health care
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
and i realize that's not really an
 
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
answer i apologize yes thank you we
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
notice that too
 
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i'm just wondering if you
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
have any thoughts on whether the
 
00:48:21.359 --> 00:48:23.190 align:start position:0%
have any thoughts on whether the
shortage

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
shortage
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
of workers
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
in this area
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
might have anything to do with
 
00:48:32.829 --> 00:48:32.839 align:start position:0%
educational programs for them not
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
being that available
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question
 
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
advanced training for mental health
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
practitioners is widely available i
 
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
actually teach at the university of new
 
00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:45.670 align:start position:0%
actually teach at the university of new
hampshire

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
we have an online program we have an
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
executive program for the msw that
 
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
operates in manchester and we have a
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
face-to-face cohort in durham we
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
graduate nearly 200
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
new msws every year
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
um southern um
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
university of uh
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
new england i believe it's in southern
 
00:49:10.549 --> 00:49:10.559 align:start position:0%
maine has a similar program
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh there are a large number of programs
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
and the on the online environment that
 
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
really exploded during covet has allowed
 
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
universities across the country to
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
provide education anywhere in the
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
country and a lot of students are taking
 
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
it taking advantage of that there are
 
00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:27.750 align:start position:0%
it taking advantage of that there are
other

00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
structural issues that are getting in
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
the way and as i said many of those
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
issues belong in the domain of commerce
 
00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:36.069 align:start position:0%
issues belong in the domain of commerce
but

00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:36.079 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
many practitioners many students that
 
00:49:42.829 --> 00:49:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:49.109 --> 00:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to testify on
 
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none i'm going to close
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:42.630 align:start position:0%
 
mike

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
do you think the committee might be
 
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
interested in emotion on this bill we
 
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
just heard
 
00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:48.069 align:start position:0%
just heard
yes

00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
um i make a motion of ought to pass sb
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
220. and i'll second the motion
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
okay ought to pass by representative
 
00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.309 align:start position:0%
okay ought to pass by representative
fellowes

00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
fellowes
 
00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative marsh do you
 
00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to your motion
 
00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
representative fellow um yes uh this is
 
00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
a study committee
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
it's not changing any legislation
 
00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:10.549 align:start position:0%
it's not changing any legislation
but

00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:51:10.559 --> 00:51:12.230 align:start position:0%
but
um

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
it certainly seems to be an important
 
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
issue and one of the things i like about
 
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
this study bill is that it's
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and it's not addressing
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
just like a little piece of the
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
issues we think we have with licensing
 
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
it's comprehensive it's dealing with a
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
large group and i think that something
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
useful recommendations might come from
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
the study committee
 
00:51:38.069 --> 00:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
thank you representative marsh
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i'll point out
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
that i'm one of the co-sponsors of this
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
bill yes and the reason that i did so is
 
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
that we are aware that new hampshire has
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
a desperate shortage of mental health
 
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
providers at this point in time as we
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
just heard a number of students that are
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
trained in this state are leaving in
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
this state and many of those reasons may
 
00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
very well be structural based on the way
 
00:51:58.870 --> 00:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
they're licensed in this state and if we
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
can easily address those issues we
 
00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559 align:start position:0%
really ought to do so that would be far
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
and away the least expensive way of
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
addressing this problem
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that all right
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative lackas
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah i'm
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not opposed to this i'm i'm willing
 
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
to vote for it my only concern is i mean
 
00:52:17.349 --> 00:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
the one that was expressed here as a
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
practical matter
 
00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.710 align:start position:0%
practical matter
um

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
given probable complexity of this is the
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
committee going to be able to actually
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
come up with something useful in a time
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
allowed between when it's
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know this actually becomes
 
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
law and when
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
you know when the report's due which is
 
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative rhodes thank
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
you madam chairman um i'm not
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
necessarily opposed to what they're
 
00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
looking to study in
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
in senate bill 220 my concern is what
 
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
i've heard repeatedly from
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
multiple committees
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:52:58.950 --> 00:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
is a study committee in the second year
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
and my under my was under the
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
understanding the impression that
 
00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:03.750 align:start position:0%
understanding the impression that
it

00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
it really is frowned upon for many
 
00:53:07.349 --> 00:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
reasons so i'm not really sure if this
 
00:53:07.359 --> 00:53:08.790 align:start position:0%
reasons so i'm not really sure if this
wouldn't

00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily be better to come
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
to come back whenever it actually can
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
have the study of the committee that it
 
00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
needs so i'm not i'm not really sure how
 
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:16.790 align:start position:0%
needs so i'm not i'm not really sure how
to

00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:18.559 align:start position:0%
how to handle the the conundrum that it
 
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
seems to present
 
00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:23.430 align:start position:0%
seems to present
anyone

00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
okay i'd like to say that the scope of
 
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
this is almost entirely with an edna
 
00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
and we could should we wish to study it
 
00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
without having a formal study committee
 
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
if that were the choice of the committee
 
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
we don't need to pass this bill to get a
 
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
as i said a formal study committee with
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
the senator
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
in order to look at these issues because
 
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
we've heard
 
00:53:49.829 --> 00:53:49.839 align:start position:0%
a large number of these
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
comments and concerns
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
from other people
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
um madam chair i i i think that
 
00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
we need more than just the people from
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
edna to look at this i think we need
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
people um from the
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
medical profession to to deal with this
 
00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
and i think that they're with the study
 
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
committee i think that we can find
 
00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
come up with
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
you know one senator and
 
00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:24.630 align:start position:0%
you know one senator and
three

00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:25.430 align:start position:0%
three
um

00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
representatives that have a background
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
in in this um
 
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
you know they're they're doctors or they
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
they have a background in in social work
 
00:54:37.349 --> 00:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
00:54:39.359 --> 00:54:40.309 align:start position:0%
that would be
um

00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
in a better position to make
 
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations for this
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else representative
 
00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:48.950 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else representative
scientific

00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
scientific
 
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
even if this
 
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
we even if we cannot act on the results
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
of the uh
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
uh this committee i'm thinking about
 
00:55:02.069 --> 00:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
senator carson who was in last week
 
00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
talking about a bill i don't know i have
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
to look it up saying this is a result of
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
a study committee of years in the past
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
so this i would regard this as a first
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
step even if it doesn't
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
actually achieve orbit so
 
00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
any other comments concerns
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.150 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
so i i agree with my colleagues that is
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
late in the game but the bottom line is
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
that the old saying about is better than
 
00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
light one candle and cursed darkness
 
00:55:38.799 --> 00:55:40.230 align:start position:0%
light one candle and cursed darkness
and

00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
i i think
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
that as much as i have a lot of respect
 
00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:45.829 align:start position:0%
that as much as i have a lot of respect
for

00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:55:47.589 --> 00:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
this committee's
 
00:55:50.069 --> 00:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
overall collective intelligence
 
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
experience and so forth putting it all
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
on us especially when uh there was
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
testimony saying that
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
former representative de joy
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
maybe most members of the committee are
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
not aware of it but mr dejoy is the
 
00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.430 align:start position:0%
not aware of it but mr dejoy is the
honorable

00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
honorable
 
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
john de joy who was in the house for a
 
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
number of terms
 
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
back in my early days
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
and he talked about commerce
 
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh also
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
might have been a committee that this
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
could have gone this bill could have
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
gone before
 
00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:56:24.789 --> 00:56:24.799 align:start position:0%
to the degree that we put all the burden
 
00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
on edna
 
00:56:29.109 --> 00:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
it in our collective wisdom but our
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
collective wisdom is not so strong in
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
commerce and some other aspects
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
that this uh study committee
 
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
would be dealing with
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
so i think that that
 
00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:44.559 align:start position:0%
i will vote for it too
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh because i think that we absolutely
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
have to try to get something
 
00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:50.549 align:start position:0%
have to try to get something
accomplished

00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
accomplished
 
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
there are all kinds of people here the
 
00:56:54.309 --> 00:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
first time you see him out on the mound
 
00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:56.559 align:start position:0%
or uh at bat you're going like this
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
guy's never going to make it in the
 
00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:00.799 align:start position:0%
major leagues and a couple years later
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
he's at least
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
a journeyman so
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
nothing ventured nothing gained
 
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
since we have a moment uh representative
 
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
schmidt there's a better old saying than
 
00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:18.799 align:start position:0%
light a candle with respect to this bill
 
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
and it is what james carville said
 
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
the best time to plant an oak tree is 10
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:31.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
your representative lucas you had a
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
comment no no allegra
 
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
thank you i just want to express
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
practical concern for the number of
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
bills coming through proposing study
 
00:57:49.109 --> 00:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
committees and our ability to
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
actually uh enact them in a fair manner
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
and that's all i need thank you okay
 
00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:56.789 align:start position:0%
and that's all i need thank you okay
absolutely

00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:02.069 --> 00:58:02.079 align:start position:0%
yes foreign
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
 
00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
with uh reference to mentioning the
 
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
other committees that
 
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
could likely be involved in this i would
 
00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
hope if this
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
is adopted that our statement of intent

it might be useful but i am
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
continuing and not voting for any study
 
01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:32.480 align:start position:0%

very earliest convenience
 
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
and you and you also you also are
 
01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.150 align:start position:0%
and you and you also you also are
presumptuous

01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
presumptuous
 
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:46.480 align:start position:0%

01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
with four votes against it's
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
probably too much representing the
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%

01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
we could study it anyway
 
01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
we don't need to study on this bill
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
that's the study committee and study
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.910 align:start position:0%

i believe my senator said most
 
01:20:38.950 --> 01:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
everything that's necessary
 
01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
but i will do want to add that there is
 
01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
no fiscal note to this this simply
 
01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
retitles the positions
 
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
and if the jcec needs to review them
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
they can do so once the new titles have
 
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
been established
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
there's not expecting any

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:16.470 align:start position:0%

the organization of the department i
 
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
mean what kind of changes are
 
01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
i don't believe so but you'd have to ask
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%

members of the committee uh it is a
 
01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be able to answer questions
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
for you associated with senate bill 221
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
and i thank senator regan and
 
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
house rep maguire and others for
 
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
sponsoring this bill
 
01:21:56.629 --> 01:21:56.639 align:start position:0%
the goal
 
01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:00.639 align:start position:0%
was to align the names of two specific
 
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
division directors that already exist
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
unclassified and funded
 
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
one change was to take the director of
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
security and training and change that
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
name to the director of personnel and
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
information if you're not aware the
 
01:22:16.229 --> 01:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
department of corrections has a line of
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
effort of significant need associated
 
01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
with staffing employee development and
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
training for us to meet our mission and
 
01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
it seemed odd that we did not have a
 
01:22:28.229 --> 01:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
division director that oversaw our human
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
resource bureau
 
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
our training bureau and those lines of
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
effort so it takes those and puts it
 
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
under the current position referred to
 
01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
in statute director of security and
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
training but asks to rename that to the
 
01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:42.639 align:start position:0%
director of personnel and information
 
01:22:44.950 --> 01:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
the other area we adjusted
 
01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
is currently referred to as the director
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
of community corrections and every other
 
01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:50.719 align:start position:0%
state the director of community
 
01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
corrections actually oversees their
 
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
field services supervision effort our
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
director of community corrections
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
actually oversees the rehabilitative
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
programming across all locations in the
 
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
agency so you'll see we're asking to
 
01:23:06.149 --> 01:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
change that to the director of
 
01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation services
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
we did change some semantics underneath
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
that to recognize that that line of
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
effort under the director of
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative services should be
 
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
working to reduce recidivism we
 
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be working to increase
 
01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
recidivism and target re-entry and
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
programmatic initiatives that do just
 
01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:25.350 align:start position:0%
programmatic initiatives that do just
that

01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:26.390 align:start position:0%
that
the

01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
organizational adjustment as we move
 
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
proposing to move the bureau of victim
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
services under our existing director of
 
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
field services
 
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
to better align the effort of
 
01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
restitution collection so that we're
 
01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
making victims financially whole through
 
01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
the process and those are the major
 
01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
changes that we're asking for within
 
01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for
 
01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming and taking
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
questions um
 
01:23:59.830 --> 01:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
as i look at this and what's currently
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
in statute and what's here in front of
 
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
us these positions um in this bill all
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
say that they are going to unclassified
 
01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:08.719 align:start position:0%
are they classified now or unclassified
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
positions that we are talking about
 
01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question they're all
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
unclassified and would request that they
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
oh follow-up
 
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is why does it have
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
to specifically say in legislation when
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't now in statutes say that they
 
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
are unclassified that we're putting in a
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
statute that they
 
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding the way the
 
01:24:38.229 --> 01:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
statutes written because i have to
 
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
nominate and recommend to the governor
 
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
and the governor executive council that
 
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
they're unclassified we're just using
 
01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for the
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner oh representative schmidt
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%

01:24:58.560 --> 01:24:59.830 align:start position:0%

long because uh
 
01:25:08.239 --> 01:25:09.430 align:start position:0%
long because uh
you're

01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:11.830 align:start position:0%
you're
uh

01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
field your
 
01:25:13.679 --> 01:25:14.709 align:start position:0%
field your
your

01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:14.719 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
corrections department
 
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
is one of the ones that
 
01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:19.110 align:start position:0%
is one of the ones that
is

01:25:19.110 --> 01:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh has one of the toughest
 
01:25:24.229 --> 01:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh rows to host so to speak
 
01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh and uh i think it a
 
01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
a dialogue between this committee and
 
01:25:30.239 --> 01:25:31.030 align:start position:0%
a dialogue between this committee and
your

01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh your uh your
 
01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
department is an important one
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm glad we're going to have an
 
01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to see you today and ask
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
some questions and this
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
appears to be a pretty thorough
 
01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:45.910 align:start position:0%
appears to be a pretty thorough
reorganization

01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
reorganization
 
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
of the department of corrections
 
01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh and i'm wondering is this something
 
01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
that is a result of an outside
 
01:25:59.830 --> 01:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
analysis or this is homegrown
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
and that would be our first question
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt it's a
 
01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
combination of both it's an analysis now
 
01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:08.719 align:start position:0%
that i've been in the position of
 
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the last four years and
 
01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
also my ability to participate under the
 
01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
correctional leaders association which
 
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
is an association of all commissioners
 
01:26:19.110 --> 01:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
across the united states learning from
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
those encounters with them as well as
 
01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
our own needs within the department
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up um so representative
 
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
goalie already asked uh along these
 
01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
lines but uh
 
01:26:35.110 --> 01:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
to the degree that you're changing names
 
01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
and it's just a name change that's not
 
01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and
 
01:26:41.110 --> 01:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have any reason to object to
 
01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:41.990 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have any reason to object to
that

01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
but to the degree that you're changing
 
01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
functions which you clearly are
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
in response to representative goldy's
 
01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
question you got into some of the
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
changes which are change and function as
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
well as the name
 
01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:54.470 align:start position:0%
well as the name
um

01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:56.070 --> 01:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
is this the end of it or is this the
 
01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
beginning of the process
 
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
at this point this is
 
01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
what i'm prepared to put forward and ask
 
01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
for i'm in a constant analysis of the
 
01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
agency and it would be premature for me
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
to respond to that question at this time
 
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not um
 
01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not prepared to even ask for another
 
01:27:16.830 --> 01:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
particular bill this
 
01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
session one more
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
as a member of the jcec
 
01:27:22.239 --> 01:27:24.070 align:start position:0%
as a member of the jcec
i'm

01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
obviously interested whenever we have
 
01:27:26.639 --> 01:27:27.390 align:start position:0%
obviously interested whenever we have
uh

01:27:27.390 --> 01:27:27.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.350 align:start position:0%
uh
reorganizations

01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
reorganizations
 
01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
which of course the executive branch is
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
entitled to do
 
01:27:35.590 --> 01:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
that's part of their function
 
01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
um and um so
 
01:27:40.229 --> 01:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
as this is
 
01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639 align:start position:0%
can we expect to see this on
 
01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
our agenda jc you see anytime soon
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt if this has
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
passed and is signed off i will
 
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
certainly having facilitated things
 
01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
through the jcec if that's appropriate
 
01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
and where it needs to go next i will
 
01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
take it down that path as well okay
 
01:27:59.590 --> 01:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome representative
 
01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:01.669 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair

um i see that that one of the new

divisions you're putting together is
 
01:28:11.189 --> 01:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
personnel and information
 
01:28:14.229 --> 01:28:14.239 align:start position:0%

internal and external communication
in

01:28:24.870 --> 01:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
bus in technology
 
01:28:29.669 --> 01:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
and so i'm
 
01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
confused as to why you would put those
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
things together i i don't really see
 
01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
any connection between
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
i t
 
01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:41.669 align:start position:0%
i t
and

01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
internal and external communications or
 
01:28:44.159 --> 01:28:45.350 align:start position:0%
internal and external communications or
between

01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
personnel management and internal and
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
external communications or business
 
01:28:53.189 --> 01:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
technology so can you please explain why
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
you put those together
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative fellows happy
 
01:28:58.390 --> 01:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
both our external intra
 
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
internet page and we have an internet
 
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
page are highly used both to push public
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
information out about what we what we
 
01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
actually do in corrections we are
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
certainly not a reality tv show and we
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
actually people who really do think that
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
what is it pink is the new black or
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
whatever those things are and so it's
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
important that our information
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
technology bureau is part of our
 
01:29:24.629 --> 01:29:24.639 align:start position:0%
communication side in line of effort so
 
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
we communicate both to the loved ones
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
and attorneys and all of those other
 
01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
constituents that are looking for
 
01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
information that the right information
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
gets out and so there's an alliance
 
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
between our information technology and
 
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
our communications effort as well as our
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
employees for example police standards
 
01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
and training council adjusted their
 
01:29:45.189 --> 01:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
software platform that manages law
 
01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement certification to a product
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
called benchmark so our training line of
 
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
effort we need to be able to pass that
 
01:29:53.189 --> 01:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
information seamlessly to police
 
01:29:55.830 --> 01:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
standards and training we have over 400
 
01:29:57.669 --> 01:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
certified law enforcement members within
 
01:29:59.590 --> 01:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
the agency so combining our
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
communications both written and
 
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
published through information technology
 
01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
as well as our employee training and
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
employee development which we will and
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
do use online modalities of software is
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
important that they're all working in
 
01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
cohesion to help advance our employees
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah can you tell me the process that
 
01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
you use to develop this reorganization
 
01:30:28.709 --> 01:30:28.719 align:start position:0%
certainly so um in working both with my
 
01:30:30.149 --> 01:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
partners in ability with the
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
correctional leaders association and
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
reviewing other states
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
organizational charts and asking other
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
commissioners what's worked what hasn't
 
01:30:40.149 --> 01:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
worked this is what we're experiencing
 
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
and doing that for the last several
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
years as well as doing exit interviews
 
01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
with our employees that are choosing to
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
leave not retiring and asking them what
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
could we have done better
 
01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
many things were centered around
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
employee development training and trying
 
01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
to get a pathway to do that as you can
 
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
imagine our overtime budget is
 
01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
significant and sometimes computer
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
technology is our fastest pathway to
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
communicate with our employees and push
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
information and training out so some of
 
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
it is studying and understanding how
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
other agencies have done it what their
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
successes have been
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
should i stop
 
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
as well as looking within the agency and
 
01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
asking the employees that we've lost uh
 
01:31:22.709 --> 01:31:22.719 align:start position:0%
what could we have done better and
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's informed these next steps
 
01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:26.709 align:start position:0%
that's informed these next steps
follow-up

01:31:26.709 --> 01:31:26.719 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:31:26.719 --> 01:31:27.590 align:start position:0%
follow-up
um

01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
yes just to follow up on when you're
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
training and development
 
01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
so i'm thinking that
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
every state agency
 
01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:39.430 align:start position:0%
every state agency
has

01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
has um at least a budget line for
 
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
training which usually is used to give
 
01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:48.229 align:start position:0%
training which usually is used to give
personnel

01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
training that they can use to move up in
 
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
the organization
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking that
 
01:31:57.110 --> 01:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
that correction collections is
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
pretty different from most agencies and
 
01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
i would be thinking that
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong that a lot of
 
01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
your training
 
01:32:09.189 --> 01:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
goes to training the people
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
once you hire them to do their job
 
01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:14.229 align:start position:0%
once you hire them to do their job
so

01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:16.149 --> 01:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering about that
 
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
distinction and you're just putting the
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
training here
 
01:32:22.229 --> 01:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
so what does that mean
 
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
certainly representative fellows by
 
01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
having a division director of personnel
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
and information and dealing with both
 
01:32:31.110 --> 01:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
called onboarding and training the
 
01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
basics of what you need to navigate and
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
the numbers of disciplines it takes to
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
actually run a corrections environment
 
01:32:39.030 --> 01:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's nursing social workers
 
01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
corrections officers teachers case
 
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
managers the diversity of that employee
 
01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
development and ongoing training so
 
01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
where do they want to go within the
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
agency and how do we help them find a
 
01:32:52.629 --> 01:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
path there employee development and
 
01:32:54.390 --> 01:32:54.400 align:start position:0%
leadership training because of our rank
 
01:32:57.189 --> 01:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
and file um having an officer could go
 
01:32:58.229 --> 01:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
all the way up to be the chief of
 
01:33:00.790 --> 01:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
security that all of those embedded
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
together in this division
 
01:33:04.229 --> 01:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
we're investing in our personnel we're
 
01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
investing in our employee development
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
and we're investing in what i would call
 
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
ongoing and natural training and that's
 
01:33:12.070 --> 01:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
the just that's what we're proposing
 
01:33:17.110 --> 01:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:33:21.189 --> 01:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you very much thank
 
01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
you for your time appreciate your
 
01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
service to the state
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
are there any other members of the
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
public that are here that wish to
 
01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:29.590 align:start position:0%
public that are here that wish to
testify

01:33:29.590 --> 01:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
saying none we will close the
 
01:34:31.590 --> 01:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:34.470 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 221
 
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i'll like to make
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
a motion of ought to pass for senate

you let you speak
 
01:35:00.629 --> 01:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
thank you i already said what i had to
 
01:35:00.639 --> 01:35:02.310 align:start position:0%
thank you i already said what i had to
say

01:35:02.310 --> 01:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
obviously a request of the department of
 
01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
corrections it appears to be
 
01:35:12.870 --> 01:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
well within their scope
 
01:35:17.669 --> 01:35:17.679 align:start position:0%
of business and i i support them
 
01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
choosing the names that they think most
 
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
appropriately fit their business
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
represent is there another anyone else
 
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
01:35:32.229 --> 01:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know that this matters because i
 
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
did not compare it to the original uh h
 
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
21 h whatever it was but the word
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
resident is used in lines 25 and 30 on
 
01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:43.270 align:start position:0%
resident is used in lines 25 and 30 on
page

01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
two and they're not defined and does
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
that is that going to be any practical
 
01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:50.550 align:start position:0%
that is that going to be any practical
problem

01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
i i i should be here
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
looks like you have an answer to that
 
01:35:54.239 --> 01:35:57.750 align:start position:0%
looks like you have an answer to that
question

01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
because in looking at the statutes
 
01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
looking at many of the statutes the
 
01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
statutes range from stating
 
01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:05.590 align:start position:0%
statutes range from stating
convicts

01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
convicts
 
01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:06.629 align:start position:0%
convicts
offender

01:36:06.629 --> 01:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
offender
 
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
inmate person under departmental control
 
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
i think the nature of where this
 
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
language resides in the internal
 
01:36:15.109 --> 01:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
organization recognizes we're talking
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
about people who are under the
 
01:36:18.390 --> 01:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the department
 
01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:19.510 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the department
there's

01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:21.189 align:start position:0%
there's
numerous

01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
numerous
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
references to people who are charged
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
within our mission well if you don't
 
01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
have a problem i don't have a problem so
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
yes represent fellows
 
01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i i can
 
01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
understand um
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
certain portions of this and it makes
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:49.679 --> 01:36:50.550 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
there should be some reorganization
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
i just
 
01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
you know and i guess i'm willing to give
 
01:36:59.910 --> 01:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
them a try at this i just some of it
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
just doesn't make a lot of sense to me
 
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
like why it isn't under like the
 
01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:06.709 align:start position:0%
like why it isn't under like the
administrative

01:37:06.709 --> 01:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
01:37:10.709 --> 01:37:10.719 align:start position:0%
business operations and you know and why
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
ex you know com
 
01:37:15.189 --> 01:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
external communications
 
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
just doesn't seem to be in my opinion it
 
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong with personnel
 
01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:23.750 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong with personnel
but

01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:25.270 --> 01:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
if that's how they the only thing i can
 
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
say is that the department of
 
01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
corrections has
 
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:34.229 --> 01:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
very tightly staffed and people are
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of different things and if
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
this is the way they they choose to do
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
it like you i'm willing to give them a
 
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah just um
 
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
i have something the rest of you are not
 
01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
looking at but i believe that there is
 
01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
not cur is it true that there's not
 
01:37:58.149 --> 01:37:58.159 align:start position:0%
currently a person in the position
 
01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
of director of over the personnel
 
01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:04.550 align:start position:0%
of director of over the personnel
operation

01:38:04.550 --> 01:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner that's a factual question
 
01:38:09.669 --> 01:38:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:09.679 --> 01:38:10.470 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
there is a person in the position of
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
director of security and training as
 
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's statutorily referred to right now
 
01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
all of our unclassified positions are
 
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
filled if this passes that person's
 
01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
title would change to director of
 
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
personnel and information and is
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
personnel in part of that division
 
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
yes we're functioning under the
 
01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
statutory authority of the commissioner
 
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
to other duties as assigned
 
01:38:35.669 --> 01:38:35.679 align:start position:0%
and functioning quite well i think we've
 
01:38:37.030 --> 01:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
done that
 
01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
representative scitec this sure sounds
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
like an echo of what we've just gone
 
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
through with a health and human services
 
01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:46.550 align:start position:0%
through with a health and human services
where

01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's tightly staffed they took advantage
 
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
of openings moved people around and we
 
01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
had to have
 
01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:52.149 align:start position:0%
had to have
a

01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:52.159 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
charlie arlinghaus come in and
 
01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
straighten out the whole shebang for us
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
01:38:59.109 --> 01:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
not the least bit surprising that this
 
01:39:01.109 --> 01:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
is going on
 
01:39:01.119 --> 01:39:02.550 align:start position:0%
is going on
okay

01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
you're john schmidt
 
01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am sure um i think you
 
01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
stated extremely well uh
 
01:39:13.350 --> 01:39:13.360 align:start position:0%
in your opening remarks
 
01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
and and i think one of the key factors
 
01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh that we should take into
 
01:39:17.199 --> 01:39:18.550 align:start position:0%
uh that we should take into
consideration

01:39:18.550 --> 01:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:39:21.430 --> 01:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
is what the commissioner herself said in
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
her testimony which is that we
 
01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
that she has now been commissioner for
 
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
four years
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
so she was with the department before
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
but but it's only been under her
 
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
leadership for four years so she's had
 
01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
the time to to uh you know
 
01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
to work with these positions these
 
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
individuals and with these titles as
 
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
well and to the degree that now she has
 
01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
the authority to do so
 
01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
she believes that the terminology needs
 
01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
to be changed
 
01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:54.719 align:start position:0%
i think we should let her do that
 
01:39:59.189 --> 01:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:01.840 align:start position:0%

03:10:19.600 --> 03:10:20.790 align:start position:0%
if this was to become law in september
be

03:10:20.790 --> 03:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:10:22.950 --> 03:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
became this and 37 other things that
 
03:10:25.349 --> 03:10:25.359 align:start position:0%
that are september what would this what
 
03:10:26.950 --> 03:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
would this look like
 
03:10:29.830 --> 03:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
sure i think that um it's an opportunity
 
03:10:33.269 --> 03:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
for organizations such as step up to
 
03:10:33.279 --> 03:10:34.070 align:start position:0%
for organizations such as step up to
um

03:10:34.070 --> 03:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:35.670 --> 03:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
know that there's a month where they're
 
03:10:37.030 --> 03:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
sort of heightened awareness of this
 
03:10:39.670 --> 03:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
challenge that exists in our communities
 
03:10:41.990 --> 03:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
to do you know some fundraising to
 
03:10:44.229 --> 03:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
sustain these organizations and um to
 
03:10:45.510 --> 03:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
hold events
 
03:10:47.830 --> 03:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes featuring you know local local
 
03:10:50.870 --> 03:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
elected officials to make sure that um
 
03:10:52.469 --> 03:10:52.479 align:start position:0%
there's sort of a spotlight on this
 
03:10:56.790 --> 03:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:59.830 --> 03:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:01.269 --> 03:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very

thank you very much
 
03:11:05.590 --> 03:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
03:11:10.710 --> 03:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:12.550 --> 03:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none
 
03:11:17.510 --> 03:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:19.670 --> 03:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
and does
 
03:11:24.790 --> 03:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:29.910 --> 03:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:31.429 --> 03:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
03:11:31.439 --> 03:11:36.229 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
um

03:11:36.229 --> 03:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:38.550 --> 03:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
well i think i'm going to do um senate
 
03:11:40.950 --> 03:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
bill 2-8 i'm sorry
 
03:11:42.229 --> 03:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
that's a lie
 
03:11:44.469 --> 03:11:44.479 align:start position:0%
um i actually like to make a motion of
 
03:11:46.309 --> 03:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
an expedient to legislate for senate
 
03:11:48.630 --> 03:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
bill 219.
 
03:11:52.309 --> 03:11:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:55.910 --> 03:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative second by representative
 
03:11:58.309 --> 03:11:58.319 align:start position:0%
219 yes
 
03:12:00.389 --> 03:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your motion
 
03:12:04.150 --> 03:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
yes madam chairman um
 
03:12:04.160 --> 03:12:05.510 align:start position:0%
yes madam chairman um
so

03:12:05.510 --> 03:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:12:08.630 --> 03:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
when i'm not in in concord i i actually
 
03:12:10.630 --> 03:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
work up at the uh the school district in
 
03:12:14.070 --> 03:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
my town and i do recognize the the
 
03:12:16.070 --> 03:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
challenges and the
 
03:12:18.870 --> 03:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
the heartbreak that that a lot
 
03:12:21.510 --> 03:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
of children uh go through especially
 
03:12:23.910 --> 03:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
with with all of the different struggles
 
03:12:26.389 --> 03:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
that a lot of their parents have um
 
03:12:29.750 --> 03:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
however i i still go back to our our i
 
03:12:31.110 --> 03:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
feel like it's the same paragraph that
 
03:12:32.870 --> 03:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
we say over and over in the committee
 
03:12:36.550 --> 03:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
which is i i think that if there was a
 
03:12:38.790 --> 03:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
group of people that
 
03:12:40.950 --> 03:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
that organized and got themselves
 
03:12:42.469 --> 03:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
together annually
 
03:12:44.630 --> 03:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
and they were to
 
03:12:46.950 --> 03:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
approach the governor and ask for an
 
03:12:48.469 --> 03:12:48.479 align:start position:0%
awareness day
 
03:12:50.550 --> 03:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
i recognize that this is a month um but
 
03:12:52.790 --> 03:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
nonetheless i think it's the it it's
 
03:12:54.469 --> 03:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
still it's going to be the same effect
 
03:12:55.910 --> 03:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
and i think that if you have this group
 
03:12:59.030 --> 03:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:01.030 --> 03:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
collaborate together that there would
 
03:13:03.990 --> 03:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
actually be a lot more awareness brought
 
03:13:06.710 --> 03:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
to the to this particular subject and i
 
03:13:07.910 --> 03:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
think that they would actually probably
 
03:13:10.070 --> 03:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
get more news coverage
 
03:13:11.990 --> 03:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
um and get a lot more community
 
03:13:13.990 --> 03:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
involvement that way because they can
 
03:13:15.910 --> 03:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
actually have the day be what they want
 
03:13:17.110 --> 03:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
the day to be
 
03:13:20.790 --> 03:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:22.389 --> 03:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
representative lakas
 
03:13:24.870 --> 03:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah i i agree um you know
 
03:13:26.150 --> 03:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
maybe they could get together even
 
03:13:27.830 --> 03:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
organized people to volunteer to help
 
03:13:29.429 --> 03:13:29.439 align:start position:0%
give people providing that kind of care
 
03:13:32.710 --> 03:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
or break i mean i'm familiar with this
 
03:13:34.630 --> 03:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
we had our oldest granddaughter living
 
03:13:35.510 --> 03:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
with us
 
03:13:36.950 --> 03:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
through high school because her mother
 
03:13:39.670 --> 03:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
was having difficulties at the time so
 
03:13:42.950 --> 03:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's not that i don't care about this
 
03:13:44.950 --> 03:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
but i think that there's much more
 
03:13:47.190 --> 03:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
effective ways of raising awareness i
 
03:13:48.790 --> 03:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
don't think this would because
 
03:13:50.710 --> 03:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
i think the governor staff just gives
 
03:13:51.990 --> 03:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
them something to sign on the right day
 
03:13:53.750 --> 03:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
they do a press release
 
03:13:55.030 --> 03:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
unless there are people out in the
 
03:13:56.790 --> 03:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
community doing something more to raise
 
03:13:58.710 --> 03:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
awareness that's where it ends
 
03:14:00.550 --> 03:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
and so i just don't think this sort of
 
03:14:02.150 --> 03:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
thing's effective it's not that i'm not
 
03:14:03.910 --> 03:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to
 
03:14:06.710 --> 03:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
your the constituent's uh you know
 
03:14:08.550 --> 03:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
interest in this
 
03:14:11.349 --> 03:14:11.359 align:start position:0%
okay any other comments questions
 
03:14:14.630 --> 03:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:18.309 --> 03:14:18.319 align:start position:0%
senator has brought to us two important
 
03:14:18.319 --> 03:14:19.990 align:start position:0%
senator has brought to us two important
issues

03:14:19.990 --> 03:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
issues
 
03:14:23.670 --> 03:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not a fan of any of these kinds of
 
03:14:25.349 --> 03:14:25.359 align:start position:0%
memorials because i don't think they
 
03:14:27.110 --> 03:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
have much meaning
 
03:14:28.950 --> 03:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
on the other hand these are important
 
03:14:31.429 --> 03:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
and i would like to ask whether
 
03:14:32.389 --> 03:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
03:14:34.950 --> 03:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
hinting what i hinted at during her
 
03:14:37.750 --> 03:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
testimony earlier is there any appetite
 
03:14:37.760 --> 03:14:38.389 align:start position:0%
testimony earlier is there any appetite
to

03:14:38.389 --> 03:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:14:41.269 --> 03:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
get an amendment to make these uh for
 
03:14:42.950 --> 03:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
this year and
 
03:14:42.960 --> 03:14:43.910 align:start position:0%
this year and
um

03:14:43.910 --> 03:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:45.910 --> 03:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
go forward with them on the one on this
 
03:14:48.229 --> 03:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
one year basis and see what the next
 
03:14:50.469 --> 03:14:50.479 align:start position:0%
year brings but i don't think i want to
 
03:14:54.790 --> 03:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:57.910 --> 03:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm asking the committee i guess if
 
03:14:59.190 --> 03:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
if that would
 
03:15:01.910 --> 03:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
how people might feel about that
 
03:15:03.750 --> 03:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
because i'd be willing to i'd certainly
 
03:15:06.710 --> 03:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
vote for that for uh
 
03:15:09.750 --> 03:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
while a one year month or a day so
 
03:15:11.349 --> 03:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:15:12.630 --> 03:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
any comments
 
03:15:14.469 --> 03:15:14.479 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes oh thank you madam
 
03:15:15.910 --> 03:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
chairman one of the things that i
 
03:15:17.510 --> 03:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
actually just wanted to bring up
 
03:15:19.269 --> 03:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
when i was
 
03:15:21.030 --> 03:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
taking our small lunch break i just
 
03:15:22.550 --> 03:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
happened to turn to the right page of
 
03:15:25.190 --> 03:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
the 2017 laws in the book to see that
 
03:15:27.110 --> 03:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
last week was actually
 
03:15:28.950 --> 03:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
that last monday was actually john stark
 
03:15:29.990 --> 03:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
day i
 
03:15:31.590 --> 03:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
i didn't know that
 
03:15:34.469 --> 03:15:34.479 align:start position:0%
um i feel like if again if that was if
 
03:15:36.309 --> 03:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
that was brought as an individual day i
 
03:15:37.190 --> 03:15:37.200 align:start position:0%
think there would have been a lot more
 
03:15:38.389 --> 03:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
coverage and we all probably would have
 
03:15:38.399 --> 03:15:40.389 align:start position:0%
coverage and we all probably would have
known

03:15:40.389 --> 03:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
known
 
03:15:42.389 --> 03:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
okay represent representative broda and
 
03:15:45.030 --> 03:15:45.040 align:start position:0%

03:15:46.790 --> 03:15:46.800 align:start position:0%

been dead for an awful long time and
 
03:16:16.309 --> 03:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
they're not a lot of relatives that are
 
03:16:18.550 --> 03:16:18.560 align:start position:0%

03:16:34.550 --> 03:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
impetus for anything that local
 
03:16:36.870 --> 03:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
communities or local organizations may
 
03:16:38.229 --> 03:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
want to do
 
03:16:40.070 --> 03:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
it just provides a
 
03:16:42.710 --> 03:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
a nice background for what any efforts
 
03:16:45.030 --> 03:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
that they might want to do
 
03:16:46.309 --> 03:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
so i
 
03:16:49.110 --> 03:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
let's leave john stark in
 
03:16:50.950 --> 03:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
in memory thank you
 
03:16:52.550 --> 03:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative blackis
 
03:16:55.750 --> 03:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:57.190 --> 03:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
03:16:58.389 --> 03:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
without having
 
03:17:00.070 --> 03:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
any statute this year they were able to
 
03:17:01.429 --> 03:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
get a proclamation and there may have
 
03:17:03.590 --> 03:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
been other activities that i'm not aware
 
03:17:03.600 --> 03:17:04.790 align:start position:0%
been other activities that i'm not aware
of

03:17:04.790 --> 03:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:17:06.710 --> 03:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
and that could happen again this year
 
03:17:08.550 --> 03:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
next year um
 
03:17:10.150 --> 03:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
i really don't see doing this sort of
 
03:17:12.710 --> 03:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
thing as adding much it's really
 
03:17:15.269 --> 03:17:15.279 align:start position:0%
kind of a grassroots or a community
 
03:17:16.630 --> 03:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
doing something
 
03:17:18.389 --> 03:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
and making things visible and then maybe
 
03:17:19.910 --> 03:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
not just commemorating it but doing
 
03:17:22.550 --> 03:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
something to help the people in those
 
03:17:24.469 --> 03:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
situations as well
 
03:17:26.790 --> 03:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
um i'd i'd i'd
 
03:17:29.110 --> 03:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
you know i would be maybe less opposed
 
03:17:31.030 --> 03:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
to having to be one day than something
 
03:17:32.950 --> 03:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's in statute that would be there
 
03:17:34.950 --> 03:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
automatic and generally ignored after a
 
03:17:36.710 --> 03:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
certain amount of time i believe
 
03:17:38.630 --> 03:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh but i'm not
 
03:17:40.870 --> 03:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
you know i wouldn't um
 
03:17:46.229 --> 03:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:46.239 --> 03:17:47.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:17:47.830 --> 03:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:17:47.840 --> 03:17:51.110 align:start position:0%
okay
representative

03:17:51.110 --> 03:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:53.190 --> 03:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
i just don't see this as the purview of
 
03:17:56.550 --> 03:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature i think it's a
 
03:17:59.030 --> 03:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's a much richer effort anyway when it
 
03:18:02.150 --> 03:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
just comes from the citizenship
 
03:18:04.389 --> 03:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
and i always remind myself that we have
 
03:18:07.510 --> 03:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
65 000 pages of laws
 
03:18:09.190 --> 03:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
of rsas
 
03:18:11.429 --> 03:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
and adding another for these kinds of
 
03:18:13.830 --> 03:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
events i don't think is
 
03:18:13.840 --> 03:18:14.790 align:start position:0%
events i don't think is
is

03:18:14.790 --> 03:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:18:16.070 --> 03:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
our job
 
03:18:18.389 --> 03:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
and especially adding one
 
03:18:20.950 --> 03:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
for just one time
 
03:18:23.269 --> 03:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:18:25.750 --> 03:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
that's all i need to add thank you
 
03:18:27.750 --> 03:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
03:18:27.760 --> 03:18:29.190 align:start position:0%
anyone else
represents

03:18:29.190 --> 03:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
represents
 
03:18:31.110 --> 03:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
yeah representative alegre this would be
 
03:18:32.950 --> 03:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
likely to be chapter laws so it's not
 
03:18:35.190 --> 03:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
going to swell the books for very long
 
03:18:37.349 --> 03:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
and we'll let them struggle with it next
 
03:18:39.429 --> 03:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
year so
 
03:18:41.269 --> 03:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
i i would like to address that please
 
03:18:43.830 --> 03:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
chapter law or otherwise i just don't
 
03:18:45.349 --> 03:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
think that
 
03:18:48.389 --> 03:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
this should be done by law of any sort
 
03:18:50.710 --> 03:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
this should be done by local
 
03:18:50.720 --> 03:18:52.150 align:start position:0%
this should be done by local
organizations

03:18:52.150 --> 03:18:52.160 align:start position:0%

to six
 
03:21:33.040 --> 03:21:34.469 align:start position:0%

minority report i don't think that

should be on consent
 
03:21:47.110 --> 03:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
so we'll put that on the regular

so we'll put that on the regular
calendar

03:22:00.550 --> 03:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:00.560 --> 03:22:02.309 align:start position:0%

03:22:24.870 --> 03:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
allegro will second all right do you
 
03:22:27.429 --> 03:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to your motion
 
03:22:29.910 --> 03:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you i mean it's
 
03:22:32.830 --> 03:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
it's basically the same argument as for
 
03:22:35.429 --> 03:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
219 um
 
03:22:36.790 --> 03:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
you know i've certainly known people
 
03:22:38.790 --> 03:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
who've had breast cancer died of it i
 
03:22:40.950 --> 03:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
don't know what kind
 
03:22:43.990 --> 03:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's not a matter of being unsympathetic
 
03:22:46.870 --> 03:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of
 
03:22:46.880 --> 03:22:49.110 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of
public

03:22:49.110 --> 03:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:22:51.590 --> 03:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
awareness raising events activities
 
03:22:53.429 --> 03:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
symbols and all of that
 
03:22:55.990 --> 03:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
for breast cancer in general which i
 
03:22:57.830 --> 03:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
i support
 
03:23:00.309 --> 03:23:00.319 align:start position:0%
i just i don't really think that adding
 
03:23:03.110 --> 03:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
an official day which is basically
 
03:23:05.590 --> 03:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
going to generate in some you know
 
03:23:08.070 --> 03:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
press release of a uh
 
03:23:10.309 --> 03:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
a proclamation which is i think all it's
 
03:23:11.590 --> 03:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
going to do
 
03:23:13.750 --> 03:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh is of any point at all and is going
 
03:23:14.950 --> 03:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
to contribute
 
03:23:17.830 --> 03:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
to that awareness thank you
 
03:23:19.429 --> 03:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
03:23:21.190 --> 03:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
yes one of the differences however is
 
03:23:23.429 --> 03:23:23.439 align:start position:0%
that october 13th is national metastatic
 
03:23:25.670 --> 03:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
breast cancer awareness day
 
03:23:27.190 --> 03:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
and i think it's appropriate for the
 
03:23:28.710 --> 03:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire to join the other
 
03:23:34.070 --> 03:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:36.710 --> 03:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else represent scitec well i
 
03:23:39.110 --> 03:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
agree with representative
 
03:23:40.630 --> 03:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
lekkis i'm not going to vote with him i
 
03:23:42.389 --> 03:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
still want my amendment
 
03:23:47.510 --> 03:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
so uh i'll be voting against ito
 
03:23:49.750 --> 03:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative goalie and then pearson
 
03:23:52.710 --> 03:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:54.309 --> 03:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
well i agree it is
 
03:23:57.429 --> 03:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
already observed nationally
 
03:23:59.590 --> 03:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think
 
03:24:01.990 --> 03:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
bringing an amendment forward um
 
03:24:02.000 --> 03:24:02.790 align:start position:0%
bringing an amendment forward um
is

03:24:02.790 --> 03:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:24:04.229 --> 03:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
the appropriate thing to do i think the
 
03:24:06.150 --> 03:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing to do is for those
 
03:24:07.830 --> 03:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
involved with this
 
03:24:09.349 --> 03:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
should approach the governor for a
 
03:24:11.830 --> 03:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
proclamation through his office and not
 
03:24:14.229 --> 03:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
through the legislature
 
03:24:16.309 --> 03:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
to me that's the more appropriate thing
 
03:24:16.319 --> 03:24:17.590 align:start position:0%
to me that's the more appropriate thing
that

03:24:17.590 --> 03:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:24:19.349 --> 03:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
brings out folks
 
03:24:21.190 --> 03:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
gets them down on the front steps as he
 
03:24:23.670 --> 03:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
does the proclamation on that day versus
 
03:24:25.590 --> 03:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
just putting it in statute and leaving
 
03:24:27.510 --> 03:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
with all the others as i look up
 
03:24:29.269 --> 03:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
october 13th
 
03:24:30.950 --> 03:24:30.960 align:start position:0%

03:24:32.710 --> 03:24:32.720 align:start position:0%

pudding day national train your brain
 
03:24:41.750 --> 03:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
day and it goes on and on
 
03:24:43.750 --> 03:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
i think it's more appropriate to have it
 
03:24:45.670 --> 03:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
done that day and have the governor do
 
03:24:47.429 --> 03:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
it and bring it forth to him versus just
 
03:24:48.389 --> 03:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
putting it
 
03:24:50.150 --> 03:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
in statute thank you thank you

conflicted
 
03:24:59.990 --> 03:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not a big fan of the days that's not
 
03:25:02.389 --> 03:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
a secret um but in this particular case
 
03:25:05.030 --> 03:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
it being a a recognized national day
 
03:25:05.040 --> 03:25:06.389 align:start position:0%
it being a a recognized national day
already

03:25:06.389 --> 03:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
already
 
03:25:08.469 --> 03:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
i can't recall what we did
 
03:25:10.950 --> 03:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
last october 13th what the governor did
 
03:25:13.830 --> 03:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
i would imagine it was recognized
 
03:25:13.840 --> 03:25:15.590 align:start position:0%
i would imagine it was recognized
um

03:25:15.590 --> 03:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:18.950 --> 03:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
so i guess the the matter is do we
 
03:25:21.590 --> 03:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
codify this into a state
 
03:25:21.600 --> 03:25:23.510 align:start position:0%
codify this into a state
day

03:25:23.510 --> 03:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
day
 
03:25:25.110 --> 03:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
to coincide with the national
 
03:25:25.120 --> 03:25:28.309 align:start position:0%
to coincide with the national
recognition

03:25:28.309 --> 03:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:30.150 --> 03:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at a veto proof majority out
 
03:25:32.229 --> 03:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
of the senate i
 
03:25:35.510 --> 03:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's 17 senators on this bill
 
03:25:37.110 --> 03:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
this one i'm probably okay with as a
 
03:25:39.830 --> 03:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
general rule i'm not but
 
03:25:43.269 --> 03:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
considering that there's already
 
03:25:45.590 --> 03:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of national attention which is why
 
03:25:47.030 --> 03:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
i'm conflicted the national attention
 
03:25:49.110 --> 03:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
that exists for this bill
 
03:25:51.750 --> 03:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
is substantial so does this really add
 
03:25:53.349 --> 03:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
to what the state of new hampshire is
 
03:25:53.359 --> 03:25:54.870 align:start position:0%
to what the state of new hampshire is
doing

03:25:54.870 --> 03:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
doing
 
03:25:57.030 --> 03:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
over and above the substantial
 
03:25:58.550 --> 03:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
recognition that occurs at the national
 
03:26:00.150 --> 03:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
level i don't know if that answers yes
 
03:26:02.550 --> 03:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
or no i don't know that it necessarily
 
03:26:04.630 --> 03:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
is but
 
03:26:06.070 --> 03:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
this is why i'm
 
03:26:06.080 --> 03:26:07.510 align:start position:0%
this is why i'm

oh i didn't realize i had my hand up but
 
03:26:15.429 --> 03:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
i did never get to

comment on my second
 
03:26:18.630 --> 03:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna provide a little personal
 
03:26:21.269 --> 03:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
context to this i don't often do that
 
03:26:23.590 --> 03:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
but i have a or had a beloved sister who
 
03:26:25.190 --> 03:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
passed away from metastatic breast
 
03:26:25.200 --> 03:26:26.710 align:start position:0%
passed away from metastatic breast
cancer

03:26:26.710 --> 03:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
03:26:28.469 --> 03:26:28.479 align:start position:0%
i'm certain that she wouldn't want this
 
03:26:29.429 --> 03:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
03:26:29.439 --> 03:26:30.830 align:start position:0%
kind of
um

03:26:30.830 --> 03:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:35.030 --> 03:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
thing i don't think it does anything to
 
03:26:37.030 --> 03:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
further the cause
 
03:26:40.550 --> 03:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
um i think it's largely symbolic
 
03:26:40.560 --> 03:26:41.590 align:start position:0%
um i think it's largely symbolic
and

03:26:41.590 --> 03:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:26:44.150 --> 03:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
with that kind of loss i'm i don't know
 
03:26:45.590 --> 03:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
how else to put it i'm not into
 
03:26:45.600 --> 03:26:47.030 align:start position:0%
how else to put it i'm not into
symbolism

03:26:47.030 --> 03:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
symbolism
 
03:26:49.750 --> 03:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:51.830 --> 03:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
03:26:54.389 --> 03:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
03:26:56.150 --> 03:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
i think that everyone in this
 
03:26:58.790 --> 03:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
in this committee probably knows
 
03:27:00.870 --> 03:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
of someone
 
03:27:02.070 --> 03:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
that has
 
03:27:04.550 --> 03:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
that has lost a life due to um
 
03:27:05.830 --> 03:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
to breast cancer i don't think that
 
03:27:05.840 --> 03:27:06.950 align:start position:0%
to breast cancer i don't think that
anybody

03:27:06.950 --> 03:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
03:27:09.990 --> 03:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
um is not sensitive to that at all
 
03:27:11.510 --> 03:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
but the question that i would have and
 
03:27:13.349 --> 03:27:13.359 align:start position:0%
it was after representative pearson was
 
03:27:15.750 --> 03:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
speaking is exactly
 
03:27:17.110 --> 03:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
what would it
 
03:27:18.790 --> 03:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
what would
 
03:27:21.190 --> 03:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
what would making the day what what
 
03:27:23.269 --> 03:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
exactly is it going to do
 
03:27:23.279 --> 03:27:25.190 align:start position:0%
exactly is it going to do
um

03:27:25.190 --> 03:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:27.590 --> 03:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
and i did look up to see in you know if
 
03:27:29.670 --> 03:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
there was something national and i you
 
03:27:30.950 --> 03:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
know i did look it up because i do know
 
03:27:32.229 --> 03:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
that there's
 
03:27:33.830 --> 03:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
certainly a lot of events i know that
 
03:27:35.510 --> 03:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
there's um you know the city of
 
03:27:37.429 --> 03:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
pittsburgh they have a
 
03:27:37.439 --> 03:27:38.790 align:start position:0%
pittsburgh they have a
um

03:27:38.790 --> 03:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:41.750 --> 03:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
a big marathon on that day um so i think
 
03:27:43.190 --> 03:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
going along the lines that we've done
 
03:27:45.670 --> 03:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
with all of the other awareness days or
 
03:27:47.429 --> 03:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
awareness months
 
03:27:50.309 --> 03:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
is is probably with with nationally is
 
03:27:51.910 --> 03:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
is probably the better way to go i just
 
03:27:53.510 --> 03:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
don't know that this is going to do
 
03:27:55.190 --> 03:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
anything other than doing what we
 
03:27:56.790 --> 03:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
already do nationally
 
03:27:58.870 --> 03:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
and i think that i really
 
03:28:00.469 --> 03:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
watched what i was trying to say but i
 
03:28:02.710 --> 03:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
think that i got the point across so i
 
03:28:02.720 --> 03:28:04.070 align:start position:0%
think that i got the point across so i
apologize

03:28:04.070 --> 03:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
03:28:06.150 --> 03:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
any of any other
 
03:28:12.550 --> 03:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:13.990 --> 03:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative peterson are you talking
 
03:28:17.030 --> 03:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
about forever or the uh the proposed the
 
03:28:19.190 --> 03:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
putative amendment that i'm talking
 
03:28:19.200 --> 03:28:23.670 align:start position:0%
putative amendment that i'm talking
about

03:28:23.670 --> 03:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:26.229 --> 03:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
the national recognition of this day is
 
03:28:28.950 --> 03:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
i would presume in perpetuity so i'm
 
03:28:30.229 --> 03:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
going to agree with representative
 
03:28:32.550 --> 03:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
goalie that a single
 
03:28:34.630 --> 03:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
turning this turning this into a single
 
03:28:36.790 --> 03:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
year event is a waste of time it's
 
03:28:39.750 --> 03:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
either we're gonna do it or not it
 
03:28:39.760 --> 03:28:41.349 align:start position:0%
either we're gonna do it or not it
and

03:28:41.349 --> 03:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:28:43.910 --> 03:28:43.920 align:start position:0%

there's a little bit more to it
 
03:29:04.870 --> 03:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
representative goalie the governor is
 
03:29:09.030 --> 03:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
very aware of ceremony and he can sign a
 
03:29:11.750 --> 03:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
bill with as much fanfare as he can make
 
03:29:14.710 --> 03:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
a proclamation the difference is that
 
03:29:16.710 --> 03:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
this shows it's not just the governor
 
03:29:19.429 --> 03:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
but the legislature's behind this
 
03:29:19.439 --> 03:29:20.790 align:start position:0%
but the legislature's behind this
so

03:29:20.790 --> 03:29:20.800 align:start position:0%

03:29:22.469 --> 03:29:22.479 align:start position:0%

03:29:24.950 --> 03:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
