00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
cameras and stuff are they going
 
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
okay well this is the work session on
 
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
hb 1258 which is the relative to the
 
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
implementation of the department of
 
00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 align:start position:0%
energy uh we have a new amendment which
 
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
everybody should have a copy of now
 
00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 align:start position:0%
and we know there's one thing that we
 
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
were going to put into this uh michael
 
00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 align:start position:0%
maybe you can help with this and that's
 
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh cats uh
 
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
that other bill to combine it in here so
 
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
we'll have to work that in that's simply
 
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
just to take something that was in a
 
00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
separate piece of legislation and
 
00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
eliminate that and put it in here
 
00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 align:start position:0%
because it has to do with the department
 
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
of energy anyways and we'll discuss that
 
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough it's it's 1285
 
00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 align:start position:0%
going into 1258 okay
 
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
so we'll discuss that one afterwards
 
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
what i'd like to do now is this will be
 
00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
a somewhat informal process i'd like to
 
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
ask the people from the department of
 
00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 align:start position:0%
energy because they're the ones who
 
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
wrote up the amendment basically to just
 
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
start from the beginning and go over
 
00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
what changes they made so if you want to
 
00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
come up to the table here and we'll take
 
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
good morning just excuse me a question
 
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
from chairman votes
 
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
does this amendment reflect
 
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
the document
 
00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 align:start position:0%
that we shared with ols
 
00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
yes sir it does
 
00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
um but there is
 
00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 align:start position:0%
one mistake in what i sent over to ols
 
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
so how would you like to proceed would
 
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
you like to just go through the
 
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment itself yeah i think we
 
00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:25.759 align:start position:0%
just start on the beginning of the
 
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
minute and go through and just some of
 
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
these are going to be fairly simple just
 
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
you know replaced uh
 
00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 align:start position:0%
puc with uh doe but others may have a
 
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
little bit more background that we want
 
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.749 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.270 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
section one of the bill
 
00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
or of the amendment
 
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
is identical to
 
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
what was in the bill as introduced there
 
00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
were no changes made in that section
 
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
in section two
 
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
part of the change
 
00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.189 align:start position:0%
part of the change
that

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.710 align:start position:0%
that
modified

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
modified
 
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
the bright red line
 
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
and which
 
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
made the department and automatic party
 
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
to proceedings before the public
 
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
okay to the on section two of of this i
 
00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
have a note here from
 
00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
this is having to do with i'm not sure
 
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
if this is the right place but it looks
 
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
like we're talking about the
 
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
rules here i guess it would be section
 
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.230 align:start position:0%
rules here i guess it would be section
three

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.270 align:start position:0%
three
and

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
there was talk of a five-year rule
 
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.469 align:start position:0%
there was talk of a five-year rule
review

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
review
 
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh that we discussed
 
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
in the last meeting but i don't see that
 
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
in the bill anywhere and that was to try
 
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
to clean up some of the stuff problems
 
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
we had identified from the past
 
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.510 align:start position:0%
we had identified from the past
and

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
my apologies i did not include that uh
 
00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
in what i provided to you for ols but
 
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
there's no objection to putting okay new
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
period in there come up with the best
 
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
place to put that in then yes okay
 
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
because we want to make sure i think
 
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
that's that that clears up another
 
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
problem that we so we don't have to pass
 
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
any additional legislation who's got the
 
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
i quit section two on page
 
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
four we're not there yet right
 
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
that one
 
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
just go through
 
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
go through them when we get to that i
 
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
have a real problem with that okay
 
00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 align:start position:0%
so anything else on page one
 
00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 align:start position:0%
uh i just have a question
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
um on section two i was just reading
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
through it as you were referring to it
 
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
um attorney and it says that any
 
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
confidential information in discovery or
 
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise should be provided to the
 
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.830 align:start position:0%
otherwise should be provided to the
department

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.670 align:start position:0%
department
um

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.110 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
if the department is already
 
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
a party
 
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.749 align:start position:0%
a party
to

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
an adjudicative proceeding then wouldn't
 
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
then would they normally
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
receive confidential information
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
sent to the puc
 
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
so what
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
when the current department staff which
 
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
appears now as a party before the puc
 
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
was at the commission they automatically
 
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
received confidential information
 
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
pursuant to puc rule
 
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.350 align:start position:0%
pursuant to puc rule
but

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
there there is no such rule and there is
 
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.390 align:start position:0%
there there is no such rule and there is
no

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
statute requiring the department
 
00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
employees to get that confidential
 
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
information so we've requested it in
 
00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
statute okay then so
 
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
and it is by statute that the
 
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
office of consumer advocate for instance
 
00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
gets confidential information and
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
so the department is simply asking for
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
that same type of provision in the
 
00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
statute so that there's no question
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
that they they're privy to any of
 
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
utilities confidential information so
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
that they can perform the functions of
 
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
their job so follow up i think that's i
 
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
tried to get at this question in the
 
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
last hearing and i believe
 
00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
chairman bose had something to say and
 
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
you didn't answer me
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
does this then present a problem in
 
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
taking those resources out of the public
 
00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:02.879 align:start position:0%
utilities commission and putting them in
 
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
an agency
 
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.270 align:start position:0%
an agency
where

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
they now have the same responsibility
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
but they're under different jurisdiction
 
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
in other words that that that's where
 
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.029 align:start position:0%
in other words that that that's where
the

00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
inconsistency in the statutes is coming
 
00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:17.919 align:start position:0%
from is that those resources
 
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
who who handle those things or had
 
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
handled those things
 
00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:23.919 align:start position:0%
are being asked to continue to handle
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
or you know in a different agency under
 
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
a different heading in terms of
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
organizational yeah i don't i don't
 
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
think that there's any problems so long
 
00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
as the rules are spelled out in the
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
statute which they are
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
okay and so that means that those folks
 
00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
will not be discussing the confidential
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
information that they receive with other
 
00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
people in doe that are not related to
 
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
their jobs or
 
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
okay yeah thank you is it safe to say
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
then what we're doing here is that the
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
we've transferred the
 
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
work function and the people to the
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
department of energy and so now we're
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
transferring the authority to see
 
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
confidential information to that same
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
group in a different department exactly
 
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
so they can perform their job like they
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.509 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:33.519 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
we discussed that in the context of
 
00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
placing a five-year period uh in that
 
00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
is it in there
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
anywhere the five years because i didn't
 
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
now we can move on to page two i guess
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
so no go ahead jackie i want to go back
 
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
to what you just said
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
about confidential information that
 
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
puc has i just want to clarify puc has
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
the ability and the right to get
 
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
confidential information when it's
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
discussing a case department of energy
 
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
has the right to get that information
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
if if i'm interpreting what you said
 
00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:27.750 align:start position:0%
if if i'm interpreting what you said
correctly

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.550 align:start position:0%
correctly
and

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
the consumer advocate has that right
 
00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
that's one heck of a chain of custody
 
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
with the way it was presently set up the
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
puc and the consumer advocate had it but
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
now that we've got the department of
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
energy we have to address that and what
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
this does is addresses that and allows
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
the department of energy to get that
 
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
confidential information and
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
and does that assume that the department
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
of energy is a party to any of those
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
adjudicative processes
 
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%
yes so under the current statute the
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
department is a party to any
 
00:11:05.829 --> 00:11:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
under the current statute
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
yes and and you did that without any
 
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.710 align:start position:0%
yes and and you did that without any
information

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
parties provided us with the
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
confidential information so that we
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
could do our job it just wasn't
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
specified in statute
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
but the utilities have been cooperative
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh so at the top of uh page four
 
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
um the three lines that are crossed out
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
are the pre or the fuzzy red line that
 
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
we'd like to make the bright red line on
 
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
lines four five and six you'll see here
 
00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.949 align:start position:0%
lines four five and six you'll see here
deleted

00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
line four line four page two yeah
 
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.629 align:start position:0%
line four line four page two yeah
yeah

00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:14.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:14.959 --> 00:12:17.829 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
this is this isn't new this was
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
something we had had in here before yeah
 
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.350 align:start position:0%
something we had had in here before yeah
right

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.790 align:start position:0%
right
so

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
i i actually think this is the language
 
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
that sort of relates to what i was
 
00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:33.519 align:start position:0%
getting at which says the stuff that's
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
crossed out starting at line three
 
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
provided that other than the
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
administrative functions department
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
employees shall not communicate with the
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission and its
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
staff in connection with any issue
 
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
in a matter pending before the
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
commission i mean why is that language
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
stricken because that's exactly what i
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
was asking um that language is actually
 
00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
replaced with other language which is on
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
page one
 
00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
and you'll find it on lines 19 and 20.
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
so that in adjudicative proceedings the
 
00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission and the
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
department are subject to a provision of
 
00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:06.949 align:start position:0%
department are subject to a provision of
541a

00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
541a
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
and that is a provision that prohibits
 
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
ex-parte contacts
 
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
with someone who's in a sort of a
 
00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:14.470 align:start position:0%
with someone who's in a sort of a
judicial

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
judicial
 
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.150 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
the language that you see on page two
 
00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:26.550 align:start position:0%
the language that you see on page two
um

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
is is broader than the language in the
 
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
administrative procedures act it is and
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
has proven to be somewhat problematic
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
because matters aren't defined it's not
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
limited to adjudicative proceedings
 
00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
um it would include probably rule
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
makings you know if push came to shove
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
and there's there's really no reason for
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
that we ought to be able to coordinate
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
our rule makings to make sure that we're
 
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
doing them correctly and
 
00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh dividing our responsibilities
 
00:13:57.279 --> 00:13:58.710 align:start position:0%
uh dividing our responsibilities
appropriately

00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.829 align:start position:0%
appropriately
um

00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:02.389 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
there was
 
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.710 align:start position:0%
there was
confusion

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.750 align:start position:0%
confusion
within

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
within
 
00:14:07.829 --> 00:14:07.839 align:start position:0%
the commission and the department and
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
among the relevant parties as to what
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
was administrative and what was not
 
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:12.790 align:start position:0%
was administrative and what was not
so

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
people were having difficult
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
difficulty communicating
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
with the clerk
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
at the puc and getting information out
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
it made participating in a docket quite
 
00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:25.509 align:start position:0%
it made participating in a docket quite
problematic

00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
but the language in
 
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.110 align:start position:0%
but the language in
541a

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
541a
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
is relatively well understood it's the
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
same language that any other
 
00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:34.710 align:start position:0%
same language that any other
uh

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
agency is is subjected to when they're
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
acting in a quasi-judicial capacity
 
00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
so that would eliminate the confusion
 
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
and allow the cooperation where it's
 
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.350 align:start position:0%
and allow the cooperation where it's
helpful

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
but it also kind of addresses the issue
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
that's been a concern over the years and
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
that's that when when the puc as it used
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
they had the staff and that was sort of
 
00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.310 align:start position:0%
they had the staff and that was sort of
like

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.470 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
bro there we go
 
00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
so but the the staff had direct access
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
to the commission where the utilities
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
didn't that was considered ex-part-time
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
so this sort of addresses that issue to
 
00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:24.629 align:start position:0%
so this sort of addresses that issue to
clarify

00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
when and where the uh
 
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
the staff whatever staff in this case
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
department of energy can have direct
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
access to the commissioners right and
 
00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:33.110 align:start position:0%
access to the commissioners right and
and

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:33.910 align:start position:0%
and
so

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
actually what when staff was at the
 
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.189 align:start position:0%
actually what when staff was at the
commission

00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:15:37.199 --> 00:15:39.189 align:start position:0%
commission
those

00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
and and commission staff was speaking
 
00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
with the commissioners that was not
 
00:15:42.639 --> 00:15:43.910 align:start position:0%
with the commissioners that was not
considered

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
ex parte under 541a right there was a
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
different provision that applied
 
00:15:49.519 --> 00:15:50.710 align:start position:0%
different provision that applied
to

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.430 align:start position:0%
to
uh

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
puc staff in an adjudication
 
00:15:54.399 --> 00:15:55.590 align:start position:0%
puc staff in an adjudication
um

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
that was eliminated in house bill 2.
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
but there was a special provision that
 
00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.389 align:start position:0%
but there was a special provision that
governed

00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
governed
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
the conversations between staff members
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
and and commissioners it's different
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
from the one cited here but the but the
 
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
con i'm sorry go ahead jackie you've had
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
your hand up a while i was just going to
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
say but the confusion is because we've
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
reorganized them so that their staff no
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
longer belongs to them
 
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
that's why this confusion right because
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
regulatory and executive branch are not
 
00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
the same yeah i think the confusion was
 
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
the language that was chosen on page two
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
the appropriate language in that
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
circumstance is the language in rsa541a
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
which was what we're asking you to
 
00:16:36.959 --> 00:16:38.389 align:start position:0%
which was what we're asking you to
substitute

00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
substitute
 
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
okay yeah thanks go ahead jackie
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
541a as as i thought i heard you say it
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
was that
 
00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.670 align:start position:0%
was that
it

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
did not allow ex part day communication
 
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's correct that's correct so now as
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
listening to this
 
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
with my
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
does this forbid
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
the puc
 
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.470 align:start position:0%
the puc
and

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
the department of energy from talking to
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
each other about confidential
 
00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:18.069 align:start position:0%
each other about confidential
information

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
and if it does why do they each need it
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
right that's just
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
is does that do that
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.789 align:start position:0%
 
utility

00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
some of the information that's provided
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
by utilities is
 
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
confidential by statute some of it is
 
00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.029 align:start position:0%
confidential by statute some of it is
confidential

00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
because it's really nobody's business
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
who their customers are by name or
 
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes by address right
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
and some of their internal financials
 
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
are confidential
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
when you do after you do the
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
the balancing that's required under 91a
 
00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:03.909 align:start position:0%
the balancing that's required under 91a
right

00:18:03.909 --> 00:18:03.919 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
but in order for everyone to perform
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
their job and regulate the utilities we
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
have to review that language or you know
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
that that information right
 
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.710 align:start position:0%
that that information right
um

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
and and so everybody has to have access
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
to it that doesn't mean
 
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.470 align:start position:0%
to it that doesn't mean
that

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.590 align:start position:0%
that
we're

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
talking to each other about it behind
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
the other party's backs that's what ex
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
parte means it means if you're going to
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
have a conversation about it about that
 
00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
information then that conversation has
 
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:32.630 align:start position:0%
information then that conversation has
to

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
occur in front of all of the parties to
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
the docket but that's different from who
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
has access to the information
 
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
that you would have the conversation
 
00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.630 align:start position:0%
that you would have the conversation
about

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
if that makes any sense yeah jackie
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
would be like for example let's just say
 
00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:47.919 align:start position:0%
there was a rate case and so the
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
department would be looking at that for
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
their what they think the appropriate
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
rate increase like should say should be
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
for a utility well in order to make that
 
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
decision in order to
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
build develop what their position is
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to need access to that
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
confidential information and obviously
 
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
so is the commissioners are going to
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
need it as well because they'll make the
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
final call on it but it doesn't mean
 
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
that the commissioners and the
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
department are going to be discussing
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
that information back and forth they're
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
just both going to have it so they can
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
both do their jobs so can i follow up
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
sure sure the follow-up would be then
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
it would be possible and i
 
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
again in my normal mind that the
 
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
department of energy and the public
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
utilities commission
 
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
could not come up with the same
 
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.150 align:start position:0%
could not come up with the same
conclusion

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
conclusion
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
and then what happens there well
 
00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
who then decides
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
quote unquote whose conclusion is
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
more in the public interest or more
 
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
correct and i'm not sure when you say
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
conclusion you mean conclusion of what's
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
confidential a conclusion of the
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
disposition of a rape case the
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
disposition of the red case that'll be
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
the puc they have the adjudicative
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
authority to do that and they'll put out
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
the decision the department of energy
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
would be you might be able to look at
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
him as if you know had a plain event or
 
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
defended i don't like to use those terms
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
but people can understand what i'm
 
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
they both make recommendations let's
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
just say utility x comes in and says
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
based on all of our experts in 10 days
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
of testimony and 55 500 pages or
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
whatever we think we should get a 3.8
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
rate increase the department of energy
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
looks at all the same thing and says no
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
we think it should only be a 3.3 percent
 
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
increase that's going to go to the
 
00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:33.039 align:start position:0%
commission and the commission will rule
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
they might rule one way or the other or
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
they may rule something different but
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
they have the final saying they have the
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
final say
 
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.870 align:start position:0%
final say
but

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
and again in my mind the way it's
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
working the department of energy has the
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
purse strings over the public utilities
 
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.470 align:start position:0%
purse strings over the public utilities
commission

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
well not really i i think their funding
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
is independent like from that they get a
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
the money comes in by formula you can
 
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
help me out here david but i'm pretty
 
00:20:59.110 --> 00:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
sure it just goes all into a bucket at
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
the department of energy and then by
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
fixed formula so much of that is given
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
to the puc so it's not a determination
 
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
of the department of energy correct the
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
budgets of the public utilities
 
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
commission the office of consumer
 
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
advocate and the department are
 
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.190 align:start position:0%
advocate and the department are
determined

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
determined
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
by the governor and the legislature
 
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
you decide
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
who gets how much money
 
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.470 align:start position:0%
who gets how much money
right

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
all the department does is collect it
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
and put it into the kitty to be
 
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.710 align:start position:0%
and put it into the kitty to be
distributed

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
right but it is the legislature and the
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
and you know each agency is responsible
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
for developing its own budget the
 
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.990 align:start position:0%
for developing its own budget the
department

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
you know provide some back office help
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
you know to those agencies to help them
 
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
put that stuff together but it's really
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
their budget they take it to the
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
move down the page then
 
00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.310 align:start position:0%
move down the page then
please

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
okay uh section five
 
00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.149 align:start position:0%
okay uh section five
um

00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
the deletion that you see that says the
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
division shall be an automatic party is
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
replaced by a sentence on page one that
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
says the department shall automatically
 
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
be a party right
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
no reason to make just one division
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
a party
 
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
because many of our divisions
 
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.870 align:start position:0%
because many of our divisions
participate

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh section six
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
um is the
 
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.789 align:start position:0%
um is the
um

00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
provision that we requested to extend
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
the life of the
 
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.350 align:start position:0%
the life of the
um

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh the pucs procedural rules
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
until we can get procedural rules in
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
place which should occur
 
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
section 7
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
this is identical to what was in the
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
bill is introduced and it essentially
 
00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
places replaces the commissioner of the
 
00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission with the
 
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department of energy
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh on page three
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
this changes some references in
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
the regi statute from the commission to
 
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
the department of energy that have to do
 
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
with developing a report to the
 
00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.310 align:start position:0%
with developing a report to the
legislature

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:27.919 align:start position:0%
it's the department that really develops
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
that report and this language just
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
reflects that
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
and just so we're clear here in this
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
section since we're dealing with i
 
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
assume it's 125.
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
when you say department you mean des
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
and then department of energy is
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
department of energy correct that's
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
this assumes that the legislative
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
oversight committee is not going to be
 
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
repealed as we have another bill pending
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:57.919 --> 00:23:59.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.510 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
at the end of last week as we were going
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
through 125.0 and doing this work we
 
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
found a few more
 
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
references that probably should be
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
changed which i will be floating to you
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
in an email
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
probably tomorrow i just need to make
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
sure i i need to discuss it with the
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission to make sure
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
they're on board with the changes that
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
we would
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
suggest making
 
00:24:24.559 --> 00:24:27.990 align:start position:0%
suggest making
um

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.510 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
before we leave this page i had a
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
question on
 
00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
uh section 10 we talked about for good
 
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
cause and after notice and hearing the
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
department of energy may accelerate a
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
delay up to one year okay this has taken
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
effect a couple of times now it's been
 
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
in effect for some of the wood plants or
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
whatever because they um
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
first of all it's only class one and
 
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:49.039 align:start position:0%
class two is that the way it is now
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
because i thought they did it for the
 
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
for the uh old wood burning plants
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
because we just don't have enough of
 
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
them running anymore i think um for the
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
class three plants it's a complete
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
change in the in the requirement it can
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
right it can um
 
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
that's covered someplace else which is
 
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:08.799 align:start position:0%
it is okay but on this one
 
00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
making that go to the department of
 
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
energy the reason i just want to bring
 
00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
this up and this is for everybody in the
 
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
commission the committee's input as well
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
is this could actually affect rates
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
because if you go out and you say
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
you have to have i'm just making up
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
members it has to be 10 of your energy
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
has to be from solar and you change that
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
to 5
 
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
or you change that to 15
 
00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.390 align:start position:0%
or you change that to 15
um

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
that means the utility has to go up and
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
buy more or less wrecks which is going
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
to change rates
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
so should that be done by the department
 
00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
of energy or should the
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
and i put this as a question or the puc
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
should just take that as an input and
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
say because this has changed it's gone
 
00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:48.559 align:start position:0%
down now the rate should go down
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
accordingly or because it's gone up the
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
rate should go up accordingly well i
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
i think this
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
is appropriately at the department
 
00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.789 align:start position:0%
is appropriately at the department
right

00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.799 --> 00:26:01.830 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
might decide what the rate change
 
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
actually is
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
what the department would be deciding is
 
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
whether there's good cause
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
to change a programmatic feature okay so
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
move the percentages one way or the
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
other okay i just wanted to make sure
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
people understood that that's a that's
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
sort of a change because it's
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
reggie is sort of with the department of
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
energy but in this case it'll directly
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
affect i mean the rps but it'll directly
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
it could directly affect rights if that
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
was changed right
 
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
mr shillock can you just give me an idea
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
what what the interpretation of a good
 
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
cause is
 
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
i understand that it says for a good
 
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
cause and after hearings and so forth
 
00:26:44.799 --> 00:26:46.390 align:start position:0%
cause and after hearings and so forth
but

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:48.559 align:start position:0%
what are typical good causes where you
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
can you just make up any cause you want
 
00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
well i would suspect that the types of
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
causes that
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
people would
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
say for some reason there there were
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
numerous retirements
 
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.029 align:start position:0%
numerous retirements
uh

00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
that that would affect the supply of
 
00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:13.909 align:start position:0%
that that would affect the supply of
wrecks

00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
wrecks
 
00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:14.710 align:start position:0%
wrecks
right

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.870 align:start position:0%
right
and

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
trying to think i think
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
we had a situation something like that
 
00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.389 align:start position:0%
we had a situation something like that
when

00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
steam plants here in town
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
stopped burning
 
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.070 align:start position:0%
stopped burning
right

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
stopped burning wood
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
um and so there was going to be a
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
shortage in one of the areas and that
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
that was good cause i believe at the
 
00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
time to to delay and increase
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
i mean not only was there a shortage it
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
was a permanent one right and there's
 
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
nothing we could really do about it in
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
the short term but to be quite honest
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
with you peter that's a great question
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
but i can remember when this was being
 
00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
debated i think i was at the commission
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:52.870 align:start position:0%
at the time
and

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
that was the best words we could come up
 
00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
with that was so it's it's they're not
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
perfect but if you can kept up with
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
better ones let me know
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
so uh section 11 was a request of the
 
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission to change
 
00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
the requirements of what needed to be
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
described in their final orders
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
and it removes the requirement that um
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
state the position of each party on each
 
00:28:22.159 --> 00:28:23.190 align:start position:0%
state the position of each party on each
issue

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
it doesn't prohibit them from doing that
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't require it in every
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
order and just so people are clear the
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
the the entire history of those
 
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
positions is there in it you can look up
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
a docket and you'll find the filing of
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
eversource the filing of unitil or
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
whatever and it'll give their complete
 
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
position what's been done in the past is
 
00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
then in the order that the puc puts out
 
00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
they will summarize that position of the
 
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
various parties and put it in their
 
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
order it really has no legal bearing
 
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
because it's just saying this is this is
 
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
our interpretation of their opinion of
 
00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
what these what they submitted so what
 
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
they actually submitted is still there
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
open to the public and everybody can
 
00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:03.039 align:start position:0%
read it so um can i ask what the
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
exemption in rsa 541 a29 and rsa 541
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
a29a are
 
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
because it's saying except for those
 
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0%
and i don't think we unders you know we
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
probably don't know what those are that
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
are being exempted
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
page three yes i'm sorry yeah page yep
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
so we're on page two again bottom of
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
page three very
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
final orders is what i'm referring to
 
00:29:32.669 --> 00:29:32.679 align:start position:0%
okay so um rsa
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
541a29 has been around for a while and
 
00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
that is a provision that requires an
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
agency when it receives an application
 
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
or a request
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
it requires within a certain amount of
 
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
time that the agency identify the person
 
00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
who's handling that request
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
and that the
 
00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:55.039 align:start position:0%
agency state
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know what is missing you know in
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
terms of information from the request
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
what what is unclear
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh etc that timeline
 
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh used to be 60 days
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
and then it requires action
 
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.389 align:start position:0%
and then it requires action
on

00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:19.029 --> 00:30:19.039 align:start position:0%
it used to be 120 days
 
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
a few years ago that was changed
 
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
to 30 days
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
and 60 days
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise the agency had to open an
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceeding
 
00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.190 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceeding
right

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
also just a few years ago rsa 29
 
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
the 29a section was added and that
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
section states that you know unless
 
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
there's some other
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
timeline specified to the contrary um if
 
00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
the agency fails to meet the timelines
 
00:30:48.399 --> 00:30:49.430 align:start position:0%
the agency fails to meet the timelines
in

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
29 then the application or request is
 
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
automatically granted
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
as a matter of law
 
00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.750 align:start position:0%
as a matter of law
right

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.230 align:start position:0%
right
and

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh the pc that a means of enforcement
 
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:11.669 align:start position:0%
uh the pc that a means of enforcement
really

00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:13.519 align:start position:0%
it's a means of it's trying trying to
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
to prevent long delays the problem with
 
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
the puc is there's been a number of
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
times when they actually get filings
 
00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
from individuals or small groups of
 
00:31:25.039 --> 00:31:25.990 align:start position:0%
from individuals or small groups of
people

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
and uh you know i'm sure david can
 
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
give you more about this
 
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
it's just totally incomplete it's you
 
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
have to you almost have to walk them
 
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
through the process and say you didn't
 
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
do this you didn't do that and then
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
they'll refile and go on some of these
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
things we had a case i'm always wearing
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
one in bedford for the individual
 
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
household who said we were selling them
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
bad they was getting sold bad
 
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
electricity whatever the hell that means
 
00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
but uh and that went on for i don't know
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
two or three years i think before it was
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
finally settled so this just allows the
 
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh people to work with the um
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
especially private individuals where
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
with the utilities they have their own
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
lawyers and everything and it doesn't
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
i've never seen it as being an issue for
 
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
those well i i mean i think some of the
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
language before this addresses that
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
though it says you know that that um the
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
agency when they receive a request
 
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
they're required to assess define and
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
define what's missing within a certain
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
period of time right so if they've
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
defined that an application comes in
 
00:32:17.679 --> 00:32:18.470 align:start position:0%
defined that an application comes in
that's

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
problematic or you know even if they
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
can't secure the information right if
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
they've reached out to the parties that
 
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
are responsible for that incomplete
 
00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.750 align:start position:0%
are responsible for that incomplete
information

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
they would have met their requirement
 
00:32:30.789 --> 00:32:30.799 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be have it waived i mean
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
i just i'm just trying to figure out
 
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
whether this makes things better or
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
worse you're not waiving that
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
requirement but when you send it back
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
out to them then it could be a month or
 
00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
two before they respond and then that
 
00:32:42.549 --> 00:32:42.559 align:start position:0%
deadline for finally the final decision
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
would have passed and that's that's the
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
reason they allowed okay yeah i think
 
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
it's almost always people that are
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
filing is a you know they don't have the
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
legal skills because they're not a
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
utility with a staff a lawyer so yeah
 
00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:53.990 align:start position:0%
utility with a staff a lawyer so yeah
okay

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.190 align:start position:0%
okay
and

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
and the agencies were never staffed to
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
handle those types of timelines right it
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
was difficult even with the 120 days the
 
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
60 days it was nearly impossible
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
so for instance when the consumer
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
affairs division was at the puc they got
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
10 000 contacts a year yeah among five
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
people right right and so just
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
and you know the types of requests that
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
would come in
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
often required a lot of hand-holding
 
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
right yeah uh with with uh individual
 
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
rate payers and
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of escalating with the utilities
 
00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.190 align:start position:0%
a lot of escalating with the utilities
and

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
not really possible to do it within
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
those timelines and and most of the
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
requests weren't really
 
00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
suitable for automatic grant
 
00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
right they would be problematic if you
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
just automatically granted the request
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
that came in from the consumers
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
go ahead jackie
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
does any of this encompass the site
 
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
no no
 
00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:57.909 align:start position:0%
no no
no

00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:59.310 --> 00:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
but the site
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
hanging out here by the department of
 
00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.430 align:start position:0%
hanging out here by the department of
energy

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
so the the site evaluation committee is
 
00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:12.079 align:start position:0%
an independent committee
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
right made up made up of representatives
 
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
from different
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
agencies at the state
 
00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
it's only
 
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the
 
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.550 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the
department

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
the department doesn't even have a
 
00:34:24.079 --> 00:34:25.270 align:start position:0%
the department doesn't even have a
member

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
member
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
on on the sec
 
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.069 align:start position:0%
on on the sec
right

00:34:28.069 --> 00:34:28.079 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
and there is a major uh
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
amendment a change to that coming out
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
coming from the senate side
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
michael is that past the senate do you
 
00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.149 align:start position:0%
michael is that past the senate do you
know

00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
okay but it's it's over there anyways
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
yeah at this point all we would do is
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
provide some back office support to the
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
uh committee
 
00:34:49.829 --> 00:34:49.839 align:start position:0%
so the rest of these on page four unless
 
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
someone has another question looked like
 
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
just changing commission to department
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
of energy
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
to make two pages
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:34:58.079 --> 00:35:02.950 align:start position:0%
is that correct
so

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
i don't see any policy changes other
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
than they just right place
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
commissioned with the department of
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
energy that's correct and that's just um
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the department is able
 
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
to collect the assessment and distribute
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
mr harrington sure go ahead
 
00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.990 align:start position:0%
mr harrington sure go ahead
section

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
section two on page four
 
00:35:27.119 --> 00:35:29.030 align:start position:0%
section two on page four
um

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
that concerned me because we had given
 
00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:32.870 align:start position:0%
that concerned me because we had given
up

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.790 align:start position:0%
up
all

00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.829 align:start position:0%
all
control

00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
over communications and we're still
 
00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.670 align:start position:0%
over communications and we're still
assessing

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
assessing
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
and we're still getting reports and
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
we're still
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
requiring things of them that we no
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
longer have any
 
00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over and i wonder why
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
that happened years ago when
 
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
nato cain was the chair
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
and we wondered if that was a good idea
 
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
and then we heard that the assessment on
 
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
the communications
 
00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.069 align:start position:0%
the communications
here

00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
one of the testimonies was it had
 
00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.109 align:start position:0%
one of the testimonies was it had
doubled

00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
doubled
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
and i wondered why when
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
we don't have any
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
so the assessment statute was revised
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
when the legislature reduced the
 
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
regulation of telephone companies right
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
um and they went from a full asses
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
100 uh
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
100 assessment on their revenues to a
 
00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.230 align:start position:0%
100 assessment on their revenues to a
third

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
third
 
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.230 align:start position:0%
third
right

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.030 align:start position:0%
right
so

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
their assessments were reduced
 
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
considerably at that point
 
00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.870 align:start position:0%
considerably at that point
um

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
and the changes that you see here which
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
just refer to the collection don't don't
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
affect the level or amount of their
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
assessment the the changes on page four
 
00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
are really
 
00:36:59.430 --> 00:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
just mechanical
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
that they don't go to the level
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
um of the assessment or how much a
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
telecommunications company might owe
 
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
this is just the mechanics of the
 
00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.349 align:start position:0%
this is just the mechanics of the
collection

00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
collection
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
and if you get down the road that may be
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
an issue worth pursuing because it was
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
kind of hanging from when the telephone
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
deregulation remember it wasn't
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
completely because basic service is
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
still covered but it's a separate issue
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
from this this is just as david said if
 
00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
this is just saying commission goes to
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
department of energy and it's not making
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
an opinion on those assessments but it's
 
00:37:34.829 --> 00:37:34.839 align:start position:0%
possibly something for future
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
legislation but they're still collecting
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
those revenues and and as we heard here
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
they're doubling and that just
 
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
my point is it's just it's not really
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
within the scope of what we're trying to
 
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
accomplish in this bill it's
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying something we shouldn't
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
look at but that would be something we
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
might want to look at in the future and
 
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
not try to get it in here because we
 
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
start getting to that level we'll still
 
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
be here three months from now working on
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i actually have
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
a question at the top of page four
 
00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
on the section on final order shall
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
include but not be limited to
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
and it looks like
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
two three and
 
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
uh or
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
they were items two three and four now
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
they're uh two three and three are
 
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
have been xed out one way or another and
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
so all the final order needs to include
 
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
is the identity of all the parties
 
00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm actually concerned with
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
eliminating the concurrence or dissent
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
of each of the commissioners
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
participating in the decision because
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
those haven't been eliminated i mean
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
maybe it's just the way that every
 
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
number yeah
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay so three is two and three is two
 
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
and four is three yeah there is no there
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
is no yeah so this should be
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
that the two should be pushed down if
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
you will next line i got you okay so you
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
left the two but switch okay the only
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
thing was taken out was the position of
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
sorry on to page five then right so um
 
00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.589 align:start position:0%
sorry on to page five then right so um
section

00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:39:07.599 --> 00:39:14.790 align:start position:0%
section
15.

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh section 15 deals with rsa 363 b
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
and these changes are made to
 
00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.310 align:start position:0%
and these changes are made to
clarify

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
that it is the department of energy that
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
would review terminations and uh
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
terminations of service and
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
disconnections of service
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
all the staff that that does that work
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
is now located at the department not at
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
well i just want your question if
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
they're part of an agency though
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
then are they still going to have the
 
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:55.839 align:start position:0%
same kind of independence to make those
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
decisions because it seems like
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
politics can infiltrate there in terms
 
00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:02.079 align:start position:0%
of what those decisions are
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
are those people going to be
 
00:40:04.079 --> 00:40:06.069 align:start position:0%
are those people going to be
uninhibited

00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
uninhibited
 
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
in a role within an agency uh no the the
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
disconnections and terminations are
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
governed by rule
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
right so they're they're highly
 
00:40:15.119 --> 00:40:16.309 align:start position:0%
right so they're they're highly
structured

00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
structured
 
00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
and the um
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
all of the detail work is conducted by
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
those people in the consumer division
 
00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:23.990 align:start position:0%
those people in the consumer division
right

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
and you know there's a whole long
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
process for contacting and setting up
 
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
mediations with the company etc and then
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
when it comes to terminations of service
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
especially for medical disconnections
 
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
utilities have to
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that they've provided all
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
the proper notice and gone and knocked
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
on doors etc and all of that's
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
controlled by rule uh so very highly
 
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
structured yeah i do i do understand but
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
we just had an issue with energy
 
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
efficiency which was similarly well
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
defined in process
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
um in terms of how this it would be
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
approached and how it would be reviewed
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
and how it would be administered through
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
the puc and it
 
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't help right
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
the the rules on the disconnection are
 
00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:07.839 align:start position:0%
pretty long and detailed uh some of
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
which go back to
 
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure if you were here then
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
david's probably 10
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
it was one of the utilities that's no
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
longer in the state but they had a
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
person die okay it was
 
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
enough and it was
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
june 21st 2010. okay
 
00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
and that they died when they
 
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
disconnected and after that there was a
 
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
big redo of it and there's all sorts of
 
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
rules but you can't disconnect in the
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
wintertime and you have to go out like
 
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
in person i think it's in-person contact
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
with anybody that's on a medical device
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
that registers and now i you probably
 
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
noticed you started getting phone calls
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
from the utilities saying we could have
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
a power outage be aware if you're
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
someone on a medical device so forth and
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
so on so i think that's pretty well
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
structured uh structured yeah
 
00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
that was a major waking up point when
 
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
good memory david by the way well
 
00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
some things are hard to forget
 
00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.190 align:start position:0%
some things are hard to forget
so

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.829 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
so section 16.
 
00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:13.910 align:start position:0%
so section 16.
um

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
this differs from what was in
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
the bill is introduced the bill is
 
00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
introduced would have limited
 
00:42:20.319 --> 00:42:22.790 align:start position:0%
introduced would have limited
the

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
investigations that could be transferred
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
to the puc for adjudication to just
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
violations by utilities that limitation
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
has been taken out here
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
new language
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
was inserted here
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
to clarify
 
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
what would happen to a complaint filed
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
at the department that the department
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
didn't think should be transferred to
 
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
the puc and it the new language allows
 
00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
the party
 
00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh itself to to take the complaint to
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
the puc to perhaps get a hearing
 
00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
okay that resolved one of our major
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
issues that we were discussing i've had
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
a big note about that so that's a big
 
00:43:05.589 --> 00:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
improvement i think it's it does give
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
that adjudicative process we had
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
discussed going to the supreme court was
 
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
the next movement we didn't want to do
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
it that way so this is this i think is
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
an improvement that everyone had agreed
 
00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:18.790 align:start position:0%
an improvement that everyone had agreed
to

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
so then page beginning on page six these
 
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
are changes to the
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh crossing statute
 
00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.829 align:start position:0%
uh crossing statute
right

00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
the state gives utilities and companies
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
that provide utility type services
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
licenses to cross state land and state
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
that procedure was fully adjudicative
 
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
prior to the reorganization
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
and it was all adjudicated at the public
 
00:43:59.670 --> 00:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
utilities commission
 
00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
there were very very very very very few
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
hearings on on those licensings
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
would issue
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
what would would take the license
 
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
application review it
 
00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:18.550 align:start position:0%
application review it
and

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
normally grant the license by an order
 
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
nice eye and give people the opportunity
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:27.359 --> 00:44:28.309 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:28.319 --> 00:44:29.270 align:start position:0%
and
in

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:32.079 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of those cases nobody
 
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
ever requested a hearing
 
00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
the commission would when a crossing
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
appeared to be
 
00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.950 align:start position:0%
appeared to be
controversial

00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
controversial
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
have the utility publish it in the
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
to give the public notice that somebody
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
had even applied for the crossing and
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
even then very few people would come in
 
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:55.349 align:start position:0%
even then very few people would come in
and

00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
house bill 2
 
00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:05.349 align:start position:0%
house bill 2
divided

00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
divided
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
that process in two
 
00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
and said that whenever all the parties
 
00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:11.430 align:start position:0%
and said that whenever all the parties
agreed

00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
the department could issue the license
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
right and then allowed for a hearing
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
before the puc
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
um if
 
00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.950 align:start position:0%
um if
the

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh if the parties disagreed right the
 
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
the problem was there was no way to
 
00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
determine who the parties were unless
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
you opened up an adjudication so we
 
00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
ended up with two adjudications one on
 
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
the department side and one on the
 
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
commission side and that first
 
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
adjudication is really sort of
 
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
unnecessary right so what this statute
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
revision does is it asks
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
to to make
 
00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:48.390 align:start position:0%
to to make
the

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
the proceedings before the department
 
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
um fully administrative
 
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
right so the the
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
application would come into the
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
department the department would review
 
00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
it would grant or deny
 
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
the license
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
a publication would be made so that the
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
world would know that a license was
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
granted and people would be given an
 
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to request a hearing if they
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
wanted one which sort of mimics what the
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission was doing
 
00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
all along that first part was more or
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
less administrative they would publish
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
the order nice eye and give people the
 
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to request to hearing this
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
this sort of
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
follows that model a little bit more
 
00:46:29.599 --> 00:46:31.030 align:start position:0%
follows that model a little bit more
closely

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
closely
 
00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:32.870 align:start position:0%
closely
um

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
yeah just david if i just interject with
 
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
what he's saying is 100 these things
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
used to show up these order nice size
 
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
you'd get them on friday morning you'd
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
pick them up they'd be like two or three
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
pages you'd spend 15 minutes reading
 
00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
them and you'd sign the order in a way
 
00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
it would go there was no hearings there
 
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
was no debate because they were all
 
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
totally routine so doing
 
00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:54.079 align:start position:0%
administratively is should be no problem
 
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
especially if there is an option to
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
appeal to the puc so i think jackie had
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
her hand at first then
 
00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
that's a quick question okay collect
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
questions take priority questions what's
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
nice i
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh without you
 
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's without a hearing and with
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to request one essentially
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
please spell nice n-i-s-i
 
00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.270 align:start position:0%
please spell nice n-i-s-i
yeah

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
it's probably some latin words i'm
 
00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.309 align:start position:0%
it's probably some latin words i'm
guessing

00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
guessing
 
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
anyways go ahead jackie i was listening
 
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
or trying to listen carefully to what
 
00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
you were saying mr shulock
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
and it sounded to me like first you
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
issue the license then you get the
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
hearing and so then if
 
00:47:35.589 --> 00:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
if you haven't a problem
 
00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:38.079 align:start position:0%
or if there's a major problem with that
 
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
license or
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
con contestation
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
then you would remove the license or
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
deny it it it just seemed like
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
right so under the order nice i process
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
yeah person had the opportunity to file
 
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
comments and an objection and request a
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
hearing and if after the hearing
 
00:47:57.119 --> 00:47:58.069 align:start position:0%
hearing and if after the hearing
the

00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
commission believed that the license
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be granted the license would
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
never go into effect
 
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:04.870 align:start position:0%
never go into effect
right

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
they would pull back their order
 
00:48:08.079 --> 00:48:09.750 align:start position:0%
they would pull back their order
right

00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
he's actually under the new process how
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
would that work under the new process
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
the license would be granted publication
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
would be made
 
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
and at that point people could request a
 
00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:20.630 align:start position:0%
and at that point people could request a
hearing

00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
when they request the hearing if the
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
puc disagrees and thinks that the
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
license should not have been issued
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
they can
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
order the the department to pull the
 
00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:32.309 align:start position:0%
order the the department to pull the
license

00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
clunky yeah i have a question
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:42.390 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank you for taking my
question

00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.230 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.109 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:47.599 align:start position:0%
this is licenses for new polls and i'm
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
i'm curious how this would be affected
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
with the 5g
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
technology that's pending because we've
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
had you know numerous hearings on
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
the frequency
 
00:48:57.839 --> 00:48:58.950 align:start position:0%
the frequency
of

00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
additional polls that will be needed to
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
support that new technology
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
so i'm just wondering is this is this
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
the kind of thing where a large-scale
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
project of that sort could be approved
 
00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
by the department of energy
 
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
um second part of the question is and
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
how long do people have to file if they
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
would like to have it heard at the puc
 
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
is there a window there that because
 
00:49:19.829 --> 00:49:19.839 align:start position:0%
oftentimes the public isn't aware that
 
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
something's been granted so okay so i
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
can help out here i think the key thing
 
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
is on this paragraph is that that any
 
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
public utility should construct pipeline
 
00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
cable conduit a line of poles towers so
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
forth the cell companies aren't public
 
00:49:34.079 --> 00:49:35.670 align:start position:0%
forth the cell companies aren't public
utilities

00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
so i don't think this paragraph applies
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
to them one way or the other um
 
00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:42.829 align:start position:0%
to them one way or the other um
so

00:49:42.829 --> 00:49:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
the 5g facilities
 
00:49:48.549 --> 00:49:48.559 align:start position:0%
might be attached to a utility structure
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
so it might apply then and then the
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
statute also reply applies to
 
00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.990 align:start position:0%
statute also reply applies to
corporations

00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
corporations
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
that want to cross and and they they
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
do the same application and get the same
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
type of license that the utility would
 
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
so it's not just
 
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
not just utility public utilities
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
but you know this this
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
would only be for a small portion this
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
you know if they needed to cross a state
 
00:50:15.839 --> 00:50:17.109 align:start position:0%
you know if they needed to cross a state
park

00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
park
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
right so it would only be for that
 
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
portion it wouldn't be for the entire
 
00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.670 align:start position:0%
portion it wouldn't be for the entire
project

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
right okay so just this is just state
 
00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
land state waters as it states okay
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
it's hard to
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
one of the other big differences between
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
what's being proposed here and
 
00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839 align:start position:0%
the statute as it currently exists is
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
the current statute has a number of
 
00:50:45.599 --> 00:50:47.190 align:start position:0%
the current statute has a number of
exemptions

00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:47.990 align:start position:0%
exemptions
or

00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
licenses by notification
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
the time period for some of those for
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
the licenses by notification has sort of
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
expired there was an original two-year
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
time period in the statute for that
 
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.190 align:start position:0%
time period in the statute for that
um

00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
so that that's been eliminated um there
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
was an exemption
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
from licensing for the crossing of state
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
lands for the purposes of serving the
 
00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:11.829 align:start position:0%
lands for the purposes of serving the
state

00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:51:11.839 --> 00:51:12.630 align:start position:0%
state
right

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
um that this would do away with all the
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
exemptions and the notifications
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
and require everybody to obtain a
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
license and for every crossing to be
 
00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the department for at least
 
00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.589 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the department for at least
safety

00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:51:25.599 --> 00:51:27.750 align:start position:0%
safety
right

00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
and the idea is that rather than having
 
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
exemptions or
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
such in the statute the department's
 
00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
would apply the level of scrutiny
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
required for each type of crossing
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
right rather than just saying you're
 
00:51:50.559 --> 00:51:51.670 align:start position:0%
right rather than just saying you're
exempt

00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
exempt
 
00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:57.349 align:start position:0%
exempt
right

00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:57.359 --> 00:52:00.309 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
age seven i see almost no change one it
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
says the commission down the bottom up
 
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
on line 33 right
 
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
down to line 27 that's all part of the
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
crossing statute that we just discussed
 
00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:17.510 align:start position:0%
crossing statute that we just discussed
right

00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:26.309 align:start position:0%
right
then

00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:26.319 --> 00:52:27.109 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
section 19 uh is as it appeared in the
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
bill is introduced there are no changes
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
there that you that we asked for
 
00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:39.910 align:start position:0%
there that you that we asked for
okay

00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
so on to page 8. same for section 20 at
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
this has to do with the attachments
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh statute the poll attachment statute
 
00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:03.030 align:start position:0%
uh statute the poll attachment statute
and

00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
there was some back and forth about
 
00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:05.670 align:start position:0%
there was some back and forth about
which

00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
agency should retain its authority over
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
safety and vegetation management and
 
00:53:12.309 --> 00:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
having discussed this with the public
 
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
utilities commission
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
we think it should be both agencies
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
retaining that authority because we each
 
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
have a little in different areas
 
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
this is section 21
 
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
section 21 starting on line eight page
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
eight yeah uh i actually don't
 
00:53:31.829 --> 00:53:31.839 align:start position:0%
understand what happened up up above
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
that on line one
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
because the public good i thought was
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
part of the public utilities commission
 
00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:38.630 align:start position:0%
part of the public utilities commission
charge

00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
charge
 
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
and all those factors that are being
 
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
considered there seem like they would be
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
with the utilities commission not with
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
the department of energy so i'm
 
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
questioning that yeah so the the public
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
good is just a standard
 
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
it says nothing about who would
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
apply it
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:00.309 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
the bulk of this statute to which this
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
supplies is
 
00:54:04.079 --> 00:54:05.990 align:start position:0%
supplies is
um

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
within the department of energy's
 
00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and
 
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
i think you can look at
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
the change on page one is just an
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
oversight when when they were moving
 
00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
question i automatically have when you
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
have two agents is in charge of the same
 
00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:27.990 align:start position:0%
have two agents is in charge of the same
thing

00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
how do you work it out when there's
 
00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
maybe some differences of opinion right
 
00:54:33.839 --> 00:54:39.270 align:start position:0%
maybe some differences of opinion right
um

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
i guess that remains to be seen
 
00:54:41.359 --> 00:54:42.549 align:start position:0%
i guess that remains to be seen
right

00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
i didn't specifically ask this of the
 
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
utilities and the ones that were here
 
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
said that they could live with this
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
wording uh because i have the same note
 
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
down as fred is that you know when you
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
have two agencies what we don't want to
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
do is have uh
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
well you know the commission said i
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
should do this and i did it and then the
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
department says no no no you need to do
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
something else so all i can say is this
 
00:55:05.109 --> 00:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
one uh we'll be watching close
 
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
and if this doesn't work we'll have to
 
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
make some adjustments in the future but
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
i don't know i'm willing to say give it
 
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
a shot because the utilities didn't
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
object how does the rest of the
 
00:55:17.589 --> 00:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:19.109 --> 00:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead fred
 
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
i could see something like uh what
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
happened before that uh
 
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
department of energy has the
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
responsibility but if somebody doesn't
 
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
agree they could go to the puc for
 
00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:34.150 align:start position:0%
agree they could go to the puc for
adjudication

00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
this provision uh on line eight
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually say
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
who has what authority
 
00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
that's not the purpose of this paragraph
 
00:55:48.309 --> 00:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
so this is in the poll attachment
 
00:55:48.319 --> 00:55:50.789 align:start position:0%
so this is in the poll attachment
paragraph

00:55:50.789 --> 00:55:50.799 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
which allows utilities
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
to contract
 
00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
with other companies about
 
00:55:59.430 --> 00:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
what they will attach to their polls and
 
00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:00.470 align:start position:0%
what they will attach to their polls and
how

00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:01.349 align:start position:0%
how
right

00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
um and what they'll pay for that right
 
00:56:07.349 --> 00:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
um all that this paragraph says is that
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
the utilities can't contract away the
 
00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:11.839 align:start position:0%
state's ability to regulate
 
00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
by contracting right that's the purpose
 
00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
of this paragraph and so to the extent
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
that the puc or the department have any
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
authority over
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
vegetation management which they do or
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
safety which they do the utilities can't
 
00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
bargain that away in a poll attachment
 
00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:29.589 align:start position:0%
bargain that away in a poll attachment
agreement

00:56:29.589 --> 00:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
thank you but that doesn't eliminate
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
potential for conflict
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
oh no i think you're absolutely right
 
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
about that right
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh one other question just on one
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
wording on line nine
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
where it talks about the department of
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
energy and the public utilities
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
commission shall retain their authority
 
00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.109 align:start position:0%
commission shall retain their authority
well

00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
the department of energy never had any
 
00:56:54.789 --> 00:56:54.799 align:start position:0%
authority so they can't retain it so
 
00:56:56.309 --> 00:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a little bit more correct to
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
say the department of energy and the
 
00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
public utilities shall have the
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
because they're not the public
 
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
department energy is not retaining
 
00:57:10.789 --> 00:57:10.799 align:start position:0%
anything because it didn't have anything
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
to retain well
 
00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
at the time that this gets enacted
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
or if you're looking at it in the
 
00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
context of
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
the utility just bargained for something
 
00:57:27.599 --> 00:57:28.470 align:start position:0%
the utility just bargained for something
but

00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
even when they bargain tomorrow
 
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
the department is going to retain
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
whatever authority it has
 
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
overseas it's not that big of a deal
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
right if you think it's okay the way it
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
is but i i will get back i don't think i
 
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
would change it to us
 
00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
i don't think i would change it to a
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
statute that actually says that both
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
have authority over these two things
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
that's the problem that i think we're
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
trying to get away from i would just
 
00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
like to ask the members of the
 
00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee though is i mean fred has a
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
a valid point we have two
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know possibly conflict conflicting
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
even though we know they're a big happy
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
family now um is that something we want
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
to go forward with and see how it works
 
00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
or do we want to say like what fred
 
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
proposed having
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
one have initial authority and one have
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
appellate authority and i'm just because
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
i mean this is a question that's going
 
00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
to have to come up so what do people
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
think because when we just go around the
 
00:58:18.559 --> 00:58:23.030 align:start position:0%
think because when we just go around the
room

00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
i actually prefer it being left just the
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
i would prefer that the
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
public utilities retain the authority
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
when we say retain when they would have
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
the appellate authority and the
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
department of energy would have the
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
initial review no that that the
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
department of energy be left out of that
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
because there's a pending sale of polls
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
going on too so i think that public
 
00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:55.670 align:start position:0%
going on too so i think that public
utilities

00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
is where this belongs okay
 
00:58:58.319 --> 00:58:59.589 align:start position:0%
is where this belongs okay
jackie

00:58:59.589 --> 00:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
jackie
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
the kate i mean
 
00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:03.670 align:start position:0%
the kate i mean
pat

00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
pat
 
00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:05.109 align:start position:0%
pat
oh

00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:59:07.829 --> 00:59:07.839 align:start position:0%
yeah no i i actually agree that i still
 
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
think it's it's with the public
 
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
utilities and
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
i think that where the confusion comes
 
00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
in is that many of the resources that
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
are making some of these determinations
 
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
and have the expertise are from the
 
00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
public utilities staff who are now
 
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
residing in the department of energy and
 
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
so it's just made it more confusing
 
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
as to how these these things get
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
accomplished but i think
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission has a
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
separate uh
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
mission and i i do think that these
 
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
pieces are regulatory in nature and
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:43.670 align:start position:0%
 
michael

00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
michael
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
you're here you may as well get your
 
00:59:44.799 --> 00:59:48.710 align:start position:0%
you're here you may as well get your
opinion

00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
page eight
 
00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
yeah yes
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
turn on your microphone
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
yeah should it be sorry this this
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
basically way it's set up now is it the
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
department and the commission both have
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
equal authority
 
01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:02.470 align:start position:0%
equal authority
uh

01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
fred had raised the question of
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
is that going to cause problems because
 
01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
you have two departments and none of
 
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
them has the final say
 
01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.630 align:start position:0%
them has the final say
so

01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
what jackie had suggested is just get
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
the department of energy out of it but
 
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
as k cat is brought up the problem is a
 
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
lot of the people that have the
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
expertise are now with the department of
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
energy so i think eliminating them
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
completely would be difficult
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
fred suggests the possibility of the
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
initial approval going through the
 
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
department initial review going through
 
01:00:31.109 --> 01:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
the department of energy and then if
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
there was an appeal to that it would go
 
01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
to the public utilities commission for
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
final uh well my question would be why
 
01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.750 align:start position:0%
final uh well my question would be why
did

01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
why was it suggested by the department
 
01:00:43.589 --> 01:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
of energy that the public utilities
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
commission shall be
 
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
added to the statute because apparently
 
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
it wasn't there before
 
01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
so the current statute says that it's
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
the department that shall retain its
 
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
authority and the reason for that is
 
01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%
i mean it is the context of the statute
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
itself this statute only deals with
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
attachments to polls
 
01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:06.150 align:start position:0%
attachments to polls
right

01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:07.270 align:start position:0%
right
and

01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
in the context of that statute utilities
 
01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
enter into agreements with people who
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
want to attach
 
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
and they can put all kinds of provisions
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
in those agreements that the state
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't regulate
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
all this says
 
01:01:24.789 --> 01:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
is that the utilities can't bargain away
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
the state's regulatory authority
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
over things like safety and vegetation
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
management etc it doesn't say anything
 
01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:35.839 align:start position:0%
about who actually has that authority so
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
for instance you know we have safety
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
rules right and we'll probably
 
01:01:44.549 --> 01:01:44.559 align:start position:0%
uh adopt some additional safety rules
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
what you know as we get going right
 
01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
vegetation management
 
01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
that's all handled in dockets there is
 
01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
no rule that governs vegetation
 
01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:55.109 align:start position:0%
no rule that governs vegetation
management

01:01:55.109 --> 01:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
um that's that's really
 
01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.670 align:start position:0%
um that's that's really
um

01:01:59.670 --> 01:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
done sort of in in the context of rate
 
01:02:02.079 --> 01:02:03.029 align:start position:0%
done sort of in in the context of rate
making

01:02:03.029 --> 01:02:03.039 align:start position:0%
making
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
believe it or not where um you know
 
01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
you're deciding
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
what goes into which budget and how
 
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
readily accessible that money is to the
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
utility through their their rates right
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh when they get paid back for the work
 
01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
that they're doing that sort of thing
 
01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
right and so that's that's more
 
01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:24.559 align:start position:0%
within the pucs can and the people at
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
the department are taking a position
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
under their regulatory authority which
 
01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:30.630 align:start position:0%
under their regulatory authority which
is

01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
basically to take a position and argue
 
01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
right on that subject and then it gets
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
resolved by the puc so there is no
 
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
clean line that we can draw
 
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
in this area
 
01:02:44.549 --> 01:02:44.559 align:start position:0%
at least not at this point i think
 
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's a project that's well beyond what
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
we can do here
 
01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
um in in this session but on things like
 
01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
safety for example the people that would
 
01:02:54.319 --> 01:02:55.029 align:start position:0%
safety for example the people that would
be

01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:55.039 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
responsible for that would be are in the
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
department of energy and not in the puc
 
01:03:01.349 --> 01:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
those those people have been moved over
 
01:03:01.359 --> 01:03:03.349 align:start position:0%
those those people have been moved over
correct

01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:03:03.359 --> 01:03:04.950 align:start position:0%
correct
um

01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
yes those people have been moved over
 
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean that they wouldn't
 
01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
appear before the puc to make arguments
 
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
on an issue that the puc would have the
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
decisional authority for
 
01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
right so was this original change to
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
statute made by hb2
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
right so the original statute said the
 
01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission shall retain
 
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
its authority right
 
01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 changed that to the
 
01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.470 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 changed that to the
department

01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:33.270 align:start position:0%
department
shall

01:03:33.270 --> 01:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
shall
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
retain its authority and what the puc
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
and the department are suggesting to you
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
is that it should be both
 
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
right so whatever
 
01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:43.430 align:start position:0%
right so whatever
authority

01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
the each one has they retain it in that
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
that process the utility
 
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
cannot be permitted to bargain that away
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
in its attachment agreements
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
i'm satisfied with this language as
 
01:03:56.829 --> 01:03:56.839 align:start position:0%
written fred
 
01:03:59.829 --> 01:03:59.839 align:start position:0%
listening which i sometimes do
 
01:03:59.839 --> 01:04:00.789 align:start position:0%
listening which i sometimes do
uh

01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
i think that uh
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
leave it alone let's see if the plate
 
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
let it play out and see if there's a
 
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
problem in the future
 
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
because i heard about the
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
the the it's too difficult to unwind the
 
01:04:14.069 --> 01:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
department has this and puc has that
 
01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
some of it's in a rate case some of it's
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
some of it's administrative so let's
 
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
leave it alone and see what the problem
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
wraps up in the future i may have been
 
01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
thinking of a problem that won't exist
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
well you know i i think these are things
 
01:04:29.029 --> 01:04:29.039 align:start position:0%
that you do need to think about right as
 
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
as do we and we're going to be thinking
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
about this as we go through our
 
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
rule-making project this year right
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
we'll be working with the department of
 
01:04:38.829 --> 01:04:38.839 align:start position:0%
justice on that to make sure that we're
 
01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
appropriately assuming the authority
 
01:04:42.789 --> 01:04:42.799 align:start position:0%
that we should assume and not assuming
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
authority we shouldn't each agency
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
right and
 
01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
i think after that if there are problems
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
they'll be they'll become more clear
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
right such as well
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
if if the department sets a rule can the
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
commission require something some
 
01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
some type of behavior that's
 
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
above and beyond
 
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
the rule that the department has set in
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
a certain area those issues will arise
 
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
at some point
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it's a
 
01:05:15.029 --> 01:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think it's something
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
that can be resolved
 
01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.589 align:start position:0%
that can be resolved
today

01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:05:17.599 --> 01:05:20.390 align:start position:0%
today
yeah

01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
i can accept the uh the language as it
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
is although i i do agree if as you're
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
going through
 
01:05:31.270 --> 01:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
the uh actual mechanics of
 
01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
the next the year or so
 
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
the the proposal that uh
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
that fred had uh outlined makes sense
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
that you consider
 
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.190 align:start position:0%
that you consider
driving

01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
driving
 
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
all the initial work into the department
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
of energy where the staff is and if
 
01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
there's if there's a conflict then the
 
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
puc is the adjudicatory body for
 
01:05:56.069 --> 01:05:56.079 align:start position:0%
resolution that that makes sense if this
 
01:05:56.079 --> 01:05:57.190 align:start position:0%
resolution that that makes sense if this
becomes

01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
becomes
 
01:06:02.069 --> 01:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:02.079 --> 01:06:03.589 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i i my
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
instincts are more towards what uh
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
jackie was saying about the public
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
utilities commission having the major
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
role here
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that this is a
 
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
regulatory authority
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
however i think
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
because of the way this was restructured
 
01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
as we know we have people who used to do
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
one function are now in a department
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
that really has a different function
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
and then the question is who takes care
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
of the regulatory versus planning and
 
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
other things
 
01:06:38.549 --> 01:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
and i think this is going to be a
 
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
reoccurring problem
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
this this is not the only place where
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
this is going to happen it's going to
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
happen over and over again because this
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
is a major overhaul and major shifting
 
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
around of people with different
 
01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:50.789 align:start position:0%
around of people with different
expertise

01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:50.799 align:start position:0%
expertise
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
uh and you you don't you don't want to
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
lose that expertise but at the same time
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
now they're under a different authority
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
so it's really a tricky thing to do and
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
i think at this point maybe the best
 
01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
thing would be to leave it as is right
 
01:07:09.029 --> 01:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
now but to keep a really sharp eye on it
 
01:07:09.039 --> 01:07:10.309 align:start position:0%
now but to keep a really sharp eye on it
and

01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:12.309 --> 01:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned a couple times and
 
01:07:14.789 --> 01:07:14.799 align:start position:0%
requested a couple times
 
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
we really need to get a better overview
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
of this whole reorg from
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
your department and a lot of the answers
 
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
about you know you you provide us with
 
01:07:25.829 --> 01:07:25.839 align:start position:0%
some comments now that
 
01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
may be new to us
 
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
but not new to you so we need to be up
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
updated in what's exactly happened where
 
01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
people are what are what what
 
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
authorities got shifted
 
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
and i don't think we've gotten that kind
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
of information as i mentioned the last
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
time i think we got an update was may of
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
last year
 
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
so that's way too long right thank you
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
so uh representative mcgee made a
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
comment at our last meeting
 
01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
she just wanted to know whether
 
01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
the structure had been implemented the
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
way that you were shown and it was
 
01:07:59.430 --> 01:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:08:01.349 --> 01:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
um that
 
01:08:02.549 --> 01:08:02.559 align:start position:0%
that's the structure that's been
 
01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
implemented that's where people went in
 
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
the department or the puc and how the
 
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
different divisions are structured
 
01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.430 align:start position:0%
different divisions are structured
right

01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
um i just just to follow up to i think
 
01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
peter had an excellent point there this
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
is not going to be the only issue will
 
01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:19.839 align:start position:0%
we come in and say
 
01:08:19.839 --> 01:08:21.030 align:start position:0%
we come in and say
doe

01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
doe
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
commission both separate one above the
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
other whatever so rather than try to
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
come up with a unique solution for each
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
one i think what i suggest is we just
 
01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
let you guys know we're going to be
 
01:08:33.669 --> 01:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
looking at this closely obviously if
 
01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
there tends to be problems the utilities
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
and the people that do poll attachments
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
which are i never there's like a zillion
 
01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
different companies out there attaching
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
things to polls these days
 
01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
they are not shy they will they will let
 
01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
us know if there's a problem so i think
 
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
maybe trying to see what works
 
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
rather than try to find a unique
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
solution to each one maybe the best
 
01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:55.590 align:start position:0%
solution to each one maybe the best
approach

01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
approach
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
i think i think maybe some of the
 
01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
confusion here is
 
01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
results from the fact that the
 
01:09:03.359 --> 01:09:06.070 align:start position:0%
results from the fact that the
commission

01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:09:09.829 --> 01:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
up until hb2 occurred or was passed
 
01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:13.400 align:start position:0%
the commission was doing a lot of
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
non-regulatory kinds of things
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
and what hb2 does is it
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
gives back to the commission
 
01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
just those things over which it should
 
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
regulate which is mostly rate setting
 
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
and it creates the new department of
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
energy to administer
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
the rest of
 
01:09:37.349 --> 01:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
the legislative mandates
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh with regard to energy
 
01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:43.510 align:start position:0%
uh with regard to energy
so

01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
people have to kind of separate in their
 
01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:47.030 align:start position:0%
people have to kind of separate in their
minds

01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
minds
 
01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:48.390 align:start position:0%
minds
that

01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
the department of energy is
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
like the department of transportation
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
relevant to its area of expertise
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
but the public utilities commission
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
regulates a very
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
narrower set of things
 
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
than the department of of energy does
 
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
and is more adjudicative
 
01:10:14.229 --> 01:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
in the process because of
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
the nature of rate setting so i think if
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
we keep that distinction in our mind
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
it'll be easier for us to understand why
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
some of these changes are being
 
01:10:23.679 --> 01:10:27.030 align:start position:0%
some of these changes are being
requested

01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um mike i have a
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
we've been talking back and forth about
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
who does what and that we've transferred
 
01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
resources over that do investigatory
 
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
pieces that used to be puc that are now
 
01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.149 align:start position:0%
pieces that used to be puc that are now
doe

01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
doe
 
01:10:40.159 --> 01:10:41.110 align:start position:0%
doe
and

01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
if the public utilities commission were
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
the sole responsible party under this
 
01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:50.950 align:start position:0%
the sole responsible party under this
language

01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
they would still have access to those
 
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
people for the investigatory piece
 
01:10:59.189 --> 01:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
of determining any of these issues right
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
they so they
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
they become sort of an extended
 
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
administrative staff to the puc when
 
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
they're doing their work right well
 
01:11:08.719 --> 01:11:09.990 align:start position:0%
they're doing their work right well
so

01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
let me see if i can come up with an
 
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
example as to why it should be both i
 
01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
mean we have to understand that because
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
now that
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
let me see if i can come up with an
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
example is
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
why it should be both who have
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
the the regular retain their authority
 
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
over these things okay okay so
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
issue were to come to the commission
 
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
right and the commission wanted the
 
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
department's aid
 
01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:39.590 align:start position:0%
department's aid
in

01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
understanding the issue yeah right you
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
the the commission would have to have
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
authority over something like safety so
 
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
that they could make the decision
 
01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
the department would have to have
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
authority over safety so that it could
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
fully go in and investigate
 
01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
and require answers right
 
01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.310 align:start position:0%
and require answers right
and

01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
require some initial changes right
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
before maybe before it goes to the
 
01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
litigation right
 
01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:08.470 align:start position:0%
litigation right
so

01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
if you were to just say that the
 
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission has control
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
over it then what would the department
 
01:12:17.189 --> 01:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
do how would they even help
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
this is the problem with building the
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
plane while you're flying it
 
01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
right is that
 
01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
i understand there could be endless back
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
and forth trying to figure out how the
 
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
department would work without putting it
 
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
in place and then and then tweaking i
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
understand that there's you know there's
 
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
different ways to to approach doing that
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
and and different values to doing it
 
01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
each way
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
but it seems like
 
01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
the issue still keeps coming back to the
 
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
fact that the public utilities
 
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
commission no longer has its own
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
investigatory resources and so it's
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
going to continue to have this back and
 
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
forth with who does what why when who
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
has authority when where
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
and that is going to be confusing not
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
only for the regulatory process but also
 
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
for the people who interact with those
 
01:13:11.189 --> 01:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
two bodies it's not just going to be
 
01:13:11.199 --> 01:13:12.310 align:start position:0%
two bodies it's not just going to be
internal

01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
internal
 
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
i think it's unnecessary i think what
 
01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
we've done here is an unnecessary
 
01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
confusion of the two
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
so let me
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
see if i can give an example of how it
 
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
works right so
 
01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.070 align:start position:0%
works right so
um

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
recently two telephone companies applied
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
for a boundary exchange
 
01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
right because we do still regulate some
 
01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
things having to do with telephone right
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
so they applied for the boundary
 
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
exchange and the commission issued a
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
procedural order asking the department
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
to investigate and prepare a
 
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation within a certain amount
 
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
of time right now the
 
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
red line required the commission to do
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
that on the record
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
right so the the companies know
 
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
that the department has been requested
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
to prepare the investigation but
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
the department has regulatory authority
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
so they can actually conduct that
 
01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:11.830 align:start position:0%
so they can actually conduct that
investigation

01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
they can they'll file the recommendation
 
01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
and then the puc will take action
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
based upon what the utilities have said
 
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
and what the
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
department has recommended
 
01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
so everything's working
 
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
right in terms of where the resources
 
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
are and who's doing the work
 
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
and everything's on the record so
 
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
everybody sees it and that's the
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
fundamental design i think of house bill
 
01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:35.189 align:start position:0%
fundamental design i think of house bill
2

01:14:35.189 --> 01:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
2
 
01:14:35.199 --> 01:14:36.070 align:start position:0%
2
and

01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
it functions
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
it's working
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
peter you had a question
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
01:14:46.709 --> 01:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
i kind of want to respond to what
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
chairman votes just
 
01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned i understand his thinking that
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
you know we've changed dramatically the
 
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
structure of things
 
01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
and now the department of energy has a
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
lot more authority and
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
and authority they didn't have before
 
01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:03.830 align:start position:0%
and authority they didn't have before
um

01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
but this example here with the poll
 
01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:07.510 align:start position:0%
but this example here with the poll
attachment

01:15:07.510 --> 01:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
attachment
 
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
is is contradicts that very argument
 
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
because then there shouldn't be the puc
 
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
in here the theo should be the only one
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
in here but now you put both together
 
01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.149 align:start position:0%
in here but now you put both together
with

01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
both of them have to agree
 
01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
and this kind of confusion um is
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
contradicting maybe the intent of what a
 
01:15:25.679 --> 01:15:26.550 align:start position:0%
contradicting maybe the intent of what a
uh

01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
what what should have happened
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh and i don't think that that's going
 
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
to get resolved easily uh
 
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
just because of the just this one item
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
here so in the context of this statute
 
01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
both do not have to agree
 
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
poll attachment issues do not go to the
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
puc at all
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
unless the
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
the poll owner and the person who wishes
 
01:15:48.870 --> 01:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
to attach
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
can't come to an agreement
 
01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
right if they can't come to an agreement
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
as to the terms and conditions and
 
01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
pricing of the poll attachment statute
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
that all goes to the puc for litigation
 
01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's all that's going there now there
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
might be a safety issue involved you
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
know where
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
um an attacher wants to attach in the
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
electric space right and the commission
 
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
is going to say absolutely not you can't
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
do that right just as the department
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
would say absolutely not you can't do
 
01:16:19.679 --> 01:16:20.550 align:start position:0%
would say absolutely not you can't do
that

01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
but but the sentence says
 
01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:24.390 align:start position:0%
but but the sentence says
like

01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
michael was just saying before
 
01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
retain their authority so on the one
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
hand you say this is a puc issue
 
01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:32.790 align:start position:0%
hand you say this is a puc issue
uh

01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
they're the people of having the
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
authority to do this
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
but then
 
01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
it talks about the department of energy
 
01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
retaining some authority over it well
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
they didn't have authority before right
 
01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
so this is something new
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
but i think you're you're looking at it
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of when the statute is enacted
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
as opposed to where this falls in the
 
01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:54.470 align:start position:0%
as opposed to where this falls in the
process

01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
right so this is where it falls in the
 
01:16:58.470 --> 01:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
process excuse me though i would just
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
because i was wrong on that the hb2
 
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
presently gives the authority to the
 
01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
department of energy so they are
 
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
retaining it so that it is the correct
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
term i i just i just read it wrong
 
01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:11.030 align:start position:0%
term i i just i just read it wrong
already

01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
and they retained that so this
 
01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
i suggest expanding that but beyond
 
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
beyond that
 
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
i don't that this really has to do
 
01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
with where the paragraph falls in the
 
01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
process of attachments not where it
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
falls in the process of
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
adopting statutes
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
not it's so it's not on that small slice
 
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
of that process exactly right so all
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
this is saying
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
is that in the process
 
01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:40.149 align:start position:0%
is that in the process
of

01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
entering into a poll attachment
 
01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.430 align:start position:0%
entering into a poll attachment
agreement

01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
the utility
 
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
and the attacher cannot
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
bargain away the state's authority to
 
01:17:49.679 --> 01:17:51.350 align:start position:0%
bargain away the state's authority to
regulate

01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
01:17:53.110 --> 01:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
right so when you're in that process
 
01:17:55.110 --> 01:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
regardless of who has that authority
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay yeah
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
so yeah this doesn't deal with who has
 
01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
the authority or what authorities they
 
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
hold it's just whatever we hold
 
01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
you can't bargain it away
 
01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
whatever you agree to
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter we're going to come in
 
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to regulate safety
 
01:18:11.669 --> 01:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
right okay we're going to have to move
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
on because we can battle this thing uh
 
01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
for forever so going down the rest of
 
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
the page it looks to me
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
under section 23 that these are just uh
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
changes which i think were in the
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
original from commission to department
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
of energy
 
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
there's a number of those i i'd like to
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
look at number four on line 15.
 
01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:30.149 align:start position:0%
look at number four on line 15.
um

01:18:30.149 --> 01:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
what page you want we're on i'm on eight
 
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
before we're
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
glossing by the rest of what's on that
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
page um under open access to
 
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
transmission and distribution facilities
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
we're leaving the first sentence and i
 
01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
would like to ask whether we could leave
 
01:18:46.149 --> 01:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
the last sentence as well
 
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
which i think has relevance in the
 
01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:50.550 align:start position:0%
which i think has relevance in the
statute

01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
and was there for a reason
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
the commission in the department should
 
01:18:56.550 --> 01:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
monitor companies providing transmission
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
of distribution services and take
 
01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
necessary measures to ensure that no
 
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
supplier has an unfair advantage in
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
offering and pricing such services
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
language was there specifically
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that is taken into
 
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
consideration under
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh open access to transmission and
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
distribution facilities
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
and it was part of the original
 
01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
restructuring policy principles so
 
01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
um i
 
01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
think that that language should be
 
01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:29.510 align:start position:0%
think that that language should be
retained

01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
i think that's up to you you folks and
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
we'll do that work if you ask us to i
 
01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
know so the sentence says the the
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
sentence that representative mcgee
 
01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
referred to says the commission and the
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
department was that changed in hb2 was
 
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
that language changed in hb2
 
01:19:46.709 --> 01:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
what department is
 
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
the sentence referring to
 
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
yeah it would be doe because in the in
 
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
hb2 it said that those would be the
 
01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
references right department would be
 
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
doing so that's where it came from i'm
 
01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:02.630 align:start position:0%
doing so that's where it came from i'm
sure

01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
i think it's a valid request i don't see
 
01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
why we wouldn't want to leave it in
 
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
unless someone sees something i'm
 
01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:08.790 align:start position:0%
unless someone sees something i'm
missing

01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
missing
 
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
so i think representative mcgee is right
 
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
on the money you want to put that one
 
01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
back in then
 
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
so that's on line 20 of page four thank
 
01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:30.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:20:30.629 --> 01:20:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
section 23
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
is one that we've talked about a couple
 
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
of times
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
this is a rate payer protection
 
01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:43.669 align:start position:0%
this is a rate payer protection
provision

01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:20:43.679 --> 01:20:48.470 align:start position:0%
provision
and

01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:50.229 --> 01:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
has to do with
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
providing notice of when you're
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
going to use a variable rate
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
and the appropriate party to report that
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
to would be the department because we're
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:10.709 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:21:10.709 --> 01:21:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:14.629 --> 01:21:14.639 align:start position:0%
so section 24 at the bottom of the page
 
01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
has to do with the so-called
 
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
sbc report
 
01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
that is provided to the legislature
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
every year
 
01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:25.350 align:start position:0%
every year
and

01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 had the commission and the
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
department submitting that report but
 
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
the commission really doesn't have
 
01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:33.110 align:start position:0%
the commission really doesn't have
anything

01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:33.990 align:start position:0%
anything
to

01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
of its own to say about that
 
01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
so our recommendation was that you just
 
01:21:39.669 --> 01:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
have the department prepare and submit
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
this is another one of those sections
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
sort of similar to the one we were
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
discussing before in that you're going
 
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
to have two
 
01:21:59.830 --> 01:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
the two groups of department and the
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
commission having to really work
 
01:22:04.229 --> 01:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
together here i mean for example i know
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
one of the commissioners was just down
 
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
at the nay roof meeting in washington
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
where they passed a resolution between
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
ferc and nehru to work on
 
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
some transmission siting rules
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
and obviously
 
01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
when we get back to new hampshire the
 
01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
the part of this our state that's going
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
to be working on the transmission issues
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with knee pool and iso new
 
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
england is going to be the department of
 
01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
energy and not the puc so
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
the sentence you added in here employees
 
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
of the commission and department are not
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
otherwise prohibited from participating
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
etc it was definitely needed but again
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
just a heads up on this one this is an
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
area where we could have potential
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
conflict and we're going to have to make
 
01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:44.719 align:start position:0%
sure that the two groups work together
 
01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
seamlessly because these things aren't
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
that clear especially once you start
 
01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:56.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
section 26 beginning on line 22. uh this
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
was in the original
 
01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:02.629 align:start position:0%
was in the original
uh

01:23:02.629 --> 01:23:02.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
house bill 1258 has introduced
 
01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
so no changes there
 
01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me could you say that again
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
please how it was where
 
01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:15.030 align:start position:0%
please how it was where
um

01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
so beginning on page line 22 on page
 
01:23:18.239 --> 01:23:19.750 align:start position:0%
so beginning on page line 22 on page
nine

01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
nine
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
we did not make any changes to that that
 
01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
this is how it appeared in
 
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
house bill 1258 as introduced
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
so this is all language you've seen
 
01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:35.110 align:start position:0%
so this is all language you've seen
before

01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
oh okay yeah so did this uh result from
 
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
last year's senate bill 91
 
01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
so section 27 was also when uh the bill
 
01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
is introduced it's just a
 
01:24:00.390 --> 01:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
reference change in the budget
 
01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:01.390 align:start position:0%
reference change in the budget
from

01:24:01.390 --> 01:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
adjudicative commissioners back to
 
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission
 
01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
i think because adjudicative
 
01:24:09.510 --> 01:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
commissioners is difficult to say
 
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
then um
 
01:24:15.669 --> 01:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
that took out the repeal of the
 
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:25.590 align:start position:0%
that took out the repeal of the
um

01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:28.629 --> 01:24:28.639 align:start position:0%
rsa 374 f34
 
01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
that's on page eight now
 
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
so the open access transmission
 
01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:37.990 align:start position:0%
so the open access transmission
provision

01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
in house bill 1258 that was completely
 
01:24:40.159 --> 01:24:41.669 align:start position:0%
in house bill 1258 that was completely
repealed

01:24:41.669 --> 01:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
right so you'll no no longer see that in
 
01:24:44.159 --> 01:24:47.669 align:start position:0%
right so you'll no no longer see that in
the

01:24:47.669 --> 01:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
on section 28 then these are repealed
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
this was in
 
01:25:02.310 --> 01:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
hb2 or 1258 as originally submitted or
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
01:25:07.590 --> 01:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
rsa 12 p12
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
was a mistake in house bill 2 because
 
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
that provision actually appears in the
 
01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:13.669 align:start position:0%
that provision actually appears in the
pucs

01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
pucs
 
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
own statutes
 
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
so that's just a housekeeping measure
 
01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:19.830 align:start position:0%
so that's just a housekeeping measure
okay

01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
two three and four the 371 sites those
 
01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
are changes to the crossing statute
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
these are the exemptions that are being
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
removed so that everybody comes in
 
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
to get a license right
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
rsa 374 f35b
 
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.430 align:start position:0%
rsa 374 f35b
we

01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
that that repeal was in 1258 as
 
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
introduced and that's because that
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
provision has been superseded
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:53.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:55.110 --> 01:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
go ahead there was one mistake that i
 
01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:56.790 align:start position:0%
go ahead there was one mistake that i
made

01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
find it here in the uh
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:06.070 --> 01:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
we're losing your volume david if you
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
if we're through i'd like to summarize
 
01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:55.750 align:start position:0%
if we're through i'd like to summarize
how

01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:26:57.669 --> 01:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
what what changes we still need to make
 
01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
so we get a another
 
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
amendment it's complete
 
01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:04.639 align:start position:0%
and the ones that i remember is putting
 
01:27:06.709 --> 01:27:06.719 align:start position:0%
back in the five-year you have five
 
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
years to
 
01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
change rules yeah but actually i think
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
that was intended to go
 
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:21.709 --> 01:27:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
541a172 which page you want that would
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
be page two line 16. i think that's
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
where you had actually talked about the
 
01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:32.149 align:start position:0%
where you had actually talked about the
five-year

01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
five-year
 
01:27:34.149 --> 01:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
okay as long as we get it in there then
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
okay so page 2916.
 
01:27:39.110 --> 01:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
just so you note down to provide
 
01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:40.229 align:start position:0%
just so you note down to provide
language

01:27:40.229 --> 01:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
second was uh the uh
 
01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
the mcgee uh
 
01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:45.590 align:start position:0%
the mcgee uh
uh

01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
the uh amendment with respect to uh the
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh database
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
which should be incorporated in here
 
01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:52.229 align:start position:0%
which should be incorporated in here
okay

01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:27:53.669 --> 01:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
that we haven't addressed it let's just
 
01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
give a can we go over what we've done
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
so far today and then we'll get to that
 
01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
afterwards so go ahead freddie
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
well just i'm just summarizing what i
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
thought what changes
 
01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
third that i remember is adding back a
 
01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:07.030 align:start position:0%
third that i remember is adding back a
sentence

01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
that was deleted
 
01:28:12.310 --> 01:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
on page eight lines uh
 
01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
16 to 22 the last sentence starting the
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department should be
 
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
added back in
 
01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:19.910 align:start position:0%
added back in
okay

01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
those are the changes i remember that's
 
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
that's the ones i had written down as
 
01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
well so if anyone has anything else okay
 
01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:25.990 align:start position:0%

01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
then uh in addition to that i said that
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
i would be sending around some
 
01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
additional changes to rsa 125.0
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
just in terms of changing department to
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
commission or
 
01:28:40.149 --> 01:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
some some very simple changes to that
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%

01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
for the dyslexic
 
01:28:54.719 --> 01:28:59.110 align:start position:0%

01:29:03.110 --> 01:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
build is a lot more yeah
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%

01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
matthew young who was the ols attorney
 
01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
informed me that mr shulock had
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
addressed this in his document but i
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
didn't see anything in the document we
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
supplied to os ols that addressed this
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
change house bill 1285
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
yeah the statewide energy data platform
 
01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
with the security and privacy language
 
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
we had just agreed that we can itl that
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
bill if we can include that language
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
here and updating
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
the language around doe okay
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
so in the last
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
change okay so in the language that i
 
01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
send you you want me to include the
 
01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
language from 1285. that'd be helpful
 
01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:51.510 align:start position:0%
language from 1285. that'd be helpful
yes

01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
that way we can be assured it gets in
 
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
mr young apparently got confused when i
 
01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
asked him to put it in because he didn't
 
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
know where it came from i guess
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
you should start attending our meetings
 
01:30:06.790 --> 01:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
just a question is hb 1285 has not been
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
amended it's it's hb 25 1285 he can get
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%

okay so we've got uh three changes
 
01:30:21.669 --> 01:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
um when do you think as far as time wise
 
01:30:23.189 --> 01:30:23.199 align:start position:0%
goes and i'll defer to the chairman on
 
01:30:25.030 --> 01:30:25.040 align:start position:0%

could get it to them uh
 
01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
just in case there was a storm and
 
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
things get closed and i'm hoping then
 
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
based on that we can take the amendment
 
01:31:20.709 --> 01:31:20.719 align:start position:0%
as is to the executive committee uh or
 
01:31:22.229 --> 01:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
