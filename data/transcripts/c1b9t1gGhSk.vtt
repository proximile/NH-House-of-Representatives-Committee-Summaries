00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
so let's go ahead here and we have a
 
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee today tasked with the
 
00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:43.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
378 378 is Rel to the pbass program
 
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
which we have uh performance-based
 
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
School accountability system which the
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
doe uses in terms of looking at
 
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.270 align:start position:0%
doe uses in terms of looking at
performance

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
performance
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
accountability and this bill was
 
00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
submitted by the department and came to
 
00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:04.759 align:start position:0%
us from of course from the Senate and
 
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
when it was presented to us I think
 
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
there were a number of issues raised we
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
were looking at statutory references too
 
00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
and saw some the way it once was and
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
under the annotated versions here so
 
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to do for right now uh
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
there is uh a a a a revised Amendment it
 
00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:28.919 align:start position:0%
uh which is designed it was supposed to
 
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
be just pling draft and not an amendment
 
00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:33.959 align:start position:0%
with my name on it it would it would be
 
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
just a draft for as some of the thoughts
 
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
which might go into are looking at this
 
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
so what I'd like to do at this time is
 
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
open this up to a discussion and invite
 
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh both uh Caitlyn and Nate up if you're
 
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
both involved with this you know since
 
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
you working from way back there uh might
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:19.240 align:start position:0%
okay since uh we last discussed this um
 
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
I've had communication with the
 
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
department and and in a department with
 
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
myself with me as well and I'd like to
 
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
just just go drive right break down
 
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
through 378 as introduced and 378 as
 
00:09:34.829 --> 00:09:34.839 align:start position:0%
you're looking on the amendment and we
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
can go down by Roman 1 2 and go down
 
00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
through this thing and see where some of
 
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:43.240 align:start position:0%
these changes are and whether they
 
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
reflect what this committee is uh Desir
 
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
us of moving towards so the on the on
 
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
the does everybody have the originalist
 
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
introduced and the amendment so we can
 
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
just put them right beside each other
 
00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
and try to walk through a little bit we
 
00:10:05.949 --> 00:10:05.959 align:start position:0%
also had on this one a side by side done
 
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
by Jenifer 4 does everybody have that
 
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
side by side as well that takes the bill
 
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
as introduced and Compares it to current
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
law so we have several pieces of paper
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
we can use during our adventure here to
 
00:10:25.949 --> 00:10:25.959 align:start position:0%
try to figure out where we're going with
 
00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:27.110 align:start position:0%
try to figure out where we're going with
this

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
thing so on on I'm looking at the bill
 
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
as introduced right now where it says
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
Roman one uh under one there is hereby
 
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:39.160 align:start position:0%
establish a task force to develop and
 
00:10:40.829 --> 00:10:40.839 align:start position:0%
review the performance-based school
 
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:43.720 align:start position:0%
accountability pbass that will serve to
 
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
demonstrate a school is providing etc
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
etc anybody have a problem with that
 
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
because that's current law right
 
00:10:58.269 --> 00:10:58.279 align:start position:0%
uh no no it's not but is there a problem
 
00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
do we okay let's jump down to Roman
 
00:11:08.829 --> 00:11:08.839 align:start position:0%
2 the commissioner in consultation with
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
the legislative oversight committee
 
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
established in RSA 193c colon 8 and
 
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
Governor shall appoint no fewer than
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
nine and no more than 15 members to the
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
task force which shall consist of this
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
is where this other Amendment departs
 
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
significantly from the language which
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:35.710 align:start position:0%
 
us

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.509 align:start position:0%
us
and

00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
the law on page 570 in your statute
 
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
books in small in historical and
 
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
statutory notes says at least every four
 
00:11:49.949 --> 00:11:49.959 align:start position:0%
years the commissioner shall review the
 
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
performance-based accountability system
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
and make recommendation to the
 
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee the
 
00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner May establish a task force
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
to assist with this review the
 
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner or dis designate shall be
 
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the task force and shall
 
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
appoint no fewer than and it the
 
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
numbers as we have in front of us here
 
00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:15.079 align:start position:0%
so that's where that older language
 
00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:18.839 align:start position:0%
was so it's open to discussion now
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn or Nate you're you're welcome to
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
just jump in any time because we want to
 
00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:26.839 align:start position:0%
try to get through this today if we can
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
um from the committee yes represent
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
Corell but well okay let's let's start
 
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
who's on this committee okay let's first
 
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
start with representative cascaden then
 
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
who's on the committee and then we'll go
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
to other members and and then fight
 
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
others in yes thank you um I have a
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
couple uh just a couple points I did the
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
same thing is go over my notes to see
 
00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
what would be amended and I see that
 
00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
some of in in the amendment you gave us
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
this morning has some of the parts that
 
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
I had had put down in my um in my draft
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
um going back to the statute has there
 
00:13:09.069 --> 00:13:09.079 align:start position:0%
been a task force
 
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:11.240 align:start position:0%
established previous to now that's a
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
good question for Department there was
 
00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:15.519 align:start position:0%
previously a task force that was
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
established but it hasn't been in law
 
00:13:19.829 --> 00:13:19.839 align:start position:0%
since at least 2020 and it hasn't been
 
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
implemented probably since at least 2015
 
00:13:25.949 --> 00:13:25.959 align:start position:0%
so the the problem or the challenges is
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
there was the original task force that
 
00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
um did the P Bass work and then the
 
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
department kind of took that to use as
 
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
the task force when the Essa act the
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
every student succeeds Act was passed
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
and we needed an accountability task
 
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
force to oversee our federal legislation
 
00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:45.519 align:start position:0%
um and we kind of used one in the same
 
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
and we still have that task force that's
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
in place but they focus specifically on
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
the federal legislation we really do
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
need a separate one for the state side
 
00:13:59.310 --> 00:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
of accountability um because it's it
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
there's too much for one task force to
 
00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:02.959 align:start position:0%
do we would need full-time people to to
 
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
do do it if were to do both so okay that
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
puts that in perspective anybody else
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
from the subcommittee per some
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
dry thank you I I was just going back to
 
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:17.720 align:start position:0%
my mental definition of a task force
 
00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
which is do a task then disband and
 
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:23.720 align:start position:0%
looking at this it says the task force
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
is to develop and review so does that
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
mean it's in perpetuity this task force
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
so yeah so we would see it as a a task
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
force that would um review the
 
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
accountability um result each year to
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that um when the department is
 
00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:42.519 align:start position:0%
doing the determinations that they feel
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
like it is
 
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate um the determinations that
 
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
are we eventually put in law will be an
 
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate reflection of the
 
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
measurement of an account of of
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
accountability for an adequate education
 
00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:56.839 align:start position:0%
um we really do value because because um
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
right now with our federal
 
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
accountability task force it's made up
 
00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
of practitioners we really do value
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
their input and so we typically meet
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
three or four times a year um at least
 
00:15:09.749 --> 00:15:09.759 align:start position:0%
once before we start the work once after
 
00:15:12.509 --> 00:15:12.519 align:start position:0%
we start can start the work sometimes
 
00:15:15.389 --> 00:15:15.399 align:start position:0%
during the work um to make sure that the
 
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
work that we're doing is one aligned to
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
the federal law and then two if the work
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
that we're doing um needs to or like our
 
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:25.720 align:start position:0%
plan needs to be modified as a result of
 
00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
the of the results of the work that's
 
00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
done okay follow yes so I guess is that
 
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
a task force thing or more like a
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
commission at that point we call it an
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
accountability task force um if we want
 
00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:43.160 align:start position:0%
to update terms um I you know the
 
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:45.160 align:start position:0%
department would be happy to do that but
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
we call it we right now we call it the
 
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
accountability perpetuity our current
 
00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
one does yes okay thank
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
you representa cascaden again do you
 
00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
want to keep going down or I mean well
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
um do you want to wait till you say okay
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
what about a what about B what about C
 
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
okay I I think that what we ought to do
 
00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:04.790 align:start position:0%
okay I I think that what we ought to do
is

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
just we get the drift to where that
 
00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:09.079 align:start position:0%
sentences right there let's look at like
 
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh lines 12 on the amendment 12 down
 
00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:14.759 align:start position:0%
right through to G okay yep and we do
 
00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:17.959 align:start position:0%
the do the same thing on on the bill as
 
00:16:19.949 --> 00:16:19.959 align:start position:0%
introduced and we can also look in the
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
annotated version as well Mr chair
 
00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
before we leave to can I just ask why
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
you took out consultation with the
 
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee
 
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
original it says a commissioner in
 
00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
consultation with the legislative o
 
00:16:45.629 --> 00:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
established Governor because later on
 
00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
the the task force or the department has
 
00:16:50.829 --> 00:16:50.839 align:start position:0%
to report
 
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
to um let's see if I can find it here
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
yep the end um at the end of the bill
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
yeah task force should develop
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
Performance Based
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh scoring system yes yes uh um the task
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
force shall provide a report of findings
 
00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:06.039 align:start position:0%
and recommendations for future
 
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
legislation for performance
 
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
accountability system to the State Board
 
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
of Education and the legislative
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
oversight committee established pursuant
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
to RSA
 
00:17:13.679 --> 00:17:19.069 align:start position:0%
to RSA
193

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
um I just marked that down as a note as
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
a reminder that you know we may want to
 
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:27.160 align:start position:0%
to that might be a point of discussion
 
00:17:30.909 --> 00:17:30.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
um it's I've always been a little bit
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
concerned that the task force which we
 
00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
have like there's a task force you may
 
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
have for social
 
00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
studies does does the legislature want
 
00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
to get in and be guiding that prior to a
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
report being given by the task
 
00:17:59.549 --> 00:17:59.559 align:start position:0%
force um it's it's uh what's a
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know I I think that you the the
 
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
oversight committee can get into the
 
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
weeds too when perhaps we don't want to
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
go there um it's just like the executive
 
00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
committee which we executive task force
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
the order task force on higher education
 
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
which we just completed findings and
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
recommendations were put together but
 
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
the accountability system where they
 
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
have to report quarterly back to the
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
oversight committee regarding progress
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
being made in the two chancellors are
 
00:18:31.149 --> 00:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
basically given the leadership
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for ensuring that work
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
continues and reports are provided on
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
where they're going with the alignment
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
of the two systems I'm more inclined to
 
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
say that I'd rather see the task force
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
have that ability to really delve into
 
00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
this they're the ones that are going to
 
00:18:49.149 --> 00:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
have that expertise if we're going to
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
have commission
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
members uh that now opens up there would
 
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
be members from the senate or the the um
 
00:18:59.950 --> 00:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
house on there what guarantee do we have
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
the because a commission has to have
 
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
some kind of legislative participation
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
am I correct on
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
that yes and do we have that expertise
 
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm asking I I just thought I
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
said in consultation with the oversight
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
committee instead of the commissioner
 
00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:18.679 align:start position:0%
just appointing them all it's kind of
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
like an oversight for who's being
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
appointed to make sure that there's a
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
good cross reference of people being
 
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.470 align:start position:0%
good cross reference of people being
appointed

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
okay you're saying that so we want to
 
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.909 align:start position:0%
okay you're saying that so we want to
have

00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
committee well any other thoughts on
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
that I was going to okay yeah so so I
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
think I think that's probably why that
 
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
language was was in there initially to
 
00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
uh to try to you know depoliticize the
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
um the uh formation or the membership of
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
the um of the task force but I think
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
there's other ways to do that too um
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
such as going through you know B through
 
00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
G and um not making the the nominees uh
 
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
subject to to being nominated by the
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner but having the nominees uh
 
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
being recommended by you know different
 
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
groups like the school administrators
 
00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:29.720 align:start position:0%
Association or School Board Association
 
00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:32.039 align:start position:0%
or reaching higher other groups like
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
that and um and you know create a uh uh
 
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
create a a a
 
00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:42.919 align:start position:0%
a basically an informed you know group
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
that can um that can make the
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
recommendations for the for for pbass
 
00:20:51.549 --> 00:20:51.559 align:start position:0%
changes and U you know I think that's a
 
00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
way where where you know we can we could
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
leave the the um the accountability and
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
oversight commission uh for the tail end
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
like where you've pointed out in in
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
Roman 9 where it uh it basically
 
00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:08.559 align:start position:0%
receives the report and reviews the
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
findings and
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
recommendations I guess I'm I'm I put it
 
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
that way because I'm more familiar with
 
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
this occurring differently in the state
 
00:21:21.549 --> 00:21:21.559 align:start position:0%
I came from in both States Maine and in
 
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
Alaska in Alaska the Department of
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
Education was staffed properly and they
 
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
had a Department that was comprised of
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
people that were doing what Nate is
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
doing right now and Caitlyn putting
 
00:21:38.669 --> 00:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
together assessment programs and
 
00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:41.559 align:start position:0%
accountability programs based upon their
 
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
understandings of excuse me test and
 
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:47.240 align:start position:0%
measurement understandings of the skills
 
00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:49.960 align:start position:0%
that are necessary and with what is
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
needed in the field um we don't have
 
00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
that here in our department we have are
 
00:21:59.710 --> 00:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
you it is are you you the
 
00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.950 align:start position:0%
you it is are you you the
department

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so that's it and so so then we
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
rely on a task force which is up the way
 
00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919 align:start position:0%
we've done it and that so we put it off
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
to a group I I you know I just I just
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
want to ensure that the group somehow
 
00:22:21.029 --> 00:22:21.039 align:start position:0%
has the expertise that's necessary for
 
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
our department in front of us to really
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
get this job done
 
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
properly and I think that's exactly to
 
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
to the point I was trying to make uh Mr
 
00:22:34.269 --> 00:22:34.279 align:start position:0%
chair that um that rather than all of
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
those nominees coming from uh a singular
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh point that they come from a variety
 
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
of of of different uh organizations that
 
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
are that are concerned and dedicated to
 
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:50.200 align:start position:0%
the Quality outcomes of our
 
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
students so Caitlyn it if
 
00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
um put your your your your your shoes on
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
as if this is l the way it is right now
 
00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:01.559 align:start position:0%
in deciding you want to have an
 
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
administrator or a teacher whether it be
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
Elementary or secondary what would you
 
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
do in order to find that person would
 
00:23:12.029 --> 00:23:12.039 align:start position:0%
you automatically pick somebody that you
 
00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:13.799 align:start position:0%
know or would you also work
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with some
 
00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:18.559 align:start position:0%
organization we tend to do I would say a
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
combination um that's what we do right
 
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
now with the current accountability task
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
force for Essa um where you know if we
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
have someone that uh leaves that task
 
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
force and we need to fill spot um
 
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes we know someone who's already
 
00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:32.799 align:start position:0%
done a lot of work with our assessment
 
00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
systems um there's a number of
 
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
curriculum uh directors in our districts
 
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
there's a few assistant superintendents
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
and superintendents that we've worked
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
with that are very knowledgeable about
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
our current accountability system
 
00:23:44.269 --> 00:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
oftentimes because they've had schools
 
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
within their District or seu that have
 
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
been a CSI or TSI school so as a school
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
leader they're already intimately
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
familiar with what it means to work with
 
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
those schools work with those building
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
leaders um we often times work with
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
classroom teachers in the development of
 
00:23:59.549 --> 00:23:59.559 align:start position:0%
our state assessment systems and so if
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
we have teachers that have done um item
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
writing or have sat on bias and
 
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
sensitivity committees often times we'll
 
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
go to those lists of teacher volunteers
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
when we're pulling in uh committee
 
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
members for this type of work so we tend
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
to have I would say a a short list or so
 
00:24:15.669 --> 00:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
of people that you know Caitlyn and I
 
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
both know around the state that have
 
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:19.240 align:start position:0%
expertise that have worked with our
 
00:24:21.149 --> 00:24:21.159 align:start position:0%
state assessment assessment systems that
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
have worked with the accountability
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
systems um that we tend to go to if we
 
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
don't know someone off the top of the
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
head or we don't have someone immed for
 
00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:31.039 align:start position:0%
spot that we've worked with often times
 
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
we'll reach out to the superintendent
 
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
Association we'll reach out to the
 
00:24:36.029 --> 00:24:36.039 align:start position:0%
principal Association and ask for them
 
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
to provide us maybe with a list of two
 
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
or three people that might be
 
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
interested so it's a bit of a I would
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
say it's a bit of both so what I'm
 
00:24:46.269 --> 00:24:46.279 align:start position:0%
trying to do is eliminate the
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
possibility of the legislature putting
 
00:24:50.269 --> 00:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
in place something sort of like a pocket
 
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
veto uh where you you you have to get
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
approval from the legislative oversight
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
to have these members on this particular
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
task Force well I don't think that would
 
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
be appropriate is the legislative
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
oversight committee where you're going
 
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
to feel you're going to get the type of
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
information you're just expressed you're
 
00:25:12.269 --> 00:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
seeking are you going to get that from
 
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
that group or you going to get it let's
 
00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
say from Nea or if you're going to get
 
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
it from the administrators Association
 
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
or the some other group I think those
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
associations to representative Luna's
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
Point are you know they sort of know who
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
in the field
 
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:31.039 align:start position:0%
um has the appropriate knowledge and
 
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
background to do some of that work we
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
often rely on their expertise for
 
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
identifying individuals um I think the
 
00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:38.039 align:start position:0%
the checks and balances that exist in
 
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
here is the fact that any recommendation
 
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
has to come to the legislative oversight
 
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
committee from this task force so we
 
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
can't do the accountability system
 
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
without their recommendations becoming
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
Law And so there's almost two steps in
 
00:25:53.389 --> 00:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
there that I see that it has to come to
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
the legislative oversight committee and
 
00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
be recommended and then from there it
 
00:25:59.350 --> 00:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
would have to come to both this group
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
and Senate education to actually become
 
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
you know future law so there's two
 
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
points I think where the the legislature
 
00:26:09.789 --> 00:26:09.799 align:start position:0%
itself is ultimately the Arbiter of what
 
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
becomes the next pbass system the
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
committee can't recommend a system and
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
then move forward and Implement that
 
00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
right so further
 
00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
discussion we got to get this thing
 
00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
worked out yeah I think I think there
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
there is my concern is that there's a
 
00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:31.909 align:start position:0%
there is my concern is that there's a
difference

00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
between consultation and
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
Reporting and
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
so it's one thing to receive a report
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
and then react to the
 
00:26:45.789 --> 00:26:45.799 align:start position:0%
report there's
 
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:48.559 align:start position:0%
another activity that takes place prior
 
00:26:53.549 --> 00:26:53.559 align:start position:0%
to the report that's developed by the
 
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
committee and that's why I think back to
 
00:27:00.269 --> 00:27:00.279 align:start position:0%
what representative luno said said is to
 
00:27:03.389 --> 00:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
ensure that there is a and and rep
 
00:27:05.389 --> 00:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell that there is a
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
balance on there and I think that's why
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
the the consultation is important
 
00:27:13.389 --> 00:27:13.399 align:start position:0%
clearly the legislative oversight
 
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
committee is not going to have the same
 
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
expertise as those who work with it on a
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
daily basis which Nate you referred to
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
but I think that there is a concern and
 
00:27:27.149 --> 00:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how to resolve it to ensure
 
00:27:29.389 --> 00:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
that the people who are on
 
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
that have some sense of balance before
 
00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
they start their work and so that I
 
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:37.480 align:start position:0%
guess that's the concern that I would
 
00:27:40.509 --> 00:27:40.519 align:start position:0%
have too and I do know that in the past
 
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
anyway when we created the evaluation
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
system which was a lengthy process that
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
was done several years ago The Advocate
 
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
groups were clearly engaged in that at
 
00:27:55.509 --> 00:27:55.519 align:start position:0%
the GetGo and not as just receiving a
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
report to say and getting feedback on it
 
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
so I think somewhere in
 
00:28:03.909 --> 00:28:03.919 align:start position:0%
between um that there that's that would
 
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
be my concern is how do you make sure
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
that the PE Personnel that are there do
 
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
in fact rep have a broad sense of
 
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:13.240 align:start position:0%
constituency representation to help
 
00:28:15.389 --> 00:28:15.399 align:start position:0%
develop it that's my
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
concern is it necessarily represent Myer
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
a a
 
00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
broad uh understanding of
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
constituency representation or is it to
 
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
ensure that folks have a a clear
 
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
understanding of performance-based
 
00:28:35.509 --> 00:28:35.519 align:start position:0%
accountability yes so we want yes they
 
00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
both yes yes yes
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
okay I'm saying is that I think you can
 
00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.710 align:start position:0%
okay I'm saying is that I think you can
have

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:28:47.149 --> 00:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
because we can have both because I think
 
00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:49.799 align:start position:0%
there are persons and I'm not saying
 
00:28:51.789 --> 00:28:51.799 align:start position:0%
that an advocate group like a
 
00:28:54.029 --> 00:28:54.039 align:start position:0%
superintend Association for example that
 
00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:56.200 align:start position:0%
they dominate the group but that there
 
00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
is a voice that they have a voice
 
00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
group um balanced by those who may be
 
00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
directly more directly involved on a
 
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
day-to-day basis that's all I'm saying
 
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm not saying that I've said what
 
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.590 align:start position:0%
so I'm not saying that I've said what
I've

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
I've
 
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
said repon luno yeah I think what
 
00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
representative Myer talks about is is
 
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:18.559 align:start position:0%
right on I think it's consistent with
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
what Dr Green and and Miss Davis were
 
00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:25.559 align:start position:0%
were we talking about uh as well uh as
 
00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
and as long as we're we're
 
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
um um bringing in the involvement of
 
00:29:34.909 --> 00:29:34.919 align:start position:0%
multiple org superintendent Association
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
principal Association School Board
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
Association um you know as Dr Green has
 
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
has suggested happens on you know you
 
00:29:45.149 --> 00:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
know in the background not by
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
legislative action but uh but in the
 
00:29:49.389 --> 00:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
background when it comes to making
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
current uh recommendations but but
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
actually I've got a a question to to Dr
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
Green if I might because you you brought
 
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
up TSI and CSI and um and and last time
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
we met I think we talked about whether
 
00:30:09.389 --> 00:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
this um whether pbass applies to Charter
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
Schools and um and I think the answer
 
00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:14.039 align:start position:0%
was no it doesn't apply to I think
 
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
that's what the answer was and I was
 
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
wondering how if you could sort of talk
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
about that a little bit and talk about
 
00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
how how
 
00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
pbass determines TSI and CSI and what
 
00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
that all means so that
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
so right now there there's some
 
00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
confusion with the existing system be
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
because of how pbass kind of refers back
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
to the federal law
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
so right now um we have Federal
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
accountability which is CSI TSI schools
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
all of that that applies only to Title
 
00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
One schools now a charter school may be
 
00:30:55.629 --> 00:30:55.639 align:start position:0%
a title one school as and in the most
 
00:30:57.149 --> 00:30:57.159 align:start position:0%
case is because charter schools are
 
00:30:59.549 --> 00:30:59.559 align:start position:0%
eligible for title One funds and so any
 
00:31:01.789 --> 00:31:01.799 align:start position:0%
school that's receiving Title One funds
 
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
would be categorized for the purpose of
 
00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.310 align:start position:0%
would be categorized for the purpose of
federal

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.149 align:start position:0%
federal
accountability

00:31:07.149 --> 00:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
00:31:07.159 --> 00:31:08.789 align:start position:0%
accountability
um

00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:08.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:11.789 --> 00:31:11.799 align:start position:0%
now then the thing that's then confusing
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
is so that's not so we have Federal
 
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
accountability it doesn't apply to all
 
00:31:16.629 --> 00:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
schools and there are a fair number of
 
00:31:18.269 --> 00:31:18.279 align:start position:0%
schools specifically high schools in the
 
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
state that are not Title One schools so
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
they're not um not required to
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
participate in the federal
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
accountability system on the state side
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
of things um um so State accountability
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
should apply to all scho all public
 
00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
schools um and right now it does it
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
apply sorry all public district schools
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
that's who pbass currently applies to
 
00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't apply to Charter Schools
 
00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:42.799 align:start position:0%
so with the two systems we could have a
 
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
CSI school that is a federal CSI school
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
but not categorized for this purpose of
 
00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:52.360 align:start position:0%
State accountability and then we could
 
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
have a state CSI school that is a CSI
 
00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
school for State accountability but not
 
00:31:59.310 --> 00:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
for federal accountabil ility and that's
 
00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
kind of one of the main reasons that we
 
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
would like to see a segregation of the
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
two different systems because they have
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
very different accountability
 
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
requirements and so using the same
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
terminology is not really helpful for
 
00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039 align:start position:0%
the people that are being that are um
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
involved in that system and so we would
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
really like we would like to get a when
 
00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
we eventually come up with you know a
 
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
state accountability system as a result
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
of this task force hope to God we would
 
00:32:26.909 --> 00:32:26.919 align:start position:0%
not use the word CSI and TSI because it'
 
00:32:28.269 --> 00:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
be way too confusing will have a
 
00:32:29.789 --> 00:32:29.799 align:start position:0%
different you know schools in need of
 
00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
improvement or um I think there was
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
maybe talk one of the last time was had
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
maybe another um some additional
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
amendments from it was maybe even from
 
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
1583 that was different different
 
00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:42.200 align:start position:0%
terminology and I think if you we're
 
00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
doing State accountability we really do
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
want State account um we really want to
 
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
just kind of to separate the two now um
 
00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
as far as the charter schools there is
 
00:32:54.669 --> 00:32:54.679 align:start position:0%
um a requirement for accountability in
 
00:32:56.909 --> 00:32:56.919 align:start position:0%
the state Charter School law but the
 
00:32:59.789 --> 00:32:59.799 align:start position:0%
state accountability system as in ibass
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
and pbass do not currently apply to
 
00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools which means for State
 
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
purposes we are not running those
 
00:33:09.789 --> 00:33:09.799 align:start position:0%
calculations but we are then running the
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
pbass calculation which is a tied to the
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
federal accountability for charter
 
00:33:18.669 --> 00:33:18.679 align:start position:0%
school so it's it's very confusing um is
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
there Charter Schools would um when
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
we're talking about overall
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
accountability and remember we have to
 
00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:26.519 align:start position:0%
do ibass and pbass ibass is not
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
something that is necessarily
 
00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
um applicable to Charter Schools because
 
00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
they're not required to comply with the
 
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards so we take that
 
00:33:36.669 --> 00:33:36.679 align:start position:0%
outside of it but could we potentially
 
00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
come up with a pbass system that could
 
00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
also apply for charter schools because
 
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
remember it's based on performance it's
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
based on data we could we could do that
 
00:33:48.029 --> 00:33:48.039 align:start position:0%
um and that is something that this task
 
00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:49.559 align:start position:0%
force could certainly talk about but
 
00:33:51.669 --> 00:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
that would be a change into the
 
00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
law so go ahead so so would that would
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
that be something that and we're not
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
down to it quite yet but I think we're
 
00:34:02.629 --> 00:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
getting close down in Roman 3 and I'm
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
looking at representative lad's draft
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
for discussion but this is the duties of
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
the task force and that could be
 
00:34:09.119 --> 00:34:10.950 align:start position:0%
the task force and that could be
considering

00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
considering
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
um everything that you just talked about
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
here including maybe new terms coming
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
from from the state uh accountability
 
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
you could you could add that um but if
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
you wanted to have if you wanted to
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
require it for Charter Schools there's a
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
different section in RSA 193e that you
 
00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
would have to make it applicable to
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools as well because because
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
we' have to go in and just and modify
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
that section as well okay but but this
 
00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
task force could certainly study the
 
00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
system and see if it's something that
 
00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
could be applicable to Charter Schools
 
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
um and maybe if you want them to keep in
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
mind it specifically design a system
 
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
that could work for Charter Schools too
 
00:34:51.149 --> 00:34:51.159 align:start position:0%
it sounds like that might be something
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
this committee could do so Caitlyn what
 
00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
would happen if we put in uh something
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
under Roman three saying uh the pbas
 
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
system will be applicable to Charter
 
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
Schools so what would happen so what we
 
00:35:08.589 --> 00:35:08.599 align:start position:0%
would do is we would run the same
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
determinations for charter schools that
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
we are for public schools I think one of
 
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
our one of the challenges sometimes with
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools is specifically size of
 
00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:20.440 align:start position:0%
schools um and so uh making sure that we
 
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
would have enough data but the other
 
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
thing and this is um where the the
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
federal accountability system sometimes
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
fails Charter Schools or any sort of
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
alternative schools is we do have a fair
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
number of charter schools that are
 
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
specifically um set up to to support at
 
00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
risk determination or at risk um
 
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
populations um and so um we have a
 
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
number of charter schools right now that
 
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:49.720 align:start position:0%
are being categorized as CSI schools
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
just because of the nature of their
 
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
population that's applying to them or
 
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
that they're helping um and so there is
 
00:35:58.349 --> 00:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
no carve out for that federal law it's
 
00:36:00.109 --> 00:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
something that we have specifically
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
reached out to the US Department of
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
Education about and so we would want to
 
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
talk about that and the impacts on those
 
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
schools that are for at risk populations
 
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
but we should have that same sort of
 
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
things for all public schools
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
realistically too so if a school
 
00:36:16.589 --> 00:36:16.599 align:start position:0%
district wanted to do a specific set up
 
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
a school that was specifically
 
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
designated to help atrisk populations we
 
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
don't want to necessarily automatically
 
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
designate them right now either and
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's that is the challenge with the
 
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
federal system so we would want to talk
 
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
about how that would impact the the
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
charter schools that are those at risk
 
00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
schools versus your traditional regular
 
00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
charter school that is just set up to um
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
enroll New Hampshire resident children
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
so so not not to get too far ahead of
 
00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:50.079 align:start position:0%
ourselves or the task force um are are
 
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:51.640 align:start position:0%
um are
 
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
Charters did did are Charters held to
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
the same adequate education minimum
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
standards that um that public school
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
districts are no so charter schools are
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
held to a different accountability
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
system that exists in RSA 194b and
 
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
there's a different uh funding scheme
 
00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
set up for Charter Schools as well later
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
on in the statute so when you look at
 
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
193 E3 it's specific to the adequate
 
00:37:16.829 --> 00:37:16.839 align:start position:0%
education funding that goes to public
 
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
schools and it's not applicable to
 
00:37:20.109 --> 00:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools because Charter Schools
 
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
don't receive that stream of funding so
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
there is accountability but the
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
accountability is in a different statute
 
00:37:28.349 --> 00:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
and it's not this statute right right
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
and and is the is the accountability
 
00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
from a um from
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
a let's let's call it a pbass standard
 
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh would would that be would that by
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
definition have to be different for a
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
charter than a public um school because
 
00:37:46.349 --> 00:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
the funding is different the standards
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
are different the requirements are
 
00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:49.720 align:start position:0%
different the expectations you would
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
wants are different yeah so if we were
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
to create something in here that was
 
00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
applicable to Charter Schools we would
 
00:37:59.710 --> 00:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
want to also look at 194b to make sure
 
00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
that the two accountability systems did
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
not end up in contradiction with
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
themselves where charter schools are now
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
being held to two um competing systems
 
00:38:08.589 --> 00:38:08.599 align:start position:0%
right so you'd have to evaluate both of
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
those in the light of each other um the
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
current accountability system for
 
00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
Charters is specific to the Charter
 
00:38:16.309 --> 00:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
itself it requires every Charter School
 
00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:18.440 align:start position:0%
to identify in the charter approved by
 
00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
the state board their mission vision and
 
00:38:23.069 --> 00:38:23.079 align:start position:0%
goals and the standards for which they
 
00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:25.240 align:start position:0%
want to be held to so that if a charter
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
school is you know their mission isic
 
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
specific to uh supporting high school
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
students at risk of Dropout the metrics
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
by which they're measuring themselves
 
00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
are things like getting kids through
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
various completion programs whether it's
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
the highet uh alternative diploma
 
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
programs getting kids to a regular high
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
school diploma but maybe doing it in
 
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
five years or six years as opposed to
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
your traditional four-year path when we
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
overlay things like a four-year
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
graduation requirement on those schools
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's a metric they'll never meet because
 
00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
they may have a third of their
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
population that's coming in in their
 
00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
fifth year and so they can't graduate in
 
00:39:00.349 --> 00:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
four years because that ship is already
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
sailed for those students so you for
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
that particular school and their unique
 
00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
Mission you would want an accountability
 
00:39:08.589 --> 00:39:08.599 align:start position:0%
system that matches the mission of the
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
school so that's the current
 
00:39:11.069 --> 00:39:11.079 align:start position:0%
accountability system it's supposed to
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
be tied to each individual Charter okay
 
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank thanks that's a really good
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
explanation I would point out to it's
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily unique to Charters
 
00:39:20.349 --> 00:39:20.359 align:start position:0%
either we have alternative programs in
 
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
public school districts that also
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
struggle to meet current accountability
 
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
systems a really good example that is
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
Bud Carlson Academy and rochest
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
um has a very similar Mission the
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
majority of their students work through
 
00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
bud Carlson Academy in addition to
 
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
working with an adult ed high school or
 
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
a highet program and so many of those
 
00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:41.720 align:start position:0%
students can't meet the current
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
accountability system that we have set
 
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
up so Bud Carlson will always be a CSI
 
00:39:48.109 --> 00:39:48.119 align:start position:0%
school right but they're doing really
 
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
amazing things for the students that are
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
coming through that school it's just
 
00:39:53.309 --> 00:39:53.319 align:start position:0%
that the system is set up to measure
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
things that those students are not going
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to achieve because of the
 
00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
point that they're at in their
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
educational careers so so when and if I
 
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
might so I i' I've seen you know bud
 
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
Carlson um Academy on the CSI list you
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
know you know and um and this is helping
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
explain that um for me so that is part
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
of the Rochester school district it is
 
00:40:18.829 --> 00:40:18.839 align:start position:0%
yeah so many of those students you know
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
for one reason or another were not able
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
to be successful in the traditional
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum within the Rochester school
 
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
system and so they attend Bud Carlson
 
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
which does a lot more support around
 
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
flexible schedules it allows students
 
00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:31.839 align:start position:0%
maybe who need to work during the day to
 
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
then attend a highet program in the
 
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
afternoon or at night um I want to say
 
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
they have maybe somewhere between 48 and
 
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
50 students so it's not a large program
 
00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
um but when we look at things like State
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
assessment requirements most of the
 
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
students are seniors or their fifth year
 
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
seniors or their sixth year seniors so
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
many of them aren't required to take the
 
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
SAT because that's required in 11th
 
00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:55.240 align:start position:0%
grade so there's not a lot of assessment
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
evidence we can use um I think we only
 
00:40:59.309 --> 00:40:59.319 align:start position:0%
generally have maybe three or four
 
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
students that take the SAT out of about
 
00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:03.640 align:start position:0%
the 40 or 50 students that attend so
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to get achievement data
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
to then use as part of the
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
accountability system um so for
 
00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
alternative programs like that our
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
current accountability system just isn't
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
set up to measure them effectively right
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
so so just just just based on what what
 
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
I just learned on on this thing just
 
00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
from this conversation here um with with
 
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
B Bud Carlson Academy you know you know
 
00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
perennially on the on the CSI list that
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
does not mean Bud Carson um uh Academy
 
00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.069 align:start position:0%
does not mean Bud Carson um uh Academy
is

00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
failing it failing in its Mission or
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
failing its students or failing in
 
00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
general and it doesn't mean that the
 
00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:43.880 align:start position:0%
Rochester school district is failing in
 
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
its Mission we failing in general either
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
right I would argue that they're
 
00:41:49.589 --> 00:41:49.599 align:start position:0%
actually doing really amazing things for
 
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
those students because by having the
 
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
academy in the first place they're
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
keeping students in some type of program
 
00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
as opposed to those students just ending
 
00:42:00.589 --> 00:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
up on the Dropout list right um and
 
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
there are a number of other districts
 
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
that have programs similar program up in
 
00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
Woodsville Newport has a program um NASA
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
has a program um this is an example
 
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
where the message doesn't correspond
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
with with really what's happening corre
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
and and that's partly why we need to
 
00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
look at the accountability system as a
 
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
whole because we need to say like what
 
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
are these different types that we can
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
really design a system to help and
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
support those system is this a it's an
 
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
important topic where just talking about
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
here is that something that that you
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
believe given the nature what the task
 
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
force has to do you're not we would be
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
expanding it to see the applicability of
 
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
pbass to certain Charter Schools
 
00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
certainly King Street School I I think
 
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
would have a difficult time with some of
 
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
this um it's a small school like we've
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
been just talking about within
 
00:42:51.549 --> 00:42:51.559 align:start position:0%
sau23 um and they I think two pro so
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
King Street and French Pond and French
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
ponds the other ones yeah exactly it's a
 
00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
it's an alternative program sort of
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
outside your traditional curriculum
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
that's still serving those students yeah
 
00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:05.559 align:start position:0%
are there scores meshed in with SE would
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
the the co-op or they they will be now
 
00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
going forward initially they had been
 
00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
separate alternative um schools they've
 
00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
recently now uh kind of brought those
 
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
schools back in under the uh Woodsville
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
High School um and the middle school
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
there yeah so the the results going
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
forward will be reported uh as part of
 
00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
the overall Woodsville scores um
 
00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
previously they been classified sort of
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
oddly in our database um and so their
 
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
scores weren't actually being reported
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
um anywhere um they weren't part of
 
00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:37.480 align:start position:0%
Woodsville and they weren't they were
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
popping up um sort of oddly as private
 
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
schools well certainly there their goals
 
00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
their objectives are more aligned IEP
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
type orientation than they are on that
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
and I I I don't know if putting under
 
00:43:53.829 --> 00:43:53.839 align:start position:0%
that big umbrella of the high school in
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
Woodsville is the appropriate thing to
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
and these are the sort of things we
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
would really like to have conversations
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
with the task force um this is well
 
00:44:03.069 --> 00:44:03.079 align:start position:0%
maybe it's something we can add on as a
 
00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
duty to the task force yeah yeah yeah I
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
I made a note too on the bottom of the
 
00:44:10.109 --> 00:44:10.119 align:start position:0%
page here let's go back up to the top
 
00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
here though we're we were dealing with
 
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
consultation consultation with what the
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
the legislative oversight and the
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
governor what's the governor going to do
 
00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of helping to provide
 
00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
membership and and what really is the
 
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
legisl it's consult with some of the
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
professional organizations we have
 
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
within our
 
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
state and so maybe we need to word it as
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
such yeah and and more than consultation
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
I I you know this
 
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
is consultation sort of doesn't doesn't
 
00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
mean very much like yeah we talked about
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
it but but I I would suggest that that
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
um that these organizations actually
 
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
then you're going to have to figure out
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
which organization's going to do the
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
nomin it's going to be AF Nea uh
 
00:45:11.069 --> 00:45:11.079 align:start position:0%
reaching higher uh for for example
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
there's two down on um down an F there's
 
00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
there's uh two two teachers yeah one by
 
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
Nea one by AF um there's I think five or
 
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
six uh where is it in B there's six uh
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
administrat ERS they can all be
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
nominated by the um uh
 
00:45:34.829 --> 00:45:34.839 align:start position:0%
SAA uh there's one School Board member
 
00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
by Schoolboard
 
00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:39.079 align:start position:0%
Association principes yep uh there's
 
00:45:43.549 --> 00:45:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
dry hi go ahead before we go a little
 
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
bit further I just want to ask in D in
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
the original bill it's kind of a catch
 
00:45:59.630 --> 00:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
off you know educational experts parents
 
00:46:01.549 --> 00:46:01.559 align:start position:0%
uh members of a public interest group
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
you know interested in education and
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make the jump to the
 
00:46:09.549 --> 00:46:09.559 align:start position:0%
amendment like there's no parents no
 
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
public groups or anything is that
 
00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
intentional well in the amendment it
 
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
says GE other educational experts who's
 
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
understanding performance-based
 
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
accountability expertise would
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
be you know a benefit to that that task
 
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
force that could be apparent but you see
 
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
if what you want to do is are you going
 
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
to put a person on a group like that
 
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
just because they're a parent or are you
 
00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
going to also be looking to see what
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
this person can bring it's going to be
 
00:46:41.829 --> 00:46:41.839 align:start position:0%
between nine and 15 people and they're
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
all going to have to have some
 
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
understanding what how do we measure
 
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.470 align:start position:0%
understanding what how do we measure
Performance

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
Performance
 
00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
Based okay so follow up I'm just the way
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
um you're describing somebody nominating
 
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
it how would a parent get nominated at
 
00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
that point
 
00:47:00.549 --> 00:47:00.559 align:start position:0%
first question is why why the parent
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I I well I'm just saying this is
 
00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
what's already in the bill and I just
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
wondered if we we're bringing that
 
00:47:09.309 --> 00:47:09.319 align:start position:0%
forward at all well you could you assume
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
that at least one of these people that
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
are from the
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
other organizations is a parent I would
 
00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
assume somewhere along the way there's
 
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
going to be a parent in there I mean I I
 
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
have five kids in the public school
 
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
system so I certainly don't mind also
 
00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:27.160 align:start position:0%
representing a parent but I did have a
 
00:47:29.069 --> 00:47:29.079 align:start position:0%
long discussion with I I can't remember
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
was Nate or or Caitlyn on this or not
 
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
long but a discussion saying what are
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
some of the skill sets that we want
 
00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
these individuals to have so we come out
 
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
of here with something that's meaningful
 
00:47:43.549 --> 00:47:43.559 align:start position:0%
and relevant and yes you know we
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
performance is always not measured by a
 
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
test although we do say something
 
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
objective elsewhere in statute but
 
00:47:53.309 --> 00:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
there's other ways of doing that I think
 
00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:54.680 align:start position:0%
we can get that from the classroom
 
00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
teachers we can get that from everybody
 
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:00.200 align:start position:0%
else here here but it's the skill set
 
00:48:02.549 --> 00:48:02.559 align:start position:0%
that they bring forward I was I was
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
going to comment on that because I think
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
even though you're talking about the
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
advocate groups making these
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations it seems to me that
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
there ought to be some standard with
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
which that individual comes from so it's
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
not just not just any classroom teacher
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
but it's would be a classroom teacher
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
that's actually done the assessments
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
been involved in it maybe even done some
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
gradual work in it so that it would seem
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
to me that there could be uh some some
 
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
qualifying language for the
 
00:48:35.549 --> 00:48:35.559 align:start position:0%
recommendations that would come forward
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
see that's why I I don't mean to hog the
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
conversation that like an F we're
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
talking about the teachers that are
 
00:48:45.309 --> 00:48:45.319 align:start position:0%
familiar with performance spacee other
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
Educators in G that you know you know it
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
says the same thing uh who who's
 
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
understanding of Performance Based so
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
that would go into you know I would say
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
the you know whether it's something's
 
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
reliable or valid or Etc in the in the
 
00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:03.640 align:start position:0%
test and measurement domain as well I
 
00:49:04.829 --> 00:49:04.839 align:start position:0%
think it's important to remember these
 
00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
are very Heavy D data driven
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
conversations and meetings and a very
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
unique person would be in it's it
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
already takes a very unique person to be
 
00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
interested in doing this work to begin
 
00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:18.280 align:start position:0%
with because of the type of work it is
 
00:49:19.789 --> 00:49:19.799 align:start position:0%
and so it is important that we have
 
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
somebody with the right skill set um I'm
 
00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
wondering if um maybe instead of
 
00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:29.720 align:start position:0%
assigning a parent to this area um or
 
00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
even talking about some of the other um
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
constituents maybe if we have a place
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
where the task force would hold like a
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
listening session or a couple type
 
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
things like that to really gauge that
 
00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:44.079 align:start position:0%
Community input because this is such an
 
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
important measurement but then the
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
day-to-day parts of this conversation
 
00:49:50.109 --> 00:49:50.119 align:start position:0%
really are um in the hands of the
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
experts that are used to dealing with
 
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
the Education data and I mean to have
 
00:49:56.829 --> 00:49:56.839 align:start position:0%
somebody else's point I'm not sure
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative Miler um even not every
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
single superintendent in this seat is
 
00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:03.400 align:start position:0%
going to be appropriate for this role
 
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
because different superintendent have
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
very different skill sets or different
 
00:50:08.589 --> 00:50:08.599 align:start position:0%
teachers or whatnot and and that's
 
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
something that we're really going to
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
want to measure before we put people um
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
on this task force um and it's that's
 
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
going to be very important to Department
 
00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:19.240 align:start position:0%
like we're going to we're going to need
 
00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
to come up with some sort of process to
 
00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that people have the the
 
00:50:25.549 --> 00:50:25.559 align:start position:0%
skills and the time to commit to this
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
and understand because this is
 
00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of work the Department's
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
going to be expecting from these
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
individuals yeah you know if your task
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
force is doing their job the committee
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
we were on Dave representative luno that
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
the task for the executive order we took
 
00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
time to listen to students we took time
 
00:50:46.349 --> 00:50:46.359 align:start position:0%
to gather from the professors we did a
 
00:50:48.829 --> 00:50:48.839 align:start position:0%
big we took time to do that with
 
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
numerous folks that had been in the
 
00:50:53.789 --> 00:50:53.799 align:start position:0%
business of chaning and all that and
 
00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
with that we got good input yeah that's
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
important so the hearing process should
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
involve gathering information as you say
 
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
k through
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
the so would you I mean maybe should we
 
00:51:08.109 --> 00:51:08.119 align:start position:0%
write that in into this or I just made a
 
00:51:12.109 --> 00:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
note to add in underneath uh Roman
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
three some reference to the hearing
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
process to gather information from the
 
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
field and all those that are involved
 
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
and I we did do that when we developed
 
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
the Essa plan we did Statewide listening
 
00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:25.720 align:start position:0%
tours with that um we went to a fair
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
number of schools across the state um at
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
night so parents could come in and and
 
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
provide input and maybe we drag some of
 
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
that language for that and put it in
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
here yeah I yeah represent chair lad I
 
00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
think that's a that's a really good
 
00:51:40.589 --> 00:51:40.599 align:start position:0%
observation here because I think that
 
00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:43.559 align:start position:0%
task force ran pretty well and uh and I
 
00:51:46.589 --> 00:51:46.599 align:start position:0%
think it particularly ran well with um
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
with with the um with the Department you
 
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
know serving as uh you know as sort of
 
00:51:56.589 --> 00:51:56.599 align:start position:0%
chief of staff and and support for that
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
for that task force with director
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
applebe um as its chair and and um and
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh uh Dr um Nick what's Nick last marks
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
Nick marks and he was exceptional yeah U
 
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
and and so so two individuals that I
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
think are are conspicuously absent from
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
this list are um are both of you um and
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
and maybe that's something that we want
 
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
to consider is is a task force that that
 
00:52:30.789 --> 00:52:30.799 align:start position:0%
is really I would gather you know I
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
would hope that the commissioner or
 
00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
design and we're looking at the design
 
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
right in front of us um one of you
 
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.309 align:start position:0%
right in front of us um one of you
probably

00:52:41.309 --> 00:52:41.319 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
Nate so to some extent that we expect
 
00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
this task force to be um oversight to
 
00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:49.400 align:start position:0%
the department and so it's challenging
 
00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
when the department is actually a voting
 
00:52:52.829 --> 00:52:52.839 align:start position:0%
member and that's partially why we wrote
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
in the department personnel shall advise
 
00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
facilitate and provide Tech technical
 
00:52:59.390 --> 00:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
support but we're really looking for the
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
experts that the the external people
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
that are working with the kids and and
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
implementing the assessments and
 
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
collecting the data and doing all that
 
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
to really advise how it's going to work
 
00:53:11.549 --> 00:53:11.559 align:start position:0%
in the field and so you know if if a you
 
00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
know the task force comes up with some
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
sort of recommendation that then
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
Department go well we can't Implement
 
00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
that because we don't have a way of
 
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
collecting that data or you know X Y and
 
00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
Z we would be part of that conversation
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
we would be obviously at every single
 
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
meeting but we're really looking for the
 
00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
experts to advise us on
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
this per pen no I have a little bit of a
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
different question it has to do with how
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
the um task force is comprised so it's
 
00:53:42.349 --> 00:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
on line 10 it says no fewer than nine
 
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
and no more than 15 members and when you
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
count up lines a through C right there
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's nine already and then by the time
 
00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
you get down to line F you're at 13 so
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
how where where's the wiggle room in the
 
00:53:59.309 --> 00:53:59.319 align:start position:0%
allotment of the makeup of the commit
 
00:54:00.789 --> 00:54:00.799 align:start position:0%
yeah that would come under the other
 
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
experts under under G and the reason for
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
that is that uh I included in here an
 
00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:11.240 align:start position:0%
elementary teacher and a secondary
 
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:13.720 align:start position:0%
teacher uh so that we can get from the
 
00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
field what has been going on and how
 
00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:18.760 align:start position:0%
what's our perceptions and insights in
 
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
terms of performance-based assess
 
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
accountability so it it narrows it down
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
there's more identified and so you don't
 
00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
have two left over I saw that also but
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh it's going to be difficult trying to
 
00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
find real good people to be on this task
 
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
force this it seems like the minimum is
 
00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
really 13 like no fewer than 13 and no
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
more than 15 Because by the time you get
 
00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:43.880 align:start position:0%
down to line G you only have two
 
00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:46.430 align:start position:0%
down to line G you only have two
positions

00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:48.990 align:start position:0%
positions
left

00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
left
 
00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
govern close to that number I don't have
 
00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
it in front of me today but I know that
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
for example when we setting up some of
 
00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
our boards we have up to it's always an
 
00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:04.280 align:start position:0%
odd number it goes up to 9 to 15 I
 
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
believe for
 
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
co-ops so it's a it's a common number we
 
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
use 15 for number of things uh I'm not
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
questioning the number I'm just
 
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
questioning the minimum
 
00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:19.349 align:start position:0%
questioning the minimum
yeah

00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
good at least should be consistent
 
00:55:27.029 --> 00:55:27.039 align:start position:0%
with with the the listed require
 
00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
MERS I just and another thing to
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
remember is like there's a lot of
 
00:55:32.029 --> 00:55:32.039 align:start position:0%
superintendents that also hold a
 
00:55:34.029 --> 00:55:34.039 align:start position:0%
principal certificate that also hold
 
00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:35.960 align:start position:0%
teaching certificate so I mean some
 
00:55:37.829 --> 00:55:37.839 align:start position:0%
people could count as more than once too
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
so we we've got a there there is some
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
but further discussion we got to go back
 
00:55:53.029 --> 00:55:53.039 align:start position:0%
up now let's get this thing on Roman two
 
00:55:55.789 --> 00:55:55.799 align:start position:0%
did we resolve the consultation issue or
 
00:55:58.510 --> 00:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
not I heard we had not got there yet
 
00:56:01.309 --> 00:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'm I'm I'm in favor of using
 
00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
using language nominated by and and and
 
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
having the groups and you you know what
 
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
I I I know there's an infinite number of
 
00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
groups but but just looking at the the
 
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
groups that that regularly um come to
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
207 and um and attend hearings uh whe
 
00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
whether it's um School Board Association
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
or or School administrators Association
 
00:56:29.829 --> 00:56:29.839 align:start position:0%
uh reaching higher we've got uh the New
 
00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um um special Educators um is
 
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
it s special
 
00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:38.150 align:start position:0%
it s special
education

00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:56:44.589 --> 00:56:44.599 align:start position:0%
administrators SAA so so Jan B on uh and
 
00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
and and and then you know when it comes
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
to G we also have a lot of you know very
 
00:56:53.549 --> 00:56:53.559 align:start position:0%
interested you know uh people that may
 
00:56:57.069 --> 00:56:57.079 align:start position:0%
take have different views um on things
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
you know from you know Bonnie Dunham
 
00:57:05.069 --> 00:57:05.079 align:start position:0%
um well you also people that are doing
 
00:57:09.069 --> 00:57:09.079 align:start position:0%
the teaching of this at PSU and
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
Kean right they're they're very good in
 
00:57:16.029 --> 00:57:16.039 align:start position:0%
this area of U they have classes on it
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so I I I think having having you
 
00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:24.440 align:start position:0%
know people that that have spent a lot
 
00:57:27.029 --> 00:57:27.039 align:start position:0%
of time in this committee show
 
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:30.200 align:start position:0%
a a vested interest in um in the work
 
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
the state does in for on educational
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
standards and and student outcomes um
 
00:57:39.069 --> 00:57:39.079 align:start position:0%
having them make
 
00:57:41.349 --> 00:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
nominations uh the the commissioner
 
00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
shall appoint based on the those
 
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
nominations and uh and so I think much
 
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
of the language could could stay but but
 
00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
that each of the ones a
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
through a through F or a through G have
 
00:57:58.789 --> 00:57:58.799 align:start position:0%
um nominated
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
by you know New Hampshire you know I'm
 
00:58:03.069 --> 00:58:03.079 align:start position:0%
just looking at D New Hampshire
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
nominated by New Hampshire Schoolboard
 
00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
Association I actually disagree with
 
00:58:10.829 --> 00:58:10.839 align:start position:0%
that because I think it would be um in
 
00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
the purview of the commissioner to reach
 
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
out to those organizations to ask for
 
00:58:16.829 --> 00:58:16.839 align:start position:0%
nominations I'm not necessarily certain
 
00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:19.839 align:start position:0%
that that would have to be in
 
00:58:22.029 --> 00:58:22.039 align:start position:0%
statute and and I certainly would
 
00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
disagree with listing specific
 
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
organizations in statute
 
00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
oh it was in statute on the on the task
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
force not by organizations but by
 
00:58:35.069 --> 00:58:35.079 align:start position:0%
different um uh on the governor's task
 
00:58:38.309 --> 00:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
force based on on different different
 
00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:43.240 align:start position:0%
roles and um and you
 
00:58:47.309 --> 00:58:47.319 align:start position:0%
know given the given the the um you know
 
00:58:50.109 --> 00:58:50.119 align:start position:0%
the sort of the you know the nature of
 
00:58:55.069 --> 00:58:55.079 align:start position:0%
today's politics I I think having having
 
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
language that that more mirrors how the
 
00:59:01.470 --> 00:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
um how the governor's task force was
 
00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
established uh would uh would result not
 
00:59:09.069 --> 00:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
only in I think more um um uh you know
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
work that that is representative of the
 
00:59:14.069 --> 00:59:14.079 align:start position:0%
broad interests of of granite Staters
 
00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
but um but but also something that that
 
00:59:20.549 --> 00:59:20.559 align:start position:0%
is going to provide uh a good um a good
 
00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:24.520 align:start position:0%
work product that um that when it when
 
00:59:27.029 --> 00:59:27.039 align:start position:0%
it comes to the
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
oversight uh assessment and oversight um
 
00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:32.440 align:start position:0%
uh committee down in the bottom of page
 
00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
two uh is going to be something that
 
00:59:37.829 --> 00:59:37.839 align:start position:0%
that that has recommendations that can
 
00:59:40.589 --> 00:59:40.599 align:start position:0%
be um can be turned into into statute
 
00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
which I think is the whole you know
 
00:59:48.549 --> 00:59:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
this is there a term for serving on this
 
00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
I mean are we asking them to commit the
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:02.109 --> 01:00:02.119 align:start position:0%
Tass is there a is there a term for the
 
01:00:04.029 --> 01:00:04.039 align:start position:0%
length of a person that's on this task
 
01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:06.440 align:start position:0%
force how long do you see this task
 
01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
force Caitlyn or Nate continuing yeah it
 
01:00:12.190 --> 01:00:12.200 align:start position:0%
may continue because there is a process
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
which we have laid out there should
 
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
always be an oversight task force for
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
the accountability for an adequate
 
01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
education it will be something that be
 
01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:19.839 align:start position:0%
extremely helpful for the Department as
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
we you make changes and recommendations
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
um as far as terms we don't have terms
 
01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
on our EX task force it's typically a
 
01:00:30.829 --> 01:00:30.839 align:start position:0%
superintendent retires and so we need or
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
or moves to a role where they you know
 
01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
feel like they can't commit the amount
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
of time needed to it um because we like
 
01:00:40.349 --> 01:00:40.359 align:start position:0%
the consistency a lot of times uh it's
 
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
really helpful to have you know the
 
01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
people that have been on the federal
 
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
accountability task force for five six
 
01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
years now are probably some of the most
 
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
helpful because they remember why
 
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
certain things were written into the the
 
01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
plan and whatnot um but I mean having
 
01:00:56.910 --> 01:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
terms could be beneficial too we would
 
01:00:58.270 --> 01:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
want them staggered so we're not looking
 
01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
for new task force all at once and
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
things like that I that I mean that
 
01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
might be something that could be figured
 
01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
out over time and there will be probably
 
01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
natural attrition over time that we
 
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
law I guess I'm asking this question is
 
01:01:16.829 --> 01:01:16.839 align:start position:0%
is if we're looking to organizations
 
01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
we're kind of assigning a letter to
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
different organizations and I just
 
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
wonder if we want to commit ourselves to
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
that you know I
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
I I still think we need some latitude on
 
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
this that we want to have the very best
 
01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
people on here we can get regardless of
 
01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:39.160 align:start position:0%
where they come from uh we're talking
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
about our accountability system for
 
01:01:42.559 --> 01:01:44.270 align:start position:0%
about our accountability system for
education

01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
and it's important that these people
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
coming on have that great skill set it's
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
not like the public school
 
01:01:52.269 --> 01:01:52.279 align:start position:0%
infrastructure commission where we have
 
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
identified you will have Homeland
 
01:01:56.829 --> 01:01:56.839 align:start position:0%
Security director so the director leaves
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
a new director but the next director is
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
on it
 
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
automatically um the members from the
 
01:02:05.269 --> 01:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
senate in the house are appointed each
 
01:02:08.670 --> 01:02:08.680 align:start position:0%
year each by Anum by the president or
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
the speaker we we have a rotation but
 
01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:13.640 align:start position:0%
it's not built into
 
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
law uh right but Mr chair on on you know
 
01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
like you said you you're just talking
 
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
about the oversite um committee right
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
the members appointed by the president I
 
01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
was talking about the public school
 
01:02:26.349 --> 01:02:26.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Commission the
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
oversight's very similar very very
 
01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
similar to that but um but th those
 
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
those appointments are also based on um
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
the um the the you know the composition
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
of the the two the two Chambers the
 
01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:43.720 align:start position:0%
house and the house and the Senate and
 
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
the way this is currently drafted here
 
01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:48.200 align:start position:0%
all of the appointments of something
 
01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
that affects um 165,000 students um you
 
01:02:56.789 --> 01:02:56.799 align:start position:0%
know more if you include charters um you
 
01:02:59.269 --> 01:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
know Statewide all of the nomination all
 
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
the all of the appointments would come
 
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
from uh a single Source uh and um and I
 
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:09.400 align:start position:0%
I think given the given the broad uh
 
01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:12.799 align:start position:0%
impact that that this has that that
 
01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
having um you know having multiple
 
01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
organizations involved in in uh making
 
01:03:22.029 --> 01:03:22.039 align:start position:0%
those Rec making those nominations the
 
01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:24.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner could certainly select from
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
from those I'm not you know I I I think
 
01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
the structure of this that you know
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
provides for that uh is uh is real
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
important and and we've seen certainly
 
01:03:36.589 --> 01:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
multiple uh you
 
01:03:39.269 --> 01:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
know a number of organizations
 
01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
represented here over the 120ish bills
 
01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:47.240 align:start position:0%
we've had uh even this year Alone um
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
that uh that have shown a vested
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
interest in U in in student outcomes and
 
01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
and may have different approaches to it
 
01:03:57.269 --> 01:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
now that's fine but I think having a
 
01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
having a a task force that that is uh
 
01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
composed of people who are vested and
 
01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
skilled uh that can uh that can arrive
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
at an out you know Rec findings and
 
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations that you with with with
 
01:04:15.269 --> 01:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
with Dr Green and Miss Davis's support I
 
01:04:18.549 --> 01:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
think it's really important here
 
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
let if you go down to line 13 where six
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
or more individuals will hold a current
 
01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
naire certification superintendent
 
01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:29.720 align:start position:0%
assistant superintendent or curriculum
 
01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:32.799 align:start position:0%
administrator so which organizations
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
would the commissioner contact the State
 
01:04:38.910 --> 01:04:38.920 align:start position:0%
School administrators Association uh
 
01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:41.720 align:start position:0%
Elementary principals Association uh
 
01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
secondary admin the for for for for B
 
01:04:49.349 --> 01:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
and and but would the department have a
 
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
better handle
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
on which superintendant really have been
 
01:04:57.309 --> 01:04:57.319 align:start position:0%
involved with curriculum development and
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
test and measurement whereas there's
 
01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
some superintendants might be good uh
 
01:05:04.829 --> 01:05:04.839 align:start position:0%
CEOs from the perspective of finances
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
but not on the other side of the coin
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
they rely upon staff interworking within
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
that administrative group maybe like a
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester which has the support staff
 
01:05:17.309 --> 01:05:17.319 align:start position:0%
around so so yeah I and and I think
 
01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
nobody would have a better sense of that
 
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
when it comes to to uh School District
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
leadership than um than um uh you know
 
01:05:31.269 --> 01:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
Fu maybe maybe I you know because that
 
01:05:37.549 --> 01:05:37.559 align:start position:0%
changes too that does change you know if
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
you you could go back to the leadership
 
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
we once had there would they have yeah
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
well Dr Joyce yes I I have a lot of
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
faith in in in Mark but uh
 
01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
there I I I don't know Nate do you have
 
01:05:54.589 --> 01:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
anything to say on that I think
 
01:05:55.829 --> 01:05:55.839 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether it's written into
 
01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
statute or not the the work that we do
 
01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
with accountability and assessment can't
 
01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
be done without the support and
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
assistance of the organizations we
 
01:06:05.269 --> 01:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
regularly reach out to them um on our
 
01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
current threeyear Cycles we identify
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
about 90 schools around the state I'm
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
the one that calls each of those School
 
01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
principles to talk them through their
 
01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
data to let them know what the
 
01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
determination was to let them know what
 
01:06:17.589 --> 01:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
it's going to look like for the next you
 
01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
know year to two years to three years
 
01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
for their school so you know I I think
 
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different ways we could
 
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
write this in here regardless we're
 
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
going to be working with those
 
01:06:28.349 --> 01:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
associations I think whether it's in
 
01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
statute or not because just to do the
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
work itself we're working with all the
 
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
superintendents in the state We're
 
01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
working directly with the building
 
01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
principles we have a lot of sort of
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
active stakeholder groups that we reach
 
01:06:41.309 --> 01:06:41.319 align:start position:0%
out to when we're considering changing
 
01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
internal policies or we're looking at uh
 
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
you know taking different parts of our
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
state Assessments in different
 
01:06:48.109 --> 01:06:48.119 align:start position:0%
directions in order to keep up with
 
01:06:50.069 --> 01:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
current instructional Trends and you
 
01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
know what's happening as we move towards
 
01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
things like you know computer science
 
01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:55.240 align:start position:0%
and Ai and you know all the different
 
01:06:56.589 --> 01:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
things that are you know starting to
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
appear in classrooms that are you know
 
01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
new for teachers and new for students so
 
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
I think it's already an integral part of
 
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
the system we have in in place now um
 
01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
and I think to Caitlyn's Point too there
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
are a lot of superintendents in the
 
01:07:09.789 --> 01:07:09.799 align:start position:0%
state many of them have different
 
01:07:11.349 --> 01:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
backgrounds U many of them have
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
different interests that they're
 
01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
interested in whether it's curriculum
 
01:07:15.549 --> 01:07:15.559 align:start position:0%
instruction whether it's assessment
 
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's you know fiscal policy
 
01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
within their Community um and we tend to
 
01:07:21.069 --> 01:07:21.079 align:start position:0%
work really closely with the group of
 
01:07:22.829 --> 01:07:22.839 align:start position:0%
superintendents and principles who have
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
a really strong understanding of
 
01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
assessment and account accountability um
 
01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
so I I I would just throw it out there
 
01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
that I think we're we're currently doing
 
01:07:32.309 --> 01:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
that I think we work a lot with those
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
associations now even in the work that
 
01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
we're doing than thank thanks thanks
 
01:07:41.269 --> 01:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
very much um I'm I'm I'm satisfied with
 
01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
you Nate in working with these folks out
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
in the field you could probably come up
 
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:48.200 align:start position:0%
with a list of those people which have
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
the expertise in this area that really
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
show up when you're talking with them on
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
the horn or whatever they are probably
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
able to go down into the weeds and ask
 
01:07:59.349 --> 01:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
the type of questions which need to be
 
01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
asked rather than somebody say yes I'll
 
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
do it just send me the send me the form
 
01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
uh and and this is this is something we
 
01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
very frequently do like we have we have
 
01:08:09.390 --> 01:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
a question in the office like all right
 
01:08:10.589 --> 01:08:10.599 align:start position:0%
which superintendent should we consult
 
01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
and we we have our go-to that we know
 
01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
about that we like be able to answer
 
01:08:16.749 --> 01:08:16.759 align:start position:0%
that on the spot or or whatnot um one
 
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
thing we also just need to be make sure
 
01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:19.839 align:start position:0%
we're careful of too is just time and
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
consideration how much you know people
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
can dedicate to this just because a
 
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
superintendent has the knowledge doesn't
 
01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
mean they have the time or capacity
 
01:08:29.070 --> 01:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
given whatever challenges they're
 
01:08:30.269 --> 01:08:30.279 align:start position:0%
currently experiencing in the school
 
01:08:32.269 --> 01:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
district like a principal that's from a
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
school that's building a school might
 
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
not be able to participate in this task
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
force right now even though they have a
 
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
great expertise they need to put their
 
01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:41.560 align:start position:0%
resources on that so things like that
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
that's we're we're constantly
 
01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
considering that we're constantly
 
01:08:46.269 --> 01:08:46.279 align:start position:0%
working with that we are in consultation
 
01:08:49.309 --> 01:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
with nhsa very regularly um and school
 
01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
boards Association and and working
 
01:08:53.309 --> 01:08:53.319 align:start position:0%
through those committees make or those
 
01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
um those groups make it easier for us do
 
01:08:57.309 --> 01:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
our job
 
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
so so we'll rewrite Roman 2 there on
 
01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:03.349 align:start position:0%
so so we'll rewrite Roman 2 there on
line

01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
10 to try to integrate some of our
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
discussion which we've had here could
 
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
you help us do that Nate or or Caitlyn
 
01:09:14.829 --> 01:09:14.839 align:start position:0%
or do you want us to sit down as
 
01:09:17.309 --> 01:09:17.319 align:start position:0%
legislators to write in consultation or
 
01:09:20.749 --> 01:09:20.759 align:start position:0%
in with nomination from or
 
01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
whatever yeah I I think you could do it
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
in relatively General language kind of
 
01:09:27.149 --> 01:09:27.159 align:start position:0%
gets to the the heart of what we're
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
talking about here that's you know in
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
consultation with stakeholder groups and
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
associations in the state that are
 
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
involved with assessment and
 
01:09:35.349 --> 01:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
accountability work that's good to me
 
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
without identifying you know the
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
specific groups yeah how much of a time
 
01:09:43.829 --> 01:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
commitment do you think this
 
01:09:46.110 --> 01:09:46.120 align:start position:0%
involves or what was that well how much
 
01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
time do you think it will involve how
 
01:09:49.789 --> 01:09:49.799 align:start position:0%
just generally how long how much time
 
01:09:53.149 --> 01:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:58.350 --> 01:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:01.480 align:start position:0%
say in the I mean it probably yeah a
 
01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
fair amount um and I heard you just say
 
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
once a month I would say actually
 
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
probably more frequently than once a
 
01:10:11.149 --> 01:10:11.159 align:start position:0%
month I could see like doing two two-day
 
01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
meetings especially in the beginning
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
when we're really trying to get the work
 
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
and the organization and what not
 
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
planned uh it makes sense to do it more
 
01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
frequently too um backtack days just so
 
01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
people are not forgetting each month um
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
but I would say yeah in the first year
 
01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
probably at least two days a
 
01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
month this is a huge job uh we had a
 
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
person up in the district I was in that
 
01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
that was a sole job PhD and also was
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
teaching at the University of Alaska
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
Anchorage on this topic and was
 
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
extremely knowledgeable and spent
 
01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
fulltime doing
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
this and we're asking now to be done
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
through a task force here um so it's
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
going to be this is
 
01:10:59.950 --> 01:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
why when when Steve applebe chaired that
 
01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
committee with his assistant there we
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
always had the minutes went out the the
 
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
records were kept squared away we had
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
support we request information they made
 
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
the contacts to get the people in from
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
the field it wasn't all on the
 
01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
chair and I that's you know on every
 
01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
even like CTE Jeff beard does our
 
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
work um
 
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.830 align:start position:0%
work um
yes

01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:31.910 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
yes so so with that said what is the
 
01:11:39.229 --> 01:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
meaning of 2A 2A the commissioner
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
designate who shall S no no I'm talking
 
01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
down I'm talking down excuse me down at
 
01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:44.990 align:start position:0%
down I'm talking down excuse me down at
uh

01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
927 927 personal shall advise
 
01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
facilitate is that what we're talking
 
01:11:52.990 --> 01:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
about right so we we're going to be a
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
part of the task force but we're not
 
01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
saying that we're voting memb we need to
 
01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
be there we need to attend all of the
 
01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
meetings we're going to facilitate the
 
01:11:59.709 --> 01:11:59.719 align:start position:0%
meetings we're going to call the
 
01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:01.960 align:start position:0%
meetings do the Mee minutes call the
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
meeting get the resources there correct
 
01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
that's how you envision that two way
 
01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and I I think too when
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about pulling in outside
 
01:12:11.629 --> 01:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
groups there's you know New Hampshire is
 
01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
actually really lucky and that there are
 
01:12:15.149 --> 01:12:15.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of national assessment experts and
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
organizations that call New Hampshire
 
01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
home um several large National
 
01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
assessment companies um Center for
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
assessment which has done a lot of work
 
01:12:24.189 --> 01:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
with the Department um that's
 
01:12:26.189 --> 01:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
essentially built account systems for
 
01:12:28.350 --> 01:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
the state of Utah for Wyoming um they're
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
currently working directly with Hawaii
 
01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
so we have a lot of really good
 
01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
expertise here that while necessarily
 
01:12:35.229 --> 01:12:35.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be you know a specific member
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
on the task force the department would
 
01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
be able to pull them in based off of
 
01:12:39.629 --> 01:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the current
 
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
discussions when are the meetings you
 
01:12:42.910 --> 01:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
know this group over here has this
 
01:12:45.229 --> 01:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
expertise we got measured progress now
 
01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
cogy up in the SE Coast Area um so I I
 
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
also see that as part of what the
 
01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
department will be able to do because we
 
01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
have those connections with various
 
01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
assessment and accountability experts in
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
the state that can come in as needed and
 
01:12:59.590 --> 01:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
advise the task
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
force now are we good with that aine 12
 
01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
the commissioner designate that they
 
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
will be that individual will be a member
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
where I read this because it says uh
 
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
shall consist of the commissioner or
 
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
designate who
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
shall uh select the chairman or or is
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
the the chairman going to be elected by
 
01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
the at at the first
 
01:13:31.229 --> 01:13:31.239 align:start position:0%
meeting which often times turns back to
 
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
be somebody that's you know in charg and
 
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
has the resources to act as a chair um
 
01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I think that's challenging for
 
01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:41.719 align:start position:0%
the Department where we really expect it
 
01:13:43.629 --> 01:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
to be oversight and then we're putting
 
01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
the department on it um I think
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
obviously two meetings ago we had robust
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
conversations of how does the um
 
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
chairperson get elected and I would
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
imagine that is your response to doing
 
01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
that but I I don't know that you want
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
the department to be on the actual
 
01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
committee so much as just having the
 
01:14:06.990 --> 01:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
force represent cascaden um just add to
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
the discussion I had in my notes also
 
01:14:15.390 --> 01:14:15.400 align:start position:0%
that we talked about the task force
 
01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
should be elected once it is put
 
01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
together I didn't perceive the dep
 
01:14:20.830 --> 01:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed would be part of that
 
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
nine to 15 member
 
01:14:27.189 --> 01:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
group um let me see that that we that
 
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
the task force once it was put together
 
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
would elect a chair and it wouldn't be
 
01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
somebody from the Department of Ed
 
01:14:35.149 --> 01:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
because because of what their role is
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
didn't know if it would add value to add
 
01:14:39.189 --> 01:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
current employee or public school
 
01:14:42.629 --> 01:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
experience anywhere or even public in
 
01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
the school board member because it's
 
01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:47.960 align:start position:0%
very technical work
 
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
M um and then the last thing I mean I
 
01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
had a lot of what you had in your
 
01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:55.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment um
 
01:14:57.669 --> 01:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
I don't know I've never worked with a
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
curriculum director in my district and a
 
01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
lot of districts don't have that
 
01:15:05.790 --> 01:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
position does that matter here um as
 
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
long as there's one on the committee
 
01:15:09.790 --> 01:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
that represents the state is that what
 
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:17.070 --> 01:15:17.080 align:start position:0%
there so yeah so I think the the
 
01:15:19.229 --> 01:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
curriculum instructors that we work with
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
are excellent throughout the state but
 
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
you're right not every district has them
 
01:15:23.669 --> 01:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
and in many districts a superintendent
 
01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
or assistant superintendent really
 
01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:27.080 align:start position:0%
serves that role and so that's kind of
 
01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
why in that line six we had the
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
superintendent assistant superintendent
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
or sorry line 13 um be so superintendent
 
01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:36.760 align:start position:0%
assistant superintendent or curriculum
 
01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
administrator now the confusing thing is
 
01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
is though also now we have it down
 
01:15:44.629 --> 01:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
online 18 um so that's almost like two
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
of of those folks but they are a very
 
01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
important indiv the school districts
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
that have them that's the people that
 
01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:53.320 align:start position:0%
are doing the majority of this work in
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
in those school districts that's why we
 
01:15:59.350 --> 01:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:01.960 align:start position:0%
okay so you saying Kaylin you would take
 
01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
out line 12 the commissioner designate
 
01:16:05.790 --> 01:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
who shall select the chairman of the
 
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
task force to to keep that out I think
 
01:16:10.189 --> 01:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
that should actually be um down on line
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
27 if we're wanting the commissioner um
 
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
to select the chairman because I I think
 
01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:16.280 align:start position:0%
that was in response to we had these
 
01:16:17.550 --> 01:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
conversations about how do we get a
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
chairman so I think that really actually
 
01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
belongs down in 2A so the department
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
shall advise blah blah blah and then it
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
say the commissioner shall select the
 
01:16:27.629 --> 01:16:27.639 align:start position:0%
the um chairman if that's how you wanted
 
01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
to be or as representative cascaden just
 
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
said or have the committee the task
 
01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
force elected the task force could elect
 
01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
one that was definitely a big question
 
01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
that came up last time somebody's going
 
01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
to have to call the first meeting right
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
the commission could do that and I would
 
01:16:42.910 --> 01:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
think the commissioner would do that
 
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
call the first meeting and then at that
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
first meeting then you go through your
 
01:16:50.830 --> 01:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
electing duties put in
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
there that's very typical yeah okay y
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
that would make sense okay the
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner designate yeah call the
 
01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
first meeting
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
Y and chair elected it's usually when
 
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
when it's and if he's not going to be a
 
01:17:10.629 --> 01:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
member of it the commissioner does the
 
01:17:12.750 --> 01:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
calling he did remember the Civics book
 
01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
textbook stuff that was called by the
 
01:17:18.910 --> 01:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner and and then uh then we
 
01:17:22.030 --> 01:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
elected right a chair ltin yeah right
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
right and that's with most of them yeah
 
01:17:26.669 --> 01:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
the case in the case of the higher ed
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
task force uh it was the commissioner's
 
01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
design who um who called the meeting and
 
01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
and shared the uh and voted and voted
 
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
and voted well you know but but also
 
01:17:40.110 --> 01:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
important thing I think for this task
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
force too um is that it it was for the
 
01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
hirate task force we worked to consensus
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean isn't that how this this is
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
a work to consensus St sure is yeah yeah
 
01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so okay so the commissioner will
 
01:17:57.070 --> 01:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
not be a member or destiny will not be a
 
01:17:59.590 --> 01:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
member we know call the
 
01:18:03.709 --> 01:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
meeting and and and then they will and
 
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
start the meeting first meeting out and
 
01:18:10.350 --> 01:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
then elect the chair there and then back
 
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
then the technical support comes in to
 
01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:16.950 align:start position:0%
then the technical support comes in to
assist

01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
okay well would give you instead of two
 
01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
I'd give you
 
01:18:24.030 --> 01:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
three from Modern math is correct here
 
01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:26.189 align:start position:0%
three from Modern math is correct here
okay

01:18:26.189 --> 01:18:26.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:18:27.550 --> 01:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
which gives you
 
01:18:29.950 --> 01:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
know that's good because maybe you get
 
01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
more experts invol I don't know you
 
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
might yeah we might get a teacher yeah
 
01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:36.870 align:start position:0%
might yeah we might get a teacher yeah
okay

01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:18:40.229 --> 01:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
um so that takes us down so we'll take
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
the commission drop it down in the line
 
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
27 where it's 2A and write all that
 
01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
language in there Y and then we'll have
 
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
Nate help us write some language up top
 
01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
on line 10
 
01:18:55.790 --> 01:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
or yeah 10 11 there yep so that's good
 
01:18:59.430 --> 01:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
and then on item three there Roman three
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
the task force shall the following
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
duties um we wanted something in there
 
01:19:05.310 --> 01:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
like investigate and make
 
01:19:07.950 --> 01:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations regarding uh the
 
01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
applicability of the PB pbas program
 
01:19:16.030 --> 01:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
PBB as yeah program applicability
 
01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:17.070 align:start position:0%
PBB as yeah program applicability
Charter

01:19:17.070 --> 01:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
Charter
 
01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
wayil yeah leave it there so they can
 
01:19:26.110 --> 01:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
deal with that which they probably
 
01:19:27.550 --> 01:19:27.560 align:start position:0%
should touch
 
01:19:33.629 --> 01:19:33.639 align:start position:0%
on and and also and also and also um um
 
01:19:36.189 --> 01:19:36.199 align:start position:0%
alternative schol yeah alternative
 
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
schools that's a regular ongoing
 
01:19:40.149 --> 01:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
discussion that we have currently within
 
01:19:42.270 --> 01:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
my office um with my staff is you know
 
01:19:43.950 --> 01:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
the alternative programs charter schools
 
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
so I think that conversation could very
 
01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
easily feed into to this task force as
 
01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
well okay so we can put that in there um
 
01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
so would it be public Charters and
 
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
public public Alternatives or does it
 
01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
matter is that what you're thinking I
 
01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
think separate they're very very similar
 
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
I think you would want to look at at
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
both because you'd want to have some
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
kind of carve out that allows for
 
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
flexibility for schools that have
 
01:20:10.990 --> 01:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
alternative models which includes public
 
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
alternative schools and Charter Schools
 
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
yep is alternative schools the
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate term it it's that's the term
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
in statute yep that's okay yeah I think
 
01:20:21.629 --> 01:20:21.639 align:start position:0%
people understand that and and then also
 
01:20:25.550 --> 01:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
I think include in Roman 3 um
 
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh public comment and uh do we have
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities for public comment set up
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
by the task force langage for that but
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
with is it anywhere in here you know
 
01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
Consulting with with other other you
 
01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
know e experts and and uh and
 
01:20:55.149 --> 01:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
stakeholders uh you know like what we
 
01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
talked about with the with the
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
governor's task force and high where
 
01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
we does it need to be in statute or the
 
01:21:05.629 --> 01:21:05.639 align:start position:0%
task force just say well let's reach out
 
01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
to so and so they I'm not saying
 
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
reaching out to specific people but but
 
01:21:12.629 --> 01:21:12.639 align:start position:0%
that that uh because I think we have had
 
01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:14.920 align:start position:0%
this in commissions and other Tas task
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
forces before that that you you um um
 
01:21:23.390 --> 01:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh we we did and you're talking hyad we
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
did reach out to
 
01:21:27.310 --> 01:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
some of the to Nei and some of the other
 
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
organizations and and we found out that
 
01:21:30.830 --> 01:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
there have been three attempts for a
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
merger throughout the country and all
 
01:21:36.149 --> 01:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
three have failed um and and and that
 
01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
was one of the reports which we saw
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
right I think I think what
 
01:21:41.790 --> 01:21:41.800 align:start position:0%
representative luno is saying is that
 
01:21:44.790 --> 01:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
just that experts will be made available
 
01:21:47.149 --> 01:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
to the task force just a general
 
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
statement general statement reach out to
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
consult with with with others you don't
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
even need to call experts but consult
 
01:21:57.070 --> 01:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
with others outside you know yeah
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
outside entities or something like
 
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
that yeah you education commission stage
 
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
all these other things yeah
 
01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
yeah you probably do you need
 
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
it it's it's likely something we would
 
01:22:13.390 --> 01:22:13.400 align:start position:0%
do anyway so I don't think it needs to
 
01:22:16.510 --> 01:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
be written in somebody on Tas they're
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
going to do this research and research
 
01:22:21.189 --> 01:22:21.199 align:start position:0%
means Chas going out yeah there's a
 
01:22:22.830 --> 01:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
National Association of alternative
 
01:22:25.870 --> 01:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
schools um that focuses a lot of um
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
their effort on this there is not a
 
01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
chapter in New Hampshire there are a
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
couple of alternative schools in New
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that have looked to see what
 
01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
it would take to create a chapter of
 
01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
that Association here in the state so
 
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
that could be a national expert group
 
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
that we could reach out to um we have
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
some local uh Charter School groups the
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Charter School Alliance um
 
01:22:44.189 --> 01:22:44.199 align:start position:0%
is one that we could reach out to that
 
01:22:45.629 --> 01:22:45.639 align:start position:0%
sort of represents charter schools
 
01:22:47.229 --> 01:22:47.239 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire so there are groups
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
that we would likely reach out to okay
 
01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
let's let's move down so we can add
 
01:22:52.910 --> 01:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
something in there where where the
 
01:22:54.550 --> 01:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
research it's kind of a given there
 
01:22:57.550 --> 01:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
going to be doing that but uh Roman
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
four uh Department May provide stiens
 
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
mileage expense this is an addition
 
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
that's come
 
01:23:07.390 --> 01:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
in uh from the Department along with
 
01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
Roman 5 any unexpended funds from for
 
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:17.310 --> 01:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
going that was the
 
01:23:19.629 --> 01:23:19.639 align:start position:0%
date that's just an account that we have
 
01:23:21.310 --> 01:23:21.320 align:start position:0%
we may anticipate having some additional
 
01:23:22.990 --> 01:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
funds left over so we're trying to do it
 
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
with no additional cost so
 
01:23:26.590 --> 01:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
um we just saying those funds would
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
carry forward um so we had obviously a
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
lot of conversations last time about
 
01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
paying mileage and stiens and
 
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
reimbursements and things like that um
 
01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
if the department were to consult with
 
01:23:38.669 --> 01:23:38.679 align:start position:0%
one of those educational experts we
 
01:23:40.669 --> 01:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
assume there should be some costs um so
 
01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
the department was in we we so trying to
 
01:23:47.149 --> 01:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
not have any sort of associated cost
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
with this I was trying to find funding
 
01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
that may be um left over in this bium
 
01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
that we might have some excess funds
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
Maybe it might be 20 to $30,000 right
 
01:24:00.270 --> 01:24:00.280 align:start position:0%
now um it it really depends on like what
 
01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
you know we have so just trying to find
 
01:24:05.229 --> 01:24:05.239 align:start position:0%
just various lines of of of funding that
 
01:24:10.149 --> 01:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
so 11 12 might practice would it help
 
01:24:16.750 --> 01:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
for fiscal it does it does because
 
01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise those funds will lapse so
 
01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
without that there those funds will
 
01:24:23.550 --> 01:24:23.560 align:start position:0%
automatic lapse um in two months here
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
right yes right right and what what is
 
01:24:29.950 --> 01:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
that account number again um it's it's
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
our state uh State assessment account
 
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
right now so it's currently the funds um
 
01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
support the different assessment
 
01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
contracts right
 
01:24:43.109 --> 01:24:43.119 align:start position:0%
now so that date June 30 2025 is good uh
 
01:24:46.109 --> 01:24:46.119 align:start position:0%
that's I mean we would need 25 because
 
01:24:47.229 --> 01:24:47.239 align:start position:0%
that's our current budget right now
 
01:24:48.669 --> 01:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
that's the line we're trying to tell not
 
01:24:49.709 --> 01:24:49.719 align:start position:0%
to not
 
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
lapse um right right but um you know end
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
on when this task force actually wraps
 
01:24:57.430 --> 01:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
up because I think we really do need to
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
look at the time um that we've
 
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
designated here um we may want to add
 
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
that till 26th but we would need it
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
anyways for now to make sure this
 
01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
existing bium doesn't lapse so should
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
any unexpended funds for the bium in
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
account and leave out the date no we
 
01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
need the date need we need the date okay
 
01:25:19.149 --> 01:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
okay exactly okay y turn back into a
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:27.629 --> 01:25:27.639 align:start position:0%
we were we were looked we did look at
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
Romans 6 what about AB C and
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
D um it is in establishing the
 
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
performance space the task force may
 
01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
consider one or more of the following
 
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:38.990 align:start position:0%
consider one or more of the following
data

01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:25:44.109 --> 01:25:44.119 align:start position:0%
indicators and um what remember that
 
01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
Litany of indicators which we've seen
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
before we've taken them all out and just
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
reference that section of law um well we
 
01:25:55.229 --> 01:25:55.239 align:start position:0%
also took out you you know using line 13
 
01:25:57.910 --> 01:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the draft Yeah using only
 
01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
the best available account Bill any yeah
 
01:26:01.950 --> 01:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
that was a typo that was should have
 
01:26:05.109 --> 01:26:05.119 align:start position:0%
never been they with so that it's good
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
to get that out yes representative
 
01:26:10.350 --> 01:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
Bel representative vure had a lot of
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
questions about that and it should not
 
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
have been there it was confusing
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
resp and at some
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
point we have a lot of responsibility
 
01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:47.430 align:start position:0%
point we have a lot of responsibility
here

01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:26:49.790 --> 01:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
on so what the the task force would
 
01:26:51.790 --> 01:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
ultimately do is essentially determine
 
01:26:53.470 --> 01:26:53.480 align:start position:0%
you know a report that says these are
 
01:26:55.149 --> 01:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
the recommendations
 
01:26:57.070 --> 01:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
in order to do anything to move forward
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
with those recommendations the
 
01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
department would need legislation and so
 
01:27:03.070 --> 01:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee that we present
 
01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:04.639 align:start position:0%
this to would hopefully take that up
 
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
into the legislation and that
 
01:27:07.629 --> 01:27:07.639 align:start position:0%
legislation then would require the
 
01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:09.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to implement the
 
01:27:12.030 --> 01:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
results of that that legislation so
 
01:27:13.229 --> 01:27:13.239 align:start position:0%
that's when the department would start
 
01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:14.639 align:start position:0%
doing that work as soon as we have
 
01:27:24.510 --> 01:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
are there any other changes which we are
 
01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
issues we might want to discuss here on
 
01:27:36.149 --> 01:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
this um yeah on Roman six yeah so so
 
01:27:37.790 --> 01:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
we're taking out right using only the
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
best available accountability system
 
01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I've got in which shall be based on
 
01:27:46.590 --> 01:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
data and indicators taking out which are
 
01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
already provided to the department Andor
 
01:27:51.390 --> 01:27:51.400 align:start position:0%
performance measures that schools are
 
01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:52.669 align:start position:0%
performance measures that schools are
already

01:27:52.669 --> 01:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:27:57.310 --> 01:27:57.320 align:start position:0%
required um and then leaving in um
 
01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
provided to the department we'll edit
 
01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
there under state and federal laws or
 
01:28:06.629 --> 01:28:06.639 align:start position:0%
other available data is deemed you know
 
01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:09.560 align:start position:0%
relevant something like that because you
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
you you may want to consider the task
 
01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
force may want to
 
01:28:17.470 --> 01:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
consider that considers some some data
 
01:28:19.629 --> 01:28:19.639 align:start position:0%
that's now available but currently not
 
01:28:19.639 --> 01:28:20.510 align:start position:0%
that's now available but currently not
being

01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
collected I think yeah and I think we
 
01:28:26.109 --> 01:28:26.119 align:start position:0%
talk about writing that maybe I'm going
 
01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
to pull up what we but I I think we do
 
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
want to give I I think well I think we
 
01:28:33.149 --> 01:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
want the task force to be obviously very
 
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
conscious of what the department already
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
collects what schools are responsible
 
01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
for providing to the department because
 
01:28:40.189 --> 01:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
we don't want to add a bunch of
 
01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
indicators that we either can't collect
 
01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
or that is going to take a ton of time
 
01:28:46.229 --> 01:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
and what value is that going to be but I
 
01:28:48.910 --> 01:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
think we do want to give the um the task
 
01:28:50.830 --> 01:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
force the flexibility of using an
 
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
additional data set that we are maybe
 
01:28:56.270 --> 01:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
not think and there were a fair number
 
01:28:58.189 --> 01:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
Fair number of them thrown out last time
 
01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
in this room of X Y and Z so um I can
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
draft that to be um to add that
 
01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
flexibility that would be really but I
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
mean I think so there right now the
 
01:29:13.629 --> 01:29:13.639 align:start position:0%
department collects data because it is
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
required to report that data in the
 
01:29:19.149 --> 01:29:19.159 align:start position:0%
federal accountability system and so
 
01:29:22.709 --> 01:29:22.719 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why a similar type so
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
the state accountability system system
 
01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
requires us to so we're going to collect
 
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
the data required for
 
01:29:31.149 --> 01:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
that and I think to that you know if the
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
task force is looking at additional data
 
01:29:33.790 --> 01:29:33.800 align:start position:0%
to be collecting one of the
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
responsibilities would be to look at the
 
01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
feasibility if it's not currently
 
01:29:38.669 --> 01:29:38.679 align:start position:0%
collected like would there be a cost
 
01:29:40.669 --> 01:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
associated with that would it be born by
 
01:29:42.030 --> 01:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
the state or would it be born by local
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
school districts and what would that
 
01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:45.669 align:start position:0%
school districts and what would that
look

01:29:45.669 --> 01:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.189 --> 01:29:50.199 align:start position:0%
like so Kaitlyn so you're going to write
 
01:29:52.510 --> 01:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
some language for Roman six here I can
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:03.109 --> 01:30:03.119 align:start position:0%
and adding in or other relative data Etc
 
01:30:04.629 --> 01:30:04.639 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah
 
01:30:09.149 --> 01:30:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
um see other metrics as determined by
 
01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
the task force that gives them kind of a
 
01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:14.990 align:start position:0%
the task force that gives them kind of a
wide

01:30:14.990 --> 01:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
wide
 
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.709 align:start position:0%
wide
open

01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:16.719 align:start position:0%
open
 
01:30:21.070 --> 01:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:29.310 --> 01:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:31.229 --> 01:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
leave I mean I think we want the task
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
force to look what at what
 
01:30:37.070 --> 01:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
people I think they do yeah yeah and
 
01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
obviously I think having performance
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
data right it's performance-based
 
01:30:42.430 --> 01:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
accountability system we want to look at
 
01:30:43.950 --> 01:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
performance on the state assessment I
 
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
think it makes sense that that's listed
 
01:30:49.790 --> 01:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
as number one so okay so we're now down
 
01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:58.990 --> 01:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
so you're you're providing this
 
01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
information to the State Board of
 
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
Education and the legislative oversight
 
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
committee are you expecting any kind of
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
action from the legislative oversight
 
01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
committee well yes ultimately we would
 
01:31:15.750 --> 01:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
need legislation
 
01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
to yeah to enact the new accountability
 
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
system as result as a result of this
 
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
task force see it doesn't say that right
 
01:31:25.229 --> 01:31:25.239 align:start position:0%
now it says t for shall provide a report
 
01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
of findings and recommendations so the
 
01:31:28.990 --> 01:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
those recommendations and findings come
 
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
legislation and and that's
 
01:31:39.149 --> 01:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
so and it says to the State Board of
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
Education is it for
 
01:31:48.189 --> 01:31:48.199 align:start position:0%
future approval or is it you know or or
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
is it you're looking for yeah we want to
 
01:31:54.669 --> 01:31:54.679 align:start position:0%
go forward with this through legislation
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
that come from the do does it need more
 
01:32:03.510 --> 01:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
guess I don't can
 
01:32:08.590 --> 01:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
we we need to tell somebody to write a
 
01:32:10.510 --> 01:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
bill yeah I don't know but I don't know
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
how to do that um I don't know ifs has
 
01:32:15.629 --> 01:32:15.639 align:start position:0%
it but that that's exactly what happens
 
01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
and I don't know can we force anybody to
 
01:32:19.629 --> 01:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
write a bill on
 
01:32:21.629 --> 01:32:21.639 align:start position:0%
something add the word make
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
recomendations for future legation
 
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
CL and would that come from the
 
01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
oversight committee then so if we're
 
01:32:31.109 --> 01:32:31.119 align:start position:0%
presenting a report to that legislative
 
01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
oversight committee would the oversight
 
01:32:35.669 --> 01:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
committee then take the step to then
 
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
create a move forward a bill that would
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
actually enact the PBS uh see the
 
01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee is
 
01:32:45.149 --> 01:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
appointed by the speaker and the
 
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
president and see what year are we
 
01:32:48.159 --> 01:32:49.790 align:start position:0%
president and see what year are we
talking

01:32:49.790 --> 01:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
talking
 
01:32:52.109 --> 01:32:52.119 align:start position:0%
here will there even be a legislative
 
01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:58.159 --> 01:32:59.590 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:32:59.590 --> 01:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:33:01.709 --> 01:33:01.719 align:start position:0%
know yeah well
 
01:33:05.790 --> 01:33:05.800 align:start position:0%
see the bium ends the you're in right
 
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
now it ends so I think I think two
 
01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
things I I think the September 2025 is
 
01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
probably too ambitious when we put that
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
date we're going to have to push that
 
01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
out unfortunately um the department
 
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
would like this work done sooner rather
 
01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
than later um and when I know when we
 
01:33:23.189 --> 01:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
started drafting this last summer
 
01:33:26.430 --> 01:33:26.440 align:start position:0%
September 25 seemed really far away but
 
01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
now it does not seem that far so I would
 
01:33:30.910 --> 01:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
push it any further than I wouldn't push
 
01:33:32.669 --> 01:33:32.679 align:start position:0%
it out any further than November which
 
01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
would be the date most study committee
 
01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
reports are for for I think be really
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
challenging I think we need to push out
 
01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
a whole another year because I think
 
01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about I think that
 
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that when we're talking
 
01:33:47.310 --> 01:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
about the nomination process and just
 
01:33:48.990 --> 01:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
even in this room of who the appropriate
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
members are I think it's going to take
 
01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of time to get the the
 
01:33:54.990 --> 01:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
initial task course
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
organized um by the time this
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
legislation passes so assuming that you
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
all get it done and get through
 
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference it gets signed
 
01:34:02.990 --> 01:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
on the governor's desk it goes 60 days
 
01:34:05.709 --> 01:34:05.719 align:start position:0%
it goes in place in September we can't
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
ask schools to start thinking about who
 
01:34:09.070 --> 01:34:09.080 align:start position:0%
should be on this task force September
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
and October no superintendent is going
 
01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
to sign up to do anything on September
 
01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
or October nor or Nate and I because
 
01:34:16.590 --> 01:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
we're gonna be so then we're talking
 
01:34:21.149 --> 01:34:21.159 align:start position:0%
about late fall and so September is is
 
01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
is too ambitious right right so if you
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
have November
 
01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
2025 that that would give the task force
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
a year I I still think I think we
 
01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
probably need to push it out for another
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
about June 30
 
01:34:37.109 --> 01:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
2025 that's 26 26 ex 26 26 I think
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's probably 26 I think that's that
 
01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
school year doable yeah I think that's
 
01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
more doable because you're not going to
 
01:34:45.149 --> 01:34:45.159 align:start position:0%
get a whole lot of work done by anybody
 
01:34:48.510 --> 01:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
during July August September right no I
 
01:34:51.790 --> 01:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
I think June 26 is I think probably is
 
01:35:06.109 --> 01:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:06.119 --> 01:35:10.590 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:35:10.590 --> 01:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:13.390 --> 01:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
okay we still didn't though resolve the
 
01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:16.360 align:start position:0%
so will the oversight committee I mean
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
so they bring this report will the
 
01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
oversight I mean
 
01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
obvious some of you are here that are on
 
01:35:25.229 --> 01:35:25.239 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee
 
01:35:26.430 --> 01:35:26.440 align:start position:0%
what if nobody on the oversight
 
01:35:27.709 --> 01:35:27.719 align:start position:0%
committee wants to move forward
 
01:35:30.189 --> 01:35:30.199 align:start position:0%
legislation like what do we do about
 
01:35:34.669 --> 01:35:34.679 align:start position:0%
that that's question Yeah well yeah I
 
01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159 align:start position:0%
mean you know anybody can file
 
01:35:38.109 --> 01:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
legislation yeah somebody could file
 
01:35:41.310 --> 01:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
legislation to have a pbass that does
 
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
something completely different than the
 
01:35:47.109 --> 01:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
TK Force Rec course so so I think um I
 
01:35:49.790 --> 01:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
think this is where good intentions
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
comes in okay that that that I think you
 
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
would find good intentions among a
 
01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
bipartisan group on the oversight
 
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
committee to file legislation okay yeah
 
01:36:00.350 --> 01:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
so I I you know that makes sense yeah
 
01:36:01.870 --> 01:36:01.880 align:start position:0%
that that that makes sense that makes
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
sense yeah and we're and but I also I
 
01:36:06.109 --> 01:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
would also think as we talked about it
 
01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
on line 24 it says report findings and
 
01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:11.910 align:start position:0%
on line 24 it says report findings and
make

01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
make
 
01:36:14.270 --> 01:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations I think I think that
 
01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
putting the word make in there I think
 
01:36:18.430 --> 01:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
makes it a little stronger as it relates
 
01:36:26.830 --> 01:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:30.030 --> 01:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
yeah that that works to me make
 
01:36:31.709 --> 01:36:31.719 align:start position:0%
recommendations in legislative oversite
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
commit is going to have y or nay ex yeah
 
01:36:39.070 --> 01:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
yeah and if you pick you know a elected
 
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
official pick a
 
01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:43.550 align:start position:0%
official pick a
representative

01:36:43.550 --> 01:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't come to us at the last
 
01:36:48.189 --> 01:36:48.199 align:start position:0%
moment from the other side the
 
01:36:52.510 --> 01:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:52.520 --> 01:37:22.510 align:start position:0%
 
same

01:37:22.510 --> 01:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:52.430 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:52.440 --> 01:38:22.430 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:52.430 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:52.440 --> 01:39:22.350 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:39:22.350 --> 01:39:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:52.310 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
