to the committee
 
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 align:start position:0%
the reason why can can everybody hear me
 
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
thank you the reason why I put this in
 
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
for my constituent is that he is a
 
00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 align:start position:0%
camper big time he has rebuilt a vintage
 
00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 align:start position:0%
1980s Airstream
 
00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 align:start position:0%
from the inside out it's worth a lot of
 
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 align:start position:0%
buckos and he camps all over New England
 
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 align:start position:0%
he keeps camps in New Hampshire when he
 
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
goes to Massachusetts he gets very upset
 
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
because they charge out of state
 
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
residents out of state rates
 
00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 align:start position:0%
we in New Hampshire do not
 
00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 align:start position:0%
and he is going why don't we charge a
 
00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 align:start position:0%
little bit more to out-of-state campers
 
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
to come to New Hampshire to our great
 
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
wonderful White Mountain State
 
00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 align:start position:0%
when they charge us a lot more to camp
 
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 align:start position:0%
on their beaches and their little bumps
 
00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 align:start position:0%
called mountains out in the western part
 
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts
 
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
for if we charge 25 a night here they
 
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 align:start position:0%
charge 55 a night down in Massachusetts
 
00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
for the same type of camping and he and
 
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
the campers Association which he is part
 
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
of are very upset that they get ripped
 
00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
off when they have to go to
 
00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts for meetings or on the
 
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
regional camping associations and that
 
00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
is why I put in the bill he's very upset
 
00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 align:start position:0%
about the pricing
 
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
he hopes that New Hampshire would
 
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.550 align:start position:0%
he hopes that New Hampshire would
consider

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
up charging out-of-state residents uh
 
00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 align:start position:0%
some more money which is basically free
 
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 align:start position:0%
income for our great wonderful Granite
 
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
State and uh oh yeah the reservation
 
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.270 align:start position:0%
State and uh oh yeah the reservation
system

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
when you go to Pawtuckaway during the
 
00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
summer you can see nothing but white and
 
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
red license plates
 
00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 align:start position:0%
because they get in early they get the
 
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
reservations and if you live in New
 
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you go in try to get a
 
00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699 align:start position:0%
reservation anywhere say south of
 
00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:43.010 align:start position:0%
reservation anywhere say south of
Concord

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
Concord
 
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
you can't if you go further up in the
 
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
state you'll get a reservation
 
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
but you'll still see a lot of white and
 
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 align:start position:0%
red license plates and it's it should be
 
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
nice if New Hampshire residents had
 
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.110 align:start position:0%
nice if New Hampshire residents had
priority

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
priority
 
00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
on reservations so that they could get
 
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
in and camp in their own state
 
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
and then open it up to anybody else who
 
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
wants to come in at an out of state
 
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.810 align:start position:0%
wants to come in at an out of state
pricing

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 align:start position:0%
pricing
 
00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:11.639 align:start position:0%
so it's more Revenue it's New Hampshire
 
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
resident favorable
 
00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
and uh if he were here I wish he could
 
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
talk about it more but like I said he's
 
00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:21.539 align:start position:0%
a chiropractor and he may have uh
 
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
clients that he couldn't uh change
 
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 align:start position:0%
so that is my testimony
 
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
and I if anybody has any questions I'd
 
00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 align:start position:0%
be happy to take them
 
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 align:start position:0%

representative

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
spelling name right I know another
 
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
person who calls himself pot a check so
 
00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:44.819 align:start position:0%
I've been called a lot of different
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
names by a lot of different people and
 
00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539 align:start position:0%
my students back when I was teaching
 
00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:52.460 align:start position:0%
Middle School it was Mr P okay uh anyway
 
00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:55.259 align:start position:0%
do you have any Revenue estimate does
 
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
this has been about the squat isn't it
 
00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
pretty much its principle I don't have
 
00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:01.139 align:start position:0%
any information from him if he was here
 
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
he would have had all the information uh
 
00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:05.639 align:start position:0%
what I will do is I'll contact him and
 
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
if he does have some some information
 
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
testimony or documentation that I can uh
 
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
pass out to you I'll get it to the chair
 
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
or to representative genagian or
 
00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
representative Platt
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
ideally if you could have him email the
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
entire committee house Ways and Means I
 
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.089 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:07:38.089 --> 00:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:43.139 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm representative Ames uh
 
00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:46.039 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the campers Association
 
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:49.860 align:start position:0%
as a group that your constituents are
 
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
part of and that they're supportive of
 
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
this initiative I assume that uh uh an
 
00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
association of people who go to camps
 
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
not campgrounds and what I'm wondering
 
00:08:05.809 --> 00:08:05.819 align:start position:0%
is uh a if that's correct and if they're
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
taking a position on this legislation
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
and then B whether there's a campground
 
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
Association or Campground some kind of
 
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
grouping that has expressed interest in
 
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
this matter and if so what their
 
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
possession would be
 
00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
I didn't get a lot of that
 
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
representative I can barely hear you but
 
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
the information that I could make out I
 
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:34.860 align:start position:0%
got is from uh from my constituent
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm not
 
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:40.140 align:start position:0%
privy to the information that he has is
 
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
the association that he belongs to of
 
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
campers of New England uh as far as I
 
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:50.700 align:start position:0%
know the information I would I would not
 
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
take you know without the veracity of it
 
00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
so I'm just taking it as as his word
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Doucette thank
 
00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:01.860 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for taking
 
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
my question representative
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
um is there any information you you uh
 
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned giving priority to New
 
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:11.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Citizens First it's not
 
00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in this proposed bill
 
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
that talks to that and I guess I'm just
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's other states that
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
do that because I'm kind of curious as
 
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
to the constitutionality of of the State
 
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire being able to do
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
something of that nature and to Echo
 
00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:33.959 align:start position:0%
what representative uh Platt said
 
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
uh we probably need some testimony from
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
the revenue side of things and how that
 
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
would work and I understand it does
 
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
happen in other states but the
 
00:09:47.329 --> 00:09:47.339 align:start position:0%
prioritization of New Hampshire Citizens
 
00:09:47.339 --> 00:09:48.470 align:start position:0%
prioritization of New Hampshire Citizens
First

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
First
 
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:50.220 align:start position:0%
you mentioned it it's not in the piece
 
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
here I'm just wondering what your
 
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
thought process is on that thank you
 
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:56.220 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh
 
00:09:58.730 --> 00:09:58.740 align:start position:0%
representative Duke Set uh like I said
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
my constituent has all the information I
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
just put this in for him but we have
 
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
talked about it he said yeah they do
 
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
they do have priority for in-state
 
00:10:11.449 --> 00:10:11.459 align:start position:0%
residents at some of these states uh
 
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
when they take reservations from their
 
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
own residence first
 
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:17.940 align:start position:0%
and then they open it up to out of state
 
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
so I'm just looking at reciprocation and
 
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
it's just a recommendation this bill has
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
nothing casting concrete it's just a
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh to look at the pricing
 
00:10:35.449 --> 00:10:35.459 align:start position:0%
and if if they wanted to I'm sure that
 
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
they could take it upon himself to look
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
at a reservation system
 
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
I mean we don't have to direct them to
 
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
them of course I'm quite sure that if
 
00:10:47.769 --> 00:10:47.779 align:start position:0%
there's Revenue to be had
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
uh they could they could do it on their
 
00:10:52.079 --> 00:10:54.350 align:start position:0%
uh they could they could do it on their
own

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920 align:start position:0%

according to market conditions and
 
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
Trends as is the common practice in

Private Industry
 
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 216a1 the intent of the

general court that accomp it is the
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
intent of the general court that a
 
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
comprehensive State Park system shall be
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
developed operated and maintained to
 
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
achieve four purposes which include
 
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
continually providing Park areas and
 
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
Facilities as may be necessary to meet
 
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
the recreational need of the citizens of
 
00:15:32.329 --> 00:15:32.339 align:start position:0%
all regions of the state as well to
 
00:15:34.129 --> 00:15:34.139 align:start position:0%
encourage and support tourism and
 
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
related economic activity in the state
 
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:38.519 align:start position:0%
the department just strives to balance
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
these priorities in part by continually
 
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
examining fee structures visitation data
 
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
and other metrics to inform
 
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:46.740 align:start position:0%
recommendations for adjustments to
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
camping fees
 
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:50.220 align:start position:0%
the department has considered a separate
 
00:15:51.769 --> 00:15:51.779 align:start position:0%
fee schedule for non-residents who
 
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
access state parks campgrounds however
 
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
with 65 percent of our campers coming
 
00:15:58.129 --> 00:15:58.139 align:start position:0%
from out of state we are concerned that
 
00:15:59.930 --> 00:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
campers will elect to go elsewhere
 
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
thereby resulting in a negative
 
00:16:03.769 --> 00:16:03.779 align:start position:0%
Financial impact to the self-funded
 
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
state park system Additionally the land
 
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
and water conservation fund monies that
 
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
were used to develop and improve state
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
park campgrounds under the lwcf program
 
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:17.480 align:start position:0%
rules it prohibits unequal access to
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
lwcf funded public lands based on
 
00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.530 align:start position:0%
lwcf funded public lands based on
residency

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
residency
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
we recognize that some New Hampshire
 
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
campers experience difficulties in
 
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
reserving the campsite and dates of
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
their choice as many in the outdoor
 
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
industry can attest the covid-19
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
pandemic created a much greater than
 
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
normal interest in Outdoor Pursuits the
 
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
division has made great strides in
 
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
improving the campground reservation
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
process over the years this Trends
 
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
includes a great emphasis on online
 
00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
reservations which account for 94
 
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
percent of all of our reservations
 
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
versus three percent that call from a
 
00:16:53.689 --> 00:16:53.699 align:start position:0%
call center fulfillment additionally the
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
division has implemented a lottery
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
reservation system which levels the
 
00:16:59.329 --> 00:16:59.339 align:start position:0%
playing field with respect to the
 
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
opening of inventory and many Savvy
 
00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:03.959 align:start position:0%
Savvy campers knowing to reserve the
 
00:17:05.449 --> 00:17:05.459 align:start position:0%
very minute inventory becomes available
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
this program is very successful at
 
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
Hampton Beach State Park campground and
 
00:17:11.929 --> 00:17:11.939 align:start position:0%
Jericho Mountain State Park both which
 
00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:13.860 align:start position:0%
see some of the system's highest
 
00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
occupancy rates thank you for the
 
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide testimony and
 
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
additional information on hb60 pursuant
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
to RS say 216 a3g the department
 
00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:26.339 align:start position:0%
currently has the authority to set fees
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
including fees charged to non-residents
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are you
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
open to questions absolutely great
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
representative pled
 
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
I always think of questions
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
um have you done a survey of what the
 
00:17:42.049 --> 00:17:42.059 align:start position:0%
fees are in other states to see whether
 
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:43.980 align:start position:0%
if we went up a little bit we'd still be
 
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
competitive yes we have
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
um we continually do this and as most
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
recently approximately a year ago
 
00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:55.860 align:start position:0%
um there was a comprehensive report
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
provided by our our staff that was
 
00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
shared with the state park advisory
 
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
Council who advises the director on
 
00:18:09.169 --> 00:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
policy of the state park system and at
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
the time there were considerations and
 
00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:14.820 align:start position:0%
even some recommendations for increases
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
to fees for non-residents and and
 
00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
consultation with the governor's office
 
00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
at that time it was determined that it
 
00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to move forward at that
 
00:18:27.409 --> 00:18:27.419 align:start position:0%
time however
 
00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:30.419 align:start position:0%
um as as I indicated in the testimony we
 
00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
have the ability to continue to do so
 
00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
and um and we'll be doing reviewing
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
doing that again with our state park
 
00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you on you it used to be that you
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
were severely underfunded in money for
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
Park maintenance
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
is that still the case and is would hire
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
fees in certain areas work work for you
 
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
for that and on is there the possibility
 
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
of having higher fees in the more
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
popular parks that are hard to get
 
00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:16.919 align:start position:0%
reservations in
 
00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:19.799 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
um the state park system is designed to
 
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
be operationally self-funded
 
00:19:27.169 --> 00:19:27.179 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:30.799 align:start position:0%
um we have done a very good job of
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
establishing our programs and our
 
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
operations both on our revenue and
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
expense side
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
to remain solvent
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
um and are I would say in in very good
 
00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:46.700 align:start position:0%
Financial Health
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
the asterisk to that that I would I
 
00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
would add is that
 
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
um it was not by Design created to
 
00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
provide for Capital Improvements which
 
00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:01.740 align:start position:0%
can be in tens and or in our case uh
 
00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:03.500 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars in
 
00:20:06.169 --> 00:20:06.179 align:start position:0%
backlog of deferred maintenance however
 
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:08.700 align:start position:0%
operationally we we've been doing very
 
00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:09.830 align:start position:0%
operationally we we've been doing very
well

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:20:12.049 --> 00:20:12.059 align:start position:0%
um and a lot of that revenue does go
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
back uh for operational maintenance of
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
our Park system and and part of the
 
00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
design for us to have the ability to
 
00:20:24.049 --> 00:20:24.059 align:start position:0%
review our fee structure and create
 
00:20:27.789 --> 00:20:27.799 align:start position:0%
changes to that is is in part to help
 
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
continually be able to make sure that we
 
00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
are competitive and kind of striking
 
00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:36.299 align:start position:0%
that balance of creating accessible
 
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
opportunities both for residents and
 
00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
non-residents that are affordable but
 
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:48.049 --> 00:20:48.059 align:start position:0%
representative Ellery
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
um this lwcf fund
 
00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
um who sets the rules and uh who manages
 
00:20:58.610 --> 00:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
the program sure uh the lwcf is the land
 
00:21:00.169 --> 00:21:00.179 align:start position:0%
and water conservation fund it's a
 
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
program administered by the National
 
00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:03.179 align:start position:0%
Park Service so through the department
 
00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
of interior
 
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
um it's a federal program
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
um to which all 50 states uh participate
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
and have received tens of millions of
 
00:21:15.169 --> 00:21:15.179 align:start position:0%
dollars since uh since it's been
 
00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:17.900 align:start position:0%
established I believe in the mid 60s
 
00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
primarily for recreational outdoor
 
00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
recreational lands acquisition and
 
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
recreational improvements
 
00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:27.620 align:start position:0%
um virtually every single Campground
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
within the park system has received lwcf
 
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:39.409 --> 00:21:39.419 align:start position:0%
requirement on
 
00:21:42.649 --> 00:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
um basically uh against discrimination
 
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
based on residency so for that there was
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
some comments earlier with respect to
 
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
the timing of reservations so this is
 
00:21:53.169 --> 00:21:53.179 align:start position:0%
something that we've looked at
 
00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
previously and have found under guidance
 
00:22:00.169 --> 00:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
from the National Park Service that we
 
00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
cannot allow for earlier reservations
 
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
for residents
 
00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
um than non-residents however we do have
 
00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:14.039 align:start position:0%
the ability to provide for a separate
 
00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:16.860 align:start position:0%
fee structure as long as within uh
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
within reason
 
00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.310 align:start position:0%
within reason
right

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up quickly yes uh thank
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
you uh from your previous testimony it
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
was under the impression that no state
 
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
could uh charge two separate fees but
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
you can charge you're now saying that a
 
00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:35.820 align:start position:0%
separate fee for a non-resident is
 
00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:41.940 align:start position:0%
allowed under the lwcf rules and uh that
 
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
can be set by the states under their own
 
00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.010 align:start position:0%
can be set by the states under their own
rules

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
and since we have a lot of experience
 
00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:51.059 align:start position:0%
doing that with cigarettes and you're
 
00:22:54.289 --> 00:22:54.299 align:start position:0%
only allowed we want better too uh with
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and alcohol and everything
 
00:22:59.690 --> 00:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
else I should not be that much of a
 
00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:01.580 align:start position:0%
difficulty to
 
00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
undertake such an activity and still cut
 
00:23:06.409 --> 00:23:06.419 align:start position:0%
the undercut every other state
 
00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:12.140 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.049 align:start position:0%
would you believe
[Laughter]

00:23:15.049 --> 00:23:15.059 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
representative Malloy
 
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:25.980 align:start position:0%
Mr Wilson I would uh for my own purposes
 
00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
I would like to see some context here
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
just how much money we're talking about
 
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
what is the revenue from the fees now
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
what are we thinking about is there a
 
00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
number for that and then I can
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
in my own view I can take a look at
 
00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
what changes might happen if we change
 
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
fees and that sort of thing that's all
 
00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:48.299 align:start position:0%
thank you if I could see the revenue
 
00:23:51.529 --> 00:23:51.539 align:start position:0%
number that's my question thank you
 
00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
is that something that um we I I'm happy
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
to share with with the committee here I
 
00:23:59.149 --> 00:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
have a few figures
 
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
um that may provide some context so in
 
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh 2022 the calendar year
 
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
um the division brought in three point a
 
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
little over 3.8 million dollars in
 
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
camping fees across the um uh Campground
 
00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.990 align:start position:0%
camping fees across the um uh Campground
system

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
um that's uh equates to 50 a little over
 
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
56 000 separate reservations and
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
um our camper account for 2022 included
 
00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.549 align:start position:0%
um our camper account for 2022 included
132

00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
132
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
000 campers visited throughout the
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
system and again uh about approximately
 
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
65 percent of that revenue and and those
 
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
other figures for that matter uh are
 
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
equated to out-of-state visitation
 
00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
representative uh doucets
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question you you mentioned in
 
00:24:54.169 --> 00:24:54.179 align:start position:0%
your testimony that the uh the fees
 
00:24:57.289 --> 00:24:57.299 align:start position:0%
self-fund the department
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
um except for Capital expenditures I'm
 
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
kind of curious as to whether we can get
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
some kind of report and see as to what
 
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
the revenues were I'm making the natural
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
assumption that the profit margin might
 
00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
have been a little ticked up in the last
 
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
couple years uh we have a great product
 
00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
a great state for people to come to and
 
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
and they did so I'm wondering where
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
those revenues if you're in the black do
 
00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
those come back to the general fund
 
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
through those uh sustain another program
 
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
within the department I'm just kind of
 
00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
curious if you can speak to that sure
 
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative
 
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
um so the uh the state park fund uh
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
generally what what how we refer to it
 
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
is a non-lapsing fund
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
um set up that revolves
 
00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
um so uh the the state park system has
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
the unique ability to be run and uh in
 
00:25:50.279 --> 00:25:51.890 align:start position:0%
the unique ability to be run and uh in
Enterprise

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
Enterprise
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
um perspective that um any year that we
 
00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:58.140 align:start position:0%
operate in the black we maintain a
 
00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.450 align:start position:0%
operate in the black we maintain a
balance

00:25:59.450 --> 00:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
balance
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
um that carry over carries over uh
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
carries forward each year and that has
 
00:26:06.649 --> 00:26:06.659 align:start position:0%
been the case for several years so it's
 
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
been it's been a long time I believe
 
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
leave since the state's Park system has
 
00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:13.460 align:start position:0%
operated in the red
 
00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:16.940 align:start position:0%
however there is also statutory language
 
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
that sets a minimum requirement for that
 
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
fund to maintain and as uh we know in
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
the outdoor recreation industry it
 
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't take much uh bad weather or or a
 
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:32.700 align:start position:0%
tough season for things to kind of go in
 
00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
the other direction so that's why we are
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
both kind of very cognizant of how we're
 
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
managing that on a year-to-year basis
 
00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
representative jinnegan thank you madam
 
00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:48.900 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:26:51.769 --> 00:26:51.779 align:start position:0%
um on the second left last paragraph you
 
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
end with the lwcf program rules
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
prohibits unequal access
 
00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
um to lwcf funded public lands so I
 
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.070 align:start position:0%
um to lwcf funded public lands so I
guess

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
guess
 
00:27:03.649 --> 00:27:03.659 align:start position:0%
um a little confused when you when you
 
00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
then said that um
 
00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
States could charge
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
non-residents different rates doesn't
 
00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:12.539 align:start position:0%
charging a different rate cause unequal
 
00:27:12.539 --> 00:27:15.169 align:start position:0%
charging a different rate cause unequal
access

00:27:15.169 --> 00:27:15.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:15.179 --> 00:27:16.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
according to the uh National Park
 
00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:20.940 align:start position:0%
Service no
 
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
um it it it doesn't
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
um it's more
 
00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
um on the timing of the accessibility
 
00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
that so that each and every day there's
 
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:34.140 align:start position:0%
the equal access uh afforded to
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
Residents and non-residents as far as
 
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:36.890 align:start position:0%
Residents and non-residents as far as
coming

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:36.900 align:start position:0%
coming
 
00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
um but it doesn't
 
00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
directly speak to the fee structure uh
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
in that and part of the reason for us
 
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
including that uh here was um we just
 
00:27:48.529 --> 00:27:48.539 align:start position:0%
wanted to be clear that
 
00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.039 align:start position:0%
um there's a differentiation I think
 
00:27:51.649 --> 00:27:51.659 align:start position:0%
we've kind of touched on it here as well
 
00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:53.940 align:start position:0%
of both the timing and the ability for
 
00:27:57.890 --> 00:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
residents to get free access over uh
 
00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:00.900 align:start position:0%
non-residents in in addition to a
 
00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
separate fee structure which are two
 
00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
separate things thank you
 
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%

a dog a mutt and Sutton
 
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 121 FN is an act relative
 
00:33:06.769 --> 00:33:06.779 align:start position:0%
to worldwide combined reporting for
 
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
unitary businesses under the business
 
00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
profits tax this bill would repeal the
 
00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:15.620 align:start position:0%
water's edge combined group provisions
 
00:33:19.549 --> 00:33:19.559 align:start position:0%
of the business profits tax in
 
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
consultation with Madam chair and
 
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
ranking member representative almi this
 
00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
presentation will be a thirty thousand
 
00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
foot overview of making the New
 
00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire tax structure more Equitable
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
by requiring multinationals to pay their
 
00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:38.700 align:start position:0%
fair share eliminating the unfair
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
Advantage they currently enjoy at the
 
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
expense of New Hampshire businesses and
 
00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:46.380 align:start position:0%
domestic companies
 
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
tax policy created by this committee and
 
00:33:51.889 --> 00:33:51.899 align:start position:0%
passed by the New Hampshire legislature
 
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:33:56.169 --> 00:33:56.179 align:start position:0%
to make sure that New Hampshire policies
 
00:33:58.909 --> 00:33:58.919 align:start position:0%
enable the state to meet its obligations
 
00:34:00.529 --> 00:34:00.539 align:start position:0%
to our citizens
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
while assuring a fair and Level Playing
 
00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:07.019 align:start position:0%
Field for all businesses operating in
 
00:34:10.129 --> 00:34:10.139 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in paying their true
 
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
profits tax
 
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
the problem is that by implementing in
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
the 1986 legislature the water's edge
 
00:34:22.369 --> 00:34:22.379 align:start position:0%
method of Taxation on the recommendation
 
00:34:24.649 --> 00:34:24.659 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Ways and Means
 
00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:25.550 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Ways and Means
Committee

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
Committee
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
it provided unintended consequences for
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
the past 37 years that grants a tax
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
advantage to foreign-based corporations
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
with U.S subsidiaries operating in New
 
00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:40.730 align:start position:0%
with U.S subsidiaries operating in New
Hampshire

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
the tax advantage is caused when
 
00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:45.419 align:start position:0%
domestic or New Hampshire companies
 
00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:48.419 align:start position:0%
cannot use the same accounting tools
 
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
that multinationals use when engaged in
 
00:34:55.369 --> 00:34:55.379 align:start position:0%
many inter-corporate transactions with
 
00:34:58.490 --> 00:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
their foreign subsidiary located in New
 
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when determining their
 
00:35:05.089 --> 00:35:05.099 align:start position:0%
business profits tax those tools are
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
called intangibles the intangible assets
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
lack physical existence and are not
 
00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:12.599 align:start position:0%
financial instruments
 
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
by these multinational inter-corporate
 
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
transactions with their New Hampshire
 
00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:23.420 align:start position:0%
subsidiary or subsidiaries is to reduce
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
their State corporate income tax
 
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
liability which leads to tax avoidance
 
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
of an estimated Revenue dollar amount of
 
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
140 to 170 million dollars each year
 
00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
the solution to this tax avoidance is to
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
treat the parent and it's integrated and
 
00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:47.460 align:start position:0%
interconnected subsidiaries as a single
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
taxable entity
 
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
this is known as unitary combined
 
00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:55.980 align:start position:0%
reporting or formulary apportionment on
 
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
a worldwide basis
 
00:36:00.109 --> 00:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
is the present water's edge method of
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
Taxation on a fair and Level Playing
 
00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:05.460 align:start position:0%
Field for New Hampshire companies and
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
domestic unitary businesses
 
00:36:10.609 --> 00:36:10.619 align:start position:0%
I don't believe so but there is a
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
position stated in 1999 13 years after
 
00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire adopted the water's edge
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
taxation method by the New Hampshire
 
00:36:23.089 --> 00:36:23.099 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court when they decided the case
 
00:36:25.609 --> 00:36:25.619 align:start position:0%
of caterpillar Incorporated
 
00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:29.220 align:start position:0%
quote we point out that the water's edge
 
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:32.460 align:start position:0%

00:39:59.089 --> 00:39:59.099 align:start position:0%

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
great thank you so much is that was that
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
your question representative mommy yes
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative Platt yes I heard
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
you say there's a commission studying
 
00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
this retired by
 
00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
uh representative spilsbury represent
 
00:40:13.849 --> 00:40:13.859 align:start position:0%
yes why is this not premature until that
 
00:40:17.329 --> 00:40:17.339 align:start position:0%
commission does its work when this uh
 
00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
commission met
 
00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
uh it didn't meet till after the
 
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
election time in November and we were
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
given the opportunity
 
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
to put in bills as Representatives that
 
00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
were here in the 2022 session and
 
00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:36.300 align:start position:0%
knowing the unpredictability
 
00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
of electors and the way they vote
 
00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
I wanted to put this bill in in case
 
00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
representative putt that I did not get
 
00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:47.690 align:start position:0%
representative putt that I did not get
reelected

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
reelected
 
00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
um once I got reelected the bill was
 
00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
already in the hopper but I think that
 
00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:56.220 align:start position:0%
with 11 members here out of 20 that have
 
00:40:59.329 --> 00:40:59.339 align:start position:0%
never heard or seen this bill it was
 
00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
good to present this
 
00:41:04.089 --> 00:41:04.099 align:start position:0%
so that you could get an idea of
 
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
what is going on in in our tax World
 
00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:10.700 align:start position:0%
especially for Ways and Means
 
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
I am hoping that this committee will at
 
00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.430 align:start position:0%
I am hoping that this committee will at
least

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
least
 
00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
look at this material and move it to
 
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
another date where we could just have a
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
further discussion before we go with a
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation on what we should do with
 
00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:33.300 align:start position:0%
and thank you Miss Moore thank you
 
00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:35.690 align:start position:0%

representative
 
00:41:38.569 --> 00:41:38.579 align:start position:0%
okay we will uh one other question yes
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
or Matt May I asked Madam chair yes uh
 
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
we received a
 
00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.230 align:start position:0%
we received a
um

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
email with an attachment
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
from the console on state taxation
 
00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
uh I think it was sent out by your
 
00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:55.430 align:start position:0%
uh I think it was sent out by your
office

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
and I just wonder will that be discussed
 
00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
today or should we wait for that for
 
00:42:01.609 --> 00:42:01.619 align:start position:0%
another time period if we're going to
 
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
move this forward
 
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:04.740 align:start position:0%
I think we should probably wait we have
 
00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
a few other speakers after yourself and
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
then we do have this ongoing commission
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
that I would encourage any member who's
 
00:42:11.329 --> 00:42:11.339 align:start position:0%
interested in this topic to please
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
bill worldwide combined reporting and
 
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
the one comment that stuck in my mind
 
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
from that was there's only a few of us
 
00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
that would be doing it it's not really
 
00:43:41.809 --> 00:43:41.819 align:start position:0%
important and
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
then they went on to cheer the tax rate
 
00:43:48.109 --> 00:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
reduction that went into effect later in
 
00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
that session
 
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
that's the only contact I've had with
 
00:43:56.770 --> 00:43:56.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:59.930 --> 00:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
follow-up clarifying question please no
 
00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
it's a question uh of the chair oh
 
00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
and it would be appropriate that I
 
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
believe to get uh these can you get
 
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
closer to the microphone
 
00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
thank you I I think it would be
 
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
appropriate if we got some input from
 
00:44:17.569 --> 00:44:17.579 align:start position:0%
the industries that would be directly
 
00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
affected by that we all know the
 
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
initials of them
 
00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
um most of them are located in Merrimack
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
I think we're going to need some input
 
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
from them thank you madam chair thank
 
00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:30.950 align:start position:0%

commission will be able to get started
 
00:44:50.329 --> 00:44:50.339 align:start position:0%
long before October because this is a
 
00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:51.900 align:start position:0%
complex issue
 
00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there are some representatives
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
of the people that would not like to see
 
00:45:00.829 --> 00:45:00.839 align:start position:0%

that was created following passage in
 
00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:06.660 align:start position:0%
the last session of hb102
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%

and that's been codified here RSA 77
a23b

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:15.500 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:17.390 align:start position:0%
the commission
is

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.430 align:start position:0%

the following the commission shall study
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
the advantages and disadvantages for the
 
00:46:26.329 --> 00:46:26.339 align:start position:0%
state's economy and revenues of
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
replacement of the current water's edge
 
00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:29.700 align:start position:0%
method by the worldwide combined
 
00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:31.260 align:start position:0%
reporting method
 
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
for reporting and apportionment of
 
00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:36.119 align:start position:0%

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.040 align:start position:0%

in both methods including economists
 
00:46:44.089 --> 00:46:44.099 align:start position:0%
business associations and tax experts
 
00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:47.060 align:start position:0%
so hb102
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
established a structure including 12
 
00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.349 align:start position:0%
established a structure including 12
members

00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:46:54.109 --> 00:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
a three to be appointed by the Speaker
 
00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
of the House
 
00:46:59.390 --> 00:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
one to be appointed by the Senate
 
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:00.650 align:start position:0%
one to be appointed by the Senate
President

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
President
 
00:47:02.809 --> 00:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
and eight to come from business and
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
industry and in
 
00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
very much in accord with representative
 
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
ulery's comments to ensure that there is
 
00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:13.380 align:start position:0%
representation within the commission's
 
00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
deliberations not merely from those who
 
00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:18.839 align:start position:0%
might choose to testify
 
00:47:18.839 --> 00:47:22.309 align:start position:0%
might choose to testify
the

00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
the commission has met twice
 
00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:31.140 align:start position:0%
we met October 10th and selected a
 
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
representative abrami as our chairman
 
00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:37.380 align:start position:0%
and we discussed generally what road map
 
00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:40.700 align:start position:0%
we would like to follow
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
we agreed that we would file an interim
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
report uh November 1st with the speaker
 
00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
and Senate President and that that has
 
00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
been done and I'll ensure that everybody
 
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
on the committee receives a copy of this
 
00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
brief report with a couple of
 
00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
attachments totaling five pages
 
00:48:04.089 --> 00:48:04.099 align:start position:0%
uh what the report essentially uh
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
indicates is that the legislation gives
 
00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
us until November 1st 2023
 
00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
to complete our study and report back to
 
00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
the legislature and I think that's
 
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
somewhat unusual where a commission is
 
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
crossing over a term into a new
 
00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.150 align:start position:0%
crossing over a term into a new
legislature

00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:29.220 align:start position:0%
so this provides us an additional 10
 
00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
months from now
 
00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:35.700 align:start position:0%
to examine the issue and to to come back
 
00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
yes representative Ami
 
00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:41.900 align:start position:0%
we would get going before October the
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of hurdles
 
00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:49.140 align:start position:0%
the first is that uh two members are not
 
00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
back in the legislature this year so
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
there is a vacancy to be filled by the
 
00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house and one by the
 
00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
Senate President
 
00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:03.780 align:start position:0%
and we met a second time November uh
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
I think it was the
 
00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:07.390 align:start position:0%
I think it was the
the

00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:11.460 align:start position:0%
tenth which uh oddly was two days after
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
the election
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
so it was it was so much ironing
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
experience because not not everybody
 
00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
who's on the commission was re-elected
 
00:49:21.849 --> 00:49:21.859 align:start position:0%
so we agreed we would not meet again
 
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
until these vacancies could be filled
 
00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:29.940 align:start position:0%
in addition uh members who have been
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
appointed are Kevin Kennedy business and
 
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
industry Association Alex freeze New
 
00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Business and
 
00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
economic Affairs Matthew Foley New
 
00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Society of certified public
 
00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
accountants and Keon Wong who's with us
 
00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
today New Hampshire Department of
 
00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration and these members
 
00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:50.700 align:start position:0%
did participate in our meetings
 
00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:53.700 align:start position:0%
but that leaves four other positions
 
00:49:55.849 --> 00:49:55.859 align:start position:0%
that the statute provides for that have
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
never been filled one for the New
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Attorney General's office one
 
00:50:01.809 --> 00:50:01.819 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Bar Association
 
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
and two more from the New Hampshire
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association the
 
00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:07.980 align:start position:0%
reason that there are multiple positions
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
from nhbia is to ensure that there are
 
00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
that each major sector of large
 
00:50:17.809 --> 00:50:17.819 align:start position:0%
businesses and domestic business smaller
 
00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
independent businesses are represented
 
00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:23.630 align:start position:0%
independent businesses are represented
so

00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
the timing
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
is that with a Full Slate of business I
 
00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
think that uh it's premature for the
 
00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:34.700 align:start position:0%
commission to meet and until the
 
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
vacancies are filled it's premature for
 
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
the commission to meet but in discussion
 
00:50:41.569 --> 00:50:41.579 align:start position:0%
with our chairman
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
um and ranking member we've talked about
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
having the commission resume at the end
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
of winter
 
00:50:50.829 --> 00:50:50.839 align:start position:0%
upbeat several times this spring
 
00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:52.980 align:start position:0%
potentially continue during the summer
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
and make sure that we're in a position
 
00:50:58.970 --> 00:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
to get our recommendations formulated
 
00:51:01.849 --> 00:51:01.859 align:start position:0%
and submitted hopefully well in advance
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
of November 1st
 
00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
so with all of those considerations in
 
00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:07.450 align:start position:0%
so with all of those considerations in
mind

00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:07.460 align:start position:0%
mind
 
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
I would like to make the recommendation
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
that the Ways and Means Committee retain
 
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:51:17.329 --> 00:51:17.339 align:start position:0%
it's premature in the time frame that we
 
00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:19.980 align:start position:0%
have to consider bills to reach a
 
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
decision either OTP or itl and a
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
retained bill would be taken back up by
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means in the fall we can
 
00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
coordinate that timing make sure that
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
the commission's conclusions you know
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
are fully considered and and framed and
 
00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:39.660 align:start position:0%
that I think would put us in a position
 
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
where the bill could be dealt with in
 
00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
January on the house floor
 
00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
representative orrs
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:51:59.690 --> 00:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
taking my question so having worked in
 
00:52:01.069 --> 00:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
the business world
 
00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
we seem to be moving at the speed of
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
Euro to turtle and I'm not
 
00:52:08.809 --> 00:52:08.819 align:start position:0%
saying that uh inappropriate but it's
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
like why do we have to wait until spring
 
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
to get a couple of these people from via
 
00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
on board or
 
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
fill these other slots I mean to me it
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
seems like we ought to be
 
00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:23.220 align:start position:0%
push pushing this instead of waiting for
 
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
it to come to us
 
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
okay fair question
 
00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:31.020 align:start position:0%
first of all I can't account for why the
 
00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:34.140 align:start position:0%
four vacancies were never filled but
 
00:52:36.349 --> 00:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
even if they had been I think that the
 
00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
interruption of the legislative members
 
00:52:40.849 --> 00:52:40.859 align:start position:0%
won in the house and one in the Senate
 
00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:42.980 align:start position:0%
would require us to pause until
 
00:52:47.089 --> 00:52:47.099 align:start position:0%
they're in place second
 
00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh your urinal the turtle metaphor is is
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
is good but uh let's bear in mind this
 
00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
is an extraordinarily complex
 
00:53:01.069 --> 00:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
uh topic this is
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
a layer of complexity upon layer of
 
00:53:06.829 --> 00:53:06.839 align:start position:0%
complexity upon layer of complexity this
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
is a topic that has been litigated to
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
the United States Supreme Court three
 
00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:14.049 align:start position:0%
the United States Supreme Court three
times

00:53:14.049 --> 00:53:14.059 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:53:19.569 --> 00:53:19.579 align:start position:0%
actually four cases in in 82 83 and 96
 
00:53:22.609 --> 00:53:22.619 align:start position:0%
incidentally I had the pleasure as a
 
00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
Young attorney
 
00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
of participating in the drafting of a
 
00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
brief to the United States Supreme Court
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
in the Shell Oil case
 
00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:34.970 align:start position:0%
in the Shell Oil case
California

00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
California
 
00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:37.140 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:38.700 align:start position:0%
that was the cause of my getting
 
00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
admitted to the United States Supreme
 
00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
Court bar so this is bringing me around
 
00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
to a topic we were discussing
 
00:53:47.329 --> 00:53:47.339 align:start position:0%
40 years ago
 
00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:49.559 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:54.200 align:start position:0%
I I would just make a comment uh
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg indicated that
 
00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
their unintended consequences from the
 
00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh 19
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
86 law I I'm not sure that that's
 
00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:07.740 align:start position:0%
exactly the phrase that I would use
 
00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:09.900 align:start position:0%
because I think that actually the
 
00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
consequences were largely contemplated
 
00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:15.780 align:start position:0%
and known I think that there are so many
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
trade-offs involved in the question of
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh the complexity of the tax fine that
 
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
would be required if we would if we
 
00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:31.140 align:start position:0%
repeal the water's edge method uh in the
 
00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
Conformity with other states and the
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
competitive questions that that would
 
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
raise in the Conformity with the current
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh rules adopted by the United States
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
Congress in the Internal Revenue Service
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:54:48.970 --> 00:54:48.980 align:start position:0%
I think it needs further deliberation
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
and I don't think this topic has
 
00:54:55.849 --> 00:54:55.859 align:start position:0%
received careful deliberation in
 
00:54:58.609 --> 00:54:58.619 align:start position:0%
at least since 1996.
 
00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
excellent answers
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
and uh there's been some updates to the
 
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
house rules my understanding of them at
 
00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
the current time is that if you testify
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
on a bill then you shouldn't also be
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
asking questions of other testifiers but
 
00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
that you can sit in your seat and
 
00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
otherwise be engaged we will continue to
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
get clarification on that if we hear
 
00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:32.220 align:start position:0%
more from the community services
 
00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:33.470 align:start position:0%
more from the community services
department

00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
okay I would like to recognize Thomas
 
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
over I think that's his name from the
 
00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
Coalition was it
 
00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:44.460 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair
 
00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
um and it's probably my handwriting that
 
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
caused the difficulty
 
00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:08.220 align:start position:0%
um I am uh Thomas Opel

representing

00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
representing
 
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
the Coalition for prosperous America in
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
support of Representative Schamberg's
 
00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:25.490 align:start position:0%
support of Representative Schamberg's
bill

00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:56:28.250 --> 00:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
um HB 121
 
00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:28.930 align:start position:0%
um HB 121
um

00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:28.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
understanding the uh
 
00:56:36.049 --> 00:56:36.059 align:start position:0%
pregame discussions I should say
 
00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to try and keep this at a
 
00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
60 foot 60 000 foot level
 
00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
um we uh we are very strongly in support
 
00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:46.380 align:start position:0%
of Representative Schamberg's bill but
 
00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
we understand that
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
with new members in the committee that
 
00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
there and the commission the existing
 
00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:55.870 align:start position:0%
there and the commission the existing
commission

00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
the idea of retaining the bill for
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
further study makes a lot of sense
 
00:57:04.809 --> 00:57:04.819 align:start position:0%
um we'd like to see quicker action but
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
we support the idea of of working with
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
the commission and representative
 
00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:11.460 align:start position:0%
spilsbury will make an excellent chair
 
00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
of that commission and we'll look
 
00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
forward to working with him
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
um I think you know fundamentally
 
00:57:20.089 --> 00:57:20.099 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg I think
 
00:57:24.130 --> 00:57:24.140 align:start position:0%
outlined the the parameters of why
 
00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:26.700 align:start position:0%
he introduced this bill and why we
 
00:57:28.609 --> 00:57:28.619 align:start position:0%
support it and it and it fundamentally
 
00:57:31.790 --> 00:57:31.800 align:start position:0%
comes down to leveling the playing field
 
00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:33.470 align:start position:0%
comes down to leveling the playing field
for

00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:57:37.849 --> 00:57:37.859 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of businesses in the
 
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
there was a study recently
 
00:57:47.329 --> 00:57:47.339 align:start position:0%
the global business Alliance not a
 
00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:49.160 align:start position:0%
particular fan of this bill
 
00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
but even they acknowledge that
 
00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
more than nine out of ten workers in New
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire work in companies that are not
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
multinational companies that would not
 
00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
be would only be positively impacted by
 
00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:06.059 align:start position:0%
this bill and when I say positively
 
00:58:07.690 --> 00:58:07.700 align:start position:0%
impacted right now
 
00:58:10.849 --> 00:58:10.859 align:start position:0%
if you have a small coffee shop if you
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
have a small Brew Pub a restaurant some
 
00:58:16.010 --> 00:58:16.020 align:start position:0%
small business that is competing with a
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
multinational like a Starbucks or
 
00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
ambev or some major international
 
00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:24.829 align:start position:0%
ambev or some major international
corporation

00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
corporation
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
you're paying a different tax rate in a
 
00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
sense than they are because they have
 
00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:31.740 align:start position:0%
the ability perfectly legal but they
 
00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:33.300 align:start position:0%
have the ability
 
00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
um through accounting methods to shift
 
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
profits and
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
defer the amount of taxes that they
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
would rightfully owe to the state of New
 
00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:44.710 align:start position:0%
would rightfully owe to the state of New
Hampshire

00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:58:47.329 --> 00:58:47.339 align:start position:0%
that small coffee shop doesn't have the
 
00:58:49.250 --> 00:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
same advantage
 
00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:50.940 align:start position:0%
um and so at the end of the day
 
00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:52.750 align:start position:0%
um and so at the end of the day
either

00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:58:55.609 --> 00:58:55.619 align:start position:0%
those companies that employ more than
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
nine out of ten workers in New Hampshire
 
00:58:59.870 --> 00:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
are paying more than their fair share to
 
00:59:02.809 --> 00:59:02.819 align:start position:0%
make up the difference uh or the state
 
00:59:05.569 --> 00:59:05.579 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire is losing Revenue as
 
00:59:08.089 --> 00:59:08.099 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg said there's a
 
00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
study out there that says 140 to 170
 
00:59:14.329 --> 00:59:14.339 align:start position:0%
million dollars and it was done by three
 
00:59:17.410 --> 00:59:17.420 align:start position:0%
organizations that are all 501 c3s
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
non-partisan under the IRS rules so
 
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
fundamentally that's why we are
 
00:59:26.589 --> 00:59:26.599 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill
 
00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:28.980 align:start position:0%
we intend to work with representative
 
00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:32.220 align:start position:0%
spilsbury as the commission moves
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
forward one of the things that we would
 
00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:36.130 align:start position:0%
forward one of the things that we would
hope

00:59:36.130 --> 00:59:36.140 align:start position:0%
hope
 
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
is that people who don't often get their
 
00:59:41.589 --> 00:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
voice heard in Concord
 
00:59:44.089 --> 00:59:44.099 align:start position:0%
because they're small business people
 
00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
and they're working
 
00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:48.660 align:start position:0%
you know and they don't have either the
 
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
time to come to conquer themselves they
 
00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:53.220 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to hire
 
00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
professional lobbyists
 
00:59:58.430 --> 00:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
and they very often their voices don't
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
get heard and and often they're not
 
01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:02.700 align:start position:0%
fully aware of what's being considered
 
01:00:04.809 --> 01:00:04.819 align:start position:0%
in the legislature
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we hope to do is
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
working with representative spilsbury is
 
01:00:10.849 --> 01:00:10.859 align:start position:0%
making sure that that sector of New
 
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy which provides most of
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
the jobs in the state that that sector
 
01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
is represented and and heard so that
 
01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
when the commission finishes with its
 
01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:23.470 align:start position:0%
when the commission finishes with its
recommendations

01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:23.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
each of your members you all have those
 
01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:28.940 align:start position:0%
kinds of businesses in your districts
 
01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
you can be confident that that sector
 
01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
has been heard from as well
 
01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:36.900 align:start position:0%
that's fundamentally
 
01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
my statement I I do have a uh a written
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
statement that was uh passed around I
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
think you all have copies of it
 
01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
um but I'll stop there and happy to
 
01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
um of a non-technical nature
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative Almy
 
01:00:55.849 --> 01:00:55.859 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:00:55.859 --> 01:00:57.049 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
on

01:00:57.049 --> 01:00:57.059 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:00:57.059 --> 01:00:58.549 align:start position:0%
on
Tom

01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
Tom
 
01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:02.220 align:start position:0%
can you tell us more about the Coalition
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
for pros prosperous America
 
01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:09.839 align:start position:0%
how big is it where is it based sure so
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
the Coalition is based in Washington DC
 
01:01:14.089 --> 01:01:14.099 align:start position:0%
it is a non-profit it represents the
 
01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
interest of about four million
 
01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
households across the United States
 
01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
working with
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
regular citizens Farmers factories
 
01:01:26.109 --> 01:01:26.119 align:start position:0%
working people
 
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
fundamentally the Coalition believes
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
that U.S trade policy has been
 
01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:33.839 align:start position:0%
imbalanced uh and that and that we
 
01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
perhaps have uh have tilted toward a
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
more Global Perspective uh and and not
 
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
done enough to protect American jobs
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
American workers American interests
 
01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
um and and that is part of the
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
coalition's it is the Coalition is
 
01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
composed of both Republicans and
 
01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:56.220 align:start position:0%
Democrats liberals conservatives it's
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
it's a a pretty uh interesting stew of
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
interests but fundamentally on this bill
 
01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
We Believe that
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
we made a mistake
 
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
several decades ago in sort of creating
 
01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
this arbitrary Water's Edge provision
 
01:02:17.569 --> 01:02:17.579 align:start position:0%
that enabled large multinationals to
 
01:02:20.809 --> 01:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
shift their profits to low tax or even
 
01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:23.180 align:start position:0%
no tax jurisdictions
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
and they're really paper transactions
 
01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:28.140 align:start position:0%
they're not you know it's not really
 
01:02:30.049 --> 01:02:30.059 align:start position:0%
reflective of the activity that is
 
01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
happening and so
 
01:02:37.930 --> 01:02:37.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:02:44.089 --> 01:02:44.099 align:start position:0%
thank you on you didn't mention our or
 
01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:47.040 align:start position:0%

01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
individuals or both
 
01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:51.180 align:start position:0%

um you know workers it it um
 
01:02:58.490 --> 01:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
it's pretty much every sector every
 
01:03:01.870 --> 01:03:01.880 align:start position:0%
every industry every um
 
01:03:09.289 --> 01:03:09.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
must have done really well because
 
01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:12.900 align:start position:0%
there's not that many questions thank
 
01:03:14.569 --> 01:03:14.579 align:start position:0%

Testimony we do have a representative
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
here from the dra if you'd like to just
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%

01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
this bill we did prepare a fiscal note
 
01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:54.140 align:start position:0%
uh be it as it may we were unable to
 
01:03:57.650 --> 01:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
make any uh substantive calculations on
 
01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
a fiscal impact
 
01:04:02.690 --> 01:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
um and I'm here to answer any questions
 
01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
that the committee may have
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
um on HP 121 I did also bring a little
 
01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
um physical quick guide to be
 
01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:37.079 --> 01:04:52.809 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:04:52.809 --> 01:04:52.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
were passing this around and seeing if
 
01:04:57.530 --> 01:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
anyone has any quick questions uh do we
 
01:05:14.049 --> 01:05:14.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:16.970 --> 01:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a little hard to hear you
 
01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
um maybe could you pass that down for us
 
01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
just to recap the blue sheet we have two
 
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
opposed and one four
 
01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:42.799 align:start position:0%
uh it looks like a representative from
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
maybe the Bia yes
 
01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh is
 
01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:49.190 align:start position:0%
uh is
against

01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:05:51.049 --> 01:05:51.059 align:start position:0%
sorry I apologize
 
01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:53.700 align:start position:0%
two people for one person against the
 
01:05:56.210 --> 01:05:56.220 align:start position:0%
Bia as opposed
 
01:05:57.650 --> 01:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
and I think you heard from everyone else
 
01:05:57.660 --> 01:06:00.589 align:start position:0%
and I think you heard from everyone else
okay

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative ulery
 
01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:04.309 align:start position:0%
representative ulery
yeah

01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
just for the record I'm a little
 
01:06:07.319 --> 01:06:08.930 align:start position:0%
just for the record I'm a little
confused

01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
confused
 
01:06:13.130 --> 01:06:13.140 align:start position:0%
because corporations are so intertwined
 
01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:13.970 align:start position:0%
because corporations are so intertwined
foreign

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:13.980 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
take for example General Dynamics
 
01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
corporation which has a major interest
 
01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:20.809 align:start position:0%
corporation which has a major interest
in

01:06:20.809 --> 01:06:20.819 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
Bae UK
 
01:06:27.370 --> 01:06:27.380 align:start position:0%
but doesn't have an interest in Bae us
 
01:06:30.289 --> 01:06:30.299 align:start position:0%
which are separate corporations because
 
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
of the way that it's set up in um
 
01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Defense for
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
defense Industries being U.S
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
manufacturers even though they may be
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
owned by a foreign entity I don't know
 
01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
how that works and I would love to find
 
01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
out and that would be something that dra
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
would have insight into
 
01:06:54.349 --> 01:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
can we ask the ra for some insight into
 
01:06:54.359 --> 01:06:55.309 align:start position:0%
can we ask the ra for some insight into
that

01:06:55.309 --> 01:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:58.490 --> 01:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
how that gets disentangled or gets
 
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
re-entangled or gets messed up
 
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
we can certainly ask the dra
 
01:07:06.410 --> 01:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
um and I would hope that that would be
 
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
part of the commission's work that we
 
01:07:10.250 --> 01:07:10.260 align:start position:0%
could do the Deep dive on that and that
 
01:07:12.890 --> 01:07:12.900 align:start position:0%
would give them a little bit more time
 
01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:14.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
so um just to provide a quick
 
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
um overview of the um unitary combined
 
01:07:24.289 --> 01:07:24.299 align:start position:0%
reporting right now currently New
 
01:07:26.569 --> 01:07:26.579 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is using uh utilizing a
 
01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:28.980 align:start position:0%
Water's Edge combined reporting whereas
 
01:07:32.569 --> 01:07:32.579 align:start position:0%
uh all the business entities within a
 
01:07:34.329 --> 01:07:34.339 align:start position:0%
combined group that are unitary
 
01:07:37.549 --> 01:07:37.559 align:start position:0%
conducting business unitary will be
 
01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
reported on one return except for those
 
01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:45.020 align:start position:0%
that are outside the uh the 50 states
 
01:07:50.029 --> 01:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
and so in that situation if we do adopt
 
01:07:52.609 --> 01:07:52.619 align:start position:0%
the worldwide combined unitary reporting
 
01:07:58.010 --> 01:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
and if the Bae UK is also unitary with
 
01:08:01.609 --> 01:08:01.619 align:start position:0%
the Bae us then that would be considered
 
01:08:03.529 --> 01:08:03.539 align:start position:0%
as part of the combined group I think
 
01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:07.140 align:start position:0%
that would be the the concept behind the
 
01:08:10.849 --> 01:08:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:10.859 --> 01:08:12.710 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:08:14.329 --> 01:08:14.339 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
interested because under DOD regulations
 
01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
at U.S defense company has to be a U.S
 
01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:22.859 align:start position:0%
defense company unless stuff is
 
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
purchased from I believe that also
 
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
applies to a couple other companies in
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire
 
01:08:29.279 --> 01:08:31.309 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire
um

01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
so are they separate companies
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
even though they're definitely have an
 
01:08:39.070 --> 01:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
incestuous relationship
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh but I I don't I'm again this is
 
01:08:44.809 --> 01:08:44.819 align:start position:0%
something that I'm actually probably
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
speaking to representing spilsbury on
 
01:08:49.249 --> 01:08:49.259 align:start position:0%
that I really
 
01:08:51.289 --> 01:08:51.299 align:start position:0%
would love to know how that's going to
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
work to to separate that out when you've
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
got companies that are so closely
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
intertwined so that extraordinarily
 
01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
complex was what I heard so I would
 
01:09:05.209 --> 01:09:05.219 align:start position:0%
encourage all members of this committee
 
01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
to engage with this commission that we
 
01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
have already structured even if you're
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
not appointed to the committee get
 
01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
involved go to the hearings listen ask
 
01:09:15.650 --> 01:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
questions be involved as much as you'd
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
like this is a big question we've been
 
01:09:21.169 --> 01:09:21.179 align:start position:0%
debating this for 40 years so that's why
 
01:09:23.209 --> 01:09:23.219 align:start position:0%
we really need to give it the proper
 
01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
attention before we make a quick
 
01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:25.570 align:start position:0%
attention before we make a quick
decision

01:09:25.570 --> 01:09:25.580 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:09:27.410 --> 01:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
representative plett and then
 
01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
representative Malloy yes thank you for
 
01:09:32.150 --> 01:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
um the uh this proposal is to go to
 
01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
worldwide rather than Water's Edge
 
01:09:40.370 --> 01:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
um what's the other State's practices do
 
01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
you have does the era have any idea what
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
the other states do yes um there are
 
01:09:47.749 --> 01:09:47.759 align:start position:0%
some states that offer worldwide
 
01:09:49.490 --> 01:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
reporting as an option
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
so the uh
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
default would be walrus Edge combined
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
reporting with the option to elect to do
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
worldwide and then there are other
 
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
states that would say okay yeah that
 
01:10:04.669 --> 01:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
they would give you they allow a
 
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
worldwide reporting but you may elect
 
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
um Awards Edge combined reporting
 
01:10:13.370 --> 01:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
um so different states have um and then
 
01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
there are some states that just allow
 
01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:15.770 align:start position:0%
there are some states that just allow
only

01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:15.780 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:23.689 --> 01:10:23.699 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question my
 
01:10:26.209 --> 01:10:26.219 align:start position:0%
apologies I don't know if I caught the
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
name of the commission
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:39.229 --> 01:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman I can clarify I have it
 
01:10:41.709 --> 01:10:41.719 align:start position:0%
oh you are you sure
 
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
representative has the exact correct
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
name the commission on worldwide
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
combined reporting for unitary
 
01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
businesses under the business profits
 
01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:54.010 align:start position:0%
businesses under the business profits
tax

01:10:54.010 --> 01:10:54.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
and I will do my best if I hear of any
 
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
of this and hopefully representative
 
01:11:00.050 --> 01:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
spilsbury will let the entire committee
 
01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
know when anything's going on with that
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
so that we can remain engaged absolutely
 
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh I will copy the committee uh anytime
 
01:11:15.050 --> 01:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay I guess that's all for oh I'm sorry
 
01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
one more representative almie
 
01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
 
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:11:28.669 --> 01:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
already been forced to adopt
 
01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing which we were told
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
by dra seems to not be changing our
 
01:11:37.970 --> 01:11:37.980 align:start position:0%
Revenue picture
 
01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
on as it has been developed uh
 
01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:47.460 align:start position:0%
and on the single sales Factor
 
01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:48.950 align:start position:0%
and on the single sales Factor
which

01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
neither we nor dra nor anybody has any
 
01:11:56.689 --> 01:11:56.699 align:start position:0%
idea what it's going to do to us in 2024
 
01:11:56.699 --> 01:11:57.649 align:start position:0%
idea what it's going to do to us in 2024
um

01:11:57.649 --> 01:11:57.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:01.930 --> 01:12:01.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:04.010 --> 01:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
and on
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
this one is also
 
01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:13.140 align:start position:0%
difficult to figure out is dra going to
 
01:12:17.050 --> 01:12:17.060 align:start position:0%
continue to try to understand
 
01:12:22.729 --> 01:12:22.739 align:start position:0%
on the fiscal impact if this was was
 
01:12:26.770 --> 01:12:26.780 align:start position:0%
developed there are people studying this
 
01:12:31.370 --> 01:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
uh inside the United States that have
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
been doing research on this for quite a
 
01:12:33.239 --> 01:12:34.669 align:start position:0%
been doing research on this for quite a
while

01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
while
 
01:12:38.090 --> 01:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
now currently we do not have a specific
 
01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
like a task force um in place to do a
 
01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
specific study on this I think um that
 
01:12:47.570 --> 01:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
is the purpose of the commission is to
 
01:12:51.770 --> 01:12:51.780 align:start position:0%
help all to be involved and get a better
 
01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
understanding of of the fiscal impact or
 
01:12:59.570 --> 01:12:59.580 align:start position:0%
otherwise other impacts of this bill of
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:06.649 --> 01:13:06.659 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for coming today thank
 
01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
you uh one last check do we have any
 
01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
more pink cards on House Bill 121
 
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none we will close the
 
01:13:17.570 --> 01:13:17.580 align:start position:0%
public killing hearing
 
01:13:20.090 --> 01:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
folks we have about 15 minutes before we
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
reconvene for House Bill 145 so if you
 
01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
could please be back in your seats by
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
good morning again
 
01:33:40.490 --> 01:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
we will now open the public hearing on
 
01:33:43.370 --> 01:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
House Bill 145
 
01:33:48.890 --> 01:33:48.900 align:start position:0%
and uh we are looking for any pink cards
 
01:33:50.570 --> 01:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
see if anyone would like to introduce
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:02.810 --> 01:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
let's just give it a moment or two just
 
01:34:07.310 --> 01:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
in case he's running late and I will see
 
01:34:10.850 --> 01:34:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman
 
01:34:18.050 --> 01:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
representative Spielberg yes if I may I
 
01:34:21.410 --> 01:34:21.420 align:start position:0%
regarding the last hearing on
 
01:34:22.970 --> 01:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg's Bill I just
 
01:34:24.410 --> 01:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out that everybody has
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
now received a copy of the commission's
 
01:34:28.370 --> 01:34:28.380 align:start position:0%
interim report
 
01:34:31.490 --> 01:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
which reflects the first meeting uh in
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
October but not the second meeting in
 
01:34:35.930 --> 01:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
November and pretty much recapitulates
 
01:35:00.169 --> 01:35:00.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:00.179 --> 01:35:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
look

01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
look
 
01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
representative Army
 
01:35:09.530 --> 01:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair this uh bill that
 
01:35:12.669 --> 01:35:12.679 align:start position:0%
should be before us but isn't uh
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
impacts your uh directly the decisions
 
01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
that were made with a great deal of care
 
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
two terms ago three terms ago on by the
 
01:35:27.290 --> 01:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and the
 
01:35:29.689 --> 01:35:29.699 align:start position:0%
current attorney general himself was
 
01:35:31.729 --> 01:35:31.739 align:start position:0%
very heavily involved as the governor's
 
01:35:36.410 --> 01:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
lawyer at the time and um
 
01:35:39.050 --> 01:35:39.060 align:start position:0%
on the Wayfair decision
 
01:35:40.970 --> 01:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
and on
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
it I believe that it contradicts the
 
01:35:49.189 --> 01:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
wayfared decision work but I've just
 
01:35:52.490 --> 01:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
learned that the Attorney General's
 
01:35:54.410 --> 01:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
office has
 
01:35:54.420 --> 01:35:55.010 align:start position:0%
office has
um

01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
lost the person that was overseeing the
 
01:36:01.970 --> 01:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
actions that would be taken on that if
 
01:36:06.350 --> 01:36:06.360 align:start position:0%
need came up and that on they have a new
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
person in charge who
 
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
as a sick child and can't appear
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
yes yes we have requested that the
 
01:36:17.450 --> 01:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
Eternal generally General's office be
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
here today for this bill and
 
01:36:21.649 --> 01:36:21.659 align:start position:0%
unfortunately they cannot uh but they
 
01:36:24.649 --> 01:36:24.659 align:start position:0%
will send us information by email as
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
soon as possible on this topic
 
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
I have not heard back from the prime
 
01:36:33.169 --> 01:36:33.179 align:start position:0%
sponsor so I assume I don't care he's
 
01:36:36.729 --> 01:36:36.739 align:start position:0%
not attending yes representative Ames
 
01:36:40.490 --> 01:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
remember to put this down uh
 
01:36:44.930 --> 01:36:44.940 align:start position:0%
I hate to see a bill shelved because
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
of whatever that we don't know
 
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
and I wonder if we could uh
 
01:36:52.910 --> 01:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
someone on on our committee could
 
01:36:55.729 --> 01:36:55.739 align:start position:0%
introduce it and uh get it
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
you know so beyond today so that we
 
01:36:59.689 --> 01:36:59.699 align:start position:0%
could then hear
 
01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
from the prime sponsor and the Attorney
 
01:37:03.890 --> 01:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
General's office is absolutely critical
 
01:37:05.090 --> 01:37:05.100 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:37:08.450 --> 01:37:08.460 align:start position:0%
this is an important subject
 
01:37:11.689 --> 01:37:11.699 align:start position:0%
um I sense that this is not the bill but
 
01:37:14.689 --> 01:37:14.699 align:start position:0%
maybe all of us won't agree on that to
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
address any remaining problems with uh
 
01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
sales tax collection that really that
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
derives from the Wayfarer decision but
 
01:37:25.490 --> 01:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
uh but let's find out and uh maybe we
 
01:37:27.050 --> 01:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
can continue this proceeding after
 
01:37:29.090 --> 01:37:29.100 align:start position:0%
getting the bill
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
built over over the hurdle of being
 
01:37:33.770 --> 01:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
introduced would you care to do that
 
01:37:35.689 --> 01:37:35.699 align:start position:0%
introduction for us I'd be happy to do
 
01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:03.770 --> 01:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
representative Ames we probably will
 
01:38:05.570 --> 01:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
have you fill out a ping card at some
 
01:38:07.129 --> 01:38:07.139 align:start position:0%
point but thank you for introducing
 
01:38:09.410 --> 01:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
House Bill 145 to the committee I will
 
01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
fill out a pick card and I I appreciate
 
01:38:16.430 --> 01:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to introduce House Bill
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
145 an act relative to a collection of
 
01:38:24.290 --> 01:38:24.300 align:start position:0%
sales taxes of foreign jurisdictions
 
01:38:26.570 --> 01:38:26.580 align:start position:0%
by New Hampshire by New Hampshire
 
01:38:29.689 --> 01:38:29.699 align:start position:0%
businesses uh the prime sponsor
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
um is not present and that's why I'm
 
01:38:37.610 --> 01:38:37.620 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill I uh I'm not
 
01:38:41.149 --> 01:38:41.159 align:start position:0%
prepared to speak to the bill
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:49.250 --> 01:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
all right I see no other pink cards
 
01:38:58.970 --> 01:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:06.050 --> 01:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
okay we will now uh we will now
 
01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
recognize representative pleck yes the
 
01:39:10.370 --> 01:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
first question what reading this is
 
01:39:13.250 --> 01:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
whether it was legal or not so listening
 
01:39:14.510 --> 01:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
to the attorney general to me is
 
01:39:17.450 --> 01:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
critical that's all
 
01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
yes I think we all need to have an
 
01:39:20.629 --> 01:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
update from the AG and hopefully we'll
 
01:39:22.850 --> 01:39:22.860 align:start position:0%
receive that information soon and we can
 
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
kind of go from there but at this time I
 
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
think I will close the public hearing on
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you all for coming uh that
 
01:39:38.930 --> 01:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
reps wraps up our morning we will
 
01:39:41.810 --> 01:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
reconvene at one o'clock to hear from
 
01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire fiscal policy
 
01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:45.719 align:start position:0%
Institute who would like to give us
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
their thoughts on the economy so it will
 
01:39:50.270 --> 01:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
be again a high-level economic briefing
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
we encourage you to attend that and then
 
01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
at two o'clock remember we cut short one
 
01:39:58.250 --> 01:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
of our presenters last week that was the
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Unemployment Security and
 
01:40:01.850 --> 01:40:01.860 align:start position:0%
there was a person who was like a New
 
01:40:03.290 --> 01:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire demographer can't remember
 
01:40:05.570 --> 01:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
exact title they will be coming back at
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
two to finish their presentation because
 
01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
I think there was a lot of questions on
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
that so I encourage you to stay for that
 
01:40:12.169 --> 01:40:12.179 align:start position:0%
as well and that will wrap up today's
 
01:40:17.330 --> 01:40:17.340 align:start position:0%
work uh we are not meeting tomorrow
 
01:40:22.370 --> 01:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
Wednesday the 18th we will plan on being
 
01:40:25.310 --> 01:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
here Monday Tuesday and Wednesday next
 
01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:26.450 align:start position:0%
here Monday Tuesday and Wednesday next
week

01:40:26.450 --> 01:40:26.460 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
the speaker has mentioned there is a
 
01:40:31.250 --> 01:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
chance for a house session on Thursday
 
01:40:34.430 --> 01:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
January 26th but he needs to see what
 
01:40:36.590 --> 01:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
bills have been exact in committee
 
01:40:38.930 --> 01:40:38.940 align:start position:0%
before he can tell you for sure
 
01:40:40.669 --> 01:40:40.679 align:start position:0%
but so that's what we've got right now
 
01:40:43.490 --> 01:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
so we'll plan next week so Monday the
 
01:40:45.770 --> 01:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
23rd we're going to start our agency
 
01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates
 
01:40:51.050 --> 01:40:51.060 align:start position:0%
we'll start with dra and then we'll just
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
keep drilling down and meeting with all
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
the different agencies Chris Shea has
 
01:40:56.810 --> 01:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
been totally instrumental on making that
 
01:40:59.330 --> 01:40:59.340 align:start position:0%
all happen with you know years and years
 
01:41:01.010 --> 01:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
of Prior experience of running these
 
01:41:02.930 --> 01:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
things he's setting that all up for so
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
that will be on Monday the 23rd and on
 
01:41:07.850 --> 01:41:07.860 align:start position:0%
Friday the 25th
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to mix that up a little
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
excuse me Wednesday the 25th great uh to
 
01:41:14.689 --> 01:41:14.699 align:start position:0%
mix it up a little bit we will do Bill
 
01:41:18.050 --> 01:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
hearings on Tuesday the 24th so plan
 
01:41:22.010 --> 01:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
from 10 to 3 kind of time frame and I
 
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
guess I'm looking at right now
 
01:41:26.870 --> 01:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
to keep going with Bill hearings on
 
01:41:29.330 --> 01:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays just to keep those moving
 
01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
forward we still don't have a ton of
 
01:41:34.010 --> 01:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
bills but we do have to keep marching
 
01:41:36.410 --> 01:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
forward from what I've seen we don't
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
have any early deadline bills so those
 
01:41:40.370 --> 01:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
are the be the bills we have to get done
 
01:41:44.209 --> 01:41:44.219 align:start position:0%
by mid-February we don't have any yet we
 
01:41:46.490 --> 01:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
still have until mid-march obviously we
 
01:41:48.830 --> 01:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
don't want to get too backed up so we'll
 
01:41:51.229 --> 01:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
keep chipping away at it so the four
 
01:41:54.290 --> 01:41:54.300 align:start position:0%
bills on the 24th
 
01:41:56.570 --> 01:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
I might look to representative janigan
 
01:41:58.129 --> 01:41:58.139 align:start position:0%
and to remind me of the bill numbers
 
01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
here but they have to do all with some
 
01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
tax cuts one is a bill on cutting or
 
01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
eliminating the communication Services
 
01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
tax there are two having to do with the
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
IND tax and there's one having to do
 
01:42:15.229 --> 01:42:15.239 align:start position:0%
with the business Enterprise tax
 
01:42:18.770 --> 01:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
and he uh representative has the numbers
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so the numbers are
 
01:42:25.609 --> 01:42:25.619 align:start position:0%
HB 15 is uh cutting the BET tax from
 
01:42:32.090 --> 01:42:32.100 align:start position:0%
0.55 to 0.5 percent uh HB 100 which is
 
01:42:32.100 --> 01:42:32.750 align:start position:0%
0.55 to 0.5 percent uh HB 100 which is
um

01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:34.970 --> 01:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
advancing the elimination of the
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax
 
01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:39.169 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax
hb133

01:42:39.169 --> 01:42:39.179 align:start position:0%
hb133
 
01:42:40.850 --> 01:42:40.860 align:start position:0%
which is eliminating the communication
 
01:42:45.590 --> 01:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
Services tax and HB 192 which proposes
 
01:42:47.450 --> 01:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
keeping the interest in dividends tax
 
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh the last one was HP 192.
 
01:43:00.770 --> 01:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
these will of course all be noticed to
 
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
you and in the calendar and I also just
 
01:43:06.590 --> 01:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
so we cannot finalize our Revenue
 
01:43:08.810 --> 01:43:08.820 align:start position:0%
estimates until we first see what the
 
01:43:11.570 --> 01:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
governor comes out with his deadline is
 
01:43:13.729 --> 01:43:13.739 align:start position:0%
February 15th to come out with his
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
budget proposal which will include his
 
01:43:18.229 --> 01:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
Revenue assumptions and so we kind of
 
01:43:19.850 --> 01:43:19.860 align:start position:0%
need to see what he has before we can
 
01:43:22.010 --> 01:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
start doing our spreadsheet to monitor
 
01:43:24.350 --> 01:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
all the different thoughts on this stuff
 
01:43:26.209 --> 01:43:26.219 align:start position:0%
but what I wanted to get started at
 
01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
least so you would get at least another
 
01:43:31.490 --> 01:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
more information on what the agencies do
 
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
the type of non-restricted Revenue they
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
generate and so forth so we'll get that
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
started next week and then obviously
 
01:43:43.669 --> 01:43:43.679 align:start position:0%
we'll have to get more detailed
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
involved in the in the revenue estimates
 
01:43:48.830 --> 01:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
after the 15th of February so that
 
01:43:50.930 --> 01:43:50.940 align:start position:0%
following week the week of President's
 
01:43:52.910 --> 01:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
Day is when we'll have to meet probably
 
01:43:55.490 --> 01:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
a couple days that week the 21st and the
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
22nd was what I was thinking uh leaving
 
01:43:59.870 --> 01:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
Thursdays available for sessions right
 
01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:00.590 align:start position:0%
Thursdays available for sessions right
now

01:44:00.590 --> 01:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
uh would be my plan so we'll keep
 
01:44:05.870 --> 01:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
marching away on Bill hearings doing as
 
01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
much as we can on understanding revenues
 
01:44:10.850 --> 01:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
and then we'll be formally putting some
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
thoughts on paper at least starting with
 
01:44:18.770 --> 01:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:21.709 --> 01:44:21.719 align:start position:0%
good awesome all right go ahead and take
 
01:44:23.870 --> 01:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
a break and we'll see you back at one
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:50.639 --> 03:04:43.790 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:04:43.790 --> 03:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:47.090 --> 03:04:47.100 align:start position:0%
okay the the time being 104 I think
 
03:04:56.269 --> 03:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:56.279 --> 03:04:57.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:04:57.410 --> 03:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:00.050 --> 03:05:00.060 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:05:01.790 --> 03:05:01.800 align:start position:0%

great great thank you very much for the
 
03:05:13.070 --> 03:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity and thank you everyone for
 
03:05:16.010 --> 03:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
your time this afternoon again I'm Phil
 
03:05:17.450 --> 03:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
slett and I'm the research director at
 
03:05:18.710 --> 03:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire fiscal policy
 
03:05:21.650 --> 03:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
Institute nhfpi is a non-profit
 
03:05:23.750 --> 03:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan independent policy research
 
03:05:26.450 --> 03:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
organization based in Concord we examine
 
03:05:28.670 --> 03:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
the state budget state revenue policy
 
03:05:31.490 --> 03:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
and the state economy and the economic
 
03:05:32.929 --> 03:05:32.939 align:start position:0%
security of granite Staters and I'm
 
03:05:35.450 --> 03:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
going to try to talk about both of those
 
03:05:37.070 --> 03:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
areas both state budget and revenue
 
03:05:40.130 --> 03:05:40.140 align:start position:0%
policy and the state economy in this
 
03:05:40.140 --> 03:05:41.210 align:start position:0%
policy and the state economy in this
presentation

03:05:41.210 --> 03:05:41.220 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
03:05:43.550 --> 03:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
now for this presentation what I'm going
 
03:05:47.510 --> 03:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
to try to do for the committee is start
 
03:05:50.330 --> 03:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
big picture with revenues what revenues
 
03:05:51.849 --> 03:05:51.859 align:start position:0%
look like on sort of a macro scale
 
03:05:54.290 --> 03:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
narrow down to a couple key Revenue
 
03:05:56.150 --> 03:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
sources that will be in your interest to
 
03:05:58.670 --> 03:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
project over the next budget biennium
 
03:06:00.769 --> 03:06:00.779 align:start position:0%
and then broaden out a little bit with a
 
03:06:03.710 --> 03:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
wider look at the economy I know you've
 
03:06:05.090 --> 03:06:05.100 align:start position:0%
spent some time last week and are going
 
03:06:06.110 --> 03:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
to spend some more time a little bit
 
03:06:07.550 --> 03:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
this afternoon talking about the economy
 
03:06:09.230 --> 03:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
in more detail but I want to give you
 
03:06:11.269 --> 03:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
some big picture pieces and connect them
 
03:06:14.150 --> 03:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
to State revenues in particular and I
 
03:06:15.650 --> 03:06:15.660 align:start position:0%
should say at the pleasure of the chair
 
03:06:17.330 --> 03:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions throughout
 
03:06:19.429 --> 03:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
the presentation so I'll try to keep my
 
03:06:21.230 --> 03:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
eyes up periodically and look for hands
 
03:06:23.389 --> 03:06:23.399 align:start position:0%
especially if you have a particular
 
03:06:25.130 --> 03:06:25.140 align:start position:0%
question about it that's a technical
 
03:06:26.870 --> 03:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
question about a slide I'm happy to
 
03:06:28.730 --> 03:06:28.740 align:start position:0%
field that right away I've also tried to
 
03:06:30.170 --> 03:06:30.180 align:start position:0%
leave a little bit of time at the end
 
03:06:32.870 --> 03:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
for broader questions or questions about
 
03:06:35.570 --> 03:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
topics that I haven't covered in this
 
03:06:35.580 --> 03:06:37.130 align:start position:0%
topics that I haven't covered in this
presentation

03:06:37.130 --> 03:06:37.140 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
03:06:40.429 --> 03:06:40.439 align:start position:0%
so what about the big picture of State
 
03:06:41.690 --> 03:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
revenues when we're talking about State
 
03:06:43.969 --> 03:06:43.979 align:start position:0%
revenues in New Hampshire what are we
 
03:06:46.250 --> 03:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
talking about broadly and I'm going to
 
03:06:47.269 --> 03:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
move through these slides relatively
 
03:06:49.250 --> 03:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
quickly I try to paper clip them for you
 
03:06:51.110 --> 03:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
together together for you so you could
 
03:06:53.570 --> 03:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
un undo them and fold them and at least
 
03:06:55.670 --> 03:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
look at two unfurl them and look at at
 
03:06:56.990 --> 03:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
least two at a time
 
03:07:00.250 --> 03:07:00.260 align:start position:0%
so this chart that you see on slide four
 
03:07:02.870 --> 03:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
is the biggest picture that at least I
 
03:07:04.910 --> 03:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
can construct of what state revenues
 
03:07:07.969 --> 03:07:07.979 align:start position:0%
look like at a macro level
 
03:07:09.530 --> 03:07:09.540 align:start position:0%
um not just including what's in the
 
03:07:11.750 --> 03:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
state budget not switches including
 
03:07:13.849 --> 03:07:13.859 align:start position:0%
what's just in some key funds but what
 
03:07:15.410 --> 03:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
does state revenue look like overall in
 
03:07:17.750 --> 03:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
terms of what the state collects and
 
03:07:19.490 --> 03:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
you'll see that federal grants Federal
 
03:07:20.809 --> 03:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
transfers from the federal government
 
03:07:23.510 --> 03:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
are a really significant part about 3.7
 
03:07:25.190 --> 03:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
billion dollars as you can see on that
 
03:07:27.650 --> 03:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
graph that includes some pandemic
 
03:07:29.570 --> 03:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
related aid but most of that came in the
 
03:07:31.969 --> 03:07:31.979 align:start position:0%
last two fiscal years so this is State
 
03:07:34.130 --> 03:07:34.140 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2022 you can see federal
 
03:07:36.230 --> 03:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
grants are a big part of the picture
 
03:07:38.690 --> 03:07:38.700 align:start position:0%
the next largest slices you can see the
 
03:07:40.250 --> 03:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
business profits tax is our largest
 
03:07:42.410 --> 03:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
state tax revenue source and then the
 
03:07:43.550 --> 03:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission and the Lottery
 
03:07:46.010 --> 03:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
Commission and these slices may be
 
03:07:47.389 --> 03:07:47.399 align:start position:0%
larger than you're sort of used to
 
03:07:48.769 --> 03:07:48.779 align:start position:0%
seeing used to thinking about when
 
03:07:50.030 --> 03:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
you're thinking about State revenues
 
03:07:51.710 --> 03:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
that's because this is measuring gross
 
03:07:53.809 --> 03:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
revenue and the Liquor Commission and
 
03:07:55.309 --> 03:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission have to pay for their
 
03:07:56.990 --> 03:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
own expenses running the stores
 
03:07:59.269 --> 03:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
purchasing the products uh paying for
 
03:08:01.849 --> 03:08:01.859 align:start position:0%
winnings Etc and then after that the
 
03:08:03.230 --> 03:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals tax Statewide
 
03:08:04.550 --> 03:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
education property tax business
 
03:08:06.650 --> 03:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax Medicaid enhancement tax
 
03:08:08.630 --> 03:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax and the list
 
03:08:10.130 --> 03:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
goes on to some of the smaller tax
 
03:08:12.349 --> 03:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
revenue sources there
 
03:08:15.130 --> 03:08:15.140 align:start position:0%
um so that's sort of the large picture
 
03:08:18.230 --> 03:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
and uh and I want to talk a moment about
 
03:08:21.110 --> 03:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
that Federal fund slice because federal
 
03:08:22.969 --> 03:08:22.979 align:start position:0%
funds have been a really significant
 
03:08:25.550 --> 03:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
part of both state revenues funding
 
03:08:27.110 --> 03:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
State services or services that are
 
03:08:28.849 --> 03:08:28.859 align:start position:0%
provided by the state and the state
 
03:08:30.710 --> 03:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
economy particularly over the last two
 
03:08:32.389 --> 03:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
years they are every year but
 
03:08:33.469 --> 03:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
particularly over the last two years
 
03:08:35.150 --> 03:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
they've been significant as you can see
 
03:08:38.269 --> 03:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
on Slide Five this is the total amount
 
03:08:41.030 --> 03:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
of Revenue that has come from the
 
03:08:43.969 --> 03:08:43.979 align:start position:0%
federal government to the state over the
 
03:08:47.269 --> 03:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
year and a quarter roughly from March of
 
03:08:50.710 --> 03:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
2020 related to covid-19
 
03:08:53.750 --> 03:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic relief packages and Recovery
 
03:08:53.760 --> 03:08:54.889 align:start position:0%
pandemic relief packages and Recovery
packages

03:08:54.889 --> 03:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
packages
 
03:08:57.110 --> 03:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
and that 17 billion dollar figure I do
 
03:09:03.769 --> 03:09:03.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:06.710 --> 03:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh last budget that's a good question so
 
03:09:08.870 --> 03:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
because not all federal funds or state
 
03:09:11.570 --> 03:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
funds go through the state budget the
 
03:09:13.849 --> 03:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
portion that's federal grants associated
 
03:09:16.730 --> 03:09:16.740 align:start position:0%
with state budget is about the same size
 
03:09:19.730 --> 03:09:19.740 align:start position:0%
um but uh the amount of so if you were
 
03:09:21.410 --> 03:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
to take the pie chart the same pie chart
 
03:09:24.530 --> 03:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
that you see on slide four for uh fiscal
 
03:09:28.429 --> 03:09:28.439 align:start position:0%
year uh 2021 then you'd see that it's
 
03:09:31.370 --> 03:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
almost half of the pie so it's dropped
 
03:09:34.070 --> 03:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
significantly between 2021 and 2022. and
 
03:09:36.230 --> 03:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry uh chair I want to go to
 
03:09:37.730 --> 03:09:37.740 align:start position:0%
you first to call on members so my
 
03:09:39.769 --> 03:09:39.779 align:start position:0%
apologies for that that's that's okay
 
03:09:42.110 --> 03:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
we'll do that from now on okay my
 
03:09:44.090 --> 03:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
apologies I was eager to answer the
 
03:09:46.130 --> 03:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
question so my apologies to uh for
 
03:09:47.750 --> 03:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
jumping in
 
03:09:50.690 --> 03:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
um so if the you can see in this pie
 
03:09:50.700 --> 03:09:51.590 align:start position:0%
um so if the you can see in this pie
chart

03:09:51.590 --> 03:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
chart
 
03:09:53.690 --> 03:09:53.700 align:start position:0%
um 17 billion dollars roughly is the
 
03:09:56.090 --> 03:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
number and it's this pie chart as as of
 
03:09:59.330 --> 03:09:59.340 align:start position:0%
July 2022 as of the end of September
 
03:10:00.889 --> 03:10:00.899 align:start position:0%
um that figure was about the same and
 
03:10:02.269 --> 03:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
these numbers are from the office of
 
03:10:03.710 --> 03:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistant which
 
03:10:05.990 --> 03:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
tracks these revenues as they come to
 
03:10:07.790 --> 03:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
the state and I should note this is not
 
03:10:09.769 --> 03:10:09.779 align:start position:0%
just the state government this is you
 
03:10:10.849 --> 03:10:10.859 align:start position:0%
know you could see the largest slice of
 
03:10:12.590 --> 03:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
the pie is a paycheck Protection Program
 
03:10:14.389 --> 03:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
and other Aid to businesses about five
 
03:10:16.010 --> 03:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
billion dollars so that's going into the
 
03:10:16.020 --> 03:10:17.330 align:start position:0%
billion dollars so that's going into the
economy

03:10:17.330 --> 03:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
economy
 
03:10:18.769 --> 03:10:18.779 align:start position:0%
um economic impact payments to
 
03:10:20.210 --> 03:10:20.220 align:start position:0%
individuals the so-called stimulus
 
03:10:21.710 --> 03:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
checks right that's the next largest
 
03:10:24.110 --> 03:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
slice but one of the significant
 
03:10:26.210 --> 03:10:26.220 align:start position:0%
components here is that 17 billion
 
03:10:28.429 --> 03:10:28.439 align:start position:0%
dollars that's larger than a two-year
 
03:10:30.769 --> 03:10:30.779 align:start position:0%
state budget right which is about 13.6
 
03:10:32.090 --> 03:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
billion dollars so when we're talking
 
03:10:34.130 --> 03:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
about money flowing into state
 
03:10:36.110 --> 03:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
government and the state economy and
 
03:10:37.790 --> 03:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
local governments and other entities in
 
03:10:39.710 --> 03:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
the state this is a really significant
 
03:10:41.570 --> 03:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
infusion of resources that we've just
 
03:10:43.429 --> 03:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
seen not all of this has been spent yet
 
03:10:44.929 --> 03:10:44.939 align:start position:0%
but that we've just seen over the last
 
03:10:47.389 --> 03:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
uh two and a half years or so
 
03:10:49.429 --> 03:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
and relative to the size of the state
 
03:10:51.230 --> 03:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
economy which as you can see on the
 
03:10:53.870 --> 03:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
slide in 2019 was about 87 billion
 
03:10:55.730 --> 03:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
dollars our growth State product if you
 
03:10:57.290 --> 03:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
will our state version of gross domestic
 
03:10:57.300 --> 03:10:58.070 align:start position:0%
will our state version of gross domestic
product

03:10:58.070 --> 03:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
product
 
03:10:59.929 --> 03:10:59.939 align:start position:0%
17 billion dollars is a really
 
03:11:02.570 --> 03:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
significant bump in resources
 
03:11:04.610 --> 03:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
um relative to pre-pandemic economy and
 
03:11:06.410 --> 03:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
relative to what usual state
 
03:11:09.710 --> 03:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
expenditures are if you will
 
03:11:11.929 --> 03:11:11.939 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about the tax revenue
 
03:11:14.030 --> 03:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
sources a little bit more that was the
 
03:11:16.550 --> 03:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh the big picture of federal grants
 
03:11:19.010 --> 03:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
related to covid-19 what about tax
 
03:11:21.950 --> 03:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
revenue sources this pie chart looks at
 
03:11:24.170 --> 03:11:24.180 align:start position:0%
sort of the big picture of state and
 
03:11:27.110 --> 03:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
local tax revenue sources combined and
 
03:11:28.790 --> 03:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
here you can see and this is on slide
 
03:11:30.650 --> 03:11:30.660 align:start position:0%
six so my apologies for those of you
 
03:11:32.269 --> 03:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
that are leafing through
 
03:11:34.550 --> 03:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
um for moving too quickly but uh on
 
03:11:37.190 --> 03:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
slide six you can see state and local
 
03:11:39.349 --> 03:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
tax revenue sources combined
 
03:11:41.570 --> 03:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
and you'll note that the local property
 
03:11:43.730 --> 03:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
tax is a little bit more than half of
 
03:11:45.830 --> 03:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
all the state and local taxes collected
 
03:11:47.170 --> 03:11:47.180 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
03:11:49.550 --> 03:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
the Statewide education property tax
 
03:11:50.990 --> 03:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
which is raised and retained locally is
 
03:11:53.150 --> 03:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
another five percent on top of that that
 
03:11:55.309 --> 03:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
functions more effectively like a local
 
03:11:57.830 --> 03:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
property tax and then you could see in
 
03:11:59.269 --> 03:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
Orange the business profits and business
 
03:12:01.790 --> 03:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
Enterprise taxes together and then the
 
03:12:03.410 --> 03:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
smaller tax revenue sources all the way
 
03:12:05.150 --> 03:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
down to the interest in dividends tax
 
03:12:08.170 --> 03:12:08.180 align:start position:0%
other state taxes and other local taxes
 
03:12:10.550 --> 03:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
there are some other local tax revenue
 
03:12:12.230 --> 03:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
sources but they're relatively small
 
03:12:15.590 --> 03:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
compared to the property tax include
 
03:12:16.849 --> 03:12:16.859 align:start position:0%
things like the timber tax the
 
03:12:19.130 --> 03:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
excavation tax Etc
 
03:12:22.610 --> 03:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
so on slide 7 you'll see what may be a
 
03:12:25.190 --> 03:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
more familiar array of revenues and
 
03:12:27.950 --> 03:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
their relative size when you as the
 
03:12:29.150 --> 03:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
house Ways and Means Committee are
 
03:12:30.769 --> 03:12:30.779 align:start position:0%
thinking about projecting revenues and
 
03:12:32.450 --> 03:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
that's because these are the revenues to
 
03:12:34.250 --> 03:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
the general fund and the education trust
 
03:12:36.230 --> 03:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
fund combined and a lot of these Revenue
 
03:12:38.510 --> 03:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
sources are shared for example you can
 
03:12:40.190 --> 03:12:40.200 align:start position:0%
see the business profits and business
 
03:12:42.889 --> 03:12:42.899 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax the taxes which I've
 
03:12:44.570 --> 03:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
shaded together here both of them are
 
03:12:46.849 --> 03:12:46.859 align:start position:0%
split between the general fund and the
 
03:12:48.230 --> 03:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
education trust fund they have their own
 
03:12:49.910 --> 03:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
unique splits across the two different
 
03:12:52.910 --> 03:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
tax revenue sources this uh you could
 
03:12:55.250 --> 03:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
see that it's about it's more than a
 
03:12:56.630 --> 03:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
third of Revenue to the general
 
03:12:58.370 --> 03:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
education trust funds or from the two
 
03:13:00.710 --> 03:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
business taxes combined and I've shaded
 
03:13:02.269 --> 03:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
them together because
 
03:13:05.450 --> 03:13:05.460 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to tell exactly what is
 
03:13:07.130 --> 03:13:07.140 align:start position:0%
business profits tax revenue what is
 
03:13:09.170 --> 03:13:09.180 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax revenue until
 
03:13:11.210 --> 03:13:11.220 align:start position:0%
all the returns are in and all the
 
03:13:13.490 --> 03:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
information has been sorted by the
 
03:13:14.570 --> 03:13:14.580 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
03:13:16.070 --> 03:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
there's sometimes a significant lag
 
03:13:18.710 --> 03:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
there so the split you see here is what
 
03:13:20.030 --> 03:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
the annual comprehensive financial
 
03:13:23.990 --> 03:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
report uh shows for a fiscal year but
 
03:13:26.630 --> 03:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
that can include uh revenue from many
 
03:13:29.090 --> 03:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
different tax years and is not
 
03:13:31.730 --> 03:13:31.740 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh in line with exactly what
 
03:13:32.690 --> 03:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
is the split between the business
 
03:13:34.370 --> 03:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
profits and business Enterprise taxes
 
03:13:35.809 --> 03:13:35.819 align:start position:0%
excuse me we have a question
 
03:13:37.969 --> 03:13:37.979 align:start position:0%
representative play yes thank you you're
 
03:13:40.730 --> 03:13:40.740 align:start position:0%
going kind of fast uh the the revenues
 
03:13:42.769 --> 03:13:42.779 align:start position:0%
you touched on earlier combined 17
 
03:13:45.710 --> 03:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
billion this shot shows a revenues of
 
03:13:48.410 --> 03:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
general and education is that still 17
 
03:13:50.570 --> 03:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
billion or is it a bigger pie no this is
 
03:13:52.849 --> 03:13:52.859 align:start position:0%
yes that's a great question
 
03:13:55.849 --> 03:13:55.859 align:start position:0%
um the 17 billion is the federal revenue
 
03:13:57.349 --> 03:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
the revenue that comes from the federal
 
03:13:59.870 --> 03:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
government and has come but with
 
03:14:02.990 --> 03:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
covid-19 related Aid so that's that's
 
03:14:04.670 --> 03:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
talking about that sort of federal fund
 
03:14:07.790 --> 03:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
slice of the pie so back to on on slide
 
03:14:09.950 --> 03:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
four and you can see it on the screen I
 
03:14:11.750 --> 03:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
talked about the federal revenue piece
 
03:14:13.670 --> 03:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
and particularly the covid-19 related so
 
03:14:17.269 --> 03:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
that Federal size slice and then the
 
03:14:19.370 --> 03:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
rest of the revenue sources broken down
 
03:14:22.370 --> 03:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
by tax revenue on slide six slide seven
 
03:14:25.849 --> 03:14:25.859 align:start position:0%
is a subset of that slide six those tax
 
03:14:27.830 --> 03:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
revenue sources and some of the other
 
03:14:29.450 --> 03:14:29.460 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources that you saw in slide
 
03:14:31.969 --> 03:14:31.979 align:start position:0%
four so slide seven
 
03:14:33.290 --> 03:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
um we were talking about General and
 
03:14:35.690 --> 03:14:35.700 align:start position:0%
education trust fund revenues bigger
 
03:14:37.670 --> 03:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
Tech now what's the number yes so the
 
03:14:40.429 --> 03:14:40.439 align:start position:0%
number in total on slide 10 you can see
 
03:14:43.910 --> 03:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
is a little bit is about 3.2 billion I
 
03:14:45.370 --> 03:14:45.380 align:start position:0%
believe was the number I think it's like
 
03:14:48.830 --> 03:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
3.424 billion is what it is
 
03:14:51.410 --> 03:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
um so that General and education trust
 
03:14:55.250 --> 03:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
funds piece is just the subset of for
 
03:14:57.830 --> 03:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
example the whole state budget on slide
 
03:15:00.710 --> 03:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
eight you can see the breakdown of what
 
03:15:04.010 --> 03:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
is in the state budget by fund and sorry
 
03:15:05.450 --> 03:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
to skip around a little bit here but
 
03:15:06.769 --> 03:15:06.779 align:start position:0%
this question covers a fair bit of
 
03:15:06.779 --> 03:15:07.510 align:start position:0%
this question covers a fair bit of
ground

03:15:07.510 --> 03:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
ground
 
03:15:10.790 --> 03:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
slide 8 shows the general fund and the
 
03:15:12.710 --> 03:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
education trust fund combined that's
 
03:15:15.230 --> 03:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
about 40 percent of the state budget and
 
03:15:16.849 --> 03:15:16.859 align:start position:0%
the state budget in state fiscal year
 
03:15:19.730 --> 03:15:19.740 align:start position:0%
2022 appropriated a little bit north of
 
03:15:22.190 --> 03:15:22.200 align:start position:0%
six billion dollars
 
03:15:24.590 --> 03:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
um so that's what was appropriated not
 
03:15:26.269 --> 03:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
the revenue collected the revenue
 
03:15:28.190 --> 03:15:28.200 align:start position:0%
collected ended up being a little bit
 
03:15:31.070 --> 03:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
north of 3 billion uh again 3.2 billion
 
03:15:33.349 --> 03:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
dollars I believe it was so that was a
 
03:15:34.550 --> 03:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
lot of information right there I'm happy
 
03:15:36.290 --> 03:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
to answer a follow-up question if I can
 
03:15:38.590 --> 03:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
help provide clarity
 
03:15:41.809 --> 03:15:41.819 align:start position:0%
representative Ami
 
03:15:46.370 --> 03:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
thank you on are fees in other funds on
 
03:15:49.670 --> 03:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
slide eight uh on slide eight uh well
 
03:15:49.680 --> 03:15:50.750 align:start position:0%
slide eight uh on slide eight uh well
yes

03:15:50.750 --> 03:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:15:51.950 --> 03:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
um that's not to say that there aren't
 
03:15:53.750 --> 03:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
fees that don't go to the general fund
 
03:15:55.790 --> 03:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
there are some uh that end up in the
 
03:15:58.370 --> 03:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
general fund but other funds would be
 
03:16:01.370 --> 03:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
specific dedicated funds for oftentimes
 
03:16:03.530 --> 03:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
for specific purposes for example the
 
03:16:05.389 --> 03:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
food protection section collects fees
 
03:16:07.070 --> 03:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
associated with doing food inspections
 
03:16:09.410 --> 03:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
at restaurants and a portion of those
 
03:16:11.809 --> 03:16:11.819 align:start position:0%
fees go to a specific fund that helps
 
03:16:13.190 --> 03:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
support the food protection section
 
03:16:14.690 --> 03:16:14.700 align:start position:0%
that's an example of something that
 
03:16:16.790 --> 03:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
would end up in the other funds category
 
03:16:20.510 --> 03:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
so it's I believe the last uh time I
 
03:16:22.670 --> 03:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
heard a reference to is more than 200
 
03:16:24.889 --> 03:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
other funds special dedicated funds for
 
03:16:27.889 --> 03:16:27.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:29.929 --> 03:16:29.939 align:start position:0%
thank you yep I think they're more than
 
03:16:32.030 --> 03:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
that there may be more than that the
 
03:16:33.889 --> 03:16:33.899 align:start position:0%
number I've heard is more than 200 but I
 
03:16:34.969 --> 03:16:34.979 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be surprised if it's above
 
03:16:36.830 --> 03:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
three at this point
 
03:16:39.290 --> 03:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
representative ours
 
03:16:41.269 --> 03:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thanks for
 
03:16:43.490 --> 03:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
taking my question so if I don't I don't
 
03:16:45.950 --> 03:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
want to have to do the math but for
 
03:16:48.410 --> 03:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
state tax and other revenues is that
 
03:16:51.170 --> 03:16:51.180 align:start position:0%
about 13 billion or can you give us the
 
03:16:52.730 --> 03:16:52.740 align:start position:0%
number so we don't have to add all these
 
03:16:54.410 --> 03:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
up yeah so the state tax and other
 
03:16:57.170 --> 03:16:57.180 align:start position:0%
revenues I believe uh the total on that
 
03:16:58.309 --> 03:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
and I can get back to you with the
 
03:16:59.750 --> 03:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
number but the total is a little north
 
03:17:01.429 --> 03:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
of 9 billion
 
03:17:03.230 --> 03:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
um is what it is um and again that's
 
03:17:05.210 --> 03:17:05.220 align:start position:0%
including revenues beyond what you see
 
03:17:07.969 --> 03:17:07.979 align:start position:0%
in the state budget for example
 
03:17:09.530 --> 03:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
um and this is including all
 
03:17:11.990 --> 03:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
governmental and Enterprise funds so not
 
03:17:13.730 --> 03:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
all this Revenue shows up in the state
 
03:17:15.170 --> 03:17:15.180 align:start position:0%
budget which is why that number is
 
03:17:17.090 --> 03:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
different than the six billion dollars
 
03:17:19.130 --> 03:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
in change you see annually in the in the
 
03:17:21.590 --> 03:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
state budget Appropriations but this is
 
03:17:25.010 --> 03:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
the as I as I noted this is my attempt
 
03:17:26.929 --> 03:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
to get as comprehensively as I can to
 
03:17:28.550 --> 03:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
all the revenue sources that the state
 
03:17:30.230 --> 03:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
has based on the annual comprehensive
 
03:17:31.969 --> 03:17:31.979 align:start position:0%
financial report
 
03:17:33.889 --> 03:17:33.899 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and a follow-up question
 
03:17:36.830 --> 03:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
if I may follow up
 
03:17:39.650 --> 03:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
page number six what is the number for
 
03:17:39.660 --> 03:17:41.269 align:start position:0%
page number six what is the number for
that

03:17:41.269 --> 03:17:41.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:17:44.389 --> 03:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh yes so the number for this
 
03:17:44.399 --> 03:17:45.130 align:start position:0%
uh yes so the number for this
um

03:17:45.130 --> 03:17:45.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:47.269 --> 03:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
I don't remember off the top of my head
 
03:17:49.250 --> 03:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
what this number is
 
03:17:51.230 --> 03:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
um but I can get back to you with that
 
03:17:53.030 --> 03:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
total if you'd like okay thank you very
 
03:17:55.070 --> 03:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
much you're welcome
 
03:17:59.030 --> 03:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
I I should note you know that the uh
 
03:18:02.450 --> 03:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
state tax revenue sources and I'll get
 
03:18:03.590 --> 03:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
back to you with a specific number I
 
03:18:05.150 --> 03:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I have the the correct
 
03:18:05.160 --> 03:18:07.550 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I have the the correct
one

03:18:07.550 --> 03:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:07.560 --> 03:18:09.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:18:09.309 --> 03:18:09.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:18:13.250 --> 03:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
continue yes
 
03:18:13.260 --> 03:18:14.510 align:start position:0%
continue yes
so

03:18:14.510 --> 03:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:18:18.530 --> 03:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
um if we look at so again on slide eight
 
03:18:20.150 --> 03:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
um the general education trust funds
 
03:18:21.290 --> 03:18:21.300 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:18:22.790 --> 03:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
um which are the revenues for that are
 
03:18:24.710 --> 03:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
represented on slide seven
 
03:18:26.090 --> 03:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
um and you can see it's actually one
 
03:18:27.349 --> 03:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
thing I want to note on slide seven it's
 
03:18:29.090 --> 03:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
a relatively diverse picture right
 
03:18:31.070 --> 03:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
there's other than the business profits
 
03:18:33.110 --> 03:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
tax growing to be us uh more than a
 
03:18:36.469 --> 03:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
quarter of the whole pie chart otherwise
 
03:18:38.570 --> 03:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
other than the business profits tax
 
03:18:40.070 --> 03:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax on the Statewide
 
03:18:41.630 --> 03:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
education property tax everything else
 
03:18:43.730 --> 03:18:43.740 align:start position:0%
is under 10 with the meals and rentals
 
03:18:46.730 --> 03:18:46.740 align:start position:0%
tax starting to get to that 10 figure so
 
03:18:48.290 --> 03:18:48.300 align:start position:0%
it means it's a relatively diverse tax
 
03:18:49.790 --> 03:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
revenue base for the general and
 
03:18:51.469 --> 03:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
education trust funds
 
03:18:54.830 --> 03:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
and on slide eight uh you can see how
 
03:18:56.510 --> 03:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
the state budget is broken down and
 
03:18:59.210 --> 03:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
again not all tax rate not all revenue
 
03:19:01.429 --> 03:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
that the state collects including those
 
03:19:03.349 --> 03:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
federal grants go through the state
 
03:19:05.809 --> 03:19:05.819 align:start position:0%
budget itself but the state budget has
 
03:19:07.490 --> 03:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
about a third funded through Federal
 
03:19:09.889 --> 03:19:09.899 align:start position:0%
transfers and 40 percent come from those
 
03:19:15.710 --> 03:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:17.990 --> 03:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
so I'll move us on to if we're if we're
 
03:19:20.210 --> 03:19:20.220 align:start position:0%
ready I'll move us on to revenue Trends
 
03:19:21.650 --> 03:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
since the pandemic and really some
 
03:19:23.630 --> 03:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
recent Revenue Trends and this was the
 
03:19:25.370 --> 03:19:25.380 align:start position:0%
slide I referred to earlier this is
 
03:19:28.389 --> 03:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
slide 10. this shows the
 
03:19:31.190 --> 03:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
inflation-adjusted revenue over time to
 
03:19:32.870 --> 03:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
the general and education trust funds
 
03:19:34.849 --> 03:19:34.859 align:start position:0%
and this is irrespective of policy
 
03:19:36.469 --> 03:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
changes so there are changes in tax
 
03:19:38.150 --> 03:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
rates there are changes in which funds
 
03:19:39.830 --> 03:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
are in the general fund or in the
 
03:19:41.349 --> 03:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
education trust funds and which aren't
 
03:19:43.550 --> 03:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
over the course of this time period
 
03:19:46.010 --> 03:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
because it's going back to 2006 but you
 
03:19:47.630 --> 03:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
can see it's been a relatively steady
 
03:19:50.570 --> 03:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
picture that being said before the Great
 
03:19:54.110 --> 03:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
Recession we saw higher Revenue so 2006
 
03:19:58.130 --> 03:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
2007 2008 and then there was a very long
 
03:20:00.050 --> 03:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
period in which the revenues were
 
03:20:01.550 --> 03:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
substantially below that in
 
03:20:04.250 --> 03:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
inflation-adjusted terms until about
 
03:20:08.090 --> 03:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
2015 2016 we saw the economy after a
 
03:20:10.250 --> 03:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
slow a period of very slow growth start
 
03:20:11.870 --> 03:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
to pick up again and that was reflected
 
03:20:14.570 --> 03:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
in tax revenues and then most recently
 
03:20:17.150 --> 03:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
we saw a decline in state fiscal year
 
03:20:19.309 --> 03:20:19.319 align:start position:0%
2020 associated with the pandemic and
 
03:20:21.889 --> 03:20:21.899 align:start position:0%
then we see these increases in 2021 and
 
03:20:24.110 --> 03:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
2022 which we'll talk about a little bit
 
03:20:24.120 --> 03:20:26.750 align:start position:0%
2022 which we'll talk about a little bit
more

03:20:26.750 --> 03:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:29.750 --> 03:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
so those increases and on slide 11 you
 
03:20:31.969 --> 03:20:31.979 align:start position:0%
can see an array of Revenue sources for
 
03:20:33.590 --> 03:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
the general and education trust funds
 
03:20:35.450 --> 03:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
what has been driving some of those
 
03:20:38.330 --> 03:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
increases well in dollar terms we can
 
03:20:40.010 --> 03:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
see that the combined business taxes
 
03:20:42.110 --> 03:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
have been the primary driver you can see
 
03:20:45.170 --> 03:20:45.180 align:start position:0%
shaded in green is State fiscal year is
 
03:20:48.230 --> 03:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
2017 to 2022 what the difference is and
 
03:20:49.910 --> 03:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
then shaded in blue a little shorter
 
03:20:52.250 --> 03:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
timeline State fiscal year 2019 so just
 
03:20:54.290 --> 03:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic to State fiscal year
 
03:20:57.170 --> 03:20:57.180 align:start position:0%
2022 and you can see the business taxes
 
03:20:59.809 --> 03:20:59.819 align:start position:0%
combined even between 2019 and 2022 have
 
03:21:02.210 --> 03:21:02.220 align:start position:0%
added essentially more than a whole
 
03:21:04.070 --> 03:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals tax in additional
 
03:21:06.469 --> 03:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
Revenue over that time period that being
 
03:21:08.090 --> 03:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
said the real estate transfer tax the
 
03:21:09.950 --> 03:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals tax and the interest
 
03:21:11.570 --> 03:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
in dividends tax as well as Lottery
 
03:21:13.309 --> 03:21:13.319 align:start position:0%
Commission revenues have done relatively
 
03:21:16.490 --> 03:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
well over this time period too the
 
03:21:19.969 --> 03:21:19.979 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax I wouldn't expect to be a
 
03:21:21.710 --> 03:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
growing tax revenue Source going into
 
03:21:22.910 --> 03:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
the future for some of the reasons
 
03:21:24.590 --> 03:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner step already spoke about
 
03:21:27.050 --> 03:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
last week but it's probably going to to
 
03:21:28.969 --> 03:21:28.979 align:start position:0%
be a declining Revenue Source over time
 
03:21:31.490 --> 03:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
and because it is a fixed dollar amount
 
03:21:34.010 --> 03:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
for packs of cigarettes it's a declining
 
03:21:35.690 --> 03:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
source of real Revenue as well after you
 
03:21:37.429 --> 03:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
adjust for inflation
 
03:21:39.349 --> 03:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
insurance premium tax revenues have done
 
03:21:41.330 --> 03:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
relatively well Liquor Commission
 
03:21:43.969 --> 03:21:43.979 align:start position:0%
revenues if you compare these uh these
 
03:21:46.370 --> 03:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
two periods have been relatively flat
 
03:21:48.950 --> 03:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
that being said there are Liquor
 
03:21:50.990 --> 03:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
Commission revenues that go to other
 
03:21:53.269 --> 03:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
operations outside of the general fund
 
03:21:54.830 --> 03:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
that go to other funds such as the
 
03:21:56.469 --> 03:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
alcohol abuse prevention treatment fund
 
03:21:59.030 --> 03:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
so some of those policy changes in that
 
03:22:00.670 --> 03:22:00.680 align:start position:0%
window have likely affected that number
 
03:22:03.050 --> 03:22:03.060 align:start position:0%
and then you can see all other General
 
03:22:04.969 --> 03:22:04.979 align:start position:0%
and education trust fund revenues second
 
03:22:06.950 --> 03:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
to the right those have actually been
 
03:22:08.630 --> 03:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
down over this time period so if you
 
03:22:10.010 --> 03:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
look at all the other Revenue sources
 
03:22:13.790 --> 03:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
combined we see a net reduction in uh in
 
03:22:15.050 --> 03:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
revenues and again these are not
 
03:22:17.210 --> 03:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
adjusted for inflation so this is a
 
03:22:19.969 --> 03:22:19.979 align:start position:0%
nominal dollar figures if you will so
 
03:22:21.889 --> 03:22:21.899 align:start position:0%
the shows that the revenue drivers the
 
03:22:23.389 --> 03:22:23.399 align:start position:0%
primary revenue drivers are covered in
 
03:22:25.190 --> 03:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
these other tax revenue sources or other
 
03:22:26.990 --> 03:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources I should say
 
03:22:28.910 --> 03:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
and uh all the way over on the right I
 
03:22:30.769 --> 03:22:30.779 align:start position:0%
put the motor fuels tax in as well this
 
03:22:32.030 --> 03:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
does not support the general and
 
03:22:33.410 --> 03:22:33.420 align:start position:0%
education trust funds but it does
 
03:22:35.150 --> 03:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
support the highway fund so something
 
03:22:36.769 --> 03:22:36.779 align:start position:0%
that uh this committee will likely be
 
03:22:38.929 --> 03:22:38.939 align:start position:0%
thinking about and those revenues are
 
03:22:40.910 --> 03:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
still a little bit down in 2022 relative
 
03:22:44.750 --> 03:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
to where they were in 17 and 19.
 
03:22:47.690 --> 03:22:47.700 align:start position:0%
so if you prefer lines to bars then and
 
03:22:50.150 --> 03:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
you want to see on a monthly basis this
 
03:22:52.730 --> 03:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
is the slide 12 is a 12 month rolling
 
03:22:55.309 --> 03:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
average that shows what the change in
 
03:22:58.190 --> 03:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue in dollars has been relative to
 
03:23:02.030 --> 03:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
the prior year going back to 2014 state
 
03:23:04.610 --> 03:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2014. you could see that
 
03:23:06.590 --> 03:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
thick green line is general and
 
03:23:09.229 --> 03:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
education trust funds Revenue The Thin
 
03:23:11.630 --> 03:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
Blue Line the thinner blue line is
 
03:23:13.250 --> 03:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
without the business profits and
 
03:23:14.809 --> 03:23:14.819 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise taxes backing those
 
03:23:18.229 --> 03:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
out and then uh um the business
 
03:23:20.269 --> 03:23:20.279 align:start position:0%
Enterprise business profits meals and
 
03:23:22.070 --> 03:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
rentals and real estate transfer taxes
 
03:23:24.530 --> 03:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
are backed out in that thin orange line
 
03:23:27.290 --> 03:23:27.300 align:start position:0%
and there's a couple you know noteworthy
 
03:23:30.469 --> 03:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
deviations from that from uh Trend if
 
03:23:32.510 --> 03:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
you will um over over the course of this
 
03:23:35.090 --> 03:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
time period one is that first rise that
 
03:23:36.650 --> 03:23:36.660 align:start position:0%
we see which is broadly across tax
 
03:23:38.030 --> 03:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
revenue sources that's really the
 
03:23:40.250 --> 03:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
economy starting to pick up again after
 
03:23:42.830 --> 03:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
the Great Recession the second one you
 
03:23:44.570 --> 03:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
can see is almost entirely that green
 
03:23:46.910 --> 03:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
one line that's business tax revenue
 
03:23:48.830 --> 03:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
increasing after the tax cuts and jobs
 
03:23:50.510 --> 03:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
act at the federal level spurred more
 
03:23:53.269 --> 03:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
repatriation and actual repatriation as
 
03:23:56.330 --> 03:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
opposed to deemed repatriation of um of
 
03:23:58.010 --> 03:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
corporate profits that were captured in
 
03:24:00.590 --> 03:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax revenues we see
 
03:24:03.650 --> 03:24:03.660 align:start position:0%
a drop following those one-time revenues
 
03:24:05.510 --> 03:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
and associated with the beginning of the
 
03:24:07.490 --> 03:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
pandemic and then a really significant
 
03:24:09.229 --> 03:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
increase particularly in the business
 
03:24:11.090 --> 03:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
taxes so that green lines pushed up
 
03:24:13.910 --> 03:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
further but also in other tax revenue
 
03:24:15.290 --> 03:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
sources to the general and education
 
03:24:16.610 --> 03:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
trust funds because you can see that
 
03:24:19.070 --> 03:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
that orange line and the blue line are
 
03:24:22.490 --> 03:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
also historically relatively High
 
03:24:24.950 --> 03:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about the tax revenue
 
03:24:27.710 --> 03:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
sources in a little bit more detail I'm
 
03:24:29.330 --> 03:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
not going to go Source by Source but I'm
 
03:24:30.950 --> 03:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
going to go to a few specific sources
 
03:24:33.410 --> 03:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
yes was there a question
 
03:24:35.090 --> 03:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions on that
 
03:24:37.550 --> 03:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
last section or we all sent
 
03:24:40.690 --> 03:24:40.700 align:start position:0%
okay yes okay great thank you very much
 
03:24:43.490 --> 03:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
so the two primary business taxes just
 
03:24:43.500 --> 03:24:44.389 align:start position:0%
so the two primary business taxes just
to

03:24:44.389 --> 03:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:24:46.550 --> 03:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
um uh review some of the some of the
 
03:24:48.710 --> 03:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
material that you've already seen the
 
03:24:51.769 --> 03:24:51.779 align:start position:0%
business profits tax is uh is more like
 
03:24:53.269 --> 03:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
your typical State corporate income tax
 
03:24:55.070 --> 03:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
it's based on Gross business profits and
 
03:24:56.929 --> 03:24:56.939 align:start position:0%
corporate income there are adjustments
 
03:24:58.250 --> 03:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
including credits for business
 
03:25:00.290 --> 03:25:00.300 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax paid that's applied to
 
03:25:01.910 --> 03:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax and
 
03:25:03.950 --> 03:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
apportionment which apportionment is the
 
03:25:07.370 --> 03:25:07.380 align:start position:0%
process for determining how much tax uh
 
03:25:10.429 --> 03:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
Revenue a multi-state entity owes to the
 
03:25:11.750 --> 03:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
03:25:14.450 --> 03:25:14.460 align:start position:0%
the tax base for this so the pool of
 
03:25:16.849 --> 03:25:16.859 align:start position:0%
economic activity that this is drawing
 
03:25:18.950 --> 03:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
from was likely about 6.8 billion
 
03:25:21.710 --> 03:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
dollars in tax year 2020. and again tax
 
03:25:23.330 --> 03:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
year 2020 is the most recent year for
 
03:25:25.370 --> 03:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
which we have the sort of the final or
 
03:25:27.229 --> 03:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
close to final parsing between the
 
03:25:28.250 --> 03:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
business profits and the business
 
03:25:32.210 --> 03:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
Enterprise taxes um so that's yeah
 
03:25:35.090 --> 03:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
um so where it says tax based on Gross
 
03:25:36.889 --> 03:25:36.899 align:start position:0%
business profits
 
03:25:39.889 --> 03:25:39.899 align:start position:0%
um that is the threshold I believe as to
 
03:25:42.530 --> 03:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
whether the tax whether you're possibly
 
03:25:44.570 --> 03:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
subject to the tax but the tax itself is
 
03:25:46.670 --> 03:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
based on the net business profits is it
 
03:25:50.990 --> 03:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
not uh so thinking back to the statute
 
03:25:53.570 --> 03:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
um the uh there are ways that you can
 
03:25:55.010 --> 03:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
apply credits and there are ways that
 
03:25:57.290 --> 03:25:57.300 align:start position:0%
you could apply sort of for example that
 
03:25:58.910 --> 03:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
initial exemption
 
03:26:02.150 --> 03:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
um whether that uh so when I say tax
 
03:26:04.070 --> 03:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
based on Gross business profits here
 
03:26:05.630 --> 03:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
that's part of the calculation right
 
03:26:07.130 --> 03:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
that's the first of the string of
 
03:26:08.690 --> 03:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
calculations that's done here because
 
03:26:10.070 --> 03:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
there's those gross business profits and
 
03:26:11.690 --> 03:26:11.700 align:start position:0%
there are adjustments for it adjustments
 
03:26:14.389 --> 03:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
is made and then apportionment so I hope
 
03:26:16.010 --> 03:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
that answered your question
 
03:26:18.229 --> 03:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
okay so yeah I just wanted to make clear
 
03:26:20.750 --> 03:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
that the actual tax you pay is based on
 
03:26:23.750 --> 03:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
the gross minus those adjustments minus
 
03:26:26.030 --> 03:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
the businesses expenses and then right
 
03:26:28.070 --> 03:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so there so there are
 
03:26:29.269 --> 03:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
um there are adjustments and I did use
 
03:26:31.250 --> 03:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
the term profits as opposed to income
 
03:26:33.050 --> 03:26:33.060 align:start position:0%
there you know so with some intention
 
03:26:36.650 --> 03:26:36.660 align:start position:0%
around that too thank you yep absolutely
 
03:26:39.229 --> 03:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
um so the tax rate is then applied to
 
03:26:42.530 --> 03:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
that roughly 6.8 billion dollars
 
03:26:44.150 --> 03:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
um that was the tax base and there have
 
03:26:45.889 --> 03:26:45.899 align:start position:0%
been a series of rate reductions so from
 
03:26:47.750 --> 03:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
2001 to 2015 it was eight and a half
 
03:26:47.760 --> 03:26:48.830 align:start position:0%
2001 to 2015 it was eight and a half
percent

03:26:48.830 --> 03:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:26:51.110 --> 03:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
um in tax year 2023 seven and a half
 
03:26:52.849 --> 03:26:52.859 align:start position:0%
percent over because of those rate
 
03:26:54.650 --> 03:26:54.660 align:start position:0%
reductions over this time period and
 
03:26:56.450 --> 03:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
again supports the general and education
 
03:26:58.729 --> 03:26:58.739 align:start position:0%
trust funds the business Enterprise tax
 
03:27:00.650 --> 03:27:00.660 align:start position:0%
is actually a little bit it's Unique
 
03:27:03.410 --> 03:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
among state tax revenue sources
 
03:27:05.090 --> 03:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
um and among business taxes that other
 
03:27:06.950 --> 03:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
states have it's based on compensation
 
03:27:09.229 --> 03:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
or interest paid or accrued and
 
03:27:11.210 --> 03:27:11.220 align:start position:0%
dividends paid as well as adjustments
 
03:27:13.370 --> 03:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
and apportionment so again working down
 
03:27:15.410 --> 03:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
from that larger base and and making
 
03:27:17.570 --> 03:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
those adjust based on credits and other
 
03:27:20.150 --> 03:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
and other other things that are not
 
03:27:22.969 --> 03:27:22.979 align:start position:0%
included in the tax base that tax base
 
03:27:26.090 --> 03:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
because compensation is in it is much
 
03:27:28.070 --> 03:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
broader it was likely about 36 billion
 
03:27:29.809 --> 03:27:29.819 align:start position:0%
dollars in tax year 2020. so much
 
03:27:31.969 --> 03:27:31.979 align:start position:0%
broader than than that business profits
 
03:27:34.190 --> 03:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
tax base there have been a series of
 
03:27:36.590 --> 03:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
rate reductions uh that you'll note that
 
03:27:38.210 --> 03:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
the rate itself can be much lower
 
03:27:40.670 --> 03:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
because that base is much broader to
 
03:27:42.110 --> 03:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
collect a significant amount of Revenue
 
03:27:44.990 --> 03:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
it's gone from in 2015 three-quarters of
 
03:27:47.690 --> 03:27:47.700 align:start position:0%
a percent to 0.55 percent starting in
 
03:27:50.750 --> 03:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
2022 and supports the education trust
 
03:27:52.910 --> 03:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
fund and the general fund
 
03:27:55.969 --> 03:27:55.979 align:start position:0%
so on slide 15 what you'll see and
 
03:27:57.290 --> 03:27:57.300 align:start position:0%
you'll see a series of graphs that are
 
03:27:58.450 --> 03:27:58.460 align:start position:0%
like this
 
03:28:01.969 --> 03:28:01.979 align:start position:0%
you'll see the inflation adjusted tax
 
03:28:05.809 --> 03:28:05.819 align:start position:0%
revenue and the uh the percentage growth
 
03:28:09.410 --> 03:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
based on those inflation adjustments and
 
03:28:11.150 --> 03:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
um so after those inflation adjustments
 
03:28:12.530 --> 03:28:12.540 align:start position:0%
this is what the percentage of sort of
 
03:28:14.450 --> 03:28:14.460 align:start position:0%
real inflation-adjusted tax revenue
 
03:28:15.769 --> 03:28:15.779 align:start position:0%
growth was
 
03:28:17.630 --> 03:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
part of the reason why I want to break
 
03:28:20.210 --> 03:28:20.220 align:start position:0%
that down for you here is because as a
 
03:28:21.170 --> 03:28:21.180 align:start position:0%
committee when you're thinking about
 
03:28:22.790 --> 03:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue projections you may want to
 
03:28:25.309 --> 03:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
think about what is the actual growth or
 
03:28:27.050 --> 03:28:27.060 align:start position:0%
change in the underlying economic
 
03:28:30.110 --> 03:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
activity and what is inflation going to
 
03:28:32.450 --> 03:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
be because that affects how many dollars
 
03:28:34.550 --> 03:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
will be collected through those tax
 
03:28:36.050 --> 03:28:36.060 align:start position:0%
revenue sources right so there are two
 
03:28:38.330 --> 03:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
components not just what the economic
 
03:28:41.570 --> 03:28:41.580 align:start position:0%
growth is but also what is the what is
 
03:28:43.309 --> 03:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
what do you expect inflation to be and
 
03:28:44.690 --> 03:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
how might that affect what those actual
 
03:28:47.330 --> 03:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
numbers end up being in terms of your
 
03:28:50.450 --> 03:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
final projections so this graph shows
 
03:28:53.870 --> 03:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
what again adjusted for inflation the
 
03:28:55.729 --> 03:28:55.739 align:start position:0%
Consumer Price Index for urban consumers
 
03:28:57.250 --> 03:28:57.260 align:start position:0%
in the Northeast
 
03:29:00.710 --> 03:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
what the actual underlying growth may
 
03:29:02.929 --> 03:29:02.939 align:start position:0%
have been in the tax base right based on
 
03:29:04.670 --> 03:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
the tax returns that we have
 
03:29:07.910 --> 03:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
and you can see here and again we have
 
03:29:08.929 --> 03:29:08.939 align:start position:0%
the estimate between the business
 
03:29:10.370 --> 03:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
profits and the business Enterprise tax
 
03:29:12.590 --> 03:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
but the total tax amount is what matters
 
03:29:13.670 --> 03:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
most here
 
03:29:15.650 --> 03:29:15.660 align:start position:0%
um I don't even I'll say that
 
03:29:17.389 --> 03:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
um uh I'll say that we'll talk in the
 
03:29:18.469 --> 03:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
next slide a little bit more about the
 
03:29:21.170 --> 03:29:21.180 align:start position:0%
split between the two but uh there was
 
03:29:22.670 --> 03:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
growth prior to the Great Recession
 
03:29:24.650 --> 03:29:24.660 align:start position:0%
after the Great Recession there was a
 
03:29:26.030 --> 03:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
long period of time with very little
 
03:29:28.370 --> 03:29:28.380 align:start position:0%
business tax growth in terms of business
 
03:29:31.130 --> 03:29:31.140 align:start position:0%
tax revenues and then we saw when the
 
03:29:32.929 --> 03:29:32.939 align:start position:0%
economy started to pick up again in 2014
 
03:29:36.229 --> 03:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
and 2015 that being captured in state
 
03:29:38.929 --> 03:29:38.939 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2016 revenues and going
 
03:29:41.330 --> 03:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
forward there was a drop in 2020 and
 
03:29:43.309 --> 03:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
then really significant even after
 
03:29:44.630 --> 03:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
adjusting for inflation really
 
03:29:47.450 --> 03:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
significant increases in fiscal 21 and
 
03:29:50.030 --> 03:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
22. so before we talk about those
 
03:29:51.950 --> 03:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
increases I do want to mention something
 
03:29:53.410 --> 03:29:53.420 align:start position:0%
oh yes I do have a question
 
03:29:56.929 --> 03:29:56.939 align:start position:0%
representative army yes on
 
03:29:58.070 --> 03:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
can you
 
03:29:58.080 --> 03:30:00.290 align:start position:0%
can you
explain

03:30:00.290 --> 03:30:00.300 align:start position:0%
explain
 
03:30:06.530 --> 03:30:06.540 align:start position:0%
that such a increase in 2016.
 
03:30:09.410 --> 03:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
and then a decrease
 
03:30:13.190 --> 03:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
and then another increase
 
03:30:16.010 --> 03:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
and we seem to be wavering back and
 
03:30:19.190 --> 03:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
forth a lot more than we used to yes so
 
03:30:23.090 --> 03:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
in 2016 I would attribute most of that
 
03:30:25.370 --> 03:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
to what we saw in the earlier slide that
 
03:30:27.229 --> 03:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
showed the 12-month rolling averages I
 
03:30:29.570 --> 03:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
would attribute most of that to uh
 
03:30:31.429 --> 03:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
Revenue growth that came from the
 
03:30:33.349 --> 03:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
economy speeding up particularly in 2014
 
03:30:36.110 --> 03:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
and 2015 if you look at New Hampshire
 
03:30:39.769 --> 03:30:39.779 align:start position:0%
Gross State product you see there was a
 
03:30:41.750 --> 03:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
period of very low growth from about
 
03:30:45.590 --> 03:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
2010 2009 2010 and the negative growth
 
03:30:49.130 --> 03:30:49.140 align:start position:0%
that we saw or the the reduction the
 
03:30:51.650 --> 03:30:51.660 align:start position:0%
size of the economy going from the Great
 
03:30:54.050 --> 03:30:54.060 align:start position:0%
Recession for those next few years and
 
03:30:55.550 --> 03:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
then we see that grow State product
 
03:30:57.950 --> 03:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
growth start to pick up again in 2014
 
03:31:01.550 --> 03:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
and 2015. that starts to be captured I
 
03:31:03.410 --> 03:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
believe in those State fiscal year 2016
 
03:31:05.870 --> 03:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
revenues both probably the early some of
 
03:31:07.070 --> 03:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
the estimate payments that were earlier
 
03:31:09.170 --> 03:31:09.180 align:start position:0%
on and some of the tax returns that we
 
03:31:12.469 --> 03:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
saw filed in 2016 that you know may have
 
03:31:14.870 --> 03:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
been a adjusting for estimates from the
 
03:31:16.490 --> 03:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
first half for the second half of State
 
03:31:19.429 --> 03:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2015. that was adjusting
 
03:31:20.889 --> 03:31:20.899 align:start position:0%
from those quarterly estimate payments
 
03:31:23.570 --> 03:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
so that's I think 2016 is mostly
 
03:31:26.750 --> 03:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
explained by the economy 2017 it could
 
03:31:29.030 --> 03:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
be that we saw you know I I'm trying to
 
03:31:30.710 --> 03:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
remember what the specific growth State
 
03:31:34.010 --> 03:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
product number was but we probably saw
 
03:31:36.889 --> 03:31:36.899 align:start position:0%
maybe a similar amount of growth but we
 
03:31:40.309 --> 03:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
did see tax rates start to be reduced
 
03:31:41.990 --> 03:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
also during that time period so that
 
03:31:43.330 --> 03:31:43.340 align:start position:0%
could have had some effect
 
03:31:43.340 --> 03:31:45.130 align:start position:0%
could have had some effect
2018

03:31:45.130 --> 03:31:45.140 align:start position:0%
2018
 
03:31:47.510 --> 03:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's where we start capturing the
 
03:31:49.969 --> 03:31:49.979 align:start position:0%
one-time revenues associated with the
 
03:31:52.130 --> 03:31:52.140 align:start position:0%
tax cuts and jobs act and I think that
 
03:31:54.469 --> 03:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
bumped for 2018 and part of State fiscal
 
03:31:56.750 --> 03:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
year 2019 those revenues in a
 
03:31:58.610 --> 03:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
substantial Way Beyond what we saw in
 
03:32:00.530 --> 03:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
terms of economic activity so those
 
03:32:02.990 --> 03:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
would be my my guesses as the primary
 
03:32:05.750 --> 03:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
sources but of course the the individual
 
03:32:07.610 --> 03:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
tax returns which I don't see are are
 
03:32:10.250 --> 03:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
the ones that would tell the story in a
 
03:32:11.630 --> 03:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
clearer picture
 
03:32:15.050 --> 03:32:15.060 align:start position:0%
thank you yep you're welcome
 
03:32:16.969 --> 03:32:16.979 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
03:32:20.030 --> 03:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
um so on slide 16 one thing I do want to
 
03:32:20.750 --> 03:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
highlight and this is something
 
03:32:23.210 --> 03:32:23.220 align:start position:0%
commissioner step mentioned last week is
 
03:32:24.889 --> 03:32:24.899 align:start position:0%
the split between the business profits
 
03:32:27.530 --> 03:32:27.540 align:start position:0%
and the business Enterprise taxes and
 
03:32:29.929 --> 03:32:29.939 align:start position:0%
these are using those um close to final
 
03:32:32.030 --> 03:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
tax year data that splits between the
 
03:32:33.769 --> 03:32:33.779 align:start position:0%
two Revenue sources
 
03:32:36.050 --> 03:32:36.060 align:start position:0%
um you'll see in your daily revenue
 
03:32:37.610 --> 03:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
reports you'll see in the monthly
 
03:32:40.250 --> 03:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
Revenue Focus the split between the
 
03:32:41.269 --> 03:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
business profits and the business
 
03:32:44.870 --> 03:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax estimated but in the
 
03:32:47.150 --> 03:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
actual estimated payments the Department
 
03:32:48.889 --> 03:32:48.899 align:start position:0%
of Revenue Administration doesn't have
 
03:32:51.710 --> 03:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
that information in detail so I will say
 
03:32:53.330 --> 03:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
as someone who also reads those monthly
 
03:32:54.710 --> 03:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
revenue reports and looks at daily
 
03:32:57.650 --> 03:32:57.660 align:start position:0%
revenue updates I don't pay very much
 
03:32:59.150 --> 03:32:59.160 align:start position:0%
attention at all to the split between
 
03:33:00.349 --> 03:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
the business profits and the business
 
03:33:02.750 --> 03:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax on those shorter term
 
03:33:06.650 --> 03:33:06.660 align:start position:0%
pieces because a lot of the a lot of the
 
03:33:08.809 --> 03:33:08.819 align:start position:0%
estimated or a lot of the split is based
 
03:33:11.450 --> 03:33:11.460 align:start position:0%
on historical estimates of 60 business
 
03:33:13.190 --> 03:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
profits tax 40 percent is business
 
03:33:14.990 --> 03:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax and you can see that
 
03:33:18.590 --> 03:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
especially between about 2009 and maybe
 
03:33:20.809 --> 03:33:20.819 align:start position:0%
even 2016 that that has been what the
 
03:33:22.130 --> 03:33:22.140 align:start position:0%
split has been in a relatively stable
 
03:33:24.590 --> 03:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
pattern but since then we've seen the
 
03:33:26.150 --> 03:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
business profits taxes become more
 
03:33:28.729 --> 03:33:28.739 align:start position:0%
important as a state tax revenue Source
 
03:33:30.349 --> 03:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
relative to the business Enterprise tax
 
03:33:33.229 --> 03:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
and the most recent years it's more like
 
03:33:38.030 --> 03:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
a 70 30 split so so that is I think a
 
03:33:39.410 --> 03:33:39.420 align:start position:0%
significant change when you're thinking
 
03:33:42.650 --> 03:33:42.660 align:start position:0%
about what are the impacts of various
 
03:33:44.630 --> 03:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
economic factors on state revenues going
 
03:33:46.010 --> 03:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
forward is that the business profits tax
 
03:33:48.229 --> 03:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
is becoming more important so that tax
 
03:33:50.570 --> 03:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
base is going to be more significant in
 
03:33:51.650 --> 03:33:51.660 align:start position:0%
your in your thoughts and your
 
03:33:51.660 --> 03:33:52.849 align:start position:0%
your in your thoughts and your
projections

03:33:52.849 --> 03:33:52.859 align:start position:0%
projections
 
03:33:54.710 --> 03:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
okay we have a couple of questions uh
 
03:33:56.929 --> 03:33:56.939 align:start position:0%
representative Platt thank you thank you
 
03:33:59.150 --> 03:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question back on slide 12
 
03:34:02.269 --> 03:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
how do you explain the pump in 2020
 
03:34:05.750 --> 03:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh the bump in 2020 yes so um so
 
03:34:07.130 --> 03:34:07.140 align:start position:0%
actually we're just getting to that um
 
03:34:09.410 --> 03:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to so you're talking about
 
03:34:12.229 --> 03:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
the bump that's uh since 2020 are you
 
03:34:14.030 --> 03:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
talking about the like the most recent
 
03:34:16.849 --> 03:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
rise I've been 2022. see the big bump
 
03:34:16.859 --> 03:34:18.050 align:start position:0%
rise I've been 2022. see the big bump
yes

03:34:18.050 --> 03:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:34:19.910 --> 03:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
um so I'm I'm uh I've got a couple
 
03:34:21.050 --> 03:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
slides that I think will help address
 
03:34:23.750 --> 03:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
that but the upshot is uh corporate
 
03:34:26.330 --> 03:34:26.340 align:start position:0%
profits have done quite well and as you
 
03:34:28.070 --> 03:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
saw that that business profits tax is
 
03:34:29.870 --> 03:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
becoming more important I think that's a
 
03:34:32.950 --> 03:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:35.210 --> 03:34:35.220 align:start position:0%
representative Ami
 
03:34:38.389 --> 03:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
thank you and you didn't mention but I
 
03:34:41.330 --> 03:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
think it's true that about 80 percent of
 
03:34:44.750 --> 03:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
the business Enterprise tax is
 
03:34:44.760 --> 03:34:45.410 align:start position:0%
the business Enterprise tax is
um

03:34:45.410 --> 03:34:45.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:45.420 --> 03:34:47.090 align:start position:0%
um
payroll

03:34:47.090 --> 03:34:47.100 align:start position:0%
payroll
 
03:34:49.370 --> 03:34:49.380 align:start position:0%
yeah and so it's jobs yes compensation
 
03:34:52.550 --> 03:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
is a really big part right of the of the
 
03:34:53.870 --> 03:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax base which is
 
03:34:56.090 --> 03:34:56.100 align:start position:0%
why it's much broader yes than the
 
03:34:58.490 --> 03:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
business profits tax and I'm not sure if
 
03:35:02.809 --> 03:35:02.819 align:start position:0%
it was clear that on since the business
 
03:35:05.990 --> 03:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax is a credit on the
 
03:35:10.010 --> 03:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
business profits tax if we took away the
 
03:35:12.769 --> 03:35:12.779 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax and nothing
 
03:35:17.210 --> 03:35:17.220 align:start position:0%
changed because of that we would have uh
 
03:35:19.910 --> 03:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
companies paying the same thing they'd
 
03:35:22.309 --> 03:35:22.319 align:start position:0%
been paying before in business profits
 
03:35:26.030 --> 03:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
Tax Plus business Enterprise tax so uh
 
03:35:28.370 --> 03:35:28.380 align:start position:0%
four companies that have a taxable
 
03:35:30.110 --> 03:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
profit under the business profits tax
 
03:35:32.330 --> 03:35:32.340 align:start position:0%
and also pay business Enterprise tax
 
03:35:34.370 --> 03:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
there is a one for one credit right one
 
03:35:37.130 --> 03:35:37.140 align:start position:0%
dollar for one dollar so you those
 
03:35:39.670 --> 03:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
companies will uh if you this is
 
03:35:41.990 --> 03:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
referring to it colloquially but will
 
03:35:43.670 --> 03:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
pay business Enterprise fed tax first
 
03:35:46.370 --> 03:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
and then apply that tax credit to the
 
03:35:47.510 --> 03:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
business profit tax
 
03:35:49.729 --> 03:35:49.739 align:start position:0%
and when we talk about the tax basis for
 
03:35:52.550 --> 03:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
these two tax revenue sources you'll see
 
03:35:54.290 --> 03:35:54.300 align:start position:0%
that the as a result the business
 
03:35:57.469 --> 03:35:57.479 align:start position:0%
profits tax base is much narrower
 
03:35:59.210 --> 03:35:59.220 align:start position:0%
um that and that business Enterprise tax
 
03:36:01.070 --> 03:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
credit is likely a significant part of
 
03:36:01.080 --> 03:36:04.030 align:start position:0%
credit is likely a significant part of
that

03:36:04.030 --> 03:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:07.070 --> 03:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:36:08.809 --> 03:36:08.819 align:start position:0%
okay and these questions are very
 
03:36:12.110 --> 03:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
apropos because the first pie chart that
 
03:36:13.070 --> 03:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
I was going to show you in this series
 
03:36:16.490 --> 03:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
of pie charts here is uh the relative
 
03:36:18.410 --> 03:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
size of entities that are paying
 
03:36:19.729 --> 03:36:19.739 align:start position:0%
business profits tax and business
 
03:36:21.530 --> 03:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax
 
03:36:23.450 --> 03:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
um the business pro this is looking at
 
03:36:25.550 --> 03:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
just the business profits tax base you
 
03:36:28.250 --> 03:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
can see that 78 filers so 78 business
 
03:36:30.170 --> 03:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
entities or combined reporting entities
 
03:36:32.929 --> 03:36:32.939 align:start position:0%
paid about 38 percent of the business
 
03:36:36.889 --> 03:36:36.899 align:start position:0%
profits tax and then another 644 filers
 
03:36:38.870 --> 03:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
paid almost the same amount of money
 
03:36:43.670 --> 03:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
again so relative to the uh roughly 77
 
03:36:45.410 --> 03:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
000 filers I believe it was that filed
 
03:36:47.389 --> 03:36:47.399 align:start position:0%
in tax year 2020.
 
03:36:50.450 --> 03:36:50.460 align:start position:0%
um this uh the largest entities or the
 
03:36:52.250 --> 03:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
entities with the largest profits are
 
03:36:54.530 --> 03:36:54.540 align:start position:0%
disproportionately important in the
 
03:36:56.510 --> 03:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
business profits tax base
 
03:36:58.729 --> 03:36:58.739 align:start position:0%
representative Platt yeah I have trouble
 
03:37:01.670 --> 03:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
when information is missing the 78
 
03:37:03.830 --> 03:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
filers how big are they there's no size
 
03:37:06.229 --> 03:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
listed on this chart to be as opposed to
 
03:37:08.330 --> 03:37:08.340 align:start position:0%
the rest yeah so the this is all
 
03:37:09.769 --> 03:37:09.779 align:start position:0%
information from the Department of
 
03:37:11.389 --> 03:37:11.399 align:start position:0%
Revenue administration's annual reports
 
03:37:13.490 --> 03:37:13.500 align:start position:0%
so those are available in those inverted
 
03:37:15.050 --> 03:37:15.060 align:start position:0%
triangles that I believe have been
 
03:37:17.150 --> 03:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
referred to before by that committee
 
03:37:20.929 --> 03:37:20.939 align:start position:0%
um the 78 filers uh if I recall
 
03:37:25.429 --> 03:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
correctly from tax year 2019 I believe
 
03:37:28.610 --> 03:37:28.620 align:start position:0%
the average size in terms of the profits
 
03:37:32.809 --> 03:37:32.819 align:start position:0%
that they reported uh was about and this
 
03:37:34.610 --> 03:37:34.620 align:start position:0%
is reported profits so this isn't the
 
03:37:36.710 --> 03:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
size of the the business operation but
 
03:37:38.870 --> 03:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
this is reported profits I believe it
 
03:37:40.610 --> 03:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
was about
 
03:37:40.620 --> 03:37:41.330 align:start position:0%
was about
um

03:37:41.330 --> 03:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:44.450 --> 03:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
35 or 40 million dollars but I will get
 
03:37:45.830 --> 03:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
you that I will send you the link
 
03:37:47.690 --> 03:37:47.700 align:start position:0%
specifically to that page on the page
 
03:37:52.490 --> 03:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:55.610 --> 03:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
representative Amy if I could when the
 
03:37:58.130 --> 03:37:58.140 align:start position:0%
dra comes back I expect them to come
 
03:37:59.990 --> 03:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
with the triangles
 
03:38:03.290 --> 03:38:03.300 align:start position:0%
and they I I do I do think they're more
 
03:38:06.950 --> 03:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
easy to follow yeah the the triangles
 
03:38:06.960 --> 03:38:08.210 align:start position:0%
easy to follow yeah the the triangles
are

03:38:08.210 --> 03:38:08.220 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:38:11.030 --> 03:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
um uh the the triangles are published
 
03:38:12.769 --> 03:38:12.779 align:start position:0%
already in the annual report so I'm
 
03:38:14.389 --> 03:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
happy to provide you with uh with that
 
03:38:15.769 --> 03:38:15.779 align:start position:0%
ahead of time
 
03:38:18.349 --> 03:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
um and yes what you'll see here is that
 
03:38:20.090 --> 03:38:20.100 align:start position:0%
I've broken out parts of the triangles
 
03:38:21.830 --> 03:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
into a series of pie charts to try and
 
03:38:24.050 --> 03:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
break it apart for folks to see visually
 
03:38:25.849 --> 03:38:25.859 align:start position:0%
but it does depend on what your
 
03:38:27.170 --> 03:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
preference is whether you prefer to see
 
03:38:30.349 --> 03:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
it in a table or a pie chart so uh in
 
03:38:32.389 --> 03:38:32.399 align:start position:0%
some ways it's easier to consume
 
03:38:33.769 --> 03:38:33.779 align:start position:0%
um and to consume the information the
 
03:38:35.330 --> 03:38:35.340 align:start position:0%
triangle but it's harder to see and on
 
03:38:38.590 --> 03:38:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:43.309 --> 03:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:48.110 --> 03:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:51.110 --> 03:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
victories must be within some kind of
 
03:38:55.130 --> 03:38:55.140 align:start position:0%
range and so the the Big Orange range is
 
03:38:57.769 --> 03:38:57.779 align:start position:0%
whatever is the highest amount of tax
 
03:39:00.290 --> 03:39:00.300 align:start position:0%
that was paid in and
 
03:39:01.969 --> 03:39:01.979 align:start position:0%
yes these are based on what the
 
03:39:03.170 --> 03:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
03:39:04.849 --> 03:39:04.859 align:start position:0%
reports in those inverted triangles
 
03:39:08.210 --> 03:39:08.220 align:start position:0%
based on categories of taxes paid right
 
03:39:08.220 --> 03:39:09.410 align:start position:0%
based on categories of taxes paid right
so

03:39:09.410 --> 03:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:39:11.630 --> 03:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
um that largest one I'm trying to
 
03:39:14.570 --> 03:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
remember I it's more than it's more than
 
03:39:16.429 --> 03:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of tax revenue paid and
 
03:39:17.690 --> 03:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
I don't remember exactly what that
 
03:39:19.309 --> 03:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
threshold is but again I can provide it
 
03:39:21.229 --> 03:39:21.239 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
03:39:21.239 --> 03:39:25.210 align:start position:0%
to the committee
mm-hmm

03:39:25.210 --> 03:39:25.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:28.130 --> 03:39:28.140 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg thank you Mr
 
03:39:31.370 --> 03:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
chairman just a question
 
03:39:33.290 --> 03:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
you said that
 
03:39:36.650 --> 03:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
if they pay the BET tax first
 
03:39:39.050 --> 03:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
they then use that one-to-one to reduce
 
03:39:42.410 --> 03:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
their BPT correct
 
03:39:47.030 --> 03:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
if the rate of the bet is reduced does
 
03:39:49.969 --> 03:39:49.979 align:start position:0%
that mean there will be more BPT to be
 
03:39:52.550 --> 03:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
paid by the companies yes I just want to
 
03:39:54.650 --> 03:39:54.660 align:start position:0%
make sure I figured that out right yes
 
03:39:58.370 --> 03:39:58.380 align:start position:0%
and indeed in the initial proposal of
 
03:40:00.170 --> 03:40:00.180 align:start position:0%
the um from the governor's budget from
 
03:40:03.650 --> 03:40:03.660 align:start position:0%
2021 there was a bet reduction and not a
 
03:40:05.929 --> 03:40:05.939 align:start position:0%
BPT reduction and in the analysis
 
03:40:07.309 --> 03:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
provided by the Department of Revenue
 
03:40:08.870 --> 03:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
Administration you saw business
 
03:40:11.269 --> 03:40:11.279 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax revenues go down and then
 
03:40:13.370 --> 03:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
some Revenue was recaptured by the
 
03:40:14.870 --> 03:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
business profits tax it wasn't all of it
 
03:40:16.429 --> 03:40:16.439 align:start position:0%
because not every company is paying
 
03:40:18.530 --> 03:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
business profits tax but the ones that
 
03:40:21.290 --> 03:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
were then had a smaller credit a smaller
 
03:40:23.330 --> 03:40:23.340 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax credit and were
 
03:40:24.650 --> 03:40:24.660 align:start position:0%
expected then to then pay business
 
03:40:29.630 --> 03:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:32.090 --> 03:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
03:40:34.010 --> 03:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
um so another way that we can learn
 
03:40:36.590 --> 03:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
about the business profits tax base is
 
03:40:38.450 --> 03:40:38.460 align:start position:0%
by file or type
 
03:40:40.370 --> 03:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
um I I believe you spent some time this
 
03:40:42.769 --> 03:40:42.779 align:start position:0%
morning talking about uh Waters Edge
 
03:40:45.170 --> 03:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
combined reporting entities so you can
 
03:40:46.729 --> 03:40:46.739 align:start position:0%
see here this is the breakdown and this
 
03:40:47.929 --> 03:40:47.939 align:start position:0%
is again from the Department of Revenue
 
03:40:50.030 --> 03:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
Administration you can see the breakdown
 
03:40:53.210 --> 03:40:53.220 align:start position:0%
by file or type so Proprietors including
 
03:40:54.969 --> 03:40:54.979 align:start position:0%
sole Proprietors are roughly 39
 
03:40:58.190 --> 03:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
corporations 35 percent Partnerships
 
03:41:01.370 --> 03:41:01.380 align:start position:0%
fiduciaries and then the water's edge
 
03:41:03.590 --> 03:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
filers that you can see in Orange here
 
03:41:05.330 --> 03:41:05.340 align:start position:0%
those are what I called here
 
03:41:07.150 --> 03:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
multinational combined entities
 
03:41:09.710 --> 03:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
basically and I'm glossing over a lot of
 
03:41:11.269 --> 03:41:11.279 align:start position:0%
details here but basically that means
 
03:41:14.630 --> 03:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
that's a multi-part business filer with
 
03:41:16.910 --> 03:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
at least one part of that entity
 
03:41:19.610 --> 03:41:19.620 align:start position:0%
combined reporting entity that has a
 
03:41:21.110 --> 03:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
significant amount of its operations
 
03:41:23.150 --> 03:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
overseas right so there's at least one
 
03:41:25.729 --> 03:41:25.739 align:start position:0%
component of a multi-part business that
 
03:41:27.769 --> 03:41:27.779 align:start position:0%
is overseas that's not to say that the
 
03:41:29.330 --> 03:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
corporations and the other entities on
 
03:41:31.130 --> 03:41:31.140 align:start position:0%
here aren't operating overseas and
 
03:41:32.630 --> 03:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's also not to say that the water's
 
03:41:34.729 --> 03:41:34.739 align:start position:0%
edge filers are only operating overseas
 
03:41:37.130 --> 03:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
they often and probably do have a
 
03:41:38.750 --> 03:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
significant amount of property personnel
 
03:41:43.309 --> 03:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
and and sales in New Hampshire but they
 
03:41:45.290 --> 03:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
are at least a large multi-part entity
 
03:41:47.450 --> 03:41:47.460 align:start position:0%
that has a significant part of at least
 
03:41:49.429 --> 03:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
one of their operations in a different
 
03:41:52.550 --> 03:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
country so that gives us some sense some
 
03:41:54.889 --> 03:41:54.899 align:start position:0%
understanding of what these what these
 
03:41:56.389 --> 03:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
businesses might look like
 
03:41:59.210 --> 03:41:59.220 align:start position:0%
so on slide 18 you can see about six
 
03:42:00.530 --> 03:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
percent of filers were combined
 
03:42:02.750 --> 03:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
reporting entities on slide 19 you can
 
03:42:04.849 --> 03:42:04.859 align:start position:0%
see if you break it down by Revenue more
 
03:42:07.250 --> 03:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
than half the revenue came from Water's
 
03:42:09.710 --> 03:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
Edge filers so again what that means is
 
03:42:10.849 --> 03:42:10.859 align:start position:0%
when we're thinking about Revenue
 
03:42:12.950 --> 03:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
projections we may also have to think
 
03:42:14.570 --> 03:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
about the global economy we may have to
 
03:42:16.010 --> 03:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
think about National corporate profits
 
03:42:18.170 --> 03:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
as well because these are multi-state
 
03:42:19.550 --> 03:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
multinational entities that are
 
03:42:21.469 --> 03:42:21.479 align:start position:0%
important part of the business profits
 
03:42:22.969 --> 03:42:22.979 align:start position:0%
tax base
 
03:42:24.349 --> 03:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
if we compare that to the business
 
03:42:26.990 --> 03:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax base we can see and this
 
03:42:29.809 --> 03:42:29.819 align:start position:0%
is the the same pie chart that you saw
 
03:42:31.309 --> 03:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
first but for the business Enterprise
 
03:42:33.950 --> 03:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
tax it's a much broader tax base right
 
03:42:35.510 --> 03:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
in part because of that business
 
03:42:37.670 --> 03:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax credit that's used
 
03:42:39.769 --> 03:42:39.779 align:start position:0%
against the business profits tax you can
 
03:42:42.889 --> 03:42:42.899 align:start position:0%
see the top 12 filers paid 23.5 million
 
03:42:44.929 --> 03:42:44.939 align:start position:0%
dollars a much smaller share than we see
 
03:42:47.450 --> 03:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
for the business profits tax for example
 
03:42:50.450 --> 03:42:50.460 align:start position:0%
that being said uh on slide 21 even
 
03:42:52.130 --> 03:42:52.140 align:start position:0%
though we have a much broader business
 
03:42:55.130 --> 03:42:55.140 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax base uh the water's edge
 
03:42:56.809 --> 03:42:56.819 align:start position:0%
filers are still a significant portion
 
03:42:58.370 --> 03:42:58.380 align:start position:0%
of the amount of business Enterprise tax
 
03:43:01.130 --> 03:43:01.140 align:start position:0%
revenue paid so again still an important
 
03:43:02.809 --> 03:43:02.819 align:start position:0%
component of the tax base when you're
 
03:43:04.429 --> 03:43:04.439 align:start position:0%
thinking about what's going to happen
 
03:43:07.190 --> 03:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
with business tax revenues
 
03:43:10.010 --> 03:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
and on slide 22 I think this is a key
 
03:43:12.710 --> 03:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
part of why we've seen that increase in
 
03:43:15.349 --> 03:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
state fiscal years 2021 and 22 in terms
 
03:43:18.050 --> 03:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
of tax revenues uh in the business taxes
 
03:43:21.229 --> 03:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
we see that there was a dip in the
 
03:43:23.809 --> 03:43:23.819 align:start position:0%
second quarter of 2020 that's associated
 
03:43:26.450 --> 03:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
with the pandemic but this graph goes
 
03:43:28.790 --> 03:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
from 2017 all the way to the second
 
03:43:31.550 --> 03:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
third quarter of 2022 and we can see
 
03:43:33.530 --> 03:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
that on an annualized basis so this is
 
03:43:35.570 --> 03:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
not quarterly but if it's if we took the
 
03:43:37.309 --> 03:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
profits in this quarter and annualize
 
03:43:40.010 --> 03:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
them that U.S corporate profits
 
03:43:42.410 --> 03:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
adjusting again for inventory and for
 
03:43:44.510 --> 03:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
Capital consumption have gone from a
 
03:43:45.830 --> 03:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
little more than two trillion dollars a
 
03:43:47.450 --> 03:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
year to about three trillion dollars a
 
03:43:49.550 --> 03:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
year so that's a really significant
 
03:43:52.070 --> 03:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
increase that part of that is likely
 
03:43:54.229 --> 03:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
being caught in the business profits tax
 
03:43:56.389 --> 03:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
base in New Hampshire and that as I
 
03:43:58.070 --> 03:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
think if I were to point to one reason
 
03:44:00.229 --> 03:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
that is I think the key reason why we've
 
03:44:02.870 --> 03:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
seen business tax revenues go up writ
 
03:44:04.969 --> 03:44:04.979 align:start position:0%
large because of the because of this
 
03:44:04.979 --> 03:44:06.050 align:start position:0%
large because of the because of this
increase

03:44:06.050 --> 03:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
increase
 
03:44:08.750 --> 03:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
if we look at slide 23 this is the
 
03:44:10.490 --> 03:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax and again broken
 
03:44:12.889 --> 03:44:12.899 align:start position:0%
out only to tax year 2020 because that's
 
03:44:14.990 --> 03:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
when we have the final breakouts there
 
03:44:16.610 --> 03:44:16.620 align:start position:0%
are three lines on this graph you can
 
03:44:18.889 --> 03:44:18.899 align:start position:0%
see business Enterprise tax revenue in
 
03:44:20.990 --> 03:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
green new hampshire-based private sector
 
03:44:22.670 --> 03:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
employment because as representative
 
03:44:24.950 --> 03:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
valmie pointed out employment is a big
 
03:44:27.830 --> 03:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
part of the tax base here you can see
 
03:44:31.790 --> 03:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
that employment in blue and wages paid
 
03:44:34.670 --> 03:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire in Orange and you can
 
03:44:36.110 --> 03:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
see that the business Enterprise tax
 
03:44:38.690 --> 03:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
revenue actually follows the wages paid
 
03:44:40.610 --> 03:44:40.620 align:start position:0%
the total amount of dollars a wages paid
 
03:44:42.170 --> 03:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
a little bit more closely than it
 
03:44:44.389 --> 03:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
follows that private sector employment
 
03:44:46.370 --> 03:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
you can see there are deviations from
 
03:44:51.170 --> 03:44:51.180 align:start position:0%
the trend in 2016 2018 2019 and those
 
03:44:52.910 --> 03:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
were years in which there was a tax rate
 
03:44:54.830 --> 03:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
reduction to the business Enterprise tax
 
03:44:57.229 --> 03:44:57.239 align:start position:0%
so that we see that that Revenue may not
 
03:44:58.910 --> 03:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
have trended as it would have otherwise
 
03:45:01.550 --> 03:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
and then of course 2020 was a pandemic
 
03:45:04.729 --> 03:45:04.739 align:start position:0%
year in terms of tax year 2020. um that
 
03:45:07.250 --> 03:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
being said wages pays still went up it
 
03:45:08.690 --> 03:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
could be that some businesses were for
 
03:45:10.190 --> 03:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
example using their credit carry forward
 
03:45:13.190 --> 03:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
for tax year 2020 and may have resulted
 
03:45:16.130 --> 03:45:16.140 align:start position:0%
in less Revenue in that year under the
 
03:45:17.750 --> 03:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax and a number of
 
03:45:20.030 --> 03:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
other factors could have applied
 
03:45:22.729 --> 03:45:22.739 align:start position:0%
and I'll uh quickly mention that as
 
03:45:24.889 --> 03:45:24.899 align:start position:0%
important as as we've talked about these
 
03:45:26.330 --> 03:45:26.340 align:start position:0%
business pro the business profits and
 
03:45:27.530 --> 03:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
the business Enterprise tax revenue
 
03:45:30.110 --> 03:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
being to state revenue the Council on
 
03:45:33.889 --> 03:45:33.899 align:start position:0%
state estate taxation looks at number of
 
03:45:35.990 --> 03:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
dollars paid by businesses in New
 
03:45:37.790 --> 03:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the state and local taxes
 
03:45:40.910 --> 03:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
and the BPT and the bet combiner about a
 
03:45:43.969 --> 03:45:43.979 align:start position:0%
quarter about half are property taxes so
 
03:45:45.349 --> 03:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
and that's been a relatively consistent
 
03:45:47.990 --> 03:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
number over the years so that's again
 
03:45:49.729 --> 03:45:49.739 align:start position:0%
when we're thinking about what our taxes
 
03:45:51.650 --> 03:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
businesses paying in the state property
 
03:45:52.910 --> 03:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
taxes are an important part of the
 
03:45:54.170 --> 03:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
picture and that includes of course the
 
03:45:56.690 --> 03:45:56.700 align:start position:0%
local property tax
 
03:45:58.130 --> 03:45:58.140 align:start position:0%
all right if we're ready I'll move on to
 
03:45:59.990 --> 03:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals tax does anybody have
 
03:46:02.929 --> 03:46:02.939 align:start position:0%
any questions on the the business taxes
 
03:46:05.990 --> 03:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury yes taking the
 
03:46:10.370 --> 03:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
last several uh slides together
 
03:46:12.889 --> 03:46:12.899 align:start position:0%
we don't have a presentation that makes
 
03:46:15.290 --> 03:46:15.300 align:start position:0%
these same breakouts over a span of
 
03:46:17.690 --> 03:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
several years so so we've seen the
 
03:46:20.510 --> 03:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
Aggregates uh as they changed from 2008
 
03:46:23.030 --> 03:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
03:46:26.290 --> 03:46:26.300 align:start position:0%
would it be accurate that
 
03:46:28.910 --> 03:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
simultaneous with the three years of
 
03:46:32.510 --> 03:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
aggressive growth in BPT revenues
 
03:46:36.429 --> 03:46:36.439 align:start position:0%
there's also been a shift in the mix
 
03:46:38.570 --> 03:46:38.580 align:start position:0%
increasingly towards
 
03:46:41.450 --> 03:46:41.460 align:start position:0%
a corporate structures B large corporate
 
03:46:45.410 --> 03:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
structures see multinational sort of in
 
03:46:48.710 --> 03:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
that progression is that likely so I can
 
03:46:51.050 --> 03:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
say that at least between tax year 2019
 
03:46:54.590 --> 03:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
and tax year 2020 those top it was 80
 
03:46:59.630 --> 03:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
filers in 2019 78 and 2020 that dropped
 
03:47:02.210 --> 03:47:02.220 align:start position:0%
from about 44 to 38 percent but tax year
 
03:47:04.849 --> 03:47:04.859 align:start position:0%
2020 was also a unique year because of
 
03:47:07.550 --> 03:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
the pandemic so I would have to look
 
03:47:10.550 --> 03:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
back and be able to say definitively has
 
03:47:13.429 --> 03:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
that Trend in larger corporate profits
 
03:47:16.429 --> 03:47:16.439 align:start position:0%
been driving the driving factor in the
 
03:47:18.469 --> 03:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
BPT becoming more important I wonder if
 
03:47:20.809 --> 03:47:20.819 align:start position:0%
you could generate a slide for us that
 
03:47:23.750 --> 03:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
would track the shift in the mix over
 
03:47:25.610 --> 03:47:25.620 align:start position:0%
say a 10-year span
 
03:47:28.550 --> 03:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh I think the dra's annual reports
 
03:47:30.349 --> 03:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
would allow me to do all 10 years so I
 
03:47:38.269 --> 03:47:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:40.190 --> 03:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
all right if we're okay I think we're
 
03:47:42.469 --> 03:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
all set move forward okay and I'll try
 
03:47:43.309 --> 03:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
to move through these quickly I
 
03:47:44.750 --> 03:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
recognize I only have about 13 minutes
 
03:47:46.670 --> 03:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
left and I have a fair number of slides
 
03:47:48.110 --> 03:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
beyond that
 
03:47:49.790 --> 03:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
um so I will do my best to move quickly
 
03:47:51.830 --> 03:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
through here uh meals and rentals tax
 
03:47:53.510 --> 03:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
eight and a half percent tax that's
 
03:47:55.490 --> 03:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
largely driven by meals at restaurants
 
03:47:58.309 --> 03:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
but also hotel rooms and rental cars
 
03:48:00.769 --> 03:48:00.779 align:start position:0%
um the revenue has been split up in the
 
03:48:02.870 --> 03:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
most recent year to the municipal
 
03:48:05.210 --> 03:48:05.220 align:start position:0%
Revenue fund um the meals and rooms
 
03:48:07.130 --> 03:48:07.140 align:start position:0%
Municipal Revenue fund I believe it's
 
03:48:09.469 --> 03:48:09.479 align:start position:0%
called you can see that transfer on that
 
03:48:11.630 --> 03:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
rightmost bar I've included it here
 
03:48:12.950 --> 03:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
because it's part of the revenue
 
03:48:14.750 --> 03:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
collected and something that you may
 
03:48:15.889 --> 03:48:15.899 align:start position:0%
want to think about when you're thinking
 
03:48:17.870 --> 03:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
about projecting Revenue again these are
 
03:48:20.030 --> 03:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
inflation adjusted changes over time I
 
03:48:21.710 --> 03:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
want to draw your attention to 2014 to
 
03:48:23.990 --> 03:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
2019 where the meals and rentals tax was
 
03:48:26.150 --> 03:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
sort of a Workhorse Revenue Source in
 
03:48:28.370 --> 03:48:28.380 align:start position:0%
that it consistently outpaced inflation
 
03:48:30.590 --> 03:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
grew faster than inflation when the
 
03:48:32.269 --> 03:48:32.279 align:start position:0%
economy was expanding during that time
 
03:48:34.429 --> 03:48:34.439 align:start position:0%
period obviously the pandemic had a
 
03:48:35.750 --> 03:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
pretty big impact on it but it has
 
03:48:38.450 --> 03:48:38.460 align:start position:0%
rebounded some since then if we look at
 
03:48:41.150 --> 03:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
slide 27 yes if I may I have a question
 
03:48:44.110 --> 03:48:44.120 align:start position:0%
on that so yes you're showing on 2022
 
03:48:48.650 --> 03:48:48.660 align:start position:0%
the municipal Revenue fund transfer it
 
03:48:51.469 --> 03:48:51.479 align:start position:0%
did increase for that year but that
 
03:48:54.110 --> 03:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't that apply to every year uh so
 
03:48:55.969 --> 03:48:55.979 align:start position:0%
that's a great question the municipal
 
03:48:58.849 --> 03:48:58.859 align:start position:0%
Revenue so a portion of the meals and
 
03:49:00.469 --> 03:49:00.479 align:start position:0%
rentals tax has been devoted to
 
03:49:02.570 --> 03:49:02.580 align:start position:0%
Municipal Revenue sharing over this
 
03:49:04.070 --> 03:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
entire time Horizon that you see on this
 
03:49:06.290 --> 03:49:06.300 align:start position:0%
graph previously it was funneled through
 
03:49:08.570 --> 03:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
the general fund so you would see that
 
03:49:09.950 --> 03:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue when you were for example
 
03:49:12.710 --> 03:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
projecting general fund revenue for from
 
03:49:14.150 --> 03:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
a general and education trust fund
 
03:49:15.469 --> 03:49:15.479 align:start position:0%
revenue from the meals and rentals tax
 
03:49:18.110 --> 03:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
that has been moved off budget entirely
 
03:49:20.450 --> 03:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
so it no longer goes to the general fund
 
03:49:22.250 --> 03:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
as a result there's this separate
 
03:49:24.349 --> 03:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
transfer to track revenues this is a
 
03:49:26.150 --> 03:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
separate transfer to the rooms and meals
 
03:49:28.309 --> 03:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
or meals and rooms pardon me Municipal
 
03:49:31.010 --> 03:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
Revenue fund okay thank you that's a
 
03:49:32.630 --> 03:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
good distinction yes you're welcome
 
03:49:34.610 --> 03:49:34.620 align:start position:0%
because the rest of the green bars are
 
03:49:36.229 --> 03:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
for General and education trust fund
 
03:49:38.570 --> 03:49:38.580 align:start position:0%
Revenue so previous previously it would
 
03:49:40.309 --> 03:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
have covered it but now things are a
 
03:49:43.610 --> 03:49:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:45.530 --> 03:49:45.540 align:start position:0%
we have another question representative
 
03:49:48.349 --> 03:49:48.359 align:start position:0%
fellows yeah was that what you were just
 
03:49:49.610 --> 03:49:49.620 align:start position:0%
talking about was that just like a
 
03:49:51.889 --> 03:49:51.899 align:start position:0%
one-year deal or is that fairly
 
03:49:53.630 --> 03:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
permanent yeah under current statute
 
03:49:55.070 --> 03:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
that is permanent so that was a change
 
03:49:56.809 --> 03:49:56.819 align:start position:0%
in the in what is the current state
 
03:49:59.269 --> 03:49:59.279 align:start position:0%
budget to instead of having those funds
 
03:50:01.610 --> 03:50:01.620 align:start position:0%
go through the general fund that what is
 
03:50:04.610 --> 03:50:04.620 align:start position:0%
uh about I think 100.1 million dollars
 
03:50:06.290 --> 03:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
doesn't show up in the general fund
 
03:50:08.210 --> 03:50:08.220 align:start position:0%
anymore it goes right to this other fund
 
03:50:10.849 --> 03:50:10.859 align:start position:0%
and if I remember correctly there was a
 
03:50:12.290 --> 03:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
there were two changes there was a
 
03:50:14.570 --> 03:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
change in the amount from about 22
 
03:50:18.229 --> 03:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
percent to roughly 30 percent and now
 
03:50:21.170 --> 03:50:21.180 align:start position:0%
the added distinction is that it's now
 
03:50:21.180 --> 03:50:22.190 align:start position:0%
the added distinction is that it's now
going

03:50:22.190 --> 03:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
going
 
03:50:22.200 --> 03:50:22.849 align:start position:0%
going
um

03:50:22.849 --> 03:50:22.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:25.969 --> 03:50:25.979 align:start position:0%
directly to municipalities yes so so to
 
03:50:28.130 --> 03:50:28.140 align:start position:0%
build on that there used to be there was
 
03:50:31.370 --> 03:50:31.380 align:start position:0%
originally a set in statute was 40 but
 
03:50:34.010 --> 03:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
the uh state had not been meeting that
 
03:50:37.370 --> 03:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
40 obligation uh and as a result there
 
03:50:38.870 --> 03:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
was a catch-up formula to catch up
 
03:50:41.330 --> 03:50:41.340 align:start position:0%
slowly to that 40 level sometimes that
 
03:50:43.729 --> 03:50:43.739 align:start position:0%
ketchup formula had been suspended as a
 
03:50:47.570 --> 03:50:47.580 align:start position:0%
result uh about 22 percent was uh where
 
03:50:49.610 --> 03:50:49.620 align:start position:0%
it ended up more recently it was hovered
 
03:50:53.090 --> 03:50:53.100 align:start position:0%
between 19 and about about 20 so
 
03:50:55.670 --> 03:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
um that 22 was then boosted to 30
 
03:50:58.250 --> 03:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
percent by a change in statute got rid
 
03:51:00.290 --> 03:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
of the ketchup formula boosted it to 30
 
03:51:02.990 --> 03:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
and moved it to the separate fund
 
03:51:04.790 --> 03:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
exactly thank you for clarifying
 
03:51:07.250 --> 03:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
representative Almighty
 
03:51:10.309 --> 03:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you and this and a number of other
 
03:51:13.729 --> 03:51:13.739 align:start position:0%
things in our revenues are a result of
 
03:51:15.410 --> 03:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
the finance committee paying no
 
03:51:17.690 --> 03:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
attention to our need to be able to
 
03:51:18.950 --> 03:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
track revenues
 
03:51:24.050 --> 03:51:24.060 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm concerned on and on
 
03:51:24.060 --> 03:51:25.429 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm concerned on and on
we

03:51:25.429 --> 03:51:25.439 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:51:29.510 --> 03:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
we compensate we compensate for them uh
 
03:51:32.750 --> 03:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
like this for a couple of years and then
 
03:51:35.389 --> 03:51:35.399 align:start position:0%
get used to the new trend and kind of
 
03:51:37.849 --> 03:51:37.859 align:start position:0%
forget about it but there have been
 
03:51:40.010 --> 03:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
times when I think they took the entire
 
03:51:42.590 --> 03:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
department of labor into a dedicated
 
03:51:45.469 --> 03:51:45.479 align:start position:0%
fund one term so that they could pretend
 
03:51:48.469 --> 03:51:48.479 align:start position:0%
they hadn't raised the spending and then
 
03:51:52.790 --> 03:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:56.030 --> 03:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:51:56.040 --> 03:51:57.349 align:start position:0%
any other questions
okay

03:51:57.349 --> 03:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:52:00.050 --> 03:52:00.060 align:start position:0%
great and again I'll uh recognizing it's
 
03:52:01.729 --> 03:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
151 I'll try to move through these
 
03:52:01.739 --> 03:52:02.990 align:start position:0%
151 I'll try to move through these
quickly

03:52:02.990 --> 03:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
03:52:05.990 --> 03:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
um meals and rentals tax revenues in
 
03:52:07.910 --> 03:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
some ways do track accommodation food
 
03:52:09.769 --> 03:52:09.779 align:start position:0%
services employment this is on a cash
 
03:52:13.010 --> 03:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
basis on slide 27 a rolling monthly Cash
 
03:52:15.710 --> 03:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
basis with a 12-month rolling average so
 
03:52:18.050 --> 03:52:18.060 align:start position:0%
that there's not the seasonal effects I
 
03:52:19.550 --> 03:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
think a significant part of what we're
 
03:52:21.290 --> 03:52:21.300 align:start position:0%
seeing in the recent rise in meals and
 
03:52:22.969 --> 03:52:22.979 align:start position:0%
rentals tax revenue which is sort of
 
03:52:26.090 --> 03:52:26.100 align:start position:0%
back up to trend is because and you can
 
03:52:28.010 --> 03:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
see on the orange line on this graph an
 
03:52:30.590 --> 03:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
increase in costs associated with food
 
03:52:31.969 --> 03:52:31.979 align:start position:0%
away from home right this is the
 
03:52:33.950 --> 03:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
inflation measure for what is a food
 
03:52:36.410 --> 03:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
what is food at a restaurant cost and
 
03:52:38.990 --> 03:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
that has increased more rapidly and that
 
03:52:40.790 --> 03:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
of course is going to be going to show
 
03:52:42.889 --> 03:52:42.899 align:start position:0%
up in meals and rentals tax revenue as
 
03:52:45.410 --> 03:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
well so that's where again the inflation
 
03:52:46.910 --> 03:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
in these costs I think going to be an
 
03:52:48.110 --> 03:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
important factor when you're thinking
 
03:52:49.429 --> 03:52:49.439 align:start position:0%
about what are revenues going to look
 
03:52:50.870 --> 03:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
like going forward
 
03:52:53.150 --> 03:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
representative Platt I'm having trouble
 
03:52:54.950 --> 03:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
understanding this graphic as you say
 
03:52:57.469 --> 03:52:57.479 align:start position:0%
momentum slowing but other than the
 
03:52:59.630 --> 03:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
pandemic dip looks like it's right back
 
03:53:02.630 --> 03:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
before pandemic and higher so where is
 
03:53:04.190 --> 03:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
it slowing so I think that I think
 
03:53:05.929 --> 03:53:05.939 align:start position:0%
that's where the trend line right if
 
03:53:07.969 --> 03:53:07.979 align:start position:0%
we're back at trend line now we
 
03:53:09.710 --> 03:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
shouldn't necessarily expect the same
 
03:53:11.030 --> 03:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
year-over-year growth we've seen over
 
03:53:12.469 --> 03:53:12.479 align:start position:0%
the last two years right since the
 
03:53:14.809 --> 03:53:14.819 align:start position:0%
depths of the pandemic so that's where I
 
03:53:17.570 --> 03:53:17.580 align:start position:0%
think that momentum is slowing also if
 
03:53:19.070 --> 03:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
we were talking about nominal dollars
 
03:53:21.410 --> 03:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
right unadjusted for inflation if
 
03:53:23.990 --> 03:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
inflation eases in food away from home
 
03:53:26.809 --> 03:53:26.819 align:start position:0%
then we'll see Revenue growth that
 
03:53:33.710 --> 03:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:33.720 --> 03:53:35.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:53:35.269 --> 03:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:53:37.190 --> 03:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
03:53:39.469 --> 03:53:39.479 align:start position:0%
um real estate transfer tax is and I'll
 
03:53:41.990 --> 03:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
go to slide 29 here it's another example
 
03:53:44.330 --> 03:53:44.340 align:start position:0%
of where there is a small portion that's
 
03:53:47.269 --> 03:53:47.279 align:start position:0%
been uh set aside for a dedicated fund
 
03:53:48.650 --> 03:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
um that's that five million dollar
 
03:53:50.389 --> 03:53:50.399 align:start position:0%
transfer to the affordable housing fund
 
03:53:52.729 --> 03:53:52.739 align:start position:0%
if we look at real estate transfer tax
 
03:53:55.550 --> 03:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
revenues over time you can see that it
 
03:53:57.889 --> 03:53:57.899 align:start position:0%
again adjusted for inflation we're about
 
03:53:59.510 --> 03:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
now and maybe a little bit higher than
 
03:54:03.229 --> 03:54:03.239 align:start position:0%
the um pre-great recession uh growth
 
03:54:05.030 --> 03:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
that we saw in housing that peaked in
 
03:54:08.030 --> 03:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
about 2005 before it started to slip
 
03:54:09.710 --> 03:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
associated with the Great Recession and
 
03:54:12.530 --> 03:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
was much lower this was a growing
 
03:54:14.389 --> 03:54:14.399 align:start position:0%
Revenue Source prior to the pandemic
 
03:54:16.490 --> 03:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
although this is a supply limited
 
03:54:18.830 --> 03:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue source and if we look at slide
 
03:54:21.590 --> 03:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
30 you can see that Supply limitation
 
03:54:24.010 --> 03:54:24.020 align:start position:0%
has become much more acute over time
 
03:54:26.809 --> 03:54:26.819 align:start position:0%
this slide 30 shows in the dashed lines
 
03:54:28.610 --> 03:54:28.620 align:start position:0%
two measures of inventory for
 
03:54:31.250 --> 03:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
single-family homes and condos and that
 
03:54:34.969 --> 03:54:34.979 align:start position:0%
months of inventory was down to one to
 
03:54:36.950 --> 03:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
one a half months maybe it's easing a
 
03:54:39.410 --> 03:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
little bit more recently the my
 
03:54:41.090 --> 03:54:41.100 align:start position:0%
understanding is that oftentimes a
 
03:54:43.010 --> 03:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
balanced Supply is considered six or six
 
03:54:44.809 --> 03:54:44.819 align:start position:0%
and a half months that isn't even on
 
03:54:46.490 --> 03:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
this graph so we had a constrained
 
03:54:49.070 --> 03:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
housing Supply before the pandemic you
 
03:54:50.689 --> 03:54:50.699 align:start position:0%
can see in that middle period with this
 
03:54:52.370 --> 03:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
12-month rolling average that inventory
 
03:54:55.010 --> 03:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
really dropped and prices started to
 
03:54:57.469 --> 03:54:57.479 align:start position:0%
increase dramatically so between March
 
03:54:59.990 --> 03:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
2017 and March 2022 the median single
 
03:55:01.309 --> 03:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
family home price in New Hampshire was
 
03:55:04.490 --> 03:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
up 80 percent right and what that means
 
03:55:06.469 --> 03:55:06.479 align:start position:0%
is that we saw growth in real estate
 
03:55:08.330 --> 03:55:08.340 align:start position:0%
transfer tax revenues as you can see on
 
03:55:10.910 --> 03:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
slide 31 again 12-month rolling average
 
03:55:13.790 --> 03:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
but we see total sales volume which is
 
03:55:16.969 --> 03:55:16.979 align:start position:0%
in green in the triangles that that
 
03:55:19.849 --> 03:55:19.859 align:start position:0%
total sales volume has been leveling off
 
03:55:22.130 --> 03:55:22.140 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax revenues have
 
03:55:23.389 --> 03:55:23.399 align:start position:0%
edged up a little bit further and
 
03:55:25.250 --> 03:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
remember of course commercial property
 
03:55:27.050 --> 03:55:27.060 align:start position:0%
and other properties in the real estate
 
03:55:29.630 --> 03:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
transfer tax base as well but maybe
 
03:55:31.070 --> 03:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
we're seeing that real estate transfer
 
03:55:34.070 --> 03:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
tax start to level off to because of
 
03:55:35.570 --> 03:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
slower sales
 
03:55:37.309 --> 03:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
part of the reason we see slower sales
 
03:55:39.170 --> 03:55:39.180 align:start position:0%
because the real estate transfer tax of
 
03:55:40.849 --> 03:55:40.859 align:start position:0%
course depending on the number of sales
 
03:55:42.889 --> 03:55:42.899 align:start position:0%
as well as the price
 
03:55:45.170 --> 03:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
um we've seen as you can see on slide 32
 
03:55:48.650 --> 03:55:48.660 align:start position:0%
perhaps the median uh home sale price at
 
03:55:50.150 --> 03:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
least approached a regional Peak
 
03:55:53.990 --> 03:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
Statewide around May or June and since
 
03:55:56.570 --> 03:55:56.580 align:start position:0%
then has been dropping of course condo
 
03:55:59.450 --> 03:55:59.460 align:start position:0%
prices appear to still be increasing but
 
03:56:00.769 --> 03:56:00.779 align:start position:0%
you can see in the dashed line is
 
03:56:02.689 --> 03:56:02.699 align:start position:0%
mortgage interest rates average mortgage
 
03:56:04.309 --> 03:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
interest rates for a 30-year fixed loan
 
03:56:06.650 --> 03:56:06.660 align:start position:0%
that means that housing has become more
 
03:56:08.389 --> 03:56:08.399 align:start position:0%
expensive for people who need to take
 
03:56:10.610 --> 03:56:10.620 align:start position:0%
out a loan to buy a house that higher
 
03:56:11.570 --> 03:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
interest rate means it's functionally
 
03:56:14.210 --> 03:56:14.220 align:start position:0%
more expensive that doesn't show up in
 
03:56:15.710 --> 03:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
our real estate transfer tax revenues
 
03:56:17.090 --> 03:56:17.100 align:start position:0%
because that's dependent on the sale
 
03:56:18.950 --> 03:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
price not dependent on what people are
 
03:56:20.389 --> 03:56:20.399 align:start position:0%
paying in their mortgage monthly
 
03:56:22.670 --> 03:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
mortgage payment for example so that may
 
03:56:24.590 --> 03:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
affect real estate transfer tax revenues
 
03:56:26.809 --> 03:56:26.819 align:start position:0%
at the same time leading up to the
 
03:56:28.670 --> 03:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
pandemic a lot of us were expecting that
 
03:56:30.229 --> 03:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
Supply would constrain real estate
 
03:56:33.469 --> 03:56:33.479 align:start position:0%
transfer tax revenues it may have some
 
03:56:36.110 --> 03:56:36.120 align:start position:0%
but the revenues continue to grow so
 
03:56:38.510 --> 03:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
there is still quite a bit of housing
 
03:56:41.809 --> 03:56:41.819 align:start position:0%
demand as you can see on slide 33 there
 
03:56:42.950 --> 03:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
are probably quite a few people who are
 
03:56:44.750 --> 03:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
in the rental market who otherwise would
 
03:56:46.670 --> 03:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
prefer to buy a home and as a result
 
03:56:48.170 --> 03:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
we're seeing rental vacancy rates
 
03:56:50.830 --> 03:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
dropping substantially and rents rising
 
03:56:54.349 --> 03:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
and with those rental costs Rising that
 
03:56:56.450 --> 03:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
means that that there are people who are
 
03:56:57.590 --> 03:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
renting who would otherwise have
 
03:56:58.910 --> 03:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
purchased a home already if they could
 
03:57:01.550 --> 03:57:01.560 align:start position:0%
afford it I can't quantify that for you
 
03:57:03.229 --> 03:57:03.239 align:start position:0%
but it does mean that lower income
 
03:57:05.570 --> 03:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
renters for example the 36 percent of
 
03:57:07.490 --> 03:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
renters who had less than thirty five
 
03:57:10.189 --> 03:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per year in income are
 
03:57:12.050 --> 03:57:12.060 align:start position:0%
paying a larger and larger share of
 
03:57:14.389 --> 03:57:14.399 align:start position:0%
their income in rent so as you can see
 
03:57:17.090 --> 03:57:17.100 align:start position:0%
on the pie chart about three quarters of
 
03:57:19.429 --> 03:57:19.439 align:start position:0%
renters who have less than thirty five
 
03:57:20.929 --> 03:57:20.939 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per year in income in
 
03:57:24.130 --> 03:57:24.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in the 2017 to 2021 period
 
03:57:28.130 --> 03:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
owed uh 30 or more of their income in
 
03:57:30.769 --> 03:57:30.779 align:start position:0%
rent so there's likely a fair bit of
 
03:57:32.870 --> 03:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
housing demand still out there part of
 
03:57:34.610 --> 03:57:34.620 align:start position:0%
the question is is it accessible because
 
03:57:35.990 --> 03:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
of the prices
 
03:57:37.370 --> 03:57:37.380 align:start position:0%
and that's something to think about when
 
03:57:38.990 --> 03:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
thinking about real estate transfer tax
 
03:57:41.450 --> 03:57:41.460 align:start position:0%
revenues going forward and we're talking
 
03:57:44.809 --> 03:57:44.819 align:start position:0%
about me median incomes for renters
 
03:57:46.309 --> 03:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
they're much lower than median incomes
 
03:57:49.010 --> 03:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
for people who own their homes
 
03:57:50.809 --> 03:57:50.819 align:start position:0%
so interest in dividends tax really
 
03:57:50.819 --> 03:57:52.070 align:start position:0%
so interest in dividends tax really
quickly

03:57:52.070 --> 03:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
03:57:53.330 --> 03:57:53.340 align:start position:0%
um a five percent tax on interest
 
03:57:54.950 --> 03:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
dividend and distribution income from
 
03:57:56.450 --> 03:57:56.460 align:start position:0%
assets this is income generated from
 
03:57:59.150 --> 03:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
wealth particularly from stock ownership
 
03:58:01.550 --> 03:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
or ownership and businesses or from
 
03:58:04.010 --> 03:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
interest on you know bank accounts for
 
03:58:04.020 --> 03:58:04.870 align:start position:0%
interest on you know bank accounts for
example

03:58:04.870 --> 03:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
example
 
03:58:07.969 --> 03:58:07.979 align:start position:0%
under current law this is to be phased
 
03:58:10.250 --> 03:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
out starting for tax year 2023 so the
 
03:58:12.050 --> 03:58:12.060 align:start position:0%
taxes that will be filed in final form
 
03:58:14.929 --> 03:58:14.939 align:start position:0%
in the spring of 2024 you can see that
 
03:58:16.490 --> 03:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
this moves with the economy some and
 
03:58:17.269 --> 03:58:17.279 align:start position:0%
actually there's been a pretty
 
03:58:20.450 --> 03:58:20.460 align:start position:0%
significant increase in 2022 which
 
03:58:22.250 --> 03:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
boosted this up in terms of where it is
 
03:58:23.689 --> 03:58:23.699 align:start position:0%
relative to other General and education
 
03:58:26.090 --> 03:58:26.100 align:start position:0%
trust fund Revenue sources when thinking
 
03:58:29.150 --> 03:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
about this Revenue source and you can
 
03:58:30.830 --> 03:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
see in this in the chart on slide 37
 
03:58:32.950 --> 03:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
which is closer to what you find in the
 
03:58:38.630 --> 03:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
dras 20 annual report this this provides
 
03:58:40.010 --> 03:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
a little more detail
 
03:58:42.229 --> 03:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
when we're thinking about where revenues
 
03:58:44.030 --> 03:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
for this may Trend it's important to
 
03:58:46.729 --> 03:58:46.739 align:start position:0%
think about those asset values what
 
03:58:48.189 --> 03:58:48.199 align:start position:0%
income is generated from assets
 
03:58:50.030 --> 03:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
particularly for people with high
 
03:58:52.309 --> 03:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
incomes because about two and a half
 
03:58:55.550 --> 03:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
percent of filers paid more than half of
 
03:58:57.229 --> 03:58:57.239 align:start position:0%
the total collection of interest and
 
03:59:00.110 --> 03:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
dividends tax revenue and that's uh
 
03:59:01.969 --> 03:59:01.979 align:start position:0%
those are filers who had whether
 
03:59:05.330 --> 03:59:05.340 align:start position:0%
individual or joint filers who had more
 
03:59:06.650 --> 03:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
than two hundred thousand dollars a year
 
03:59:08.450 --> 03:59:08.460 align:start position:0%
in taxable interest in dividends tax
 
03:59:10.670 --> 03:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
revenue so what happens with those
 
03:59:12.469 --> 03:59:12.479 align:start position:0%
higher income higher asset value filers
 
03:59:14.510 --> 03:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
will be important when we're projecting
 
03:59:17.809 --> 03:59:17.819 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax revenues
 
03:59:20.090 --> 03:59:20.100 align:start position:0%
so I'll mention a couple things getting
 
03:59:21.769 --> 03:59:21.779 align:start position:0%
to the economic Outlook portion of the
 
03:59:23.330 --> 03:59:23.340 align:start position:0%
presentation and I'm watching the clock
 
03:59:25.189 --> 03:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
as well and seeing
 
03:59:26.450 --> 03:59:26.460 align:start position:0%
um I want to make sure that I'm not
 
03:59:28.729 --> 03:59:28.739 align:start position:0%
stepping on the next guests so I I don't
 
03:59:30.830 --> 03:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
see them here yet but I will I will go
 
03:59:32.750 --> 03:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
as long as you'd like me to if that uh
 
03:59:35.210 --> 03:59:35.220 align:start position:0%
if you'd like
 
03:59:39.769 --> 03:59:39.779 align:start position:0%
um the um the on slide 39 we can see
 
03:59:42.250 --> 03:59:42.260 align:start position:0%
that this recovery has been much faster
 
03:59:45.710 --> 03:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
than the last economic recovery from the
 
03:59:47.510 --> 03:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
Great Recession this is something that
 
03:59:49.729 --> 03:59:49.739 align:start position:0%
director gotlab and this is the Deputy
 
03:59:51.769 --> 03:59:51.779 align:start position:0%
Commissioner lavers talked about last
 
03:59:55.130 --> 03:59:55.140 align:start position:0%
week using um uh the labor force and
 
03:59:57.349 --> 03:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
employment this is looking at median
 
03:59:59.090 --> 03:59:59.100 align:start position:0%
household income inflation-adjusted
 
04:00:00.349 --> 04:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
median household income in New Hampshire
 
04:00:03.110 --> 04:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
and you can see that from its peak in
 
04:00:04.969 --> 04:00:04.979 align:start position:0%
2007 prior to the Great Recession it
 
04:00:07.429 --> 04:00:07.439 align:start position:0%
took about eight to ten years to get
 
04:00:09.469 --> 04:00:09.479 align:start position:0%
back to those inflation-adjusted uh
 
04:00:10.910 --> 04:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
levels in terms of what the purchasing
 
04:00:13.729 --> 04:00:13.739 align:start position:0%
power the median household was we don't
 
04:00:15.410 --> 04:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
have data for 2020 unfortunately because
 
04:00:17.750 --> 04:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
of complications with the pandemic but
 
04:00:20.330 --> 04:00:20.340 align:start position:0%
between 2019 and 2021 we see that median
 
04:00:22.010 --> 04:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
household income adjusted for inflation
 
04:00:24.170 --> 04:00:24.180 align:start position:0%
was already higher we don't know what it
 
04:00:27.050 --> 04:00:27.060 align:start position:0%
will be in 2022 but that's a much faster
 
04:00:29.389 --> 04:00:29.399 align:start position:0%
growth in terms of the income recovery
 
04:00:30.830 --> 04:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of reasons for that
 
04:00:32.809 --> 04:00:32.819 align:start position:0%
obviously the Great Recession was caused
 
04:00:34.550 --> 04:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
by different factors than a global
 
04:00:37.910 --> 04:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic so different economic effects
 
04:00:40.070 --> 04:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
but we can see if you look on slide 40
 
04:00:43.309 --> 04:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
that the federal efforts to stimulate
 
04:00:45.769 --> 04:00:45.779 align:start position:0%
the economy were really targeted at some
 
04:00:47.809 --> 04:00:47.819 align:start position:0%
of the most effective stimulus this is
 
04:00:49.969 --> 04:00:49.979 align:start position:0%
modeling from Moody's Analytics that
 
04:00:51.950 --> 04:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
looks over the course of 2021 and
 
04:00:54.950 --> 04:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
estimates what is the dollar value in
 
04:00:57.410 --> 04:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
economic output for each dollar invested
 
04:00:58.969 --> 04:00:58.979 align:start position:0%
by the federal government in certain
 
04:01:01.370 --> 04:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
programs and you can see food assistance
 
04:01:03.530 --> 04:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
was at the top and the federal aid
 
04:01:05.769 --> 04:01:05.779 align:start position:0%
packages did boost food assistance
 
04:01:08.090 --> 04:01:08.100 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation Aid to State
 
04:01:09.769 --> 04:01:09.779 align:start position:0%
and local governments earned income tax
 
04:01:11.389 --> 04:01:11.399 align:start position:0%
credit and child tax credit expansions
 
04:01:13.849 --> 04:01:13.859 align:start position:0%
those are all things that stimulate the
 
04:01:15.590 --> 04:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
economy in the short term
 
04:01:18.530 --> 04:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
so we can see that likely had some
 
04:01:20.330 --> 04:01:20.340 align:start position:0%
significant spurring effect for economic
 
04:01:20.340 --> 04:01:21.429 align:start position:0%
significant spurring effect for economic
growth

04:01:21.429 --> 04:01:21.439 align:start position:0%
growth
 
04:01:24.410 --> 04:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
the uh however if you look at slide 41
 
04:01:25.910 --> 04:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
these are data from New Hampshire
 
04:01:29.030 --> 04:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
showing the percentage of adults since
 
04:01:30.769 --> 04:01:30.779 align:start position:0%
middle of 2020 unfortunately we don't
 
04:01:32.630 --> 04:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
have these Data before that the
 
04:01:34.250 --> 04:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
percentage of adults reporting it's been
 
04:01:35.809 --> 04:01:35.819 align:start position:0%
somewhat or very difficult to pay for
 
04:01:37.429 --> 04:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
usual household expenses in the last
 
04:01:40.429 --> 04:01:40.439 align:start position:0%
seven days and you can see that that
 
04:01:42.530 --> 04:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
percentage especially since the monthly
 
04:01:43.969 --> 04:01:43.979 align:start position:0%
child tax credits have ended and
 
04:01:46.189 --> 04:01:46.199 align:start position:0%
inflation really started to pick up in
 
04:01:49.790 --> 04:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
the first half of 2022 that it has
 
04:01:52.070 --> 04:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
become more difficult according to New
 
04:01:54.650 --> 04:01:54.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire adults about a third and a
 
04:01:55.790 --> 04:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
little bit more than a third in some
 
04:01:57.469 --> 04:01:57.479 align:start position:0%
months reported that it was somewhat or
 
04:01:58.849 --> 04:01:58.859 align:start position:0%
very difficult to pay for those usual
 
04:02:01.010 --> 04:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
household expenses so that doesn't
 
04:02:03.830 --> 04:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
portend well for the economy especially
 
04:02:05.870 --> 04:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
folks who are having that difficulty but
 
04:02:07.490 --> 04:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
if we look at slide 42 and I know there
 
04:02:08.929 --> 04:02:08.939 align:start position:0%
was some discussion about this last week
 
04:02:11.389 --> 04:02:11.399 align:start position:0%
this is the amount of additional savings
 
04:02:14.650 --> 04:02:14.660 align:start position:0%
that households have by income quartile
 
04:02:18.950 --> 04:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
in the second quarter of 2022 relative
 
04:02:20.929 --> 04:02:20.939 align:start position:0%
to what the researchers at the Federal
 
04:02:23.630 --> 04:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
Reserve would have projected based on
 
04:02:25.969 --> 04:02:25.979 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic Trends and we can see that
 
04:02:27.590 --> 04:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
those their additional savings across
 
04:02:29.030 --> 04:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
groups this is not necessarily across
 
04:02:31.010 --> 04:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
every household in each group but across
 
04:02:34.250 --> 04:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
groups that's a good cushion that's a
 
04:02:36.530 --> 04:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
good set of assets to go into more
 
04:02:38.090 --> 04:02:38.100 align:start position:0%
uncertain Economic Times with because
 
04:02:41.150 --> 04:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
that's likely supports state that likely
 
04:02:44.929 --> 04:02:44.939 align:start position:0%
supports consumption expenditures and uh
 
04:02:47.689 --> 04:02:47.699 align:start position:0%
and means that households that may face
 
04:02:49.910 --> 04:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
headwinds from both inflation which has
 
04:02:52.130 --> 04:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
likely already eroded a fair bit of this
 
04:02:56.870 --> 04:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
and an economic slowdown we'll see that
 
04:02:58.729 --> 04:02:58.739 align:start position:0%
these savings going into that period
 
04:03:00.830 --> 04:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
with these savings likely helps of
 
04:03:02.870 --> 04:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
course with the lowest savings at the
 
04:03:04.910 --> 04:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
bottom quartile that means that the
 
04:03:06.650 --> 04:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
households that have lower incomes and
 
04:03:08.090 --> 04:03:08.100 align:start position:0%
are probably least likely able to
 
04:03:09.950 --> 04:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
weather an economic downturn are coming
 
04:03:11.870 --> 04:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
in with the smallest number of assets
 
04:03:15.050 --> 04:03:15.060 align:start position:0%
and before the we're using 2019 or
 
04:03:17.870 --> 04:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
estimating for 2019 and using 2019 data
 
04:03:20.090 --> 04:03:20.100 align:start position:0%
about 26 percent of New Hampshire
 
04:03:22.550 --> 04:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
households did not have two thousand
 
04:03:24.110 --> 04:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
dollars in emergency savings according
 
04:03:27.050 --> 04:03:27.060 align:start position:0%
to estimates from the urban Institute
 
04:03:29.510 --> 04:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
um if I should I keep going is that
 
04:03:31.910 --> 04:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
I think we can keep going for now yeah
 
04:03:34.070 --> 04:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
and if no one objects sorry Governor
 
04:03:35.269 --> 04:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
okay with that
 
04:03:37.189 --> 04:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
okay okay great
 
04:03:40.070 --> 04:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
John do we excuse me Jen do we know um
 
04:03:43.189 --> 04:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Employment Security
 
04:03:44.929 --> 04:03:44.939 align:start position:0%
oh they are okay
 
04:03:47.150 --> 04:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
um let's um try to wrap up in the next
 
04:03:48.410 --> 04:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
three or four minutes sure great
 
04:03:48.420 --> 04:03:49.729 align:start position:0%
three or four minutes sure great
absolutely

04:03:49.729 --> 04:03:49.739 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
04:03:52.130 --> 04:03:52.140 align:start position:0%
um one thing that I'll say in slide 43
 
04:03:53.710 --> 04:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
is the only sort of national
 
04:03:56.929 --> 04:03:56.939 align:start position:0%
macroeconomic slide that I have the last
 
04:03:59.809 --> 04:03:59.819 align:start position:0%
few months of data the last five months
 
04:04:00.950 --> 04:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
or data or so have been quite
 
04:04:02.750 --> 04:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
encouraging if we're looking for a
 
04:04:05.269 --> 04:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
so-called soft Landing for the economy
 
04:04:08.990 --> 04:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
um because we've seen the uh rate of job
 
04:04:11.210 --> 04:04:11.220 align:start position:0%
growth slow but still remain a robust
 
04:04:13.729 --> 04:04:13.739 align:start position:0%
over 200 000 a month and we've seen the
 
04:04:15.830 --> 04:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
rate of inflation slow year over year
 
04:04:19.670 --> 04:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
now it's still too high uh but it is uh
 
04:04:21.170 --> 04:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
coming down or appears to be coming down
 
04:04:22.969 --> 04:04:22.979 align:start position:0%
from where it was before
 
04:04:25.910 --> 04:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
on slide 44 we can see that growth State
 
04:04:27.530 --> 04:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
product again our state version of gross
 
04:04:30.229 --> 04:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
domestic product has recovered faster
 
04:04:32.689 --> 04:04:32.699 align:start position:0%
than employment from the pandemic that
 
04:04:34.490 --> 04:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
pandemic employment that pre-pandemic
 
04:04:35.750 --> 04:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
high unemployment level is still
 
04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
something we're sort of getting to at
 
04:04:38.689 --> 04:04:38.699 align:start position:0%
this point whereas grow State product
 
04:04:41.150 --> 04:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
has increased substantially labor force
 
04:04:42.469 --> 04:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
constraints are probably keeping that
 
04:04:44.870 --> 04:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
from growing further they've probably
 
04:04:46.969 --> 04:04:46.979 align:start position:0%
slowed that it probably has slowed
 
04:04:49.969 --> 04:04:49.979 align:start position:0%
growth in employment as well as slowed
 
04:04:51.650 --> 04:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
growth State product overall
 
04:04:53.389 --> 04:04:53.399 align:start position:0%
and one thing I do want to mention I
 
04:04:56.450 --> 04:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
know you talked some last week about uh
 
04:04:59.450 --> 04:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
particularly that 20 to 34 age group and
 
04:05:01.429 --> 04:05:01.439 align:start position:0%
the lower participation rate in the 20
 
04:05:03.530 --> 04:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
to 34 age group I do want to emphasize
 
04:05:05.510 --> 04:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
that child care is likely a big part of
 
04:05:07.250 --> 04:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
that we have some data especially
 
04:05:09.530 --> 04:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
associated with the pandemic
 
04:05:11.870 --> 04:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
um and some of those pandemic era data
 
04:05:13.429 --> 04:05:13.439 align:start position:0%
collections that suggest that child care
 
04:05:16.130 --> 04:05:16.140 align:start position:0%
disruptions have been a big component of
 
04:05:18.250 --> 04:05:18.260 align:start position:0%
holding people back out of the workforce
 
04:05:21.530 --> 04:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
and and child care cost is really
 
04:05:23.269 --> 04:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
significant particularly for households
 
04:05:25.610 --> 04:05:25.620 align:start position:0%
with lower incomes as you can see on the
 
04:05:25.620 --> 04:05:26.450 align:start position:0%
with lower incomes as you can see on the
chart

04:05:26.450 --> 04:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
chart
 
04:05:29.630 --> 04:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
and I also want to note that long-term
 
04:05:32.269 --> 04:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
demographics are likely part of what
 
04:05:34.849 --> 04:05:34.859 align:start position:0%
we're seeing as the slower growth in the
 
04:05:36.889 --> 04:05:36.899 align:start position:0%
labor force over time
 
04:05:38.450 --> 04:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
um so the state released some
 
04:05:40.790 --> 04:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
projections last year that about 30
 
04:05:42.530 --> 04:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
percent more than 30 percent of the
 
04:05:44.389 --> 04:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
state population will be 60 years or
 
04:05:47.269 --> 04:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
older by 2030 that doesn't mean that
 
04:05:49.490 --> 04:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
folks in the 60 year old or category
 
04:05:50.570 --> 04:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
will not be participating in the
 
04:05:53.450 --> 04:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
workforce many of them will be but it
 
04:05:55.070 --> 04:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
does mean that it's there's a higher
 
04:05:57.170 --> 04:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
likelihood that a significant portion of
 
04:05:59.389 --> 04:05:59.399 align:start position:0%
the population will be either retiring
 
04:06:01.969 --> 04:06:01.979 align:start position:0%
or reducing their engagement in the
 
04:06:03.050 --> 04:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
workforce particularly as you get
 
04:06:06.530 --> 04:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
significantly older than age 60. so that
 
04:06:08.030 --> 04:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
means Child Care Access housing
 
04:06:09.590 --> 04:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
availability affordability and education
 
04:06:11.150 --> 04:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
will all be key to supporting the
 
04:06:14.150 --> 04:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
current and future Workforce so some key
 
04:06:14.160 --> 04:06:15.349 align:start position:0%
current and future Workforce so some key
takeaways

04:06:15.349 --> 04:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
takeaways
 
04:06:17.090 --> 04:06:17.100 align:start position:0%
um State revenues are relatively diverse
 
04:06:18.710 --> 04:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
Federal funding is an important part of
 
04:06:20.750 --> 04:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
it the business profits tax has
 
04:06:23.090 --> 04:06:23.100 align:start position:0%
substantially increased in importance in
 
04:06:24.650 --> 04:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
the terms of the total state revenue pie
 
04:06:27.410 --> 04:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
in recent years and has been you know
 
04:06:29.689 --> 04:06:29.699 align:start position:0%
potentially that's a potentially
 
04:06:31.309 --> 04:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
volatile Revenue Source in a recession
 
04:06:33.170 --> 04:06:33.180 align:start position:0%
or a Slowdown because corporate profits
 
04:06:34.990 --> 04:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
may be more responsive to that than say
 
04:06:37.550 --> 04:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax compensation or
 
04:06:40.370 --> 04:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
employment base or property tax base or
 
04:06:43.189 --> 04:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
even meals and rentals meals and rentals
 
04:06:44.330 --> 04:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
tax and real estate transfer tax
 
04:06:45.710 --> 04:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
revenues have jumped higher in the last
 
04:06:48.110 --> 04:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
two years relative to that growth may be
 
04:06:50.929 --> 04:06:50.939 align:start position:0%
slowing as they sort of get back to
 
04:06:53.330 --> 04:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
trend line or as we see more Supply
 
04:06:54.710 --> 04:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
constraint on the real estate side
 
04:06:56.870 --> 04:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax revenues will
 
04:06:58.250 --> 04:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
decline with the phase out with the
 
04:07:00.710 --> 04:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
reducing rate and then Workforce growth
 
04:07:01.849 --> 04:07:01.859 align:start position:0%
in the state's economy has been
 
04:07:03.530 --> 04:07:03.540 align:start position:0%
constrained by long-term demographics
 
04:07:06.290 --> 04:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
lack of access to child care and limited
 
04:07:08.689 --> 04:07:08.699 align:start position:0%
housing and I do want to note a
 
04:07:10.429 --> 04:07:10.439 align:start position:0%
recession is not a certainty there's a
 
04:07:13.070 --> 04:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion about how a recession
 
04:07:15.590 --> 04:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh is likely to be coming I don't
 
04:07:17.689 --> 04:07:17.699 align:start position:0%
consider it a certainty uh by any means
 
04:07:19.910 --> 04:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
but key revenue streams are at risk if a
 
04:07:21.349 --> 04:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
recession does occur or a significant
 
04:07:23.090 --> 04:07:23.100 align:start position:0%
economic slowdown and that would limit
 
04:07:25.010 --> 04:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
resources available to provide services
 
04:07:26.630 --> 04:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
and support the economy through those
 
04:07:28.370 --> 04:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
services so there's some additional
 
04:07:29.870 --> 04:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
resources on the last slide and I'm
 
04:07:31.250 --> 04:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
happy to take any additional questions
 
04:07:33.530 --> 04:07:33.540 align:start position:0%
that the chair seeks to allocate time to
 
04:07:33.540 --> 04:07:36.530 align:start position:0%
that the chair seeks to allocate time to
so

04:07:36.530 --> 04:07:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:38.990 --> 04:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
we can take one or two questions anyone
 
04:07:42.469 --> 04:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:44.389 --> 04:07:44.399 align:start position:0%
well seeing none I think we're good
 
04:07:46.010 --> 04:07:46.020 align:start position:0%

04:07:47.570 --> 04:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the opportunity I
 
04:08:11.570 --> 04:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:15.050 --> 04:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
foreign can you have the Department of
 
04:08:16.429 --> 04:08:16.439 align:start position:0%

04:08:16.439 --> 04:08:18.769 align:start position:0%
Employment Security come in if they're
out

04:08:18.769 --> 04:08:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:20.929 --> 04:08:20.939 align:start position:0%
oh yeah

foreign

04:12:02.750 --> 04:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:05.150 --> 04:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
okay we'll get started with the
 
04:12:06.469 --> 04:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
Department of Employment Security
 
04:12:08.510 --> 04:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
presentation a few gentlemen would
 
04:12:10.250 --> 04:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
introduce yourselves to start that'd be
 
04:12:10.260 --> 04:12:11.870 align:start position:0%
introduce yourselves to start that'd be
great

04:12:11.870 --> 04:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
great
 
04:12:13.729 --> 04:12:13.739 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Richard laver's Deputy
 
04:12:15.769 --> 04:12:15.779 align:start position:0%
Commissioner with the Department
 
04:12:18.290 --> 04:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
Brian gotlab director of the economic
 
04:12:20.150 --> 04:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
and labor market information Bureau of
 
04:12:23.330 --> 04:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:24.950 --> 04:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
um so what we have here we're going to
 
04:12:27.170 --> 04:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
and first of all thank you for
 
04:12:29.929 --> 04:12:29.939 align:start position:0%
um inviting us back to finish up the
 
04:12:32.030 --> 04:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
material that we wanted to cover
 
04:12:35.990 --> 04:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
um we updated a few slides that Brian
 
04:12:38.330 --> 04:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
will be covering to capture the most
 
04:12:40.309 --> 04:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
recent information with the the latest
 
04:12:43.130 --> 04:12:43.140 align:start position:0%
CPI report that came out at the end of
 
04:12:45.950 --> 04:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
last week we also tried to add a few
 
04:12:47.990 --> 04:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
additional slides in response to some
 
04:12:50.929 --> 04:12:50.939 align:start position:0%
topics that were discussed when we
 
04:12:53.630 --> 04:12:53.640 align:start position:0%
talked last week so I'll fast forward to
 
04:12:55.990 --> 04:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
the to where we left off there's a few
 
04:12:59.929 --> 04:12:59.939 align:start position:0%
newer slides to try to look a little bit
 
04:13:03.349 --> 04:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
more granular at the child care industry
 
04:13:05.570 --> 04:13:05.580 align:start position:0%
and some other sectors so you can see
 
04:13:07.969 --> 04:13:07.979 align:start position:0%
the the progression that they've made or
 
04:13:09.830 --> 04:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
lack thereof since the prior to the
 
04:13:12.410 --> 04:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
pandemic and then we'll get into Brian
 
04:13:15.070 --> 04:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
looking at his forecast
 
04:13:31.670 --> 04:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:35.809 --> 04:13:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:42.710 --> 04:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:49.670 --> 04:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:13:52.010 --> 04:13:52.020 align:start position:0%
um so this is where we had left off
 
04:13:53.990 --> 04:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh the presentation is online
 
04:13:55.370 --> 04:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
too right
 
04:14:03.050 --> 04:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:06.290 --> 04:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you
 
04:14:06.300 --> 04:14:09.769 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you
okay

04:14:09.769 --> 04:14:09.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:11.870 --> 04:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
um so this slide is where we had left
 
04:14:14.570 --> 04:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
off this is this had looked at the
 
04:14:17.330 --> 04:14:17.340 align:start position:0%
difference in labor force participation
 
04:14:20.929 --> 04:14:20.939 align:start position:0%
by gender in the 25 to 34 year old age
 
04:14:20.939 --> 04:14:21.950 align:start position:0%
by gender in the 25 to 34 year old age
group

04:14:21.950 --> 04:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
group
 
04:14:23.150 --> 04:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
um then there there had been some
 
04:14:26.170 --> 04:14:26.180 align:start position:0%
questions asked about uh Child Care
 
04:14:29.630 --> 04:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
specifically so we had looked at both
 
04:14:33.290 --> 04:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
the difference in licensed
 
04:14:36.769 --> 04:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
establishments as well as employment at
 
04:14:39.710 --> 04:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
those licensed establishments so this
 
04:14:43.070 --> 04:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
slide you can see establishments are off
 
04:14:46.550 --> 04:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
by a little over six percent and the
 
04:14:49.729 --> 04:14:49.739 align:start position:0%
workforce at those establishments is
 
04:14:52.490 --> 04:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
down a little over 600 individuals or
 
04:14:54.070 --> 04:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
about 11
 
04:14:56.110 --> 04:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
so trying to
 
04:14:59.030 --> 04:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
be responsive to the questions that were
 
04:15:02.510 --> 04:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
asked when we last spoke
 
04:15:06.410 --> 04:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
um and we did uh we decided to put in uh
 
04:15:09.650 --> 04:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
some uh detail on some uh particular
 
04:15:09.660 --> 04:15:10.969 align:start position:0%
some uh detail on some uh particular
sectors

04:15:10.969 --> 04:15:10.979 align:start position:0%
sectors
 
04:15:12.590 --> 04:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
um that we had talked about so we had
 
04:15:14.689 --> 04:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
shown gain and loss from an employment
 
04:15:17.210 --> 04:15:17.220 align:start position:0%
perspective uh for
 
04:15:19.130 --> 04:15:19.140 align:start position:0%
um all sectors here in New Hampshire and
 
04:15:21.170 --> 04:15:21.180 align:start position:0%
what we did here in a series of slides
 
04:15:22.910 --> 04:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
was just to show the quarterly
 
04:15:25.849 --> 04:15:25.859 align:start position:0%
progression so pre-pandemic total number
 
04:15:29.150 --> 04:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
of workers based upon reports filed by
 
04:15:31.010 --> 04:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
those employers so this is not survey
 
04:15:33.950 --> 04:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
data this is actual quarterly reports
 
04:15:36.349 --> 04:15:36.359 align:start position:0%
from those employers that are in that
 
04:15:39.950 --> 04:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
particular sector and you can see here
 
04:15:44.210 --> 04:15:44.220 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at retail you'll see in Q4
 
04:15:47.870 --> 04:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
of 2019 was their pre-pandemic peak of
 
04:15:52.610 --> 04:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
about 95 000 workers 95 541 and you can
 
04:15:54.349 --> 04:15:54.359 align:start position:0%
go to the right hand side of the screen
 
04:15:56.809 --> 04:15:56.819 align:start position:0%
you can see the most recent data we have
 
04:16:01.070 --> 04:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
here for Q2 of 2022 almost at 88
 
04:16:04.630 --> 04:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
thousand so you can see how they have
 
04:16:07.790 --> 04:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
trended from quarter to quarter and
 
04:16:09.710 --> 04:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
where they are currently compared to
 
04:16:12.469 --> 04:16:12.479 align:start position:0%
2019 and again this is the actual
 
04:16:15.349 --> 04:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
employer filings Q2 is the most recent
 
04:16:18.349 --> 04:16:18.359 align:start position:0%
we have right now so there is a decent
 
04:16:20.510 --> 04:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
lag with being able to receive that
 
04:16:22.070 --> 04:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
information and then get it into a
 
04:16:24.590 --> 04:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
format to publish but here it gives you
 
04:16:26.990 --> 04:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
that quarterly breakdown and again this
 
04:16:30.229 --> 04:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
was our retail employers when we look at
 
04:16:33.410 --> 04:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
hospitals here again you can see you can
 
04:16:36.769 --> 04:16:36.779 align:start position:0%
look back to 2019 Q4 was their
 
04:16:39.229 --> 04:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic Peak just over 30 000
 
04:16:41.929 --> 04:16:41.939 align:start position:0%
workers and then on the right hand side
 
04:16:47.210 --> 04:16:47.220 align:start position:0%
of the screen Q2 of 2022 just over 28
 
04:16:49.790 --> 04:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
000 workers you could see that that
 
04:16:52.929 --> 04:16:52.939 align:start position:0%
quarterly change where they they did
 
04:16:56.950 --> 04:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
reach a peak coming out of the pandemic
 
04:17:02.750 --> 04:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
of 2088 or almost you know 28 900 in Q4
 
04:17:07.250 --> 04:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
of 2021 and have seen some loss in those
 
04:17:10.010 --> 04:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:13.510 --> 04:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
nursing and Residential Care Facilities
 
04:17:17.809 --> 04:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
again same display of information here
 
04:17:20.330 --> 04:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
quarterly employment so you can compare
 
04:17:22.910 --> 04:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
their pre-pandemic peak of of quarter
 
04:17:28.510 --> 04:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
three of 2019 of about 14 500 employees
 
04:17:33.490 --> 04:17:33.500 align:start position:0%
to Quarter Two of 2022 at just under 13
 
04:17:37.330 --> 04:17:37.340 align:start position:0%
200 employees and see that fluctuation
 
04:17:41.090 --> 04:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
and then restaurants that was a one that
 
04:17:43.910 --> 04:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
had been a few questions were asked
 
04:17:46.870 --> 04:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
about those numbers and here you can see
 
04:17:50.870 --> 04:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
with restaurant employment usually peaks
 
04:17:55.910 --> 04:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
in that third quarter each year and that
 
04:18:01.610 --> 04:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
Q3 2019 Peak was fifty three thousand to
 
04:18:04.849 --> 04:18:04.859 align:start position:0%
sixty seven when you look at Q2 our most
 
04:18:08.990 --> 04:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
recent information for 2022 down to 50
 
04:18:14.030 --> 04:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
077 seven if you compare Q2 to Q2 to to
 
04:18:16.790 --> 04:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
seasonally adjust that you can see that
 
04:18:22.309 --> 04:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
Q2 of 2019 at about 51 8 and now in Q2
 
04:18:26.530 --> 04:18:26.540 align:start position:0%
of 2022 at 50 000
 
04:18:30.050 --> 04:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
77. so slightly slightly down when you
 
04:18:32.630 --> 04:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
look at Q2 to Q2 but it'll be
 
04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
interesting to see that third quarter
 
04:18:38.330 --> 04:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
number for 2022 and to compare that back
 
04:18:41.990 --> 04:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
to 2019 when that's available which
 
04:18:44.689 --> 04:18:44.699 align:start position:0%
should be shortly and I think here we
 
04:18:47.750 --> 04:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
now can move on I think we have a sorry
 
04:18:50.330 --> 04:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
we have a question representative thank
 
04:18:51.710 --> 04:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
you so
 
04:18:53.570 --> 04:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
are the jobs there they're just having
 
04:18:55.429 --> 04:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
trouble filling them
 
04:18:57.769 --> 04:18:57.779 align:start position:0%
so we have the jobs we just don't have
 
04:18:58.670 --> 04:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
the people
 
04:19:02.389 --> 04:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
yeah the um the the actual postings the
 
04:19:02.399 --> 04:19:03.650 align:start position:0%
yeah the um the the actual postings the
demand

04:19:03.650 --> 04:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
demand
 
04:19:08.150 --> 04:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
um is up over where it was in in 2019
 
04:19:09.710 --> 04:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
um and I think we still haven't gotten
 
04:19:11.269 --> 04:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
to those have we done some of those
 
04:19:13.010 --> 04:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
slides yet or getting to them I think we
 
04:19:14.990 --> 04:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
have no okay yeah so we'll be looking at
 
04:19:18.050 --> 04:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
some of that uh the posting detail for
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
employers and comparing that back to
 
04:19:23.210 --> 04:19:23.220 align:start position:0%
2019 so you can see where the demand is
 
04:19:26.030 --> 04:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative almi
 
04:19:28.070 --> 04:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
have you looked at the thing of
 
04:19:28.080 --> 04:19:31.010 align:start position:0%
have you looked at the thing of
establishments

04:19:31.010 --> 04:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:34.309 --> 04:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
for uh restaurants I think restaurants
 
04:19:37.550 --> 04:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
are slightly the one right two
 
04:19:39.889 --> 04:19:39.899 align:start position:0%
restaurants three restaurants died and
 
04:19:41.630 --> 04:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
everybody working at them formed their
 
04:19:43.010 --> 04:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
own restaurant
 
04:19:44.689 --> 04:19:44.699 align:start position:0%
and then started fighting over the
 
04:19:44.699 --> 04:19:46.910 align:start position:0%
and then started fighting over the
workers

04:19:46.910 --> 04:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
workers
 
04:19:49.189 --> 04:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
but I think yep slightly upright yes
 
04:19:51.530 --> 04:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
slightly up for restaurant employers for
 
04:19:51.540 --> 04:19:55.610 align:start position:0%
slightly up for restaurant employers for
establishments

04:19:55.610 --> 04:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:05.210 --> 04:20:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:07.550 --> 04:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
so um now we'll talk a little bit about
 
04:20:10.370 --> 04:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
what we see happening in the future
 
04:20:14.090 --> 04:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
um our Outlook is a little bit kind of
 
04:20:14.100 --> 04:20:14.990 align:start position:0%
um our Outlook is a little bit kind of
classic

04:20:14.990 --> 04:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
classic
 
04:20:18.410 --> 04:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
um we're not right now
 
04:20:21.229 --> 04:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
um of a mind that that the U.S is
 
04:20:23.090 --> 04:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
inevitably going to fall into recession
 
04:20:24.650 --> 04:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
that does put us in the minority
 
04:20:24.660 --> 04:20:26.510 align:start position:0%
that does put us in the minority
category

04:20:26.510 --> 04:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
category
 
04:20:28.969 --> 04:20:28.979 align:start position:0%
um uh we'll take you through some slides
 
04:20:32.269 --> 04:20:32.279 align:start position:0%
to provide some backup to that view
 
04:20:34.130 --> 04:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
we're not we don't believe we're being
 
04:20:36.469 --> 04:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
pollyanish we think that there's been
 
04:20:38.210 --> 04:20:38.220 align:start position:0%
some significant improvements in data
 
04:20:40.670 --> 04:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
over the last few months it is still
 
04:20:43.309 --> 04:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
going to be not a particularly good
 
04:20:46.610 --> 04:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
economic year it could be quite weak the
 
04:20:48.650 --> 04:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
difference the distinction between a
 
04:20:51.410 --> 04:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
very weak economy and one that is in
 
04:20:53.689 --> 04:20:53.699 align:start position:0%
recession will be pretty hard to
 
04:20:53.699 --> 04:20:54.910 align:start position:0%
recession will be pretty hard to
distinguish

04:20:54.910 --> 04:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
distinguish
 
04:20:58.490 --> 04:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
but the key metric I think is what's
 
04:21:00.469 --> 04:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
going to happen in the labor market and
 
04:21:02.990 --> 04:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
we're more optimistic about
 
04:21:05.269 --> 04:21:05.279 align:start position:0%
um the absence of of decline in
 
04:21:06.830 --> 04:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
employment than we have been in some
 
04:21:08.030 --> 04:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
time so
 
04:21:08.040 --> 04:21:08.750 align:start position:0%
time so
um

04:21:08.750 --> 04:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:11.389 --> 04:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't take I wouldn't take offense
 
04:21:13.250 --> 04:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
at anybody who argues that we are going
 
04:21:14.510 --> 04:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
to fall into a recession I think there's
 
04:21:16.130 --> 04:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
a reasonable certainly a reasonable case
 
04:21:18.410 --> 04:21:18.420 align:start position:0%
for that but based on what we see we
 
04:21:20.269 --> 04:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
don't think that's going to happen so
 
04:21:22.189 --> 04:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
number one household finances are
 
04:21:23.929 --> 04:21:23.939 align:start position:0%
actually better positioned to withstand
 
04:21:25.849 --> 04:21:25.859 align:start position:0%
some of the negative things that are
 
04:21:28.729 --> 04:21:28.739 align:start position:0%
happening the price shocks inflation and
 
04:21:32.090 --> 04:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
I say that with one caveat and that's
 
04:21:35.090 --> 04:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
largely true of middle and upper income
 
04:21:37.010 --> 04:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
households lower income households
 
04:21:39.370 --> 04:21:39.380 align:start position:0%
clearly are struggling and I'm sure Phil
 
04:21:42.410 --> 04:21:42.420 align:start position:0%
provided some of that information so
 
04:21:44.990 --> 04:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking in the aggregate so
 
04:21:47.570 --> 04:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
understand that we certainly understand
 
04:21:49.010 --> 04:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of households that are
 
04:21:51.370 --> 04:21:51.380 align:start position:0%
hurting inflation is clearly moderating
 
04:21:54.170 --> 04:21:54.180 align:start position:0%
and although it's not captured so much
 
04:21:57.170 --> 04:21:57.180 align:start position:0%
in in the CPI numbers for a number of
 
04:21:59.450 --> 04:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
reasons that I won't get into rental
 
04:22:01.309 --> 04:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
increases are starting to slow and we
 
04:22:03.769 --> 04:22:03.779 align:start position:0%
know housing sales prices are starting
 
04:22:05.389 --> 04:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
to fall
 
04:22:07.309 --> 04:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
so that's encouraging and that's a big
 
04:22:10.309 --> 04:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
part of the CPI by the way shelter is 32
 
04:22:14.929 --> 04:22:14.939 align:start position:0%
percent of the of the the CPI the labor
 
04:22:17.090 --> 04:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
force recovering not as fast as we would
 
04:22:17.100 --> 04:22:18.170 align:start position:0%
force recovering not as fast as we would
like

04:22:18.170 --> 04:22:18.180 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:22:20.929 --> 04:22:20.939 align:start position:0%
um but it is recovering and job growth
 
04:22:22.670 --> 04:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
is slowing and that's actually a good
 
04:22:24.050 --> 04:22:24.060 align:start position:0%
thing from the Federal Reserve
 
04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
perspective they're concerned about wage
 
04:22:26.640 --> 04:22:27.889 align:start position:0%
perspective they're concerned about wage
inflation

04:22:27.889 --> 04:22:27.899 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
04:22:31.030 --> 04:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
and what it would wage price spiral
 
04:22:34.729 --> 04:22:34.739 align:start position:0%
mod the combination of an increase in
 
04:22:37.849 --> 04:22:37.859 align:start position:0%
labor force and a slowing of the job
 
04:22:39.889 --> 04:22:39.899 align:start position:0%
growth will moderate
 
04:22:43.309 --> 04:22:43.319 align:start position:0%
um the wage wage increases and that will
 
04:22:46.330 --> 04:22:46.340 align:start position:0%
help put a damper on inflation concerns
 
04:22:49.670 --> 04:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
here's the biggest I think rationale for
 
04:22:51.650 --> 04:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
why we can avoid a recession is that we
 
04:22:53.090 --> 04:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
believe based on what's happened over
 
04:22:55.010 --> 04:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
the last few years the difficulty that
 
04:22:58.490 --> 04:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
employers have had in hiring people that
 
04:23:00.889 --> 04:23:00.899 align:start position:0%
they will be reluctant more reluctant in
 
04:23:03.410 --> 04:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
a downturn to let go of employees for
 
04:23:03.420 --> 04:23:04.490 align:start position:0%
a downturn to let go of employees for
fear

04:23:04.490 --> 04:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
fear
 
04:23:07.790 --> 04:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
they may not be able to rehire when the
 
04:23:09.670 --> 04:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
economy strengthens
 
04:23:13.130 --> 04:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
even forecasters who believe the new the
 
04:23:15.530 --> 04:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
economy is headed for a recession most
 
04:23:17.750 --> 04:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
believe it will be a mild recession and
 
04:23:19.250 --> 04:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
in a mild recession
 
04:23:22.130 --> 04:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
there a lot of businesses will feel that
 
04:23:24.290 --> 04:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
the risk of letting people go and not
 
04:23:26.330 --> 04:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
being able to rehire is greater than
 
04:23:29.510 --> 04:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
holding on to employees
 
04:23:31.250 --> 04:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
household Financial Obligations
 
04:23:33.590 --> 04:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
including debt are relatively Low by
 
04:23:35.210 --> 04:23:35.220 align:start position:0%
historical standards so we enter a
 
04:23:36.950 --> 04:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
weaker economy with households in a
 
04:23:38.990 --> 04:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
better position again with the caveat
 
04:23:40.969 --> 04:23:40.979 align:start position:0%
that lower income households have had to
 
04:23:43.849 --> 04:23:43.859 align:start position:0%
borrow if you look at credit usage it's
 
04:23:46.130 --> 04:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
up much more at lower income households
 
04:23:48.349 --> 04:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
and it is in upper middle and upper
 
04:23:50.990 --> 04:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
income households corporate debt is also
 
04:23:52.610 --> 04:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
low banks are well capitalized and
 
04:23:56.630 --> 04:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
recessions are often really exacerbated
 
04:23:58.849 --> 04:23:58.859 align:start position:0%
when when banks are weakened and and
 
04:24:02.090 --> 04:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
very much more reluctant or able to lend
 
04:24:05.090 --> 04:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
credit is is the fuel for economic
 
04:24:07.550 --> 04:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
growth we do know that consumer spending
 
04:24:10.550 --> 04:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
is slowing and likely will continue to
 
04:24:13.250 --> 04:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
slow but it's still positive year over
 
04:24:16.250 --> 04:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
year and without
 
04:24:19.790 --> 04:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
layoffs in large numbers that means
 
04:24:22.969 --> 04:24:22.979 align:start position:0%
incomes will stay will keep from falling
 
04:24:27.229 --> 04:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
in in free fall and without that it's
 
04:24:29.570 --> 04:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
very hard to see a recession on the
 
04:24:31.729 --> 04:24:31.739 align:start position:0%
horizon if consumers can still spend and
 
04:24:33.950 --> 04:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
businesses aren't laying off in Mass we
 
04:24:35.990 --> 04:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
believe it becomes very difficult for
 
04:24:38.090 --> 04:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
the for the US economy to fall into
 
04:24:41.090 --> 04:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
recession so that's the scenario let's
 
04:24:43.849 --> 04:24:43.859 align:start position:0%
take a look at some of the backup of
 
04:24:46.910 --> 04:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
that because that's a lot of words
 
04:24:49.670 --> 04:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
one thing that we are that we do know is
 
04:24:52.370 --> 04:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
that people are not very optimistic and
 
04:24:54.889 --> 04:24:54.899 align:start position:0%
recessions are fundamentally about a
 
04:24:56.929 --> 04:24:56.939 align:start position:0%
loss of confidence so when businesses
 
04:24:59.330 --> 04:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
aren't confident about the economy they
 
04:25:02.330 --> 04:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
don't hire typically when they're very
 
04:25:03.889 --> 04:25:03.899 align:start position:0%
concerned about the economy or the
 
04:25:05.330 --> 04:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
economy starts they lay off we don't
 
04:25:06.469 --> 04:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
think the layoffs are going to come
 
04:25:08.090 --> 04:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
they'll come but they won't come in
 
04:25:10.550 --> 04:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
large as large in numbers so businesses
 
04:25:14.389 --> 04:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
aren't hiring and consumers are very
 
04:25:17.030 --> 04:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
concerned as they at least indicate they
 
04:25:19.010 --> 04:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
are this is a universe the blue line is
 
04:25:20.330 --> 04:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
University of Michigan consumer
 
04:25:22.370 --> 04:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
sentiment index so one that I favor
 
04:25:24.349 --> 04:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
generally does a better job than the
 
04:25:26.929 --> 04:25:26.939 align:start position:0%
consumer confidence survey in assessing
 
04:25:28.790 --> 04:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
how individual households feel about
 
04:25:30.950 --> 04:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
their financial circumstances
 
04:25:33.849 --> 04:25:33.859 align:start position:0%
the problem is is that over the last
 
04:25:36.050 --> 04:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
year or more
 
04:25:38.630 --> 04:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that households have
 
04:25:40.130 --> 04:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
indicated that they're not very
 
04:25:43.010 --> 04:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
confident they've still spent so there's
 
04:25:45.950 --> 04:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
been a bigger Gap in what they say or
 
04:25:47.809 --> 04:25:47.819 align:start position:0%
how they feel about the economy and
 
04:25:49.910 --> 04:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
what's they're actually doing in this
 
04:25:49.920 --> 04:25:51.769 align:start position:0%
what's they're actually doing in this
economy

04:25:51.769 --> 04:25:51.779 align:start position:0%
economy
 
04:25:54.649 --> 04:25:54.659 align:start position:0%
so our concern has been and you see it
 
04:25:57.170 --> 04:25:57.180 align:start position:0%
all the time CEOs
 
04:25:58.670 --> 04:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
saying there's going to be a recession
 
04:26:01.189 --> 04:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
some big Bank CEO saying we're headed
 
04:26:04.550 --> 04:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
for a recession or some billionaire who
 
04:26:06.889 --> 04:26:06.899 align:start position:0%
runs the electric vehicle company says
 
04:26:08.870 --> 04:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
we're definitely going down you know
 
04:26:10.610 --> 04:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
falling off a cliff it becomes
 
04:26:13.130 --> 04:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
problematic and people believe that and
 
04:26:15.290 --> 04:26:15.300 align:start position:0%
if they believe that then they become
 
04:26:17.809 --> 04:26:17.819 align:start position:0%
pessimists they can and start cutting
 
04:26:19.969 --> 04:26:19.979 align:start position:0%
back so I did mention the household
 
04:26:21.889 --> 04:26:21.899 align:start position:0%
Financial Obligations ratio what's that
 
04:26:23.450 --> 04:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
that's the the things that households
 
04:26:24.649 --> 04:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
have to pay
 
04:26:27.410 --> 04:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
mortgages rents Etc
 
04:26:31.010 --> 04:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
insurance payments as a percentage of
 
04:26:32.990 --> 04:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
their disposable income and what you see
 
04:26:36.530 --> 04:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
here is that these shaded areas are
 
04:26:39.170 --> 04:26:39.180 align:start position:0%
periods of recession
 
04:26:42.349 --> 04:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
right now as of the third quarter
 
04:26:45.710 --> 04:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
We Begin any slowdown in a much better
 
04:26:49.189 --> 04:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
position than than we have been heading
 
04:26:53.389 --> 04:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
into prior recessions and again caveat
 
04:26:55.969 --> 04:26:55.979 align:start position:0%
lower income households much different
 
04:26:59.269 --> 04:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
circumstance and it is rising as you see
 
04:27:01.429 --> 04:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
there and I expect it will rise but at
 
04:27:03.889 --> 04:27:03.899 align:start position:0%
least we begin a period where the
 
04:27:07.429 --> 04:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:10.790 --> 04:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned that inflation is heading down
 
04:27:14.990 --> 04:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
this is probably the most optimistic and
 
04:27:16.849 --> 04:27:16.859 align:start position:0%
if you look at the most recent three
 
04:27:18.950 --> 04:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
months or so and annualize that
 
04:27:21.229 --> 04:27:21.239 align:start position:0%
inflation would be about three and a
 
04:27:24.769 --> 04:27:24.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:28.070 --> 04:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative plett yeah that sounds
 
04:27:30.830 --> 04:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
better in my view than it is isn't it
 
04:27:32.870 --> 04:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
true that you had a hundred ten percent
 
04:27:35.630 --> 04:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
inflation a year ago that's 1.1 times
 
04:27:37.910 --> 04:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
safer than costs you have five percent
 
04:27:40.969 --> 04:27:40.979 align:start position:0%
inflation this year that's another 1.05
 
04:27:43.849 --> 04:27:43.859 align:start position:0%
so you compound them is that your
 
04:27:45.950 --> 04:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
understanding it
 
04:27:48.410 --> 04:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
clearly prices are much higher yeah but
 
04:27:51.110 --> 04:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
they keep going up so it doesn't unless
 
04:27:52.370 --> 04:27:52.380 align:start position:0%
the deflation they don't go back
 
04:27:54.050 --> 04:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
absolutely and some things are are
 
04:27:56.990 --> 04:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
beginning to deflate the the
 
04:28:00.410 --> 04:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
prices do generally always rise
 
04:28:02.809 --> 04:28:02.819 align:start position:0%
so we expect that and there there's a
 
04:28:04.670 --> 04:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
compounding effect
 
04:28:08.929 --> 04:28:08.939 align:start position:0%
inflation peaked at I believe 9.5 we're
 
04:28:10.309 --> 04:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
now down
 
04:28:10.319 --> 04:28:11.349 align:start position:0%
now down
to

04:28:11.349 --> 04:28:11.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:28:15.290 --> 04:28:15.300 align:start position:0%
6.5 and if you look at the last three
 
04:28:17.389 --> 04:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
months an annualized ad it's somewhere
 
04:28:19.969 --> 04:28:19.979 align:start position:0%
over three and a half percent I do
 
04:28:22.550 --> 04:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
believe that by the end of 2023 we'll be
 
04:28:25.490 --> 04:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
under four percent on a on a
 
04:28:28.130 --> 04:28:28.140 align:start position:0%
year-over-year basis so it's clearly
 
04:28:30.769 --> 04:28:30.779 align:start position:0%
much higher than we would like higher
 
04:28:34.370 --> 04:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
prices are not good but what inflation
 
04:28:39.250 --> 04:28:39.260 align:start position:0%
is is a constant acceleration of of
 
04:28:41.630 --> 04:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
prices and we're not seeing that we're
 
04:28:44.990 --> 04:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
starting to see the a decline
 
04:28:47.570 --> 04:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
and this just has the Northeast as well
 
04:28:49.550 --> 04:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
as the U.S Northeast is a little bit
 
04:28:52.490 --> 04:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
lower a couple of reasons for that one I
 
04:28:54.769 --> 04:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
think Believe It or Not housing prices
 
04:28:56.929 --> 04:28:56.939 align:start position:0%
and shelter prices are a little bit
 
04:28:59.030 --> 04:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
lower in the Northeast not lower but
 
04:29:00.110 --> 04:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
they haven't risen as much because
 
04:29:02.510 --> 04:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
population hasn't grown places some
 
04:29:05.870 --> 04:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
places in the west Boise Idaho
 
04:29:09.530 --> 04:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
has had the fastest shelter rise in
 
04:29:11.689 --> 04:29:11.699 align:start position:0%
shelter costs one year it was almost 30
 
04:29:15.050 --> 04:29:15.060 align:start position:0%
percent so so for places so places where
 
04:29:17.750 --> 04:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
there's been a big population growth Etc
 
04:29:19.849 --> 04:29:19.859 align:start position:0%
um have have had seen the biggest so and
 
04:29:22.130 --> 04:29:22.140 align:start position:0%
that's again 32 percent of the CPI
 
04:29:24.410 --> 04:29:24.420 align:start position:0%
that's played so also gasoline prices
 
04:29:26.809 --> 04:29:26.819 align:start position:0%
High everywhere Northeast we tend to
 
04:29:28.670 --> 04:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
drive a little bit less we don't have as
 
04:29:31.130 --> 04:29:31.140 align:start position:0%
far to go so that plays into it as well
 
04:29:34.610 --> 04:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:34.620 --> 04:29:36.250 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:29:36.250 --> 04:29:36.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:29:38.030 --> 04:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
retail sales
 
04:29:40.130 --> 04:29:40.140 align:start position:0%
somebody's calling me on something I
 
04:29:45.110 --> 04:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:45.120 --> 04:29:46.189 align:start position:0%
 
Phil

04:29:46.189 --> 04:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
Phil
 
04:29:48.530 --> 04:29:48.540 align:start position:0%
wants to disagree
 
04:29:51.530 --> 04:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
um I mentioned I mentioned that retail
 
04:29:54.469 --> 04:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
sales have um they're slowing this is I
 
04:29:56.389 --> 04:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
should have I didn't put the title in
 
04:29:58.130 --> 04:29:58.140 align:start position:0%
here but that's year-over-year increase
 
04:30:00.170 --> 04:30:00.180 align:start position:0%
in retail sales some of this obviously
 
04:30:03.050 --> 04:30:03.060 align:start position:0%
has to do with Rises and prices but it
 
04:30:04.370 --> 04:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
is still
 
04:30:06.830 --> 04:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
positive year over year so while there's
 
04:30:08.510 --> 04:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
a slowing and there's two lines there
 
04:30:11.389 --> 04:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
one is the total retail sales blue the
 
04:30:13.910 --> 04:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
orange line is retail sales excluding
 
04:30:15.830 --> 04:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
automobiles automobiles have been a drag
 
04:30:18.349 --> 04:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
on retail sales why because there hasn't
 
04:30:20.990 --> 04:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
been much in the way of inventory now as
 
04:30:22.610 --> 04:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
interest rates rise that will put up
 
04:30:25.610 --> 04:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
probably a further damper on on on sales
 
04:30:28.269 --> 04:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
of automobiles but still it's positive
 
04:30:31.309 --> 04:30:31.319 align:start position:0%
expect it will it will slow somewhat
 
04:30:31.319 --> 04:30:32.689 align:start position:0%
expect it will it will slow somewhat
more

04:30:32.689 --> 04:30:32.699 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:30:34.790 --> 04:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
this chart I love
 
04:30:36.349 --> 04:30:36.359 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that we try to do
 
04:30:40.429 --> 04:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
is get unique data for New Hampshire and
 
04:30:41.990 --> 04:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we've done in the
 
04:30:44.030 --> 04:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic is try to get very high
 
04:30:46.309 --> 04:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
frequency timely data this data it comes
 
04:30:48.590 --> 04:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
from open table which is a company that
 
04:30:52.010 --> 04:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
takes restaurant reservations in every
 
04:30:56.389 --> 04:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
state and this is a daily metric of the
 
04:30:58.969 --> 04:30:58.979 align:start position:0%
number of seeded restaurant it can be
 
04:31:00.530 --> 04:31:00.540 align:start position:0%
walk-ins or it could be reservations
 
04:31:03.170 --> 04:31:03.180 align:start position:0%
that are made of the same group of
 
04:31:06.590 --> 04:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
restaurants and it compares the current
 
04:31:10.070 --> 04:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
date number of reservations with the
 
04:31:13.370 --> 04:31:13.380 align:start position:0%
same date in 2019 so pre-pandemic versus
 
04:31:16.630 --> 04:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
current and what you see is
 
04:31:21.250 --> 04:31:21.260 align:start position:0%
relatively early December of 2020 early
 
04:31:24.050 --> 04:31:24.060 align:start position:0%
2021 you know restaurant reservations
 
04:31:25.969 --> 04:31:25.979 align:start position:0%
restaurants were closed people were
 
04:31:28.490 --> 04:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
reluctant to do it 60 or more it has
 
04:31:28.500 --> 04:31:29.570 align:start position:0%
reluctant to do it 60 or more it has
recovered

04:31:29.570 --> 04:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
recovered
 
04:31:32.149 --> 04:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
and interestingly New Hampshire is well
 
04:31:35.330 --> 04:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
above where it was in 2019. why is this
 
04:31:38.630 --> 04:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
important because in a real downturn one
 
04:31:40.670 --> 04:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
of the first things that people cut back
 
04:31:42.649 --> 04:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
on is dining out
 
04:31:44.030 --> 04:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
you know when you're when they're
 
04:31:45.590 --> 04:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
looking to cut back they cut back on
 
04:31:45.600 --> 04:31:47.149 align:start position:0%
looking to cut back they cut back on
clearly

04:31:47.149 --> 04:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
04:31:49.250 --> 04:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
um that hasn't yet been the case in New
 
04:31:51.530 --> 04:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so people in New Hampshire
 
04:31:53.809 --> 04:31:53.819 align:start position:0%
um are are still spending at a fairly
 
04:31:55.729 --> 04:31:55.739 align:start position:0%
good clip one of the charts that we
 
04:31:57.530 --> 04:31:57.540 align:start position:0%
didn't include here is
 
04:32:00.530 --> 04:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
um assessment of the number of Google
 
04:32:02.990 --> 04:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
searches on the word recession which
 
04:32:04.729 --> 04:32:04.739 align:start position:0%
tends to correlate pretty well with
 
04:32:07.130 --> 04:32:07.140 align:start position:0%
people's confidence level New Hampshire
 
04:32:09.170 --> 04:32:09.180 align:start position:0%
is a little bit better than the U.S and
 
04:32:11.809 --> 04:32:11.819 align:start position:0%
this data also indicates that and what
 
04:32:13.670 --> 04:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
we're constantly looking for real-time
 
04:32:16.189 --> 04:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
indicators we we can't look at
 
04:32:17.990 --> 04:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
indicators that are a month or two
 
04:32:20.090 --> 04:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
months or six months old and really have
 
04:32:21.889 --> 04:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
a sense of where we are and where we're
 
04:32:24.170 --> 04:32:24.180 align:start position:0%
going in the near term
 
04:32:26.269 --> 04:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
um I know you heard from uh Dr Ken
 
04:32:26.279 --> 04:32:27.290 align:start position:0%
um I know you heard from uh Dr Ken
Johnson

04:32:27.290 --> 04:32:27.300 align:start position:0%
Johnson
 
04:32:30.370 --> 04:32:30.380 align:start position:0%
I don't know exactly what he said
 
04:32:33.710 --> 04:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
I have generally heard him suggest that
 
04:32:35.630 --> 04:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire isn't quite in the
 
04:32:38.030 --> 04:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
negative as bad in demographic State as
 
04:32:40.250 --> 04:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
some people would argue I've argued that
 
04:32:43.729 --> 04:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
for almost two decades now we had a
 
04:32:45.469 --> 04:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
period where we had net out migration
 
04:32:47.450 --> 04:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons it has picked up
 
04:32:49.969 --> 04:32:49.979 align:start position:0%
again net domestic in migration people
 
04:32:51.590 --> 04:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
move wanted to move to New Hampshire
 
04:32:53.389 --> 04:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
that accelerated a bit during the
 
04:32:56.149 --> 04:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic and it did so because people
 
04:32:58.670 --> 04:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to get away from more densely
 
04:33:00.590 --> 04:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
populated areas there's a lot of them in
 
04:33:02.809 --> 04:33:02.819 align:start position:0%
the Northeast they had remote work
 
04:33:05.269 --> 04:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
opportunities that helped one of the
 
04:33:06.890 --> 04:33:06.900 align:start position:0%
constraints that we face
 
04:33:09.410 --> 04:33:09.420 align:start position:0%
it's a really positive demographic for
 
04:33:11.390 --> 04:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
us really helps us address our
 
04:33:13.250 --> 04:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
demographic issues because New
 
04:33:15.830 --> 04:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's labor force grows largely by
 
04:33:15.840 --> 04:33:17.209 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's labor force grows largely by
in-migration

04:33:17.209 --> 04:33:17.219 align:start position:0%
in-migration
 
04:33:18.650 --> 04:33:18.660 align:start position:0%
so when more people are moving here
 
04:33:21.349 --> 04:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
that's good the constraint that we have
 
04:33:24.769 --> 04:33:24.779 align:start position:0%
is the availability of Housing and that
 
04:33:26.631 --> 04:33:26.641 align:start position:0%
acts as I think that's one of the
 
04:33:28.849 --> 04:33:28.859 align:start position:0%
reasons why this most recent year was a
 
04:33:30.349 --> 04:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
little bit lower
 
04:33:33.109 --> 04:33:33.119 align:start position:0%
beyond that when we look at who's moving
 
04:33:33.119 --> 04:33:35.330 align:start position:0%
beyond that when we look at who's moving
here

04:33:35.330 --> 04:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:33:38.750 --> 04:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
Vermont and Maine each saw net domestic
 
04:33:40.789 --> 04:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
immigration Vermont had lost people for
 
04:33:43.010 --> 04:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
10 years to other states
 
04:33:45.109 --> 04:33:45.119 align:start position:0%
the most recent couple of years it's
 
04:33:47.510 --> 04:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
actually seen in migration Maine has
 
04:33:49.369 --> 04:33:49.379 align:start position:0%
seen a little bit higher net in
 
04:33:52.010 --> 04:33:52.020 align:start position:0%
migration than New Hampshire but New
 
04:33:54.349 --> 04:33:54.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire benefits because our
 
04:33:56.269 --> 04:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
demographics of those who move into the
 
04:33:57.709 --> 04:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
state are a little bit different it's
 
04:33:59.510 --> 04:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
trending younger
 
04:34:01.970 --> 04:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
we see here the percentage of
 
04:34:04.029 --> 04:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
individuals who move to New Hampshire
 
04:34:06.830 --> 04:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
adults not counting college students
 
04:34:09.051 --> 04:34:09.061 align:start position:0%
because people under 25 move from state
 
04:34:10.070 --> 04:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
to state
 
04:34:11.631 --> 04:34:11.641 align:start position:0%
go to college
 
04:34:13.849 --> 04:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
forget about them think about people age
 
04:34:15.590 --> 04:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
25 and above
 
04:34:18.949 --> 04:34:18.959 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has by far the the largest
 
04:34:23.029 --> 04:34:23.039 align:start position:0%
percentage of people ages 25 to 34 in
 
04:34:25.250 --> 04:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
that group almost half the people adults
 
04:34:27.170 --> 04:34:27.180 align:start position:0%
who have moved to New Hampshire and who
 
04:34:31.789 --> 04:34:31.799 align:start position:0%
are 25 and above are age 25 to 34 and a
 
04:34:33.650 --> 04:34:33.660 align:start position:0%
smaller percentage of of older residents
 
04:34:35.810 --> 04:34:35.820 align:start position:0%
made under contrast more people but in
 
04:34:38.449 --> 04:34:38.459 align:start position:0%
older demographic
 
04:34:40.189 --> 04:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
even better news
 
04:34:42.769 --> 04:34:42.779 align:start position:0%
for our long-term demographics
 
04:34:45.590 --> 04:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
is the percentage New Hampshire had this
 
04:34:47.869 --> 04:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
the fifth largest percentage increase in
 
04:34:50.631 --> 04:34:50.641 align:start position:0%
population of 25 to 29 year olds of any
 
04:34:54.051 --> 04:34:54.061 align:start position:0%
state in the nation between 2015 and
 
04:34:54.061 --> 04:34:55.970 align:start position:0%
state in the nation between 2015 and
2021.

04:34:55.970 --> 04:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
2021.
 
04:34:58.910 --> 04:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
that is quite a surprise
 
04:35:03.769 --> 04:35:03.779 align:start position:0%
we had always been attractive to sort of
 
04:35:06.769 --> 04:35:06.779 align:start position:0%
early career married couple families
 
04:35:08.109 --> 04:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
with children
 
04:35:10.730 --> 04:35:10.740 align:start position:0%
we attracted a lot of individuals from
 
04:35:12.830 --> 04:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
the Northeast and that cat in that age
 
04:35:16.689 --> 04:35:16.699 align:start position:0%
group increasingly we're seeing it
 
04:35:22.010 --> 04:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
an uptick in 25 29 25 to 34 year olds
 
04:35:24.289 --> 04:35:24.299 align:start position:0%
moving into the state and if I looked at
 
04:35:28.070 --> 04:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
one year earlier 2014 to 2020 when we're
 
04:35:30.109 --> 04:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
actually the second highest but I did
 
04:35:31.670 --> 04:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
not want to cherry pick the data because
 
04:35:34.310 --> 04:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
I looked at that after the fact so but I
 
04:35:35.810 --> 04:35:35.820 align:start position:0%
did cherry pick because I wanted to
 
04:35:38.990 --> 04:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
mention it but that's very very positive
 
04:35:41.209 --> 04:35:41.219 align:start position:0%
but the the importance of this is that
 
04:35:43.369 --> 04:35:43.379 align:start position:0%
you know you hear a narrative that New
 
04:35:45.470 --> 04:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has one foot in the grave that
 
04:35:47.570 --> 04:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
we're the oldest state we're not by
 
04:35:49.910 --> 04:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
median age and we have a higher median
 
04:35:52.670 --> 04:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
age for one important reason we have
 
04:35:55.250 --> 04:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
very low birth rates either New
 
04:35:57.529 --> 04:35:57.539 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or Vermont historically have
 
04:36:00.170 --> 04:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
the lowest birth rates in the nation
 
04:36:02.209 --> 04:36:02.219 align:start position:0%
and the easiest way to keep your median
 
04:36:05.570 --> 04:36:05.580 align:start position:0%
age from rising or keep it low is to add
 
04:36:08.209 --> 04:36:08.219 align:start position:0%
people at age zero and we do not do that
 
04:36:10.070 --> 04:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
so we rely on people moving into the
 
04:36:11.929 --> 04:36:11.939 align:start position:0%
state these demographics that I'm
 
04:36:14.810 --> 04:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
talking about rise of the increase in 25
 
04:36:17.209 --> 04:36:17.219 align:start position:0%
to 29 year olds that a migration of
 
04:36:20.750 --> 04:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
younger demographic will help
 
04:36:23.209 --> 04:36:23.219 align:start position:0%
it won't keep us from aging but it'll
 
04:36:26.150 --> 04:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
help slow that increase in the median
 
04:36:29.150 --> 04:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
age of our state
 
04:36:31.070 --> 04:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
I did mention that we are in the
 
04:36:34.010 --> 04:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
minority when it comes to assessing the
 
04:36:35.990 --> 04:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
probability of recession this just came
 
04:36:36.000 --> 04:36:36.830 align:start position:0%
probability of recession this just came
out

04:36:36.830 --> 04:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:36:39.470 --> 04:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
today I believe maybe yeah it was today
 
04:36:42.410 --> 04:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
the latest economic survey of economists
 
04:36:43.910 --> 04:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
from The Wall Street Journal they survey
 
04:36:47.209 --> 04:36:47.219 align:start position:0%
71 economists for their probability of
 
04:36:49.849 --> 04:36:49.859 align:start position:0%
recession the mean probability and it
 
04:36:51.470 --> 04:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
varied quite a bit
 
04:36:53.990 --> 04:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
is 61 percent
 
04:36:57.349 --> 04:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
so so majority of economists believe
 
04:37:00.230 --> 04:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
that the U.S economy is headed for
 
04:37:00.240 --> 04:37:01.789 align:start position:0%
that the U.S economy is headed for
recession

04:37:01.789 --> 04:37:01.799 align:start position:0%
recession
 
04:37:03.769 --> 04:37:03.779 align:start position:0%
um it had it notice at the end there it
 
04:37:04.910 --> 04:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
has come down a little bit and that's
 
04:37:06.650 --> 04:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
because we're getting a little bit more
 
04:37:06.660 --> 04:37:08.029 align:start position:0%
because we're getting a little bit more
positive

04:37:08.029 --> 04:37:08.039 align:start position:0%
positive
 
04:37:10.730 --> 04:37:10.740 align:start position:0%
um economic news
 
04:37:12.650 --> 04:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
so last slide
 
04:37:14.390 --> 04:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
what do we think is going to happen I
 
04:37:17.830 --> 04:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
will say this is our job growth forecast
 
04:37:20.570 --> 04:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
2022 we think we'll be around 2.7
 
04:37:23.289 --> 04:37:23.299 align:start position:0%
percent that will change we'll we have
 
04:37:25.730 --> 04:37:25.740 align:start position:0%
estimated numbers now it will change
 
04:37:27.470 --> 04:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
based on
 
04:37:27.480 --> 04:37:28.070 align:start position:0%
based on
um

04:37:28.070 --> 04:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:30.830 --> 04:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
a benchmarking process that matches our
 
04:37:33.650 --> 04:37:33.660 align:start position:0%
records for employers that they that
 
04:37:35.810 --> 04:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
submit to us the number of employees and
 
04:37:38.449 --> 04:37:38.459 align:start position:0%
their wages once we match that up or the
 
04:37:39.949 --> 04:37:39.959 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Labor statistic will have a
 
04:37:41.929 --> 04:37:41.939 align:start position:0%
better more accurate number but it'll be
 
04:37:43.250 --> 04:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
somewhere around there
 
04:37:45.949 --> 04:37:45.959 align:start position:0%
moving forward our forecast is that New
 
04:37:47.449 --> 04:37:47.459 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will have somewhat under one
 
04:37:49.910 --> 04:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
percent employment growth that will vary
 
04:37:51.830 --> 04:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
also once we get the Benchmark numbers
 
04:37:54.709 --> 04:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
that forecast will likely change we
 
04:37:56.929 --> 04:37:56.939 align:start position:0%
think we'll be a little bit slower
 
04:37:59.109 --> 04:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
than the
 
04:38:01.670 --> 04:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
U.S and that's not because we have a
 
04:38:05.449 --> 04:38:05.459 align:start position:0%
weaker economy it's because we have we
 
04:38:07.789 --> 04:38:07.799 align:start position:0%
are more labor constrained and I did I
 
04:38:09.529 --> 04:38:09.539 align:start position:0%
wanted to go back to one slide because
 
04:38:14.750 --> 04:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
we I thought we had talked about the
 
04:38:14.760 --> 04:38:16.670 align:start position:0%
we I thought we had talked about the
yeah

04:38:16.670 --> 04:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:38:24.051 --> 04:38:24.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:27.890 --> 04:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
so this is just a a chart that looks at
 
04:38:30.709 --> 04:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
we showed you this once before the job
 
04:38:34.490 --> 04:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
openings rate which is very high has
 
04:38:35.810 --> 04:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
been a little bit higher than the US
 
04:38:38.390 --> 04:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
it's right around the U.S now but very
 
04:38:39.650 --> 04:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
high compared to where it has
 
04:38:42.529 --> 04:38:42.539 align:start position:0%
historically been and the job job
 
04:38:44.929 --> 04:38:44.939 align:start position:0%
openings and the job higher rate so the
 
04:38:46.429 --> 04:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
difference between the number of
 
04:38:50.390 --> 04:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
openings and the hirings is what we call
 
04:38:52.490 --> 04:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
the unfilled job openings rate and you
 
04:38:55.070 --> 04:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
see how much it's jumped it's still
 
04:38:58.369 --> 04:38:58.379 align:start position:0%
extremely elevated so there's still lots
 
04:39:00.650 --> 04:39:00.660 align:start position:0%
of opportunity out there there's lots of
 
04:39:03.830 --> 04:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
jobs there aren't enough individuals New
 
04:39:05.510 --> 04:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is more labor constrained
 
04:39:07.551 --> 04:39:07.561 align:start position:0%
going back again to the labor force
 
04:39:08.990 --> 04:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
growth we're still about one percent
 
04:39:11.330 --> 04:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
below where we were prior to the
 
04:39:13.070 --> 04:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic and number of people in the
 
04:39:15.650 --> 04:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
labor force the U.S is just about back
 
04:39:18.109 --> 04:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
to where they were prior to the pandemic
 
04:39:19.730 --> 04:39:19.740 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
04:39:22.310 --> 04:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
I'll stop
 
04:39:23.631 --> 04:39:23.641 align:start position:0%
thank you that was a lot of good
 
04:39:26.029 --> 04:39:26.039 align:start position:0%
information do we have any questions uh
 
04:39:28.070 --> 04:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
04:39:31.189 --> 04:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
um one question I have is do you have
 
04:39:34.250 --> 04:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
any information on how many residents of
 
04:39:37.250 --> 04:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are employed
 
04:39:39.948 --> 04:39:39.958 align:start position:0%
out of state I know some of them are
 
04:39:44.090 --> 04:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
commuting to to Massachusetts mostly and
 
04:39:45.948 --> 04:39:45.958 align:start position:0%
then some of them might just be working
 
04:39:48.050 --> 04:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
for companies that you know they're
 
04:39:57.368 --> 04:39:57.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:59.810 --> 04:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
Brian can address uh some of the remote
 
04:40:02.270 --> 04:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
work piece but historically
 
04:40:05.270 --> 04:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
um we have about 120 000 people
 
04:40:07.310 --> 04:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
um that live in New Hampshire
 
04:40:09.410 --> 04:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
um that are are commuting out we have
 
04:40:11.448 --> 04:40:11.458 align:start position:0%
another 80 000 that are commute that
 
04:40:13.010 --> 04:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
live outside New Hampshire that are
 
04:40:16.250 --> 04:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
commuting in so we tend we are we have a
 
04:40:21.470 --> 04:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
net uh gain with uh two uh neighbors to
 
04:40:23.990 --> 04:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
the uh East and the West with Maine and
 
04:40:27.410 --> 04:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
Vermont we actually draw in more workers
 
04:40:29.150 --> 04:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
from those States than New Hampshire
 
04:40:31.270 --> 04:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
sees leave to go work in those States
 
04:40:33.530 --> 04:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
but we have a net loss with
 
04:40:33.540 --> 04:40:35.030 align:start position:0%
but we have a net loss with
Massachusetts

04:40:35.030 --> 04:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
04:40:37.610 --> 04:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
um that's and that's historically
 
04:40:39.890 --> 04:40:39.900 align:start position:0%
um what we what we've been seeing but on
 
04:40:41.868 --> 04:40:41.878 align:start position:0%
the on the remote work side
 
04:40:45.590 --> 04:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
yeah we don't have a uh a hard measure
 
04:40:47.330 --> 04:40:47.340 align:start position:0%
of the number of people who work
 
04:40:49.490 --> 04:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
remotely we have it
 
04:40:52.250 --> 04:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
I will say that U.S Bureau of Labor
 
04:40:54.770 --> 04:40:54.780 align:start position:0%
Statistics is working is now
 
04:40:58.130 --> 04:40:58.140 align:start position:0%
beginning to ask workers on their
 
04:41:00.410 --> 04:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
monthly survey which is the basis of the
 
04:41:02.208 --> 04:41:02.218 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate and labor force
 
04:41:05.448 --> 04:41:05.458 align:start position:0%
numbers is beginning to ask people who
 
04:41:08.690 --> 04:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
they survey about their remote work they
 
04:41:10.190 --> 04:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
had been doing that in the pandemic but
 
04:41:12.350 --> 04:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
they were asking the question in a way
 
04:41:12.360 --> 04:41:13.910 align:start position:0%
they were asking the question in a way
that

04:41:13.910 --> 04:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:41:15.708 --> 04:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
they specifically said are you working
 
04:41:18.708 --> 04:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
remote because of the pandemic and now
 
04:41:20.810 --> 04:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
we're not really if there is such a
 
04:41:22.970 --> 04:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
thing as a post-pandemic world
 
04:41:25.010 --> 04:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of reasons why people
 
04:41:26.690 --> 04:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
are working remotely and that will be
 
04:41:28.910 --> 04:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
permanently we do have speaking of high
 
04:41:32.030 --> 04:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
frequency metrics and this unfortunately
 
04:41:34.610 --> 04:41:34.620 align:start position:0%
stopped about a month and a half ago we
 
04:41:37.670 --> 04:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
were looking at Google Mobility data
 
04:41:40.610 --> 04:41:40.620 align:start position:0%
Google tracks all of us if you leave
 
04:41:43.430 --> 04:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
your location on I don't but it tracks
 
04:41:46.670 --> 04:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
where we go and it so it was listing by
 
04:41:49.990 --> 04:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
state and by County actually
 
04:41:53.570 --> 04:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
how many trips were made to workplaces
 
04:41:56.690 --> 04:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
versus again pre-pandemic numbers I've
 
04:41:58.368 --> 04:41:58.378 align:start position:0%
tracked that all the way through about
 
04:42:02.570 --> 04:42:02.580 align:start position:0%
November of this year of 2022 past year
 
04:42:04.670 --> 04:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire was down somewhere
 
04:42:08.448 --> 04:42:08.458 align:start position:0%
between 15 and 20 percent so that gives
 
04:42:10.730 --> 04:42:10.740 align:start position:0%
us an indication not that people are
 
04:42:13.070 --> 04:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
working remotely all the time but on a
 
04:42:14.270 --> 04:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
daily basis
 
04:42:18.110 --> 04:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
about 15 to 20 percent fewer trips to
 
04:42:20.750 --> 04:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
workplaces were being made so that tells
 
04:42:25.128 --> 04:42:25.138 align:start position:0%
you that remote work hybrid work is here
 
04:42:28.150 --> 04:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
to stay but it does not tell us whether
 
04:42:30.288 --> 04:42:30.298 align:start position:0%
necessarily those are New Hampshire
 
04:42:32.810 --> 04:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
workers or whether those are you know
 
04:42:35.150 --> 04:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
our workers from other state so
 
04:42:36.948 --> 04:42:36.958 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll have some better
 
04:42:38.990 --> 04:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
information on that but we're estimating
 
04:42:40.368 --> 04:42:40.378 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be somewhere around
 
04:42:44.030 --> 04:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
15 and or a little bit higher people who
 
04:42:47.628 --> 04:42:47.638 align:start position:0%
work remotely and likely we're going to
 
04:42:49.990 --> 04:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
see more of what you refer to
 
04:42:52.368 --> 04:42:52.378 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire is an attractive
 
04:42:55.788 --> 04:42:55.798 align:start position:0%
place to live unfortunately the Greater
 
04:42:57.708 --> 04:42:57.718 align:start position:0%
Boston metro area
 
04:43:01.610 --> 04:43:01.620 align:start position:0%
is pays a whole lot more for equivalent
 
04:43:03.948 --> 04:43:03.958 align:start position:0%
occupations so that's a draw and if you
 
04:43:07.190 --> 04:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:09.470 --> 04:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
um it you know it can be easy to do to
 
04:43:11.208 --> 04:43:11.218 align:start position:0%
to make that choice live in New
 
04:43:12.530 --> 04:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire work for a Massachusetts
 
04:43:12.540 --> 04:43:17.510 align:start position:0%
Hampshire work for a Massachusetts
company

04:43:17.510 --> 04:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:21.590 --> 04:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:24.530 --> 04:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
all set or you have one more okay oh
 
04:43:27.530 --> 04:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah representative fellows
 
04:43:27.540 --> 04:43:29.030 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah representative fellows
okay

04:43:29.030 --> 04:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:43:33.070 --> 04:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
another question so my other question is
 
04:43:36.708 --> 04:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
retail sales are are steady we're not
 
04:43:38.990 --> 04:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
losing anything in retail sales do you
 
04:43:41.448 --> 04:43:41.458 align:start position:0%
know how much of that is like things
 
04:43:43.550 --> 04:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
that are being ordered online from
 
04:43:47.150 --> 04:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
Amazon versus in our local stores
 
04:43:48.470 --> 04:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
we don't know that for New Hampshire
 
04:43:50.810 --> 04:43:50.820 align:start position:0%
particularly we do know that
 
04:43:53.690 --> 04:43:53.700 align:start position:0%
um you know the Department of Commerce
 
04:43:56.990 --> 04:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
does produce retail sales numbers but it
 
04:43:58.910 --> 04:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
also produces online retail sales
 
04:44:01.070 --> 04:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
numbers and that has been increasing
 
04:44:02.810 --> 04:44:02.820 align:start position:0%
increased the most and accelerated
 
04:44:05.150 --> 04:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic it was accelerating
 
04:44:07.970 --> 04:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic you know brick and
 
04:44:10.850 --> 04:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
mortar retail was starting to decline
 
04:44:13.610 --> 04:44:13.620 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic the pandem
 
04:44:16.670 --> 04:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
pandemic accelerated that and that's one
 
04:44:19.510 --> 04:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why you see those numbers
 
04:44:22.490 --> 04:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
employ retail employment numbers decline
 
04:44:25.550 --> 04:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
but it has it it the rate of increases
 
04:44:27.708 --> 04:44:27.718 align:start position:0%
slowed it just peaked during the
 
04:44:30.830 --> 04:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic because nobody was shopping at
 
04:44:33.368 --> 04:44:33.378 align:start position:0%
Brick and Mortar very few people
 
04:44:36.770 --> 04:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
given the choice were and there were
 
04:44:38.690 --> 04:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
fewer opportunities to do it in in brick
 
04:44:39.830 --> 04:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
and mortar
 
04:44:41.750 --> 04:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
yeah they're still going up they will
 
04:44:43.730 --> 04:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
likely continue to go up I don't think
 
04:44:46.128 --> 04:44:46.138 align:start position:0%
that's a trend that that we're likely to
 
04:44:50.750 --> 04:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
to um you know to see go away much like
 
04:44:52.970 --> 04:44:52.980 align:start position:0%
we're not going to see remote work go
 
04:44:55.190 --> 04:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
away that you know they'll settle in
 
04:44:57.050 --> 04:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
terms of the increase the rate of
 
04:45:00.350 --> 04:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
increase but we're not going to see a
 
04:45:00.360 --> 04:45:03.288 align:start position:0%
increase but we're not going to see a
reversal

04:45:03.288 --> 04:45:03.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:05.330 --> 04:45:05.340 align:start position:0%
and you see a lot of you'll see that's
 
04:45:07.670 --> 04:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
why you're seeing Maul you know a lot of
 
04:45:09.948 --> 04:45:09.958 align:start position:0%
empty stores and malls
 
04:45:12.288 --> 04:45:12.298 align:start position:0%
um and you know a whole lot of empty
 
04:45:15.350 --> 04:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:17.690 --> 04:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
sounds good any other last minute
 
04:45:17.700 --> 04:45:20.208 align:start position:0%
sounds good any other last minute
questions

04:45:20.208 --> 04:45:20.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:22.550 --> 04:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none thank you very much
 
04:45:27.190 --> 04:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:30.530 --> 04:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
so um we're done for today
 
04:45:32.570 --> 04:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
um as representative Sanborn had
 
04:45:34.490 --> 04:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
mentioned our next meeting will be on
 
04:45:34.500 --> 04:45:36.110 align:start position:0%
mentioned our next meeting will be on
Monday

04:45:36.110 --> 04:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
Monday
 
04:45:38.690 --> 04:45:38.700 align:start position:0%
and that'll come out in the calendar
 
04:45:40.730 --> 04:45:40.740 align:start position:0%
uh this week so you'll see the timing on
 
04:45:43.310 --> 04:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
that that'll be um
 
04:45:45.410 --> 04:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
those will be uh info those will be
 
04:45:47.270 --> 04:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
Revenue we'll be doing Revenue estimates
 
04:45:49.550 --> 04:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
on Monday and Wednesday and Tuesday will
 
04:45:56.330 --> 04:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:00.350 --> 04:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
questions so as far as you know are we
 
04:46:03.830 --> 04:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
not planning to exec on anything
 
04:46:07.610 --> 04:46:07.620 align:start position:0%
or uh as far as I know but I'm but
 
04:46:10.310 --> 04:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
um exec could happen at any time I know
 
04:46:13.250 --> 04:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
as of right now there was there was no
 
04:46:15.350 --> 04:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
rush but um
 
04:46:17.090 --> 04:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
I don't know do you have a what are your
 
04:46:17.100 --> 04:46:20.890 align:start position:0%
I don't know do you have a what are your
thoughts

04:46:20.890 --> 04:46:20.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:23.570 --> 04:46:23.580 align:start position:0%
turn your microphone
 
04:46:25.490 --> 04:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
the arrangement the way it's been set up
 
04:46:28.550 --> 04:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
is that the chair and the ranking decide
 
04:46:30.530 --> 04:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
together whether there's going to be an
 
04:46:30.540 --> 04:46:32.270 align:start position:0%
together whether there's going to be an
exec

04:46:32.270 --> 04:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
exec
 
04:46:35.868 --> 04:46:35.878 align:start position:0%
and I haven't heard anything yet either
 
04:46:38.810 --> 04:46:38.820 align:start position:0%
I would say the odds of it are are slim
 
04:46:41.448 --> 04:46:41.458 align:start position:0%
at this point representative Platt I
 
04:46:44.330 --> 04:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
would just urge executing as we go along
 
04:46:46.310 --> 04:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
my last committee Science and Technology
 
04:46:48.530 --> 04:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
went they waited to the end and they
 
04:46:51.410 --> 04:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
made awfully long but uh days
 
04:46:53.628 --> 04:46:53.638 align:start position:0%
legislatively so if we can exec them
 
04:46:55.670 --> 04:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
earlier to get them to through the
 
04:46:57.770 --> 04:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
speaker's office and onto the floor for
 
04:47:01.310 --> 04:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
disposition we're not jammed at the end
 
04:47:03.050 --> 04:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
and I think anything as as
 
04:47:05.510 --> 04:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative Almy mentioned the chair
 
04:47:10.550 --> 04:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
and she will will decide and
 
04:47:13.310 --> 04:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
I I think anything that's exact in the
 
04:47:15.288 --> 04:47:15.298 align:start position:0%
immediate future meaning next week would
 
04:47:17.090 --> 04:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
be something that pretty obviously
 
04:47:18.650 --> 04:47:18.660 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot of support on both
 
04:47:22.010 --> 04:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:25.128 --> 04:47:25.138 align:start position:0%
