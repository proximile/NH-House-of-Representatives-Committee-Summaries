00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.390 align:start position:0%
the one that made the motion
517

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
517
 
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:47.720 align:start position:0%

00:18:51.409 --> 00:18:51.419 align:start position:0%
19-0 vote and representative Mel Miller
 
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
was the one to make that motion so he
 
00:18:57.730 --> 00:18:57.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
we there was some question regarding the
 
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
553 Bill relative to school district

information on Personnel salaries
 
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
when there is no record of that bill
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
being taken so it's on our docket
 
00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
correctly here
 
00:19:15.289 --> 00:19:15.299 align:start position:0%
there's absolutely nothing in the file
 
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
whereas the other ones do show the roll
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
call votes in the in the file so we're
 
00:19:23.169 --> 00:19:23.179 align:start position:0%
good with those other two
 
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
so with that I'd like to start right at
 
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:29.220 align:start position:0%
the top today with HB 71 repealing at
 
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Education report
 
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:34.500 align:start position:0%

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
is there a motion
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
representative forward ought to pass
 
00:19:42.169 --> 00:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
represent Miler makes the second so we
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
have octopass on repealing a Department
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%

00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
I think we will promotion to this
 
00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:01.340 align:start position:0%
extreme that's so I think
 
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
you're Mike
 
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
literature yes do we um
 
00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
we're on 71 yep and so according to my
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
notes uh on
 
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure the date we did this
 
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
February 1st February 16th we we did
 
00:20:24.409 --> 00:20:24.419 align:start position:0%
consider an ought to pass that came out
 
00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:26.039 align:start position:0%
that failed
 
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
do we have to reconsider that ought to
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
pass let me look at it too
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
what was the date on that February what
 
00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.029 align:start position:0%
what was the date on that February what
um

00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:34.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
February 16th see the February 1st of
 
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
February 16th I don't know why I've got
 
00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.250 align:start position:0%
February 16th I don't know why I've got
both

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
I think we recently recessed it to 56 oh
 
00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:52.010 align:start position:0%

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:56.820 align:start position:0%

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
um HP 71 OTP
 
00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:04.860 align:start position:0%
dry but that's all been scratched out on
 
00:21:12.049 --> 00:21:12.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:12.059 --> 00:21:14.930 align:start position:0%

right
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
okay I don't have that on the sheet I
 
00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
would I would move to
 
00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.049 align:start position:0%
would I would move to
well

00:21:21.049 --> 00:21:21.059 align:start position:0%

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
representative's second Sam motion
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
motion made by represent cordelli second
 
00:25:24.169 --> 00:25:24.179 align:start position:0%
by Lucas
 
00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:26.220 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:30.059 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I I believe we had two
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh bills related to uh this topic uh the
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
other bill
 
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
um we retained I think it was 155.
 
00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.070 align:start position:0%
um we retained I think it was 155.
um

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
right we retained that one and uh
 
00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:49.799 align:start position:0%
wanted to move ahead with this one
 
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
um the uh houseboat 155 we retained so
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
that if anything happened to this one
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
along the way we had 155 in our back
 
00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.930 align:start position:0%
along the way we had 155 in our back
pocket

00:25:59.930 --> 00:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
pocket
 
00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:03.380 align:start position:0%
um this basically was
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
relative to The Surety bonds required
 
00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:10.100 align:start position:0%
for a career schools
 
00:26:14.029 --> 00:26:14.039 align:start position:0%
this was the recommendation of the
 
00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:15.730 align:start position:0%
this was the recommendation of the
department

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:15.740 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:26:20.529 --> 00:26:20.539 align:start position:0%
and the hope that it would allow
 
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
additional schools to have the necessary
 
00:26:31.149 --> 00:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
funds to uh get the surety bond and
 
00:26:33.769 --> 00:26:33.779 align:start position:0%
increase possibly in the future the
 
00:26:36.529 --> 00:26:36.539 align:start position:0%
number of career schools that will be
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
approved so that's the reason for the
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
ought to pass motion
 
00:26:45.409 --> 00:26:45.419 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
representative Miler yes I as we looked
 
00:26:51.289 --> 00:26:51.299 align:start position:0%
at this obviously the concern that we
 
00:26:51.299 --> 00:26:52.190 align:start position:0%
at this obviously the concern that we
have

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559 align:start position:0%
is to make sure the um students don't
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
get uh
 
00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
hung with a bill if in fact the career
 
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
school should uh go under
 
00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
and what we really would like to do is
 
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
we would like to have somebody come in
 
00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
we're not sure whether this is a 10 of
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
this particular Bill yes we're not sure
 
00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:13.980 align:start position:0%
whether 10 percent is is an appropriate
 
00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.370 align:start position:0%
whether 10 percent is is an appropriate
withhold

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:15.380 align:start position:0%
withhold
 
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
or insurance that they should have and I
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
think during our conversation we talked
 
00:27:24.289 --> 00:27:24.299 align:start position:0%
about the need
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
to have somebody like primex come in and
 
00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
and kind of inform the committee of
 
00:27:33.049 --> 00:27:33.059 align:start position:0%
exactly what is should it be 10 maybe it
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
should be 20 or maybe 50 we don't know
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
whether 10 is the appropriate amount and
 
00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:40.909 align:start position:0%
whether 10 is the appropriate amount and
so

00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:43.740 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to be voting against the
 
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
OTP in the hopes that we can move this
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
to a retain and put it within the same
 
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
category as we did 155 and during that
 
00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
retention process as somebody from the
 
00:27:57.169 --> 00:27:57.179 align:start position:0%
insurance industry come in and at least
 
00:27:59.630 --> 00:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
give us an indication of what would be
 
00:28:02.029 --> 00:28:02.039 align:start position:0%
the appropriate thing 10 might be okay
 
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
but we don't know that uh and so that's
 
00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:09.059 align:start position:0%
there's an unsurity here of of exactly
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
what it should be not neces or not
 
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
necessarily opposed to the concept but
 
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
we just don't know what what the percent
 
00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:18.900 align:start position:0%
should be and so Mr chair uh that's what
 
00:28:21.289 --> 00:28:21.299 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do and hopefully if we have
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
a 10 10 vote I will then move to to
 
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
retain the bill uh and get some more
 
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
information so that we can act
 
00:28:30.529 --> 00:28:30.539 align:start position:0%
appropriately thank you
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
representative cardelli uh yes I I think
 
00:28:36.409 --> 00:28:36.419 align:start position:0%
that we had a testimony from uh Mr
 
00:28:39.529 --> 00:28:39.539 align:start position:0%
Appleby that there's been approximately
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh only foreclosures of career schools
 
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
in uh 20 plus years so I think more on a
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
pretty safe ground with this
 
00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on this bill
 
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:55.140 align:start position:0%

further discussion on retaining this
 
00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:09.710 align:start position:0%
further discussion on retaining this
bill

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
sure representative Luna so thank you
 
00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:14.700 align:start position:0%
very much and uh Mr chair as as
 
00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli um uh remarked
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
uh just a few moments ago uh over the
 
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
last couple of decades there have been
 
00:30:24.529 --> 00:30:24.539 align:start position:0%
foreclosures of of career schools in New
 
00:30:24.539 --> 00:30:25.850 align:start position:0%
foreclosures of of career schools in New
Hampshire

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:25.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
um uh we also heard testimony well we
 
00:30:30.169 --> 00:30:30.179 align:start position:0%
also heard representative cardelli say
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
that there's a strong interest to um to
 
00:30:36.409 --> 00:30:36.419 align:start position:0%
to have more career schools come into
 
00:30:39.649 --> 00:30:39.659 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so you know based on on
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
the sen that that playing field we we
 
00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
could very well see more than than um
 
00:30:48.049 --> 00:30:48.059 align:start position:0%
than foreclosures what happened to the
 
00:30:51.889 --> 00:30:51.899 align:start position:0%
um to students um uh prepaid tuition uh
 
00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
dollars in those foreclosures we don't
 
00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:55.980 align:start position:0%
know what happened there we don't know
 
00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen uh down the road
 
00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
with an increased number of um of of
 
00:31:05.149 --> 00:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
career schools opening up I think we all
 
00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
uh recognize the importance of career
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
schools uh uh coming into the state but
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure they do it on a
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
basis that that obviously serves
 
00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
students as well as our our economy and
 
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh and I really don't see any um any
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
drawback to uh to retaining this uh so
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
that uh so that we can um vote on it in
 
00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
in January and um knowing that uh that
 
00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
either 10 is the right amount or whether
 
00:31:36.169 --> 00:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
it should be eight percent or whether it
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
should be 15 uh to just have a little
 
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
bit more um
 
00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:43.860 align:start position:0%
um you know technical support from uh uh
 
00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
from primex on this I think would be
 
00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
very helpful further discussion from the
 
00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.610 align:start position:0%
very helpful further discussion from the
committee

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
I'd like to just say that the bill was
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
presented by uh director Appleby from
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education I'm sure
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
that when they presented something such
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
as this that they had addressed the
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
issue of 10 this bill has 10 percent in
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
and so does 155 and we retain the 155 to
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
address that very issue but uh
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
recognizing that uh director Appleby did
 
00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
simply send this forward to us for
 
00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:19.559 align:start position:0%
passage I have to assume that they have
 
00:32:21.289 --> 00:32:21.299 align:start position:0%
a pretty good handle on this and they've
 
00:32:24.049 --> 00:32:24.059 align:start position:0%
done the inquiry into the 10 percent so
 
00:32:27.049 --> 00:32:27.059 align:start position:0%
with that I will not vote to retain this
 
00:32:27.059 --> 00:32:29.570 align:start position:0%
with that I will not vote to retain this
bill

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:33.769 --> 00:32:33.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
Madam clerk would you please call the
 
00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
role Vice chairman cordelli no
 
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:41.460 align:start position:0%

go ahead thank you Mr chair
 
00:33:46.679 --> 00:33:48.350 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you Mr chair
um

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't I I mean I I
 
00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:53.700 align:start position:0%
you know I think the recommend a
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
recommendation of itl uh would not have
 
00:33:59.330 --> 00:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
been my my first choice I think
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
retaining would have been by far my
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
first choice uh I don't have any reason
 
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
to believe 10 percent is is not a good
 
00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:09.419 align:start position:0%
number but I don't have any reason to
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
believe that it is because we did not
 
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:13.740 align:start position:0%
have the testimony
 
00:34:16.849 --> 00:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
um uh that other than but from um from
 
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
Mr Mr Appleby uh with respect to um to
 
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
this to this bill and um I think coming
 
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
from uh you know at least four four
 
00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
years that I spent on the um on the
 
00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:30.899 align:start position:0%
Commerce and consumer affairs committee
 
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
uh and spending a lot of time with the
 
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
um uh consumer protection division chief
 
00:34:40.369 --> 00:34:40.379 align:start position:0%
that uh that you know this is an area
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire has to take very
 
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.550 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire has to take very
seriously

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
um uh I I would you know if I I know
 
00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
we've got a busy two weeks ahead this
 
00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:51.419 align:start position:0%
week and then the first part of next
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
week where we I think we have to have
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
all our bills out right by the 16th by
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
the 16th yeah
 
00:34:58.970 --> 00:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if we could if we could
 
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
push this one to recess the exec and and
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
maybe get even getting some written
 
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
testimony from primex could be helpful
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
um and and then we could uh we could
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
reconsider the ought to pass motion and
 
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
and move forward with it but I I just
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
feel real squishy about it right now
 
00:35:23.329 --> 00:35:23.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:26.569 --> 00:35:26.579 align:start position:0%
is emotionally recessed this and Army is
 
00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:30.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
there's an idea on the floor we've come
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
down to this point before
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
what you could do is you could ask for a
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
reconsideration on your last vote and
 
00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:47.460 align:start position:0%
then we could recess it and so the vote
 
00:35:50.089 --> 00:35:50.099 align:start position:0%
your vote would have been a retain or on
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
in the case the other side to OTP but
 
00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
that during the time if we bring it up
 
00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:56.940 align:start position:0%
then again
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
like we could do it tomorrow
 
00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
or in in a prime X if uh director
 
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
Appleby could be contacted uh could we
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
find out uh what's the difference
 
00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:10.140 align:start position:0%
between ten percent twenty percent fifty
 
00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:11.510 align:start position:0%
between ten percent twenty percent fifty
percent

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:13.619 align:start position:0%
um I don't know myself
 
00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
uh but it basically it depends upon the
 
00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
tuition for that particular uh uh
 
00:36:22.609 --> 00:36:22.619 align:start position:0%
organization right right so so Mr chair
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
if we could if we could get some some at
 
00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
least better visibility to to how the 10
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
was arrived at and what other things
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
were considered and and yes you know if
 
00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:35.460 align:start position:0%
primex is in support of that uh then uh
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
then you know this committee may be in a
 
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
position to ought to pass this
 
00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
um you know with a strong bipartisan
 
00:36:44.329 --> 00:36:44.339 align:start position:0%
vote but but if you're suggesting that
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
maybe we could um reach out we could
 
00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.810 align:start position:0%
maybe we could um reach out we could
email

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:47.820 align:start position:0%
email
 
00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
um Mr Appleby uh to get some some even a
 
00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:54.060 align:start position:0%
paragraph of written testimony I'd be
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
happy to withdraw my motion okay we can

this is a bill relative to screening and
 
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
intervention in public schools for
 
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
dyslexia and Related Disorders uh
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
this point yes on the table and uh
 
00:38:50.569 --> 00:38:50.579 align:start position:0%

00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
person uh who actually testified
 
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
um BB Casey and Karen and Bibi were both
 
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
instrumental in getting the first
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
dyslexic Bill through so we've been
 
00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
we've been kind of uh back and forth and
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
And discussing this and trying to get
 
00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
something that we thought uh would be
 
00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
palatable to everybody and yet achieve
 
00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
the two purposes that we have the two
 
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
purposes are more testing for dyslexia
 
00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:31.079 align:start position:0%
and also immediate intervention or or
 
00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
soon intervention so basically this this
 
00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:42.140 align:start position:0%
um Amendment takes out uh the diables um
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh reference that that we've had before
 
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
and just use evidence-based screener for
 
00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.010 align:start position:0%
and just use evidence-based screener for
identification

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
identification
 
00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:50.510 align:start position:0%
identification
and

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
um the rest of it I think you've seen
 
00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
before in the other the other ones we
 
00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:58.140 align:start position:0%
changed some of the um dates uh we took
 
00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
out uh January 1st and and did the
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
initial screening shall be completed no
 
00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
later than 60 school days of a student
 
00:41:08.089 --> 00:41:08.099 align:start position:0%
entering public school and that was uh
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
to cover students who come in uh not
 
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
right at in September
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
um and the um intervention uh was the
 
00:41:20.569 --> 00:41:20.579 align:start position:0%
next part of it
 
00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
um that that secondary assessment within
 
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
30 days was the second testing and then
 
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
there would be
 
00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:27.170 align:start position:0%
there would be
[Music]

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:27.180 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:27.890 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.770 align:start position:0%
um
intervention

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:29.780 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
initiated within 21 days of the initial
 
00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:35.220 align:start position:0%
screening if they tested positive as
 
00:41:37.609 --> 00:41:37.619 align:start position:0%
well we've you can see charter schools
 
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
have have been mentioned in this where
 
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
before they weren't uh they were they
 
00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:43.740 align:start position:0%
were mentioned in the first
 
00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:47.460 align:start position:0%
part but um we've also continued that
 
00:41:49.849 --> 00:41:49.859 align:start position:0%
down into section two
 
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
and then the big difference between this
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
and the last two amendments were that
 
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
have taken out the financial uh note
 
00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
where we tried to get the amount of
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
money that was given to a school after
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
third grade if someone hadn't reached
 
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
proficiency uh we were trying to
 
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
incorporate that as a incentive for uh
 
00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
or to give money to schools for the um
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
intervention but we took that out
 
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
because we feel that schools now have
 
00:42:19.849 --> 00:42:19.859 align:start position:0%
the ability to do interventions a lot of
 
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:23.220 align:start position:0%
them are trained and schools once
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
they're aware of the dyslexia issue have
 
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
been able to meet it so it no longer
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
probably should have a financial note
 
00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't
 
00:42:34.609 --> 00:42:34.619 align:start position:0%
so that's basically the changes
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner I see online
 
00:42:41.329 --> 00:42:41.339 align:start position:0%
30 or excuse me 29.
 
00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh you did make the change and I think
 
00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
it's a positive change
 
00:42:46.849 --> 00:42:46.859 align:start position:0%
during this time general education
 
00:42:46.859 --> 00:42:49.190 align:start position:0%
during this time general education
accommodations

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
accommodations
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh and it once read during this time
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
general education intervention right so
 
00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
intervention really is the wrong word
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
there right accommodation would be a
 
00:43:01.849 --> 00:43:01.859 align:start position:0%
better terminology yes and it it makes
 
00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
it that's another reason for renewing
 
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
the financial note the accommodations
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
again are something that's ongoing in in
 
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
public schools and charter schools
 
00:43:14.329 --> 00:43:14.339 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden thank you Mr
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
chair just want to add
 
00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
um to keep in mind the scores that were
 
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
published recently that showed the
 
00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:25.980 align:start position:0%
decrease in kids performance in Reading
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
really can be related back to the times
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
that schools were closed for covid so if
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
you have a kindergartner that got done
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
kindergarten in March and then had
 
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
remote the whole following year and then
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
come to school on in grade two
 
00:43:43.569 --> 00:43:43.579 align:start position:0%
the scores are going to be substantially
 
00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
low because of that that Gap so I think
 
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
this bill is very needed because it is
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
very targeted and more directed
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
I'm a little disheartened that RSA 259
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
did not work for that purpose but I
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
think this bill would so I would support
 
00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
it further discussion
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
so at this point in time we have the
 
00:44:11.569 --> 00:44:11.579 align:start position:0%
amendment on the floor
 
00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
and that's Amendment zero five one six H
 
00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on this
 
00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:20.510 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on this
amendment

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:22.740 align:start position:0%
yes representative Mr chair just to be
 
00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:23.569 align:start position:0%
yes representative Mr chair just to be
clear

00:44:23.569 --> 00:44:23.579 align:start position:0%

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
um this bill has not been amended by any
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%

00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:30.780 align:start position:0%

the support on the amendment and
 
00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
hopefully the support for the the bill
 
00:46:20.809 --> 00:46:20.819 align:start position:0%
um this is a life-changing Bill uh
 
00:46:23.329 --> 00:46:23.339 align:start position:0%
students who cannot read because they
 
00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
have dyslexia
 
00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
um or another impediment
 
00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:31.140 align:start position:0%
um once they get to you know school and
 
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
they're in second and third grade and
 
00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
fourth grade they're still struggling to
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
learn to read while their classmates are
 
00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
reading to learn and that's how they
 
00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
fall behind and they may never catch up
 
00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:46.140 align:start position:0%
and it's a life-altering so thank you
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%

okay we're jumping over 382 as that has
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
been done and completed earlier
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:24.109 --> 00:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
um three no see don't worry oh see we

00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
allowing for a testing exception for
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
graduation from high school represent
 
00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:37.490 align:start position:0%
graduation from high school represent
Belcher

00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
Belcher
 
00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I would note that we
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
just received um an amendment that went
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
around to this I've reviewed it
 
00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
um I believe it fixes some of the
 
00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:46.980 align:start position:0%
problems but I believe some language
 
00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
still needs to be cleaned up uh as such
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay women they don't have the amendment
 
00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
yet we're just going this way
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
do you represent cascadden did you pass
 
00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
around tall that way
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
as your name no wait a minute this
 
00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:06.180 align:start position:0%
represented yeah that's not true I was
 
00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:10.460 align:start position:0%
looking at the I need that dyslexia
 
00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
do you
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
I just looked too quickly at it we don't
 
00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:20.809 --> 00:49:20.819 align:start position:0%
I would further note that this amendment
 
00:49:22.849 --> 00:49:22.859 align:start position:0%
was provided by the uh representative
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
originating the bill
 
00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:27.180 align:start position:0%
um as such it's not a committee
 
00:49:29.450 --> 00:49:29.460 align:start position:0%
um Amendment so it can't be adopted by
 
00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:31.140 align:start position:0%
us at this time unless one of us were to
 
00:49:33.309 --> 00:49:33.319 align:start position:0%
go do this I believe
 
00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:36.079 align:start position:0%
that's why oh okay
 
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
in any case
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
um unless somebody else objects I would
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
say this still needs a little bit of
 
00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
to retain
 
00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
per second by representative cornelli
 
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher do you want to speak
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
to your motion yes um referencing the
 
00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
original Bill there was a very good
 
00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
concept I believe in this but there was
 
00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:01.140 align:start position:0%
a number of items that uh needed to be
 
00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
cleaned up the amendment here
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to look very closely at and
 
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
make a few minor changes at um to
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
possibly try to get this past next year
 
00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's a need for high
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
achieving students the the next Elon
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
Musk of the world to be sitting
 
00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:20.569 align:start position:0%
Musk of the world to be sitting
unnecessarily

00:50:20.569 --> 00:50:20.579 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily
 
00:50:23.089 --> 00:50:23.099 align:start position:0%
um probably developing behavioral
 
00:50:23.099 --> 00:50:24.410 align:start position:0%
um probably developing behavioral
problems

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
um instead of moving on and and building
 
00:50:28.609 --> 00:50:28.619 align:start position:0%
the future for us
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to retain this and work on
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
this so we can get this through next
 
00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:34.430 align:start position:0%
this so we can get this through next
year

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:35.390 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:37.069 align:start position:0%
question
representative

00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
cordelli you made the second do you have
 
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
any nothing further Jefferson Ellison uh
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
just not starting the discussion about
 
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment but when I was at the
 
00:50:47.569 --> 00:50:47.579 align:start position:0%
department of edit I was in charge of
 
00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
administering the high school
 
00:50:51.049 --> 00:50:51.059 align:start position:0%
equivalency test uh the current status
 
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
of that is that it's fairly easy for any
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
16 or 17 year old to take the high
 
00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
school equivalency test at this point
 
00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:01.140 align:start position:0%
with the approval of the parents and the
 
00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
approval of the school so I that'll just
 
00:51:05.089 --> 00:51:05.099 align:start position:0%
be part of the discussions I guess is
 
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
when we get to it indeed thank you
 
00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:12.970 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:17.150 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
I had one concern in receiving the sheet
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
that we all received from the New
 
00:51:24.049 --> 00:51:24.059 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school boards Association from
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
Rebecca Wilson I don't know if we re
 
00:51:28.849 --> 00:51:28.859 align:start position:0%
you've received that
 
00:51:30.829 --> 00:51:30.839 align:start position:0%
um and I'll read it generally you must
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
be at least 18 years old to take the
 
00:51:35.809 --> 00:51:35.819 align:start position:0%
hiset but Most states have Pro visions
 
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
that allow 17 year olds to take the test
 
00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
if they obtain a waiver certain States
 
00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
even allow students as young as 16 to
 
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
take the test as several additional
 
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
criteria are met the exact requirements
 
00:51:51.049 --> 00:51:51.059 align:start position:0%
for each state are are in the uh
 
00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:52.700 align:start position:0%
connection or the
 
00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
link here the hiset consists of five
 
00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
different subtests covering the core
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
subjects of the typical high school
 
00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
curriculum the questions are all
 
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
multiple choice except for one essay
 
00:52:05.329 --> 00:52:05.339 align:start position:0%
question students normally take the exam
 
00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
on a computer but a paper version is
 
00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
available as well the test is available
 
00:52:12.049 --> 00:52:12.059 align:start position:0%
in either English or Spanish so that was
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
a communication there my concerns are
 
00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:16.329 align:start position:0%
a communication there my concerns are
that

00:52:16.329 --> 00:52:16.339 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
if in fact the state gets into the
 
00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
business of having to develop a test
 
00:52:23.569 --> 00:52:23.579 align:start position:0%
like this or an assessment
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a huge amount of
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
work in terms of a lot of finances
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
associated with to identify than to
 
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
ensure that the test is matching all the
 
00:52:36.049 --> 00:52:36.059 align:start position:0%
standards associated with academic
 
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
performance in the state and also
 
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
matching up to those required courses
 
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
for graduation
 
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:45.180 align:start position:0%
so there's a trend and you'd have to
 
00:52:47.329 --> 00:52:47.339 align:start position:0%
have different forms of the test too so
 
00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:49.140 align:start position:0%
that you can't give the same version of
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
the test right after you all you have to
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
have various different versions of that
 
00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
to them and ensure it's um
 
00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:01.380 align:start position:0%
um uh a test which is uh got back up so
 
00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:03.300 align:start position:0%
that you don't are you're not repetitive
 
00:53:06.049 --> 00:53:06.059 align:start position:0%
and so it's valid so I do have some
 
00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:07.980 align:start position:0%
concerns about this whole process I
 
00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
think we're we're getting down into the
 
00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
age bracket where it's very difficult to
 
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
ascertain that this would have to be an
 
00:53:19.089 --> 00:53:19.099 align:start position:0%
I was assuming an extremely gifted
 
00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:22.980 align:start position:0%
individual to be able to test out of
 
00:53:25.849 --> 00:53:25.859 align:start position:0%
high school at age 13.
 
00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent Belcher yes
 
00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
and just to speak to your point I agree
 
00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
with a lot of what you just said and I
 
00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
think part of the change that is going
 
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
to need to be made would be to instead
 
00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:38.700 align:start position:0%
of instead of mandating a design test to
 
00:53:40.609 --> 00:53:40.619 align:start position:0%
be able to designate
 
00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:42.660 align:start position:0%
um a test and I think we can look and
 
00:53:44.569 --> 00:53:44.579 align:start position:0%
examine what tests may be out there that
 
00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
might be appropriate I recall and I
 
00:53:47.809 --> 00:53:47.819 align:start position:0%
don't know how they are these days but I
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
recall taking the sat2s they offer for
 
00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
various subjects and they uh they grade
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
them according to different percentiles
 
00:53:56.329 --> 00:53:56.339 align:start position:0%
so that may be something we can look at
 
00:53:58.730 --> 00:53:58.740 align:start position:0%
and other things as well
 
00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:01.140 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
00:54:03.049 --> 00:54:03.059 align:start position:0%
Woodcock it's just a question for
 
00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
Reverend velcro if I may so Mike is the
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
intent the intent
 
00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:11.220 align:start position:0%
um primarily the age change or is the
 
00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:18.660 align:start position:0%
I I think we can put everything up for
 
00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
discussion to where we want to kind of
 
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
fine-tune this thing if 13 is
 
00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
objectionable I I don't really have a
 
00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:25.740 align:start position:0%
problem with 13 but if we want to look
 
00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:27.780 align:start position:0%
at 14 or 15 or something like that if
 
00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
that if that's what it takes to get it
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
passed I'll be fine looking at that but
 
00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
I think there was a number of tweaks
 
00:54:34.849 --> 00:54:34.859 align:start position:0%
that needed to be made and I think we
 
00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:36.500 align:start position:0%
should put everything on the table
 
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
the motion on the table up front of us
 
00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:48.660 align:start position:0%
right now is to retain this bill
 
00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
no not see any further discussion Madam
 
00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:52.500 align:start position:0%

00:55:57.650 --> 00:55:57.660 align:start position:0%
motion made by reference second by
 
00:56:01.309 --> 00:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
represent Damon to itl 399
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
yes representative I also think this is
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh actually trying to be placed under
 
00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
the wrong place in the statute so this
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
is uh under a statute that talks about
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
compulsory education
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not sure testing out is is
 
00:56:25.309 --> 00:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
there plus
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
you know we spent
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
wonderful time on having Pace
 
00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
um performance-based assessments and uh
 
00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to do in a test like
 
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
this so thanks
 
00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:43.980 align:start position:0%
I'd like to just discuss it a little bit
 
00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:44.930 align:start position:0%
I'd like to just discuss it a little bit
um

00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:44.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
if you're looking we're looking now at
 
00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
the primary bill as it was introduced
 
00:56:52.849 --> 00:56:52.859 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking at lines 24 through 26
 
00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
any child aged 13 or older whether a
 
00:56:59.690 --> 00:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
citizen of New Hampshire or elsewhere
 
00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:02.460 align:start position:0%
may take the test any child who passes
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
the test shall be issued a high school
 
00:57:07.309 --> 00:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
diploma equivalency certificate and be
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
accepted from compulsory School
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
attendance issues
 
00:57:14.809 --> 00:57:14.819 align:start position:0%
it goes on down further and says that
 
00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
the results of this are going to be what
 
00:57:19.549 --> 00:57:19.559 align:start position:0%
guaranteed by our University system or
 
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education system we've
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
had no communication from the
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education system whether
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
they do that or not we're having a hard
 
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
time getting Community College courses
 
00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:33.059 align:start position:0%
transferred and accepted at the
 
00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:34.940 align:start position:0%
University system New Hampshire
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
now we're talking about something that a
 
00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:40.740 align:start position:0%
13 year old does so I have real
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
misgivings of even going forward with
 
00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:45.300 align:start position:0%
this bill at this time
 
00:57:48.049 --> 00:57:48.059 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell I
 
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
as a former middle school guidance
 
00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
counselor a 13 year old is a seventh
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
grader and in my mind a seventh grader
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
testing out of school and
 
00:58:03.170 --> 00:58:03.180 align:start position:0%
not going to a secondary school because
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
we have no indication that they're going
 
00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
to be accepted I don't know what they'll
 
00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
be doing and I just have visions of them
 
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
sitting home and babysitting or with I
 
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
think everybody's been reading in the
 
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
paper or seen on the news the employment
 
00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
of underage kids working midnight shifts
 
00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:25.559 align:start position:0%
places and if they're out of school none
 
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
of that I guess applies to them anymore
 
00:58:29.089 --> 00:58:29.099 align:start position:0%
because they can just go to work 40
 
00:58:31.309 --> 00:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
hours a week someplace
 
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
and I I think 13 is just too young for
 
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
something like that to be happening
 
00:58:42.289 --> 00:58:42.299 align:start position:0%
with or without parental permission so I
 
00:58:42.299 --> 00:58:43.549 align:start position:0%
with or without parental permission so I
I

00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
just find this
 
00:58:48.349 --> 00:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
upsetting that's all representative
 
00:58:49.970 --> 00:58:49.980 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you Mr chair I actually
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
had a question uh for you or for anybody
 
00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
who could possibly answer this given the
 
00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:56.460 align:start position:0%
amendment that was just put before us if
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
this bill were to be killed today is
 
00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:00.180 align:start position:0%
this amendment sufficiently different
 
00:59:01.609 --> 00:59:01.619 align:start position:0%
from the original bill that it can be
 
00:59:03.130 --> 00:59:03.140 align:start position:0%
reintroduced by the original
 
00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
representative next year
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
no I I it will not be able to be uh put
 
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
forth in the second year of the biennium
 
00:59:14.089 --> 00:59:14.099 align:start position:0%
okay it's too too close to what we have
 
00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:15.780 align:start position:0%
right here thank you
 
00:59:17.569 --> 00:59:17.579 align:start position:0%
represent Lucas and then representative
 
00:59:17.579 --> 00:59:19.250 align:start position:0%
represent Lucas and then representative
cascadden

00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
cascadden
 
00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:21.900 align:start position:0%
the idea of behind being able to test
 
00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
out of compulsory High School attendance
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
at the age of 13 is not for the kid to
 
00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:30.900 align:start position:0%
be on their own or anything else it's
 
00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:33.980 align:start position:0%
for them to be able to follow whatever
 
00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:37.140 align:start position:0%
interests or passions they have if you
 
00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:40.740 align:start position:0%
have a gifted musician and I know of
 
00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:42.109 align:start position:0%
have a gifted musician and I know of
some

00:59:42.109 --> 00:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:59:45.549 --> 00:59:45.559 align:start position:0%
um who are already at that age
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
symphonic capable right
 
00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:50.150 align:start position:0%
symphonic capable right
um

00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
why should it if they if they have shown
 
00:59:55.069 --> 00:59:55.079 align:start position:0%
that they understand all of the high
 
00:59:57.410 --> 00:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
school stuff by taking the test why
 
00:59:59.089 --> 00:59:59.099 align:start position:0%
should they have to be spending their
 
01:00:01.549 --> 01:00:01.559 align:start position:0%
time doing that instead of working on
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
whatever the instrument is and working
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
with an orchestra
 
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
that's still supervised it's still
 
01:00:11.569 --> 01:00:11.579 align:start position:0%
education it's still but it's no longer
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
sitting learning the things or sitting
 
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
through the presentation of the things
 
01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:20.940 align:start position:0%
they already know and so the idea is yes
 
01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
it's probably going to be as somebody
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
said they'd have to be gifted to pass
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
this that's the point
 
01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:30.180 align:start position:0%
and the point is if they have an area of
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
particular gifting why if they already
 
01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:35.460 align:start position:0%
know all this information why should
 
01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:37.799 align:start position:0%
they be sitting through school instead
 
01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
of pursuing whatever area that is
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
whether it's engineering or music or
 
01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:47.220 align:start position:0%
whatever area that is why should they
 
01:00:50.089 --> 01:00:50.099 align:start position:0%
not be able to use those years pursuing
 
01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:53.700 align:start position:0%
that and getting better at that and
 
01:00:56.569 --> 01:00:56.579 align:start position:0%
contributing sooner as an as once they
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
so that's the idea it's not sitting at
 
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
home on their own working whatever it's
 
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
the ability to pursue whatever their
 
01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
gifted area is thank you and I'd like to
 
01:01:12.829 --> 01:01:12.839 align:start position:0%
follow up a little bit here
 
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
I think there's a lot of information
 
01:01:17.569 --> 01:01:17.579 align:start position:0%
here in concept wise
 
01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
it has some good points however when you
 
01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:22.380 align:start position:0%
leave read the last sentence
 
01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
on page one and continue on to page two
 
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
I have real problems with it and it says
 
01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
any non-profit institution of higher uh
 
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
learning in New Hampshire that offers
 
01:01:34.849 --> 01:01:34.859 align:start position:0%
and Associates or bachelor's degree that
 
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
does not accept a passing score in this
 
01:01:40.609 --> 01:01:40.619 align:start position:0%
test as sufficient for matriculation or
 
01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
which impose burdensome regulations for
 
01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:44.940 align:start position:0%
graduation that subvert the intent of
 
01:01:48.049 --> 01:01:48.059 align:start position:0%
this law shall be subject to having its
 
01:01:51.049 --> 01:01:51.059 align:start position:0%
state funding reduced or removed by the
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
general court that's one heck of a
 
01:01:57.170 --> 01:01:57.180 align:start position:0%
threat and I don't think that is going
 
01:01:59.930 --> 01:01:59.940 align:start position:0%
to really carry over that well with the
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
university system New Hampshire UNH
 
01:02:03.289 --> 01:02:03.299 align:start position:0%
Keane Plymouth
 
01:02:03.299 --> 01:02:04.430 align:start position:0%
Keane Plymouth
Etc

01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden thank you Mr
 
01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
chair uh just want to add that we put so
 
01:02:11.329 --> 01:02:11.339 align:start position:0%
much focus on a test it's only one
 
01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
moment in time
 
01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
and if the student does really well so
 
01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
be it but for a high school diploma
 
01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
you're dumming down
 
01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
the value of that diploma and really it
 
01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
doesn't determine the Mastery of the
 
01:02:28.730 --> 01:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
competencies because I have to
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
demonstrate them oftentimes
 
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
in some some form
 
01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
um there's also no Assurance of work
 
01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:38.700 align:start position:0%
study practices that are required or
 
01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
Proficiency in any of the content areas
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
so it's a lot more than being a heavy
 
01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
knowledge base on one particular day at
 
01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
one time however I understand the
 
01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
scenario of someone who may track in a
 
01:02:54.109 --> 01:02:54.119 align:start position:0%
professional World whether it's music or
 
01:02:56.089 --> 01:02:56.099 align:start position:0%
dance or Sports
 
01:02:58.609 --> 01:02:58.619 align:start position:0%
or even someone who's on the Olympic
 
01:02:58.619 --> 01:02:59.650 align:start position:0%
or even someone who's on the Olympic
team

01:02:59.650 --> 01:02:59.660 align:start position:0%
team
 
01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
they have private tutors or there are
 
01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
arrangements made for them so if you
 
01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:07.140 align:start position:0%
have a student who's exceptional in
 
01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
music and going down that path you still
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
want them to have some sort of a
 
01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:14.940 align:start position:0%
well-rounded education so they can
 
01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
function in life outside of that world
 
01:03:20.809 --> 01:03:20.819 align:start position:0%
of music but not to deter it so again
 
01:03:25.309 --> 01:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
one moment in time is a test that's it
 
01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
further representative
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
the point of retaining is because yes
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
there are things like that paragraph
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
that should not be in there but if we
 
01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:38.460 align:start position:0%
itl it we can't fix it
 
01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
and if we if we don't pass the Ito then
 
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
we still have the ability to fix it and
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
take out those objectional parts and
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
figure out how to make it better so I
 
01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:52.980 align:start position:0%
would seriously recommend not idealing
 
01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
it so we can keep working on it
 
01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's dead we can't do anything
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
next year either thank you represent
 
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you
 
01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah I have problems with Roman 3
 
01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
um a even in the amendment
 
01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
um a citizen of New Hampshire or
 
01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:16.980 align:start position:0%
elsewhere is a uh accepted from uh
 
01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:19.740 align:start position:0%
compulsory I assume New Hampshire
 
01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
attendance laws I don't know why someone
 
01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:24.660 align:start position:0%
from another state would be exempt from
 
01:04:28.609 --> 01:04:28.619 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire School attendance laws and
 
01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
as has already been discussed B and C I
 
01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
think are very problematic
 
01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:35.450 align:start position:0%
think are very problematic
um

01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:35.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:39.660 align:start position:0%
I I like the concept you know we've seen
 
01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:40.670 align:start position:0%
I I like the concept you know we've seen
um

01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:45.049 --> 01:04:45.059 align:start position:0%
stories uh recently even of um uh very
 
01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
intelligent children
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
um 14 15 years old graduating with uh
 
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
high school and Associates degrees
 
01:04:59.410 --> 01:04:59.420 align:start position:0%
um so I I I think this is in line with
 
01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:02.460 align:start position:0%
uh maybe my view of what was the
 
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
original intent of uh uh our um
 
01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:09.180 align:start position:0%
competency program Mastery Program if
 
01:05:10.609 --> 01:05:10.619 align:start position:0%
you will
 
01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
um I I think it does need work
 
01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure and ought to pass
 
01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:21.180 align:start position:0%
um what work could be done where and
 
01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:25.140 align:start position:0%
when on it to correct the problems
 
01:05:27.770 --> 01:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
um you know a floor amendment in the
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
house I think would not be workable on
 
01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:33.900 align:start position:0%
this this bill and I'm not sure how the
 
01:05:35.170 --> 01:05:35.180 align:start position:0%
Senate would
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
react to this and trying to work on it
 
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
in the Senate so I'm disappointed that
 
01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
the retained motion did not pass and I'm
 
01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:49.980 align:start position:0%
not sure of my vote on the itl
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
rep Santana
 
01:05:55.549 --> 01:05:55.559 align:start position:0%
just as a word from a practitioner for
 
01:05:58.510 --> 01:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
been in public school for a long time
 
01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:01.140 align:start position:0%
and to follow up on representative
 
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
cascaden we had numerous students who
 
01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:06.059 align:start position:0%
were really good at skiing who went to a
 
01:06:08.809 --> 01:06:08.819 align:start position:0%
ski Academy for several months during
 
01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
the winter time and they still got their
 
01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
high school work done because we would
 
01:06:16.130 --> 01:06:16.140 align:start position:0%
the high school itself would would
 
01:06:19.970 --> 01:06:19.980 align:start position:0%
provide the the work and they had tutors
 
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
at the at the school and when they came
 
01:06:26.089 --> 01:06:26.099 align:start position:0%
back they were able to certify that they
 
01:06:28.730 --> 01:06:28.740 align:start position:0%
had actually taken that we had a young
 
01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:30.780 align:start position:0%
lady that just graduated from cursage
 
01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:33.299 align:start position:0%
that actually swam the English Channel
 
01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
swam the Catalina
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
did a tremendous uh swimming uh
 
01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
performance was able to do that well
 
01:06:44.650 --> 01:06:44.660 align:start position:0%
within the high school
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
situation and the high school and
 
01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
teachers made accommodations when she
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
needed to leave for different training
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
purposes and as you said the even the
 
01:06:56.809 --> 01:06:56.819 align:start position:0%
Olympic program has tutors and works
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
with the local schools so
 
01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
also if a student is very gifted my
 
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
experience at a high school is that they
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
can fast track them through high school
 
01:07:11.329 --> 01:07:11.339 align:start position:0%
by taking the core credits and be off to
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
college you know in their junior year or
 
01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
whatever so I think that public schools
 
01:07:20.690 --> 01:07:20.700 align:start position:0%
make accommodations for this
 
01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock thank you
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
chairman and I would I would follow up
 
01:07:27.049 --> 01:07:27.059 align:start position:0%
with representative cascadians and and
 
01:07:30.529 --> 01:07:30.539 align:start position:0%
Tanner's uh comments uh in that when I
 
01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:32.700 align:start position:0%
was last time I was at uh working in
 
01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
high school in New Hampshire I was
 
01:07:36.410 --> 01:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
responsible for part of that programming
 
01:07:39.529 --> 01:07:39.539 align:start position:0%
how they do that I would say that uh the
 
01:07:42.609 --> 01:07:42.619 align:start position:0%
intent uh of Representative belcher's uh
 
01:07:44.329 --> 01:07:44.339 align:start position:0%
piece that's what I was trying to get
 
01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:46.140 align:start position:0%
through my asses specifically if the
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
concern is really age and all else fails
 
01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
the parents still if they have the
 
01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
student that is so exceptional and
 
01:07:57.529 --> 01:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in their rsas and they
 
01:07:58.910 --> 01:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
don't prefer to go through high school
 
01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
they always have the right to withdraw
 
01:08:03.529 --> 01:08:03.539 align:start position:0%
the student as a home Schooler and put
 
01:08:05.569 --> 01:08:05.579 align:start position:0%
them in a private program anywhere they
 
01:08:07.490 --> 01:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
want to do it so it's it's not like
 
01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
we're saying geez I I understand where
 
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
they are coming from you have if you
 
01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:13.799 align:start position:0%
have this one student out of 160 000
 
01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
that's ready to roll uh the parents said
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
the right to do that and and and then
 
01:08:20.689 --> 01:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
probably their parents I would guess on
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
the aside we have students with them and
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
if want this I think there is
 
01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
an option for parents out here as well
 
01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
as uh the rest of the school system I I
 
01:08:32.269 --> 01:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
don't think there's any need to go back
 
01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
to this at this point in time and I do
 
01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
have a concern as uh representative uh
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
from Manchester said uh the youngster
 
01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
who are 13 years old uh theme of
 
01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
throwing off to handle this but I do
 
01:08:43.849 --> 01:08:43.859 align:start position:0%
think parents we had one exceptional kid
 
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
do have an option if all this fails Mr
 
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
chair thank you further discussion
 
01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:49.799 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald
 
01:08:52.189 --> 01:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wanted to add into the
 
01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
conversation another option that we
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
haven't mentioned is the availability of
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
dual and concurrent enrollment so
 
01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
options do exist for these students that
 
01:09:03.169 --> 01:09:03.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
and with that you can come out with an
 
01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
associate's degree from high school
 
01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
or two years as freshman sophomore
 
01:09:15.289 --> 01:09:15.299 align:start position:0%
in U.S University of New Hampshire
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:21.289 --> 01:09:21.299 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher thank you Mr chair
 
01:09:22.849 --> 01:09:22.859 align:start position:0%
just very briefly I think the real
 
01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
intent behind this bill is to look at
 
01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
the the history of very high achieving
 
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
people and so often what you find is
 
01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
that they they couldn't tolerate just
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
sitting around and they dropped out of
 
01:09:36.890 --> 01:09:36.900 align:start position:0%
high school
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
and they a lot of them were very
 
01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
successful nonetheless but what has
 
01:09:43.249 --> 01:09:43.259 align:start position:0%
changed today is that we now live
 
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I think in a society where
 
01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
credentials mean a lot more than what
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
you're capable of in a lot of instances
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
and somebody who's dropping out of high
 
01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
school who now doesn't have a high
 
01:09:54.289 --> 01:09:54.299 align:start position:0%
school diploma despite the fact that
 
01:09:55.729 --> 01:09:55.739 align:start position:0%
they're gifted they're going to be
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
severely handicapped when it comes to
 
01:10:00.169 --> 01:10:00.179 align:start position:0%
moving on with their life and doing good
 
01:10:02.209 --> 01:10:02.219 align:start position:0%
things unfortunately just because of
 
01:10:04.130 --> 01:10:04.140 align:start position:0%
that credential and I think that's what
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%

back to HB
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
168 relative to Surety and

indemnification for career schools and
 
01:29:11.810 --> 01:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
for discussion purposes uh I'm going to
 
01:29:13.250 --> 01:29:13.260 align:start position:0%
have representative cordelli just
 
01:29:15.010 --> 01:29:15.020 align:start position:0%
finished talking with director Appleby
 
01:29:18.649 --> 01:29:18.659 align:start position:0%
regarding primex and uh getting in that
 
01:29:20.090 --> 01:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
insurance stuff
 
01:29:22.430 --> 01:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
um so representative cordelli thank you
 
01:29:24.770 --> 01:29:24.780 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh yes I talked with
 
01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
director Appleby just now and um
 
01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:29.540 align:start position:0%
explained where we were with the bill
 
01:29:32.450 --> 01:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
and he did not think that he was going
 
01:29:33.970 --> 01:29:33.980 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
explain everything to primex or other
 
01:29:39.110 --> 01:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier
 
01:29:42.229 --> 01:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
um in a short time frame
 
01:29:45.050 --> 01:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
um and we discussed the fact that we
 
01:29:51.129 --> 01:29:51.139 align:start position:0%
have HB 155 already retained which does
 
01:29:54.430 --> 01:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
something similar with the surety bond
 
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
so I think the recommendation is that we
 
01:30:05.930 --> 01:30:05.940 align:start position:0%
itl 168 and work on 155 as our vehicle
 
01:30:08.330 --> 01:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
for moving forward with the surety bond
 
01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:11.270 align:start position:0%
for moving forward with the surety bond
issue

01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
so Madam clerk where are we where were
 
01:30:16.970 --> 01:30:16.980 align:start position:0%

01:30:26.330 --> 01:30:26.340 align:start position:0%

01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
um yeah oh I'm sorry okay I just was
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%

it out with itl withdrawn so but I
 
01:30:33.950 --> 01:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
crossed it all out so I was looking at
 
01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:35.940 align:start position:0%
above that where we it was okay so
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%

requirement to be placing on schools uh
 
01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:55.320 align:start position:0%

01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
woodcock
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I uh appreciate the
 
01:33:04.129 --> 01:33:04.139 align:start position:0%
comments from representative Belcher
 
01:33:05.810 --> 01:33:05.820 align:start position:0%
although I I don't agree with them
 
01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:07.250 align:start position:0%
although I I don't agree with them
primarily

01:33:07.250 --> 01:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
primarily
 
01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
um I would say I do agree with the ideal
 
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
moment that's not the rationale for it
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
um I think School meals are a
 
01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
significant issue right now I think food
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
is security for youngsters in school the
 
01:33:19.729 --> 01:33:19.739 align:start position:0%
same information right now I do agree
 
01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
that this bill is very confusing it has
 
01:33:22.910 --> 01:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
multiple parts that don't really fly
 
01:33:25.310 --> 01:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
right now and that there Still Remains
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
as representative Lucas and and Floyd
 
01:33:30.890 --> 01:33:30.900 align:start position:0%
and I and uh Miss Allison from the
 
01:33:33.050 --> 01:33:33.060 align:start position:0%
summer worked uh exorbitantly and
 
01:33:35.689 --> 01:33:35.699 align:start position:0%
consistently on providing getting
 
01:33:37.850 --> 01:33:37.860 align:start position:0%
information and studying this and there
 
01:33:40.370 --> 01:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
is yet another bill to come that is uh
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
significantly more meaningful uh and and
 
01:33:46.189 --> 01:33:46.199 align:start position:0%
able to be uh hopefully uh uh passed uh
 
01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
by this committee and then the house to
 
01:33:50.689 --> 01:33:50.699 align:start position:0%
help students in schools and school
 
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
meals so I would agree with my associate
 
01:33:55.129 --> 01:33:55.139 align:start position:0%
from Carroll County that this bill
 
01:33:56.689 --> 01:33:56.699 align:start position:0%
should be ideal but for a different
 
01:33:56.699 --> 01:33:58.250 align:start position:0%
should be ideal but for a different
rationale

01:33:58.250 --> 01:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
rationale
 
01:33:59.930 --> 01:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
represent luno thank you very much Mr
 
01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
chair um just a question to the chair if
 
01:34:06.770 --> 01:34:06.780 align:start position:0%
um if both those rationales could be
 
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
included in the um in the committee
 
01:34:08.639 --> 01:34:10.250 align:start position:0%
included in the um in the committee
report

01:34:10.250 --> 01:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
with some collaboration well the maker
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
and the motion represent Belcher would
 
01:34:17.450 --> 01:34:17.460 align:start position:0%
you be willing to put both rationales
 
01:34:19.610 --> 01:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
into your report
 
01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to have him do it for me
 
01:34:26.570 --> 01:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
there was also a fiscal note which they
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
could not determine what the cost of the
 
01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
program would be that's might be noted
 
01:34:41.930 --> 01:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:44.689 --> 01:34:44.699 align:start position:0%

01:35:44.570 --> 01:35:44.580 align:start position:0%
relative to the Charter Public School
 
01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
joint legislative oversight committee
 
01:35:49.729 --> 01:35:49.739 align:start position:0%
I'm going to hand the capital over to
 
01:35:52.189 --> 01:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
um representative cordelli thank you Mr
 
01:35:54.770 --> 01:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
chairman uh call on chairman Ladd for a
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
motion yes I'd recommend OTP on 536 uh
 
01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
01:36:03.729 --> 01:36:03.739 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner seconds
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
discussion from the maker yes
 
01:36:08.510 --> 01:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
um although there are some change that I
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
think the most significant need for this
 
01:36:15.169 --> 01:36:15.179 align:start position:0%
bill is that the committee meet
 
01:36:15.179 --> 01:36:15.830 align:start position:0%
bill is that the committee meet
um

01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
the uh committee uh
 
01:36:22.669 --> 01:36:22.679 align:start position:0%
was started my my recollection here is
 
01:36:27.290 --> 01:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
that the back in 1995 and going forward
 
01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
through all those years there's a page
 
01:36:32.330 --> 01:36:32.340 align:start position:0%
and a half right there in meetings but
 
01:36:35.810 --> 01:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
then all of a sudden in 2015 they stop
 
01:36:40.010 --> 01:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
and we've had I it's obvious they had
 
01:36:42.350 --> 01:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
these meetings when Charter Schools were
 
01:36:45.169 --> 01:36:45.179 align:start position:0%
were being started in the state and the
 
01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
funding source was being arrived at now
 
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
we have uh issues which with all our
 
01:36:54.649 --> 01:36:54.659 align:start position:0%
areas of Education we need some
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
oversight as a legislative body
 
01:37:00.890 --> 01:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
and at this point in time yes the State
 
01:37:03.110 --> 01:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
Board of Education addresses the issue
 
01:37:05.709 --> 01:37:05.719 align:start position:0%
of charter schools and they have even
 
01:37:08.090 --> 01:37:08.100 align:start position:0%
rejected some of the proposals that have
 
01:37:10.129 --> 01:37:10.139 align:start position:0%
come before them
 
01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
um however I feel at this time that it's
 
01:37:15.410 --> 01:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
time to get this committee is active
 
01:37:18.290 --> 01:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
again in fact one of the persons that's
 
01:37:21.530 --> 01:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
noted on the log here as representing
 
01:37:25.850 --> 01:37:25.860 align:start position:0%
education as John rist rist
 
01:37:28.189 --> 01:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
in my 15 years being on this committee
 
01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
I've never recalled that name being on
 
01:37:33.290 --> 01:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
um but Bruce Ward's name is there Kim
 
01:37:38.450 --> 01:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
Weiler's name is uh Denise Riccardi's
 
01:37:41.410 --> 01:37:41.420 align:start position:0%
there and John Hunt who's not on
 
01:37:45.229 --> 01:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
education is on that so we need to
 
01:37:48.050 --> 01:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
really revamp this get it working so we
 
01:37:50.689 --> 01:37:50.699 align:start position:0%
can get some reports in to us on the
 
01:37:53.810 --> 01:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
July 1 date that's indicated in this
 
01:37:53.820 --> 01:37:56.890 align:start position:0%
July 1 date that's indicated in this
bill

01:37:56.890 --> 01:37:56.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:00.649 --> 01:38:00.659 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Myler thank you Mr
 
01:38:00.659 --> 01:38:02.290 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Myler thank you Mr
chair

01:38:02.290 --> 01:38:02.300 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Ladd for
 
01:38:07.550 --> 01:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
moving this this is an important bill I
 
01:38:11.810 --> 01:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
mean we have in my 10-year uh on this
 
01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:12.890 align:start position:0%
mean we have in my 10-year uh on this
committee

01:38:12.890 --> 01:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
we have moved from 18 charter schools to
 
01:38:20.750 --> 01:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
30 charter schools and in that period of
 
01:38:23.410 --> 01:38:23.420 align:start position:0%
time we've had three that have failed
 
01:38:26.330 --> 01:38:26.340 align:start position:0%
primarily for for lack of interest in
 
01:38:29.330 --> 01:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
the content and also from the from a
 
01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal standpoint
 
01:38:34.810 --> 01:38:34.820 align:start position:0%
as we expand these Charter Schools
 
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that there is some
 
01:38:41.050 --> 01:38:41.060 align:start position:0%
oversight it is a commonplace
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
before the State Board of Education to
 
01:38:48.110 --> 01:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
have concerns about governance of these
 
01:38:50.750 --> 01:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
schools that come before complaints
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
we're successful uh several years ago
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
and getting a designated staff member I
 
01:39:04.189 --> 01:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
was I was one of the ones who worked
 
01:39:05.870 --> 01:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
with Senator felthus and getting that
 
01:39:08.450 --> 01:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
through again another example of
 
01:39:10.850 --> 01:39:10.860 align:start position:0%
providing uh those who want to have
 
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools uh develop their
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
proposal Etc as well as dealing with the
 
01:39:19.129 --> 01:39:19.139 align:start position:0%
governance questions around those
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
schools and what I mean about governance
 
01:39:22.970 --> 01:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
is that one of the problems you have in
 
01:39:24.649 --> 01:39:24.659 align:start position:0%
charter schools you have a dedicated
 
01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
group of people who create the charter
 
01:39:30.350 --> 01:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
school and then as new parents come into
 
01:39:32.510 --> 01:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
that charter school they want to be
 
01:39:34.430 --> 01:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
involved in the governance but those who
 
01:39:36.590 --> 01:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
created it don't want to give up their
 
01:39:39.290 --> 01:39:39.300 align:start position:0%
sense of ownership to it and then that
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
can be a problem and it has been a
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
problem so I think this oversight
 
01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:47.159 align:start position:0%
committee will help as representative
 
01:39:49.729 --> 01:39:49.739 align:start position:0%
Ladd said meet on a regular basis this
 
01:39:52.189 --> 01:39:52.199 align:start position:0%
is not a gotcha bill this is a bill that
 
01:39:54.770 --> 01:39:54.780 align:start position:0%
provides some sense of oversight and
 
01:39:57.530 --> 01:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
guidance for charter schools that we
 
01:40:00.050 --> 01:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
just have not had since the initial
 
01:40:02.450 --> 01:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
Inception of these things in in the mid
 
01:40:05.209 --> 01:40:05.219 align:start position:0%
90s so I would encourage people to vote
 
01:40:08.169 --> 01:40:08.179 align:start position:0%
for this because I think it will help
 
01:40:11.629 --> 01:40:11.639 align:start position:0%
charter schools be more effective in
 
01:40:13.790 --> 01:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
their mission as they work with their
 
01:40:15.790 --> 01:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
students thank you Mr chair
 
01:40:21.310 --> 01:40:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:25.729 --> 01:40:25.739 align:start position:0%
for you oh okay so so uh I'd like to add
 
01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
on to that that initially when Charter
 
01:40:30.050 --> 01:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
Schools their Public Schools
 
01:40:33.169 --> 01:40:33.179 align:start position:0%
and they were developed uh on the
 
01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
federal level for the purpose of
 
01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
innovation and and taking uh ideas and
 
01:40:42.169 --> 01:40:42.179 align:start position:0%
ways operating and sharing it with all
 
01:40:44.689 --> 01:40:44.699 align:start position:0%
public schools and with that I think
 
01:40:47.030 --> 01:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
this uh particular committee right here
 
01:40:49.729 --> 01:40:49.739 align:start position:0%
oversight would have the responsibility
 
01:40:52.729 --> 01:40:52.739 align:start position:0%
to communicate some of those areas which
 
01:40:55.070 --> 01:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
are the strengths and to share those
 
01:40:57.169 --> 01:40:57.179 align:start position:0%
strengths of instruction and curriculum
 
01:41:01.610 --> 01:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
with uh uh like we do with the oversight
 
01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
we have of improvement and assessment
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
for all public education so I think it's
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
a need to get this committee working and
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
so we can share in our responsibility
 
01:41:14.990 --> 01:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
for trying to improve legislation our
 
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
legislation education throughout the
 
01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:22.550 align:start position:0%
legislation education throughout the
state

01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%

thank you what we're going to do right
 
01:42:41.090 --> 01:42:41.100 align:start position:0%
now we're going to take a short talk
 
01:42:42.590 --> 01:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
because we never got the last three
 
01:42:45.050 --> 01:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
bills uh in the caucus we had we'd like
 
01:42:46.970 --> 01:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
to take about 15 minutes here go through
 
01:42:49.729 --> 01:42:49.739 align:start position:0%
that and then come through back and
 
01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
finish up our exact session for the day
 
01:42:54.169 --> 01:42:54.179 align:start position:0%
we could get out by noon time it'd be
 
01:42:54.179 --> 01:43:24.250 align:start position:0%
we could get out by noon time it'd be
great

01:43:24.250 --> 01:43:24.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:29.930 --> 01:43:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:33.729 --> 01:43:33.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
so I need to go back to this one
 
01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
which one no I just got to make sure all
 
02:19:52.630 --> 02:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:55.010 --> 02:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman I would like to
 
02:20:00.170 --> 02:20:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:03.550 --> 02:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:07.370 --> 02:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
pattern now okay okay uh representative
 
02:20:10.490 --> 02:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
now makes the second to the motion made
 
02:20:13.730 --> 02:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
by representative cordelli on 553
 
02:20:15.290 --> 02:20:15.300 align:start position:0%
relative to school district information
 
02:20:17.750 --> 02:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
on Personnel salaries representative
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
cardelli uh thank you
 
02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
um the intent with this um bill is
 
02:20:28.030 --> 02:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
basically uh transparency
 
02:20:30.889 --> 02:20:30.899 align:start position:0%
for many people
 
02:20:35.150 --> 02:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
um the public and school personnel as
 
02:20:35.160 --> 02:20:36.770 align:start position:0%
um the public and school personnel as
well

02:20:36.770 --> 02:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:20:39.370 --> 02:20:39.380 align:start position:0%
um it's my understanding that some
 
02:20:41.570 --> 02:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
districts might publish the information
 
02:20:44.750 --> 02:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
as part of their annual report but I
 
02:20:48.290 --> 02:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
think it it would be uh very helpful to
 
02:20:51.309 --> 02:20:51.319 align:start position:0%
have the information
 
02:20:56.389 --> 02:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
of the position and salary uh posted on
 
02:20:58.550 --> 02:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
the district website it could be a
 
02:21:01.610 --> 02:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
listing it could be a a PDF document
 
02:21:04.849 --> 02:21:04.859 align:start position:0%
that's posted I do not think it is
 
02:21:08.710 --> 02:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
burdensome but I think even teachers
 
02:21:11.830 --> 02:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
would be interested in looking at the
 
02:21:14.650 --> 02:21:14.660 align:start position:0%
district or the school
 
02:21:16.990 --> 02:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
salary structure
 
02:21:19.750 --> 02:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
and we've heard a lot about teacher
 
02:21:21.889 --> 02:21:21.899 align:start position:0%
salaries in the state they've been
 
02:21:25.429 --> 02:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
op-eds Etc recently about teacher
 
02:21:28.190 --> 02:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
salaries there's a Senate Bill related
 
02:21:31.010 --> 02:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
to teacher salaries and I think this
 
02:21:32.110 --> 02:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:21:35.809 --> 02:21:35.819 align:start position:0%
an easy way to provide information
 
02:21:37.870 --> 02:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
Nation about
 
02:21:40.450 --> 02:21:40.460 align:start position:0%
the entire salary
 
02:21:44.210 --> 02:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
structure within a school
 
02:21:47.750 --> 02:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:49.429 --> 02:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:21:49.439 --> 02:21:50.630 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

02:21:50.630 --> 02:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:52.910 --> 02:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
I I have serious concerns about this
 
02:21:56.210 --> 02:21:56.220 align:start position:0%
bill uh I the collective buying
 
02:22:00.889 --> 02:22:00.899 align:start position:0%
Agreements are available publicly the uh
 
02:22:04.309 --> 02:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
School accounts are available publicly
 
02:22:06.530 --> 02:22:06.540 align:start position:0%
um those pieces when you stop putting
 
02:22:09.950 --> 02:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
people's names and salary uh
 
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
particularly in small towns uh like
 
02:22:16.370 --> 02:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
teachers on a website I think this has a
 
02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
real to me it's a real negative intent I
 
02:22:20.330 --> 02:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
don't see it as a positive piece at all
 
02:22:22.429 --> 02:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
people can access information they have
 
02:22:23.990 --> 02:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
it and as Glenn mentioned already in
 
02:22:25.790 --> 02:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
some of the annual reports there are
 
02:22:27.530 --> 02:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
other ways to access it uh through the
 
02:22:29.929 --> 02:22:29.939 align:start position:0%
CPAs and and through the warrants when
 
02:22:32.389 --> 02:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
they voted I think this puts teachers
 
02:22:35.389 --> 02:22:35.399 align:start position:0%
and supervisors and administrators just
 
02:22:38.210 --> 02:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
a continued negative light in many
 
02:22:41.410 --> 02:22:41.420 align:start position:0%
communities particularly those that are
 
02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
struggling financially I I just I have a
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
real I I think there's limited good if
 
02:22:49.790 --> 02:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
anything can come from this thing thank
 
02:22:49.800 --> 02:22:53.150 align:start position:0%
anything can come from this thing thank
you

02:22:53.150 --> 02:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:55.910 --> 02:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you from personal experience at
 
02:22:58.010 --> 02:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
one point during negotiations a while
 
02:23:01.370 --> 02:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
ago they published all our our salaries
 
02:23:03.490 --> 02:23:03.500 align:start position:0%
our names are our degrees
 
02:23:05.690 --> 02:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
in the paper
 
02:23:08.450 --> 02:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
and the result of that
 
02:23:10.550 --> 02:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
um was kind of mixed a lot of teachers
 
02:23:12.290 --> 02:23:12.300 align:start position:0%
felt embarrassed that people found out
 
02:23:14.630 --> 02:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
how little they made that was one thing
 
02:23:17.929 --> 02:23:17.939 align:start position:0%
but it it really did do exactly what you
 
02:23:20.750 --> 02:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
just said representative Woodcock um you
 
02:23:22.370 --> 02:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
know we had eight towns and Care
 
02:23:24.710 --> 02:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
Sergeant some of them are pretty small
 
02:23:28.010 --> 02:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
and uh it it was really tough on a lot
 
02:23:30.349 --> 02:23:30.359 align:start position:0%
of people and and uh people were getting
 
02:23:32.809 --> 02:23:32.819 align:start position:0%
accosted in the in the supermarket and
 
02:23:36.170 --> 02:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing and I also uh had a
 
02:23:37.670 --> 02:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
lot of comments from people who work in
 
02:23:40.190 --> 02:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
business who said I can't believe you're
 
02:23:43.190 --> 02:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
they're doing this because in a business
 
02:23:45.469 --> 02:23:45.479 align:start position:0%
or anything else can you imagine and a
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
lot of you have worked outside of
 
02:23:49.790 --> 02:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
schools you imagine having your your
 
02:23:51.950 --> 02:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
salary published in the paper
 
02:23:55.670 --> 02:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
and what that might mean so
 
02:23:59.150 --> 02:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli uh thank you
 
02:24:02.990 --> 02:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
um the intent was the position not the
 
02:24:04.429 --> 02:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
individual's name
 
02:24:08.210 --> 02:24:08.220 align:start position:0%
so uh be third grade teacher a or Etc
 
02:24:09.950 --> 02:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
the position
 
02:24:12.530 --> 02:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
um and the salary even though I think
 
02:24:15.230 --> 02:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
that teacher names are and their
 
02:24:16.790 --> 02:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
salaries are public information and
 
02:24:21.710 --> 02:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
would be available on a 91a request
 
02:24:23.450 --> 02:24:23.460 align:start position:0%
that's pretty young
 
02:24:26.690 --> 02:24:26.700 align:start position:0%
well taxpayers are paying these salaries
 
02:24:28.969 --> 02:24:28.979 align:start position:0%
so they have every right to know where
 
02:24:31.610 --> 02:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
their money is going and it is public
 
02:24:33.950 --> 02:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
information they can access it through
 
02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
annual reports and such
 
02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
um however this improves the access to
 
02:24:41.270 --> 02:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
information some towns don't publish
 
02:24:44.090 --> 02:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
this in their annual reports so it
 
02:24:46.429 --> 02:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
increases transparency but most of all
 
02:24:49.490 --> 02:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
it's improving access to information so
 
02:24:56.530 --> 02:24:56.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:58.190 --> 02:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:24:59.750 --> 02:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm checking with New
 
02:25:03.110 --> 02:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal resources
 
02:25:06.710 --> 02:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
um they're already is an established
 
02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:08.030 align:start position:0%
um they're already is an established
mechanism

02:25:08.030 --> 02:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
02:25:10.309 --> 02:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
to be able to acquire that knowledge for
 
02:25:12.770 --> 02:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
somebody who wants it
 
02:25:14.690 --> 02:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
um because the law that's followed again
 
02:25:16.670 --> 02:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
is somebody already mentioned is that
 
02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:18.410 align:start position:0%
is somebody already mentioned is that
yes

02:25:18.410 --> 02:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:25:20.270 --> 02:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
um there has to be transparency of
 
02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:22.010 align:start position:0%
um there has to be transparency of
government

02:25:22.010 --> 02:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:25:24.590 --> 02:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
um and how the taxpayers money is spent
 
02:25:26.450 --> 02:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
and that right is already available
 
02:25:29.469 --> 02:25:29.479 align:start position:0%
under the right to no law
 
02:25:33.650 --> 02:25:33.660 align:start position:0%
so no this this bill putting you know
 
02:25:35.929 --> 02:25:35.939 align:start position:0%
positions of a certain
 
02:25:39.710 --> 02:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
group of people and not everybody who's
 
02:25:41.990 --> 02:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
an employee of the city or the town
 
02:25:50.410 --> 02:25:50.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:52.849 --> 02:25:52.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:25:57.170 --> 02:25:57.180 align:start position:0%
so we just voted this morning to
 
02:25:57.180 --> 02:25:58.849 align:start position:0%
so we just voted this morning to
repeal

02:25:58.849 --> 02:25:58.859 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
making it easier to see
 
02:26:05.150 --> 02:26:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:07.849 --> 02:26:07.859 align:start position:0%
and it feels to me like the same people
 
02:26:11.570 --> 02:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
who thought it was okay to repeal easier
 
02:26:13.910 --> 02:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
access to those payments
 
02:26:16.510 --> 02:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
think we should make it easier to access
 
02:26:18.530 --> 02:26:18.540 align:start position:0%
these salaries
 
02:26:24.349 --> 02:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:26.570 --> 02:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:26:29.990 --> 02:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
um information can be available
 
02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:31.150 align:start position:0%
um information can be available
um

02:26:31.150 --> 02:26:31.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:36.950 --> 02:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
via 91a request but I think it is burden
 
02:26:40.969 --> 02:26:40.979 align:start position:0%
it is a difficult process for many
 
02:26:42.849 --> 02:26:42.859 align:start position:0%
um and that
 
02:26:46.490 --> 02:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
it really is not
 
02:26:49.730 --> 02:26:49.740 align:start position:0%
what the uh intent of this is the the
 
02:26:52.730 --> 02:26:52.740 align:start position:0%
intent of this is to make it uh the
 
02:26:57.590 --> 02:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
information easily accessible to people
 
02:27:00.050 --> 02:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
as several people have mentioned some
 
02:27:01.790 --> 02:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
districts might publish it in their
 
02:27:04.130 --> 02:27:04.140 align:start position:0%
annual report
 
02:27:07.510 --> 02:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
um which is a step forward but I think
 
02:27:11.090 --> 02:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
having it available on the website makes
 
02:27:15.250 --> 02:27:15.260 align:start position:0%
it much more available to people
 
02:27:19.370 --> 02:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
staff you know might well be interested
 
02:27:21.190 --> 02:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
in seeing what
 
02:27:23.950 --> 02:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
administrators are making as opposed to
 
02:27:29.570 --> 02:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:32.809 --> 02:27:32.819 align:start position:0%
represent cascadden that information is
 
02:27:35.030 --> 02:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
made public when a line by line on an
 
02:27:38.450 --> 02:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
item budget presentation is provided to
 
02:27:42.410 --> 02:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
the public so that that is example is is
 
02:27:44.570 --> 02:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
already there
 
02:27:46.849 --> 02:27:46.859 align:start position:0%
um but this bill is also discriminatory
 
02:27:48.410 --> 02:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
you're only targeting a certain group
 
02:27:50.809 --> 02:27:50.819 align:start position:0%
just to create negativity and to make
 
02:27:52.670 --> 02:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
the public school look
 
02:27:55.969 --> 02:27:55.979 align:start position:0%
in a negative light again
 
02:27:58.370 --> 02:27:58.380 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli it is certainly not
 
02:28:01.070 --> 02:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
my intention with this bill to put
 
02:28:03.490 --> 02:28:03.500 align:start position:0%
public schools in any negative light
 
02:28:06.290 --> 02:28:06.300 align:start position:0%
that's not the intention at all the
 
02:28:07.849 --> 02:28:07.859 align:start position:0%
intention is to make salary information
 
02:28:12.110 --> 02:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
available as I said earlier uh teacher
 
02:28:14.630 --> 02:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
salaries are an issue we've seen it over
 
02:28:17.950 --> 02:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
and over again and I think that this
 
02:28:20.630 --> 02:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
would be maybe enlightening information
 
02:28:23.270 --> 02:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
to some teachers working in this school
 
02:28:26.510 --> 02:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
to see how much others in the school are
 
02:28:26.520 --> 02:28:27.530 align:start position:0%
to see how much others in the school are
making

02:28:27.530 --> 02:28:27.540 align:start position:0%
making
 
02:28:29.570 --> 02:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
but it's certainly not an attention to
 
02:28:32.389 --> 02:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
put anybody or anything in a negative
 
02:28:32.399 --> 02:28:34.250 align:start position:0%
put anybody or anything in a negative
light

02:28:34.250 --> 02:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
light
 
02:28:36.370 --> 02:28:36.380 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
02:28:40.010 --> 02:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
just as a response uh teachers know what
 
02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
other teachers are making because it is
 
02:28:43.910 --> 02:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
public information and because it is on
 
02:28:47.389 --> 02:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
a line item budget and and
 
02:28:47.399 --> 02:28:48.349 align:start position:0%
a line item budget and and
um

02:28:48.349 --> 02:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:51.110 --> 02:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
it's also collective bargaining so
 
02:28:52.910 --> 02:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
teachers are well aware of what other
 
02:28:55.250 --> 02:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
teachers are making
 
02:28:57.230 --> 02:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
I'd like to take a moment and then
 
02:28:59.510 --> 02:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative luno you can speak I
 
02:29:01.570 --> 02:29:01.580 align:start position:0%
brought in my town report right here
 
02:29:04.309 --> 02:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
everything is in the town report there's
 
02:29:07.490 --> 02:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
12 pages of salaries in here name of the
 
02:29:09.590 --> 02:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
individual I'm not the individuals
 
02:29:12.170 --> 02:29:12.180 align:start position:0%
getting paid and the position the person
 
02:29:15.790 --> 02:29:15.800 align:start position:0%
is in not just for teachers it even has
 
02:29:19.010 --> 02:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
substitute teachers listed in this it
 
02:29:22.250 --> 02:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
has any any dollars which go out for any
 
02:29:24.830 --> 02:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
other reason be it a stipend for
 
02:29:27.230 --> 02:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
athletics or it be it
 
02:29:30.469 --> 02:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
um a bonus a holiday bonus which they
 
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
had and I found that over the years and
 
02:29:35.870 --> 02:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
just open up what this is helpful
 
02:29:38.090 --> 02:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
information in terms of when you're on
 
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
the advice budget advisory committee to
 
02:29:42.710 --> 02:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
be looking at this and know where you
 
02:29:47.330 --> 02:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
are what I learned from this is that
 
02:29:50.349 --> 02:29:50.359 align:start position:0%
my Town's not competitive
 
02:29:53.630 --> 02:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
with towns south of us like Lebanon or
 
02:29:55.910 --> 02:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
even with Littleton
 
02:29:58.910 --> 02:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
um or Hanover we are for the same
 
02:30:01.070 --> 02:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
teaching job in many some cases of
 
02:30:03.650 --> 02:30:03.660 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars shy and this is
 
02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why we have our I
 
02:30:07.969 --> 02:30:07.979 align:start position:0%
have a shortage of teachers in math and
 
02:30:10.670 --> 02:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
science up my neck of the woods and so
 
02:30:14.150 --> 02:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
this is in a way I see as informative to
 
02:30:17.389 --> 02:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
the public yes you know we we have to
 
02:30:20.929 --> 02:30:20.939 align:start position:0%
address this issue and so because it's
 
02:30:23.570 --> 02:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
here on all these 12 Pages it goes and
 
02:30:25.429 --> 02:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
goes and goes
 
02:30:27.590 --> 02:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't see any reason why putting on
 
02:30:29.929 --> 02:30:29.939 align:start position:0%
a web is going to make much difference
 
02:30:32.450 --> 02:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
um I for one feel that we're transparent
 
02:30:34.550 --> 02:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
enough with this this goes out to every
 
02:30:37.610 --> 02:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
person going to the polls to vote or you
 
02:30:39.410 --> 02:30:39.420 align:start position:0%
can get a copy at the Town Office since
 
02:30:40.610 --> 02:30:40.620 align:start position:0%
they are available
 
02:30:40.620 --> 02:30:42.050 align:start position:0%
they are available
so

02:30:42.050 --> 02:30:42.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:30:45.050 --> 02:30:45.060 align:start position:0%
um I I see this as
 
02:30:45.060 --> 02:30:46.250 align:start position:0%
um I I see this as
um

02:30:46.250 --> 02:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:50.030 --> 02:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
a bill that is trying to do what some
 
02:30:52.730 --> 02:30:52.740 align:start position:0%
districts are already doing I can't say
 
02:30:55.969 --> 02:30:55.979 align:start position:0%
that this is on on by way of a PDF on
 
02:30:58.730 --> 02:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
the website or not but I can guarantee
 
02:31:00.410 --> 02:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
you that we put it every year I've lived
 
02:31:02.450 --> 02:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
there right in this book
 
02:31:04.070 --> 02:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
we used to put in them people are
 
02:31:05.889 --> 02:31:05.899 align:start position:0%
delinquenting their taxes in the thing
 
02:31:09.770 --> 02:31:09.780 align:start position:0%
and that's now since gone but this
 
02:31:09.780 --> 02:31:10.790 align:start position:0%
and that's now since gone but this
remains

02:31:10.790 --> 02:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
remains
 
02:31:13.429 --> 02:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
representative luno thank you very much
 
02:31:16.969 --> 02:31:16.979 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and and thanks for um um you
 
02:31:19.010 --> 02:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
know for for showing us that uh
 
02:31:22.190 --> 02:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton has done that for um for years
 
02:31:24.770 --> 02:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
as well and uh and they don't need a law
 
02:31:27.469 --> 02:31:27.479 align:start position:0%
in the plate on the books to um to do
 
02:31:30.770 --> 02:31:30.780 align:start position:0%
that but but but what one of the things
 
02:31:32.150 --> 02:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
you talked about
 
02:31:33.650 --> 02:31:33.660 align:start position:0%
um on that
 
02:31:36.530 --> 02:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
um representative Vlad was uh was the
 
02:31:40.730 --> 02:31:40.740 align:start position:0%
the various um uh Personnel that are
 
02:31:43.070 --> 02:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
that are that are disclosed in there and
 
02:31:45.050 --> 02:31:45.060 align:start position:0%
that their um their teachers their
 
02:31:47.090 --> 02:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
support staff their their instructional
 
02:31:52.130 --> 02:31:52.140 align:start position:0%
age Librarians principals uh uh uh I I
 
02:31:54.230 --> 02:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
don't know how far that goes if it goes
 
02:31:57.170 --> 02:31:57.180 align:start position:0%
to um to uh people that may be employed
 
02:31:59.450 --> 02:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
by the district uh to that provide
 
02:32:02.570 --> 02:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
transportation uh if it includes if it
 
02:32:04.550 --> 02:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
includes those positions and I'm
 
02:32:07.010 --> 02:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
wondering if it might also include
 
02:32:08.630 --> 02:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
um a position of let's say somebody
 
02:32:11.450 --> 02:32:11.460 align:start position:0%
that's providing transportation for or a
 
02:32:14.510 --> 02:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
child with with an IEP being being
 
02:32:18.650 --> 02:32:18.660 align:start position:0%
transported to a a you know outside of
 
02:32:21.530 --> 02:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
the district because from time to time I
 
02:32:24.830 --> 02:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
think those positions are are uh are
 
02:32:27.530 --> 02:32:27.540 align:start position:0%
filled by uh by members of that
 
02:32:30.830 --> 02:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
student's family and um and so whether
 
02:32:33.290 --> 02:32:33.300 align:start position:0%
that would be whether those positions
 
02:32:36.950 --> 02:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
would have to be disclosed uh by the the
 
02:32:36.960 --> 02:32:38.510 align:start position:0%
would have to be disclosed uh by the the
the

02:32:38.510 --> 02:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:32:42.530 --> 02:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
um policy in 553 well I can look at one
 
02:32:44.650 --> 02:32:44.660 align:start position:0%
of them right now I won't say the name
 
02:32:48.370 --> 02:32:48.380 align:start position:0%
uh it says position special needs bus
 
02:32:51.530 --> 02:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
monitor non-contract hours Insurance
 
02:32:55.130 --> 02:32:55.140 align:start position:0%
stipend employee holiday bonus preschool
 
02:32:57.830 --> 02:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh screening and it lists the the money
 
02:33:00.290 --> 02:33:00.300 align:start position:0%
that this individual receives
 
02:33:03.349 --> 02:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
right right and and you know so my
 
02:33:06.469 --> 02:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
concern is that by by clonifying it that
 
02:33:08.990 --> 02:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
that we the way is the way it is here
 
02:33:12.590 --> 02:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
that that it may compel disclosure of a
 
02:33:14.570 --> 02:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
student's mom or dad who may be driving
 
02:33:17.090 --> 02:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
transporting them into uh to an out of
 
02:33:17.100 --> 02:33:17.929 align:start position:0%
transporting them into uh to an out of

um

02:33:18.650 --> 02:33:18.660 align:start position:0%

representative
 
02:33:26.570 --> 02:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I don't think this is
 
02:33:30.770 --> 02:33:30.780 align:start position:0%
needed it's already in uh in law and it
 
02:33:35.750 --> 02:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
was cited uh 94 c9a already gives the
 
02:33:38.210 --> 02:33:38.220 align:start position:0%
opportunity for school districts if they
 
02:33:40.790 --> 02:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
if they in fact want to do this to have
 
02:33:43.610 --> 02:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
a warrant article and put it before the
 
02:33:46.070 --> 02:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
the town if they want to do this they
 
02:33:47.870 --> 02:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
can vote it in for that particular town
 
02:33:51.469 --> 02:33:51.479 align:start position:0%
so I don't think uh this uh Universal
 
02:33:54.230 --> 02:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
application for it is necessary and I'll
 
02:33:56.510 --> 02:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
be voting no on this OTP
 
02:33:58.610 --> 02:33:58.620 align:start position:0%

portiello
 
02:34:03.889 --> 02:34:03.899 align:start position:0%
so representative Ladd was showing us
 
02:34:06.550 --> 02:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
the annual report that's really thick
 
02:34:10.250 --> 02:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
not all annual reports
 
02:34:12.469 --> 02:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
provide the information on school
 
02:34:14.750 --> 02:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
salaries so
 
02:34:17.929 --> 02:34:17.939 align:start position:0%
um just wanted to speak to to that again
 
02:34:20.230 --> 02:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
this improves access to the information
 
02:34:25.610 --> 02:34:25.620 align:start position:0%
but also to representative Damon's
 
02:34:27.710 --> 02:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
pointing out that there's a
 
02:34:29.950 --> 02:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
contradiction in
 
02:34:33.410 --> 02:34:33.420 align:start position:0%
voting for House Bill 71
 
02:34:33.420 --> 02:34:34.070 align:start position:0%
voting for House Bill 71
um

02:34:34.070 --> 02:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:38.809 --> 02:34:38.819 align:start position:0%
and then not supporting this uh one of
 
02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
the I was just looking at my notes for
 
02:34:42.050 --> 02:34:42.060 align:start position:0%
71 and something that resonated with me
 
02:34:44.150 --> 02:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
was that house bill 71 was requested by
 
02:34:46.790 --> 02:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
the doe and that that along with other
 
02:34:49.670 --> 02:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
things made me vote that way so there
 
02:34:51.050 --> 02:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
was no you know I don't think there's
 
02:34:53.450 --> 02:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
any hypocrisy involved in voting one way
 
02:34:58.250 --> 02:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
on 71 and then this way on on this bill
 
02:35:00.830 --> 02:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
represent Myler yeah I've got a question
 
02:35:03.290 --> 02:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at my notes
 
02:35:05.030 --> 02:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
and I had
 
02:35:08.150 --> 02:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
on 224
 
02:35:11.389 --> 02:35:11.399 align:start position:0%
an exact session
 
02:35:13.670 --> 02:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
and I had an Ito
 
02:35:16.910 --> 02:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
by paternal and cordelli
 
02:35:18.889 --> 02:35:18.899 align:start position:0%
nine to one
 
02:35:20.690 --> 02:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
am I the only one that has that in my
 
02:35:23.290 --> 02:35:23.300 align:start position:0%
notes five six what Bill are you on
 
02:35:26.210 --> 02:35:26.220 align:start position:0%
that's 563 oh I'm in the wrong way
 
02:35:29.450 --> 02:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you very much I can't
 
02:35:32.750 --> 02:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
remember in many 901s yeah okay thank
 
02:35:37.370 --> 02:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:39.889 --> 02:35:39.899 align:start position:0%
I see this bill as something that should
 
02:35:39.899 --> 02:35:40.730 align:start position:0%
I see this bill as something that should
be

02:35:40.730 --> 02:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:35:43.370 --> 02:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
not passed because it should be up to
 
02:35:46.429 --> 02:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
local communities what approach to
 
02:35:48.050 --> 02:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
communicating the information works for
 
02:35:48.060 --> 02:35:49.070 align:start position:0%
communicating the information works for
them

02:35:49.070 --> 02:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:35:52.130 --> 02:35:52.140 align:start position:0%
we do we defer lots of things to local
 
02:35:54.770 --> 02:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
control and I think this belongs there
 
02:35:56.330 --> 02:35:56.340 align:start position:0%
I in fact think in the nine Town
 
02:35:58.070 --> 02:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
District that I represent
 
02:36:00.590 --> 02:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
there would be different decisions as to
 
02:36:01.730 --> 02:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
how the information would be
 
02:36:04.429 --> 02:36:04.439 align:start position:0%
communicated partly related to the small
 
02:36:06.969 --> 02:36:06.979 align:start position:0%
population size
 
02:36:09.469 --> 02:36:09.479 align:start position:0%
invasiveness to professionals that we
 
02:36:11.570 --> 02:36:11.580 align:start position:0%
should respect
 
02:36:14.030 --> 02:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
further discussion reps in Woodcock
 
02:36:16.429 --> 02:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Carol I just a follow-up on
 
02:36:18.290 --> 02:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
your Commerce actually
 
02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
um I think the difference between a
 
02:36:20.510 --> 02:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
document you're looking at
 
02:36:23.330 --> 02:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
representative ad and this bill is that
 
02:36:26.929 --> 02:36:26.939 align:start position:0%
is a non-discriminatory non-biased wide
 
02:36:29.330 --> 02:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
open every single person that's the way
 
02:36:31.610 --> 02:36:31.620 align:start position:0%
it is this bill
 
02:36:34.969 --> 02:36:34.979 align:start position:0%
hones in on one particular group of
 
02:36:34.979 --> 02:36:35.750 align:start position:0%
hones in on one particular group of
people

02:36:35.750 --> 02:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:36:38.750 --> 02:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh which makes it a bigger concern in
 
02:36:40.849 --> 02:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
Conway we have similar to yours
 
02:36:43.010 --> 02:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
representative ad a very detailed
 
02:36:45.290 --> 02:36:45.300 align:start position:0%
document but that's but that's not this
 
02:36:47.929 --> 02:36:47.939 align:start position:0%
this is one group of people isolated out
 
02:36:52.370 --> 02:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
uh for I think uh and and I'll take Glen
 
02:36:54.050 --> 02:36:54.060 align:start position:0%
at his word that's not a negative intent
 
02:36:55.929 --> 02:36:55.939 align:start position:0%
but surely it could be a negative action
 
02:36:58.790 --> 02:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:37:01.730 --> 02:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli uh thank you and uh
 
02:37:06.530 --> 02:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:09.469 --> 02:37:09.479 align:start position:0%
um uh yeah this is the education
 
02:37:12.469 --> 02:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
committee so I was bringing forward a
 
02:37:15.650 --> 02:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
bill related to uh school
 
02:37:18.469 --> 02:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
um uh salaries uh
 
02:37:21.170 --> 02:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
um you know if I want next year to bring
 
02:37:23.750 --> 02:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
a town salary position
 
02:37:25.070 --> 02:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm sure that will go to
 
02:37:30.530 --> 02:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:33.050 --> 02:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:37:34.610 --> 02:37:34.620 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask the court where where
 
02:37:37.250 --> 02:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
are we getting the uh
 
02:37:39.230 --> 02:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
the idea that we're only talking
 
02:37:44.469 --> 02:37:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
I wasn't referencing just teachers I
 
02:37:48.650 --> 02:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
found that where this not only only
 
02:37:52.010 --> 02:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
deals with school boards uh School staff
 
02:37:54.770 --> 02:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
and position names that's my point it's
 
02:38:01.190 --> 02:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:01.200 --> 02:38:02.450 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:38:02.450 --> 02:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:38:04.670 --> 02:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
this book that I have it even puts down
 
02:38:06.530 --> 02:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
the school board members in their
 
02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:17.170 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:38:17.170 --> 02:38:17.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:19.849 --> 02:38:19.859 align:start position:0%
town does it as well
 
02:38:21.889 --> 02:38:21.899 align:start position:0%
um has the positions and everything but
 
02:38:24.950 --> 02:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
the PDF is available on the website so
 
02:38:27.230 --> 02:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
you can access it there so I'm wondering
 
02:38:30.230 --> 02:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
if other accounts also put that book on
 
02:38:32.270 --> 02:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
the websites and that way the
 
02:38:35.990 --> 02:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
information would be accessible
 
02:38:40.790 --> 02:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:44.210 --> 02:38:44.220 align:start position:0%
um Charles who put it up as a PDF or in
 
02:38:46.130 --> 02:38:46.140 align:start position:0%
whatever form electronically are already
 
02:38:49.190 --> 02:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
doing it that's great so we passed this
 
02:38:51.770 --> 02:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
and they'll say check already done they
 
02:38:53.630 --> 02:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
don't we're not asking any more work or
 
02:38:56.090 --> 02:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
anything from them I think it's the
 
02:38:58.910 --> 02:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
towns that aren't doing it it's for the
 
02:39:00.710 --> 02:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
citizens who want to have that
 
02:39:03.349 --> 02:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
information and don't have it and so I
 
02:39:05.090 --> 02:39:05.100 align:start position:0%
think that's what this is directed at
 
02:39:07.250 --> 02:39:07.260 align:start position:0%
not the towns who are doing it they're
 
02:39:10.849 --> 02:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:15.170 --> 02:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
is this a local control issue or is this
 
02:39:18.469 --> 02:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:20.870 --> 02:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
how many how many districts in the state
 
02:39:25.309 --> 02:39:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:27.290 --> 02:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
those are questions which I don't have
 
02:39:28.610 --> 02:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
the answers to
 
02:39:28.620 --> 02:39:30.110 align:start position:0%
the answers to
but

02:39:30.110 --> 02:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:39:32.389 --> 02:39:32.399 align:start position:0%
if in fact it's not happening in a

02:41:44.750 --> 02:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
discussion from the maker the motion
 
02:41:46.610 --> 02:41:46.620 align:start position:0%
representative Luna thank you very much
 
02:41:50.150 --> 02:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chair my concern is that the um you
 
02:41:53.990 --> 02:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
know unlike the uh the voluntary uh uh
 
02:41:59.150 --> 02:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
or or local control uh policy for uh for
 
02:42:02.570 --> 02:42:02.580 align:start position:0%
publishing positions and uh and annual
 
02:42:05.690 --> 02:42:05.700 align:start position:0%
or hourly salaries or compensation
 
02:42:08.510 --> 02:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
um that uh that this um
 
02:42:13.070 --> 02:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
policy in 553 is so rigid that uh that
 
02:42:15.770 --> 02:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
it would not give a school district any
 
02:42:19.370 --> 02:42:19.380 align:start position:0%
discretion but to disclose the names of
 
02:42:22.190 --> 02:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
um of of parents or Guardians who may be
 
02:42:24.950 --> 02:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
compensated for transporting their their
 
02:42:28.130 --> 02:42:28.140 align:start position:0%
student uh with an IEP to and out of
 
02:42:31.190 --> 02:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
District placement and um and oftentimes
 
02:42:34.330 --> 02:42:34.340 align:start position:0%
these students are are
 
02:42:39.050 --> 02:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
being receiving specialized services at
 
02:42:40.610 --> 02:42:40.620 align:start position:0%
um in some cases I know because we've
 
02:42:43.730 --> 02:42:43.740 align:start position:0%
heard this in committee at uh at six
 
02:42:46.550 --> 02:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
figure costs to the community and
 
02:42:50.090 --> 02:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
um and I know that when I was on both
 
02:42:51.410 --> 02:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
the school board and the budget
 
02:42:55.250 --> 02:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
committee that uh that we um we would
 
02:42:57.770 --> 02:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
redact information that was shared with
 
02:42:59.809 --> 02:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
the budget committee if a student's
 
02:43:03.290 --> 02:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
identity was going to be be exposed to
 
02:43:07.190 --> 02:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
that and I'm just afraid that 553 would
 
02:43:10.429 --> 02:43:10.439 align:start position:0%
not provide any discretion question for
 
02:43:13.190 --> 02:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
a school district to be able to uh to
 
02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:14.389 align:start position:0%
a school district to be able to uh to
protect

02:43:14.389 --> 02:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
protect
 
02:43:16.670 --> 02:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
um uh you know a vulnerable student's
 
02:43:19.790 --> 02:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
identity and um and I just think this is
 
02:43:23.690 --> 02:43:23.700 align:start position:0%
this is a terribly broad policy that
 
02:43:27.550 --> 02:43:27.560 align:start position:0%
deserves to be itl'd represent cordelli
 
02:43:29.510 --> 02:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:43:31.849 --> 02:43:31.859 align:start position:0%
um there's nothing in here about
 
02:43:31.859 --> 02:43:34.010 align:start position:0%
um there's nothing in here about
requiring

02:43:34.010 --> 02:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
requiring
 
02:43:39.830 --> 02:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
um the uh the purpose of the payment I
 
02:43:41.770 --> 02:43:41.780 align:start position:0%
think Transportation
 
02:43:44.750 --> 02:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
would be simple enough in cases like
 
02:43:49.610 --> 02:43:49.620 align:start position:0%
that and I think that districts would
 
02:43:51.670 --> 02:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
certainly respect
 
02:43:54.889 --> 02:43:54.899 align:start position:0%
confidentiality I know of a parent who
 
02:43:54.899 --> 02:43:56.770 align:start position:0%
confidentiality I know of a parent who
is

02:43:56.770 --> 02:43:56.780 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:44:00.170 --> 02:44:00.180 align:start position:0%
transporting under contract with the
 
02:44:03.410 --> 02:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
district their child for uh dyslexia
 
02:44:03.420 --> 02:44:05.750 align:start position:0%
district their child for uh dyslexia
instruction

02:44:05.750 --> 02:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
02:44:09.650 --> 02:44:09.660 align:start position:0%
um and I would think that districts
 
02:44:12.770 --> 02:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
would be wise enough not to say that
 
02:44:15.590 --> 02:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
they're transporting ex person is
 
02:44:18.849 --> 02:44:18.859 align:start position:0%
transporting for IEP
 
02:44:24.610 --> 02:44:24.620 align:start position:0%
Transportation or for other types of
 
02:44:26.809 --> 02:44:26.819 align:start position:0%
transportation that might you know
 
02:44:29.290 --> 02:44:29.300 align:start position:0%
reveal confidentiality
 
02:44:34.130 --> 02:44:34.140 align:start position:0%
so I don't see that as an issue really
 
02:44:37.190 --> 02:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative yeah
 
02:44:38.990 --> 02:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
sure thank you very much Mr chair and
 
02:44:41.809 --> 02:44:41.819 align:start position:0%
and thank you um representative cordelli
 
02:44:44.570 --> 02:44:44.580 align:start position:0%
for suggesting that but I'm just not uh
 
02:44:47.809 --> 02:44:47.819 align:start position:0%
I I don't see it in the in the in in the
 
02:44:50.510 --> 02:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
language here in 553 that would give a
 
02:44:52.670 --> 02:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
school district any discretion other
 
02:44:55.670 --> 02:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
than to publish on each school or the
 
02:44:58.550 --> 02:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
district website a complete list of all
 
02:45:00.889 --> 02:45:00.899 align:start position:0%
position names and their annual or
 
02:45:04.190 --> 02:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
hourly salaries and um and I think you
 
02:45:07.490 --> 02:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
know to the extent that um that that the
 
02:45:10.130 --> 02:45:10.140 align:start position:0%
Department of Education or maybe uh
 
02:45:11.809 --> 02:45:11.819 align:start position:0%
somebody that feels that a school
 
02:45:15.830 --> 02:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
district is not uh complying with the
 
02:45:18.650 --> 02:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
law If This Were to become law to the uh
 
02:45:22.910 --> 02:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
to the the fullest extent that um that
 
02:45:25.610 --> 02:45:25.620 align:start position:0%
this discretion that that school boards
 
02:45:28.070 --> 02:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
have right now when they when they go
 
02:45:30.410 --> 02:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
ahead and and print lists like the uh
 
02:45:32.630 --> 02:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
like what is in the Haverhill Town
 
02:45:36.290 --> 02:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
report that uh that they'll have no
 
02:45:38.630 --> 02:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
choice but to disclose the names of
 
02:45:41.570 --> 02:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
parents who are transporting their child
 
02:45:44.330 --> 02:45:44.340 align:start position:0%
um as a result of an IEP and in a small
 
02:45:46.490 --> 02:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
town as representative Damon was
 
02:45:48.590 --> 02:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
suggesting people put two and two
 
02:45:51.590 --> 02:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
together and uh know what's going on
 
02:45:53.570 --> 02:45:53.580 align:start position:0%
Representative cordelli no thank you
 
02:45:55.910 --> 02:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in here about a
 
02:45:58.309 --> 02:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
requirement to post individual names
 
02:46:03.770 --> 02:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:06.770 --> 02:46:06.780 align:start position:0%
represent Damon
 
02:46:09.349 --> 02:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
in small towns where you only have one
 
02:46:11.210 --> 02:46:11.220 align:start position:0%
person in the position
 
02:46:13.010 --> 02:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
you may be listing it only as a position
 
02:46:16.670 --> 02:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
but it is obviously that person
 
02:46:16.680 --> 02:46:20.389 align:start position:0%
but it is obviously that person
representative

02:46:20.389 --> 02:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:23.270 --> 02:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
Transportation provider is a position
 
02:46:27.469 --> 02:46:27.479 align:start position:0%
name it doesn't need any more than that
 
02:46:29.210 --> 02:46:29.220 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:46:31.550 --> 02:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
02:46:34.130 --> 02:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
yes in in reading the bill it says
 
02:46:36.590 --> 02:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
position names and their annual or
 
02:46:38.929 --> 02:46:38.939 align:start position:0%
hourly salary
 
02:46:38.939 --> 02:46:39.590 align:start position:0%
hourly salary
um

02:46:39.590 --> 02:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:41.929 --> 02:46:41.939 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean it's I mean it doesn't
 
02:46:44.510 --> 02:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't save positions it says
 
02:46:46.490 --> 02:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
position names
 
02:46:46.500 --> 02:46:48.530 align:start position:0%

Balboni yes representative cascadden yes
 
02:47:58.849 --> 02:47:58.859 align:start position:0%
representative Damon yes
 
02:48:01.010 --> 02:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
chairman Ladd no
 
02:48:03.830 --> 02:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
10 years 10 days
 
02:48:08.950 --> 02:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:19.010 --> 02:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:19.020 --> 02:48:20.090 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:48:20.090 --> 02:48:20.100 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:48:23.090 --> 02:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
um the reason why I feel that I would
 
02:48:28.210 --> 02:48:28.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:33.710 --> 02:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
this is being done and I believe that uh
 
02:48:35.270 --> 02:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it's being done in all
 
02:48:37.610 --> 02:48:37.620 align:start position:0%
towns but our cities but they have the
 
02:48:39.590 --> 02:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
capability to do that and they don't
 
02:48:42.650 --> 02:48:42.660 align:start position:0%
have any anything saying they shouldn't
 
02:48:44.210 --> 02:48:44.220 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:48:46.910 --> 02:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
I I believe we're stepping the turf of
 
02:48:48.950 --> 02:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
local control
 
02:48:51.650 --> 02:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
and of a school board
 
02:48:54.889 --> 02:48:54.899 align:start position:0%
um or a municipal form of government a
 
02:48:57.550 --> 02:48:57.560 align:start position:0%
select border or a city council
 
02:49:01.190 --> 02:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
I believe that the this decision is a
 
02:49:02.929 --> 02:49:02.939 align:start position:0%
local decision if somebody doesn't like
 
02:49:04.490 --> 02:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
what's going on the local level then
 
02:49:07.370 --> 02:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
they have to communicate it there I've
 
02:49:10.190 --> 02:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
not seen enough information to convince
 
02:49:13.190 --> 02:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
me that this is a Statewide issue
 
02:49:15.830 --> 02:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
so that's why I present the motion to
 
02:49:18.889 --> 02:49:18.899 align:start position:0%
retain one second
 
02:49:24.710 --> 02:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:26.990 --> 02:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
further discussion can we uh do a hand
 
02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:30.290 align:start position:0%
further discussion can we uh do a hand
vote

02:49:30.290 --> 02:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:33.830 --> 02:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
per routine you can do that
 
02:49:36.230 --> 02:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
yeah I think we're going to get a I
 
02:49:38.389 --> 02:49:38.399 align:start position:0%
think that you know I've been done
 
02:49:41.030 --> 02:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
retain by showing of hands before uh
 
02:49:43.010 --> 02:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
seeing it it doesn't go anywhere
 
02:49:45.770 --> 02:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
other than for us
 
02:49:45.780 --> 02:49:48.110 align:start position:0%
other than for us
so

02:49:48.110 --> 02:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:49:50.990 --> 02:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
02:49:53.090 --> 02:49:53.100 align:start position:0%
okay Madam clerk would you ask for the
 
02:49:54.710 --> 02:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
hand vote
 
02:49:59.889 --> 02:49:59.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:02.990 --> 02:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
both hands those that are in favor of
 
02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.270 align:start position:0%
both hands those that are in favor of
retention

02:50:05.270 --> 02:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
retention
 
02:50:08.150 --> 02:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
those who are in favor of retention okay
 
02:50:09.950 --> 02:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
okay and then I count
 
02:50:14.030 --> 02:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:17.929 align:start position:0%
 
five

02:50:17.929 --> 02:50:17.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:22.429 --> 02:50:22.439 align:start position:0%
seven eight nine ten eleven
 
02:50:25.309 --> 02:50:25.319 align:start position:0%
did I do it yeah everybody this is new
 
02:50:25.319 --> 02:50:26.450 align:start position:0%
did I do it yeah everybody this is new
okay

02:50:26.450 --> 02:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:50:28.670 --> 02:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
so the bill has retained
 
02:50:31.130 --> 02:50:31.140 align:start position:0%
in committee
 
02:50:33.710 --> 02:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
all right the next one down is the last
 
02:50:36.770 --> 02:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
one for today 628 requiring certain
 
02:50:38.750 --> 02:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
non-public schools or education service
 
02:50:41.270 --> 02:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
providers that accept public funds to
 
02:50:43.130 --> 02:50:43.140 align:start position:0%
perform background checks on all
 
02:50:47.450 --> 02:50:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:47.460 --> 02:50:49.309 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:50:49.309 --> 02:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:50:52.250 --> 02:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
did you have a motion here
 
02:50:56.270 --> 02:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
or I let's see I who
 
02:51:02.690 --> 02:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:04.550 --> 02:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
okay we have a motion made by represent
 
02:51:06.410 --> 02:51:06.420 align:start position:0%
Lucas itl
 
02:51:07.610 --> 02:51:07.620 align:start position:0%
who seconded that on that side
 
02:51:09.230 --> 02:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald
 
02:51:11.270 --> 02:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
reps and luck is do you want to speak to
 
02:51:15.290 --> 02:51:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:15.300 --> 02:51:18.530 align:start position:0%
 
sure

02:51:18.530 --> 02:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:21.050 --> 02:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
okay I had to find my bill I was still
 
02:51:22.790 --> 02:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
on the last one
 
02:51:22.800 --> 02:51:24.469 align:start position:0%
on the last one
um

02:51:24.469 --> 02:51:24.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:28.429 --> 02:51:28.439 align:start position:0%
the problem with this it talks about for
 
02:51:29.750 --> 02:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
one thing
 
02:51:34.570 --> 02:51:34.580 align:start position:0%
um volunteers and what exactly does that
 
02:51:34.580 --> 02:51:36.230 align:start position:0%
um volunteers and what exactly does that
entail

02:51:36.230 --> 02:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
entail
 
02:51:39.110 --> 02:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
but the other thing is if you read this
 
02:51:41.450 --> 02:51:41.460 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do there's two two
 
02:51:43.190 --> 02:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
big issues to me we're going to be
 
02:51:45.710 --> 02:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
background checking parents
 
02:51:48.410 --> 02:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
because there are a lot of co-ops where
 
02:51:49.969 --> 02:51:49.979 align:start position:0%
the parents all get together and the
 
02:51:51.770 --> 02:51:51.780 align:start position:0%
kids get together and a parent will
 
02:51:53.929 --> 02:51:53.939 align:start position:0%
teach on something that's their
 
02:51:56.150 --> 02:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
specialty perhaps it's something that
 
02:51:58.070 --> 02:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
they do for a living and another parent
 
02:51:59.929 --> 02:51:59.939 align:start position:0%
will teach on their specialty so now
 
02:52:01.910 --> 02:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to be background checking
 
02:52:04.849 --> 02:52:04.859 align:start position:0%
parents and I know there is a lot of
 
02:52:07.630 --> 02:52:07.640 align:start position:0%
um objections amongst the community
 
02:52:10.309 --> 02:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
about background checking parents but
 
02:52:12.230 --> 02:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
the other part of that is I'm not sure
 
02:52:14.290 --> 02:52:14.300 align:start position:0%
we have yet figured out how we're doing
 
02:52:16.969 --> 02:52:16.979 align:start position:0%
all of these background checks and the
 
02:52:19.429 --> 02:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
people who come in as volunteers to
 
02:52:22.670 --> 02:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
prevent to present a program for one
 
02:52:24.590 --> 02:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
time or two times
 
02:52:26.929 --> 02:52:26.939 align:start position:0%
do we get background checks and who does
 
02:52:28.849 --> 02:52:28.859 align:start position:0%
the background checks and if it's not an
 
02:52:31.849 --> 02:52:31.859 align:start position:0%
organized actual official school but
 
02:52:34.010 --> 02:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
just a co-op
 
02:52:35.870 --> 02:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
but some of those kids might be
 
02:52:37.690 --> 02:52:37.700 align:start position:0%
receiving money for one thing or another
 
02:52:41.090 --> 02:52:41.100 align:start position:0%
then that counts by this bill but the
 
02:52:43.250 --> 02:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
question is
 
02:52:45.290 --> 02:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
um who does the background check where
 
02:52:48.230 --> 02:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
does it go we've heard a lot of issues
 
02:52:53.750 --> 02:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:56.450 --> 02:52:56.460 align:start position:0%
the department of safety explaining how
 
02:52:57.769 --> 02:52:57.779 align:start position:0%
they can't just give that information
 
02:53:00.650 --> 02:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
out to anybody it has to go to an
 
02:53:03.170 --> 02:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
official at a school or School depart
 
02:53:06.469 --> 02:53:06.479 align:start position:0%
we're still working on how to do that so
 
02:53:09.290 --> 02:53:09.300 align:start position:0%
I don't see how this can even be done
 
02:53:14.330 --> 02:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
it's got way too many flaws thank you
 
02:53:17.870 --> 02:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:22.010 --> 02:53:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:25.790 --> 02:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:25.800 --> 02:53:27.130 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:53:27.130 --> 02:53:27.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:32.990 --> 02:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
as service providers begin to expand
 
02:53:34.730 --> 02:53:34.740 align:start position:0%
one of the responsibilities this
 
02:53:36.170 --> 02:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
committee has
 
02:53:40.490 --> 02:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:43.070 --> 02:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
and right now
 
02:53:44.990 --> 02:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps you have it I haven't seen it in
 
02:53:46.910 --> 02:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
this committee yet I have no idea what
 
02:53:49.429 --> 02:53:49.439 align:start position:0%
the volume of service providers is I
 
02:53:52.010 --> 02:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
don't know who they are
 
02:53:55.490 --> 02:53:55.500 align:start position:0%
where they are what they do
 
02:53:57.410 --> 02:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
and it would seem to me that this this
 
02:54:01.309 --> 02:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
bill provides some sense of uh Safe
 
02:54:01.319 --> 02:54:02.630 align:start position:0%
bill provides some sense of uh Safe
Harbor

02:54:02.630 --> 02:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
Harbor
 
02:54:05.210 --> 02:54:05.220 align:start position:0%
to look at the issue
 
02:54:08.690 --> 02:54:08.700 align:start position:0%
of where our service providers are and
 
02:54:10.790 --> 02:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
volunteers so there is a definition of
 
02:54:13.849 --> 02:54:13.859 align:start position:0%
volunteer in in the law right now so
 
02:54:15.349 --> 02:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about somebody who
 
02:54:17.090 --> 02:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
comes in from a volunteer standpoint
 
02:54:20.389 --> 02:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
somebody who comes in and is there for a
 
02:54:22.670 --> 02:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
single shot we used in our as we
 
02:54:24.710 --> 02:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
said if Yo-Yo Ma comes in and wants to
 
02:54:27.889 --> 02:54:27.899 align:start position:0%
do an instruction uh for a day he's not
 
02:54:30.110 --> 02:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
going to have to have a a criminal
 
02:54:31.730 --> 02:54:31.740 align:start position:0%
records check
 
02:54:34.130 --> 02:54:34.140 align:start position:0%
so the law already defines what a
 
02:54:35.570 --> 02:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
volunteer is
 
02:54:38.870 --> 02:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
and so I I just think that this bill as
 
02:54:40.790 --> 02:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
again going back to some of the other
 
02:54:43.010 --> 02:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
stuff we've had on the issue of school
 
02:54:45.469 --> 02:54:45.479 align:start position:0%
choice if we're going to move in this
 
02:54:47.630 --> 02:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
direction there ought to be some sense
 
02:54:50.389 --> 02:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
of understanding from a from a legal
 
02:54:52.969 --> 02:54:52.979 align:start position:0%
standpoint of making sure our kids are
 
02:54:55.790 --> 02:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
safe now I understand the argument I
 
02:54:58.130 --> 02:54:58.140 align:start position:0%
truly understand the argument that well
 
02:54:59.450 --> 02:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
if you've got parents there they
 
02:55:01.730 --> 02:55:01.740 align:start position:0%
basically monitor themselves I
 
02:55:04.010 --> 02:55:04.020 align:start position:0%
understand that but you know if you're
 
02:55:09.590 --> 02:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
going to have uh kids go over to the uh
 
02:55:13.490 --> 02:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
um the uh Southeast soccer program for
 
02:55:16.490 --> 02:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
example and as part of the CFE EFA
 
02:55:18.410 --> 02:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
program we don't know what's going on
 
02:55:20.450 --> 02:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
there we don't know who those coaches
 
02:55:23.090 --> 02:55:23.100 align:start position:0%
are we don't know what their background
 
02:55:25.790 --> 02:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
is and yet we're going to have our kids
 
02:55:28.130 --> 02:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
go there it would seem to me that that
 
02:55:29.809 --> 02:55:29.819 align:start position:0%
it's responsibility of this committee to
 
02:55:31.370 --> 02:55:31.380 align:start position:0%
begin to look at that and all this bill
 
02:55:33.950 --> 02:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
is trying to do is to provide some sense
 
02:55:36.889 --> 02:55:36.899 align:start position:0%
of of understanding of what that means
 
02:55:39.590 --> 02:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
anybody else that's in school goes to
 
02:55:41.389 --> 02:55:41.399 align:start position:0%
through a background check at some point
 
02:55:42.530 --> 02:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
in time
 
02:55:45.110 --> 02:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
and so I would just I would just hope
 
02:55:46.969 --> 02:55:46.979 align:start position:0%
people would begin to look at the need
 
02:55:48.769 --> 02:55:48.779 align:start position:0%
for at least to begin to look at this
 
02:55:51.769 --> 02:55:51.779 align:start position:0%
thing as the volume of service providers
 
02:55:54.349 --> 02:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
increase thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:55:56.389 --> 02:55:56.399 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden
 
02:55:59.990 --> 02:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you just want to reference the 189
 
02:56:03.290 --> 02:56:03.300 align:start position:0%
13 on um that's already on the books
 
02:56:05.570 --> 02:56:05.580 align:start position:0%
there is a section that addresses
 
02:56:07.370 --> 02:56:07.380 align:start position:0%
um just take a minute to read a few
 
02:56:10.070 --> 02:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
lines a non-public school may elect to
 
02:56:12.050 --> 02:56:12.060 align:start position:0%
require a criminal history records check
 
02:56:14.990 --> 02:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
on selected applicants for employment or
 
02:56:17.990 --> 02:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
selected volunteers and a non-public
 
02:56:19.910 --> 02:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
school that elects to conduct a criminal
 
02:56:22.250 --> 02:56:22.260 align:start position:0%
history records check she'll comply with
 
02:56:23.929 --> 02:56:23.939 align:start position:0%
the procedures and requirements set
 
02:56:26.269 --> 02:56:26.279 align:start position:0%
forth in the sections so it's selected
 
02:56:29.870 --> 02:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
volunteers and selected applicants now
 
02:56:32.870 --> 02:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
when you look at the EFA use of EFA
 
02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:34.070 align:start position:0%
when you look at the EFA use of EFA
funds

02:56:34.070 --> 02:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:56:37.309 --> 02:56:37.319 align:start position:0%
there are several driving schools that
 
02:56:39.650 --> 02:56:39.660 align:start position:0%
are on that list that someone could use
 
02:56:43.490 --> 02:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
their EFA funds for driver's ed
 
02:56:45.830 --> 02:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
so you could potentially have students
 
02:56:48.290 --> 02:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
who are alone with a driver
 
02:56:49.790 --> 02:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
they should have a criminal background
 
02:56:49.800 --> 02:56:51.410 align:start position:0%
they should have a criminal background
check

02:56:51.410 --> 02:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
check
 
02:56:51.420 --> 02:56:52.070 align:start position:0%
check
um

02:56:52.070 --> 02:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:55.370 --> 02:56:55.380 align:start position:0%
Arts music ballet
 
02:57:00.110 --> 02:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
um ticondo or you know any martial arts
 
02:57:02.750 --> 02:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
if there's an individual
 
02:57:06.290 --> 02:57:06.300 align:start position:0%
adult in a student or two students they
 
02:57:08.450 --> 02:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
should have criminal background check
 
02:57:10.969 --> 02:57:10.979 align:start position:0%
I don't think the intent is that the
 
02:57:12.530 --> 02:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
parent who's homeschooling needs a
 
02:57:13.969 --> 02:57:13.979 align:start position:0%
criminal check that's
 
02:57:16.490 --> 02:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
that's not the issue here
 
02:57:18.710 --> 02:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's making sure
 
02:57:21.170 --> 02:57:21.180 align:start position:0%
that it raises the bar on the law that's
 
02:57:23.210 --> 02:57:23.220 align:start position:0%
already on the books that say they may
 
02:57:24.349 --> 02:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
do it
 
02:57:27.650 --> 02:57:27.660 align:start position:0%
instead of now saying we require to do
 
02:57:27.660 --> 02:57:28.429 align:start position:0%
instead of now saying we require to do
it

02:57:28.429 --> 02:57:28.439 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:57:28.439 --> 02:57:29.870 align:start position:0%
it
because

02:57:29.870 --> 02:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:57:31.849 --> 02:57:31.859 align:start position:0%
we want the safety of the kids in
 
02:57:35.150 --> 02:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
whatever scenario they are alone with an
 
02:57:38.030 --> 02:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
adult or with any adult working with
 
02:57:41.269 --> 02:57:41.279 align:start position:0%
kids in some capacity so it is selected
 
02:57:43.730 --> 02:57:43.740 align:start position:0%
volunteers selected applicants
 
02:57:47.389 --> 02:57:47.399 align:start position:0%
I mean EFA whoever oversees that could
 
02:57:49.070 --> 02:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
go through their vendor list and
 
02:57:51.889 --> 02:57:51.899 align:start position:0%
determine how are they providing
 
02:57:55.130 --> 02:57:55.140 align:start position:0%
education to students and determine
 
02:57:56.990 --> 02:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's feasible for a background
 
02:57:59.450 --> 02:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
check or not so that's what this law
 
02:57:59.460 --> 02:58:01.250 align:start position:0%
check or not so that's what this law
does

02:58:01.250 --> 02:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
does
 
02:58:04.370 --> 02:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative lecus
 
02:58:06.710 --> 02:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how they're determining
 
02:58:09.050 --> 02:58:09.060 align:start position:0%
whether it's feasible for a background
 
02:58:10.849 --> 02:58:10.859 align:start position:0%
check given that this says that they
 
02:58:12.830 --> 02:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
have to have one
 
02:58:15.050 --> 02:58:15.060 align:start position:0%
um I also don't understand how having
 
02:58:18.050 --> 02:58:18.060 align:start position:0%
one background check makes any kid safer
 
02:58:19.969 --> 02:58:19.979 align:start position:0%
given that as you said the public
 
02:58:22.190 --> 02:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
schools have to and I can tell you that
 
02:58:24.349 --> 02:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
my daughter's best friend was pregnant
 
02:58:27.469 --> 02:58:27.479 align:start position:0%
from uh one of the teachers in the
 
02:58:30.290 --> 02:58:30.300 align:start position:0%
school and so I don't I think background
 
02:58:32.750 --> 02:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
checks make you feel good I don't think
 
02:58:35.929 --> 02:58:35.939 align:start position:0%
it actually does anything and so far you
 
02:58:37.969 --> 02:58:37.979 align:start position:0%
haven't explained to me however much we
 
02:58:40.969 --> 02:58:40.979 align:start position:0%
want and I agree I would like to know
 
02:58:43.309 --> 02:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
whether somebody is an issue or not
 
02:58:46.370 --> 02:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
before I let my kids go there but I want
 
02:58:48.710 --> 02:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
to know how you're going to if you're
 
02:58:53.269 --> 02:58:53.279 align:start position:0%
say a co-op now Co-op has to provide
 
02:58:56.450 --> 02:58:56.460 align:start position:0%
um money for a space to meet or whatever
 
02:58:58.969 --> 02:58:58.979 align:start position:0%
and so students get charged for that
 
02:59:02.269 --> 02:59:02.279 align:start position:0%
students may use their EFA money to pay
 
02:59:04.969 --> 02:59:04.979 align:start position:0%
for that facility
 
02:59:08.269 --> 02:59:08.279 align:start position:0%
and it may just be parents teaching
 
02:59:10.309 --> 02:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
other kid you know teaching each other's
 
02:59:10.319 --> 02:59:11.230 align:start position:0%
other kid you know teaching each other's
kids

02:59:11.230 --> 02:59:11.240 align:start position:0%
kids
 
02:59:14.870 --> 02:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
how they are not a school how are they
 
02:59:18.290 --> 02:59:18.300 align:start position:0%
going to get the background checks done
 
02:59:20.330 --> 02:59:20.340 align:start position:0%
I mean it's nice to say oh you have to
 
02:59:22.910 --> 02:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
do it but how are you going to do it
 
02:59:25.670 --> 02:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
that's my question I I don't see this as
 
02:59:27.530 --> 02:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
being feasible now eventually we're
 
02:59:29.750 --> 02:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
talking about the Department of
 
02:59:32.150 --> 02:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
Education being able you know have a
 
02:59:34.730 --> 02:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
depository and any of these people could
 
02:59:37.070 --> 02:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
do a background check one time and it
 
02:59:38.990 --> 02:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
would be on record and then people could
 
02:59:40.910 --> 02:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
check but we're not there yet so how can
 
02:59:42.410 --> 02:59:42.420 align:start position:0%
we pass this law
 
02:59:43.969 --> 02:59:43.979 align:start position:0%
when we don't even have a way of
 
02:59:46.490 --> 02:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
implementing it yet thank you
 
02:59:48.590 --> 02:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Tanner
 
02:59:50.389 --> 02:59:50.399 align:start position:0%
then represented cascadden
 
02:59:53.389 --> 02:59:53.399 align:start position:0%
thank you I guess uh just to address a
 
02:59:54.769 --> 02:59:54.779 align:start position:0%
couple of issues one about the
 
02:59:57.590 --> 02:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
volunteers that school districts
 
03:00:00.410 --> 03:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
actually or can make up the what they
 
03:00:02.450 --> 03:00:02.460 align:start position:0%
consider designated volunteers and the
 
03:00:04.550 --> 03:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
vast majority of them that if a
 
03:00:06.590 --> 03:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
volunteer comes in on a one-time basis
 
03:00:10.190 --> 03:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
or if a volunteer is in a situation
 
03:00:12.530 --> 03:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
comes into my classroom I'm in the
 
03:00:16.130 --> 03:00:16.140 align:start position:0%
classroom it's actually supervised what
 
03:00:18.590 --> 03:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
they have volunteers do background
 
03:00:20.450 --> 03:00:20.460 align:start position:0%
checks is when they're one-on-one or one
 
03:00:23.330 --> 03:00:23.340 align:start position:0%
on Two And they come on a regular basis
 
03:00:28.370 --> 03:00:28.380 align:start position:0%
so there's the designated volunteers as
 
03:00:31.630 --> 03:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden said in 189 13
 
03:00:35.170 --> 03:00:35.180 align:start position:0%
has already been talked about camps
 
03:00:38.269 --> 03:00:38.279 align:start position:0%
athletic camps in the summer any kind of
 
03:00:40.670 --> 03:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
camps um have to do these background
 
03:00:43.190 --> 03:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
checks and we actually had someone come
 
03:00:45.950 --> 03:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
and testify that she worked in a co-op
 
03:00:48.769 --> 03:00:48.779 align:start position:0%
but she also got background checks for
 
03:00:50.990 --> 03:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
Girl Scouts background checks when she
 
03:00:54.550 --> 03:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
was with a fishing game
 
03:00:58.730 --> 03:00:58.740 align:start position:0%
Rod and Gun Club did work so there are
 
03:01:00.590 --> 03:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
people doing background checks all over
 
03:01:02.450 --> 03:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
the place and we have it now for
 
03:01:04.309 --> 03:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
substitutes where a substitute can get
 
03:01:06.530 --> 03:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
background checks that apply in
 
03:01:07.969 --> 03:01:07.979 align:start position:0%
different places we have it for
 
03:01:10.490 --> 03:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
transportation people what we're really
 
03:01:12.710 --> 03:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
doing is representative Miler said is
 
03:01:14.809 --> 03:01:14.819 align:start position:0%
trying to make kids safe now there's no
 
03:01:18.230 --> 03:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
100 guarantee we know what happens in
 
03:01:20.030 --> 03:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
schools we know what happens in churches
 
03:01:22.190 --> 03:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
we know what happens in with parents
 
03:01:24.710 --> 03:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
that there's incest we know things
 
03:01:27.050 --> 03:01:27.060 align:start position:0%
happen but what we're trying to do is
 
03:01:30.710 --> 03:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make things as safe as
 
03:01:32.690 --> 03:01:32.700 align:start position:0%
we possibly can and one of the things
 
03:01:36.110 --> 03:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
that we've as a society said that helps
 
03:01:38.389 --> 03:01:38.399 align:start position:0%
us see if somebody is safe is to do a
 
03:01:39.710 --> 03:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
background check and the background
 
03:01:42.110 --> 03:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
check that schools have or people that
 
03:01:43.910 --> 03:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
work with children is much different
 
03:01:45.710 --> 03:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
than the person that goes in and gets a
 
03:01:47.090 --> 03:01:47.100 align:start position:0%
background check to work at Walmart
 
03:01:49.969 --> 03:01:49.979 align:start position:0%
they're concerned with robbery or murder
 
03:01:51.590 --> 03:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
or arson
 
03:01:53.990 --> 03:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
the school checks the checks with
 
03:01:56.990 --> 03:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
working with children extend further and
 
03:01:59.210 --> 03:01:59.220 align:start position:0%
deal with trafficking child trafficking
 
03:02:01.969 --> 03:02:01.979 align:start position:0%
child pornography different issues like
 
03:02:03.830 --> 03:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
that that are specific that would
 
03:02:06.830 --> 03:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
endanger children so that's what this
 
03:02:08.950 --> 03:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
bill is meant to do
 
03:02:12.590 --> 03:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
and I really
 
03:02:16.450 --> 03:02:16.460 align:start position:0%
think that it's worth consideration and
 
03:02:21.889 --> 03:02:21.899 align:start position:0%
it is feasible we know we can do it so
 
03:02:24.410 --> 03:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
that's that's my response to some of the
 
03:02:26.990 --> 03:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
questions represent cascadden just
 
03:02:28.550 --> 03:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to add that there is a system
 
03:02:31.309 --> 03:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
from my experience
 
03:02:33.170 --> 03:02:33.180 align:start position:0%
um with people outside of school
 
03:02:35.809 --> 03:02:35.819 align:start position:0%
district who need criminal background
 
03:02:37.370 --> 03:02:37.380 align:start position:0%
check and that's through the state
 
03:02:40.370 --> 03:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
police barracks within your region
 
03:02:42.050 --> 03:02:42.060 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if that's the case all
 
03:02:43.969 --> 03:02:43.979 align:start position:0%
over the state but
 
03:02:47.269 --> 03:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
F Troop into a mountain we'll do
 
03:02:49.849 --> 03:02:49.859 align:start position:0%
background checks for whatever you need
 
03:02:53.750 --> 03:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
it for so just the service is there
 
03:02:56.269 --> 03:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald thank you Mr chair
 
03:02:58.370 --> 03:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to remind the committee of
 
03:03:00.590 --> 03:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
the extensive testimony we had in
 
03:03:02.750 --> 03:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill overwhelmingly
 
03:03:05.090 --> 03:03:05.100 align:start position:0%
the testifiers that took time out of
 
03:03:07.250 --> 03:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
their day to speak to us oppose this
 
03:03:10.070 --> 03:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
bill I have one quoted as saying that
 
03:03:12.170 --> 03:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
it's a baseless Inquisition on
 
03:03:14.510 --> 03:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
homeschool families and knowing that it
 
03:03:16.670 --> 03:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
is almost discriminatory against a
 
03:03:20.450 --> 03:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
certain class of parents that's looking
 
03:03:22.969 --> 03:03:22.979 align:start position:0%
for a problem what a problem may or may
 
03:03:26.030 --> 03:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
not exist I just don't know why we would
 
03:03:28.450 --> 03:03:28.460 align:start position:0%
support something like that
 
03:03:31.490 --> 03:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
further discovers in Belcher thank you
 
03:03:33.650 --> 03:03:33.660 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I I would like to highlight
 
03:03:35.269 --> 03:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
that safety is obviously the important
 
03:03:37.910 --> 03:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
issue but there is a line that you cross
 
03:03:41.030 --> 03:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
when you go from safety to safety ism
 
03:03:44.450 --> 03:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
and when you start dictating to parents
 
03:03:46.610 --> 03:03:46.620 align:start position:0%
who needs to get a background check when
 
03:03:48.349 --> 03:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
they're when they're getting together in
 
03:03:49.730 --> 03:03:49.740 align:start position:0%
their little homeschool pods and this
 
03:03:52.250 --> 03:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
that and the other this that's nothing
 
03:03:54.469 --> 03:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
but government overreach parents have
 
03:03:57.230 --> 03:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
the ability to make these decisions on
 
03:03:58.790 --> 03:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
their own without any sort of
 
03:04:04.550 --> 03:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:06.889 --> 03:04:06.899 align:start position:0%
discussion represent cordelli
 
03:04:08.830 --> 03:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:04:11.530 --> 03:04:11.540 align:start position:0%
a number of things
 
03:04:11.540 --> 03:04:13.990 align:start position:0%
a number of things
first

03:04:13.990 --> 03:04:14.000 align:start position:0%

03:04:17.830 --> 03:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
tax credit scholarships efas
 
03:04:20.690 --> 03:04:20.700 align:start position:0%
money is going to
 
03:04:24.130 --> 03:04:24.140 align:start position:0%
families and they are making individual
 
03:04:28.730 --> 03:04:28.740 align:start position:0%
private choices let me quote former
 
03:04:31.429 --> 03:04:31.439 align:start position:0%

Charles Douglas
 
03:04:35.750 --> 03:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
the court Drew consistent distinctions
 
03:04:37.849 --> 03:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
between government programs that provide
 
03:04:40.490 --> 03:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
Aid directly to religious schools and
 
03:04:43.370 --> 03:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
programs of true private choice in which
 
03:04:45.290 --> 03:04:45.300 align:start position:0%
the government Aid reaches religious
 
03:04:48.230 --> 03:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
schools only by the result of genuine
 
03:04:51.290 --> 03:04:51.300 align:start position:0%
and independent choices of private
 
03:04:51.300 --> 03:04:52.610 align:start position:0%

individuals
 
03:04:55.610 --> 03:04:55.620 align:start position:0%
this is getting into the lives of
 
03:04:57.170 --> 03:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
private individuals
 
03:04:59.389 --> 03:04:59.399 align:start position:0%
uh two
 
03:04:59.399 --> 03:05:00.230 align:start position:0%
uh two
um

03:05:00.230 --> 03:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:02.570 --> 03:05:02.580 align:start position:0%
this bill references
 
03:05:02.580 --> 03:05:04.429 align:start position:0%
this bill references
um continually

03:05:04.429 --> 03:05:04.439 align:start position:0%
um continually
 
03:05:09.769 --> 03:05:09.779 align:start position:0%
um 189 was it 13 a right
 
03:05:11.570 --> 03:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
that statute
 
03:05:14.330 --> 03:05:14.340 align:start position:0%
references that these background checks
 
03:05:17.870 --> 03:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
are to go to school Personnel SAU School
 
03:05:19.670 --> 03:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
District personnel
 
03:05:23.750 --> 03:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
so are we saying that background checks
 
03:05:30.670 --> 03:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
of a volunteer or a Home School
 
03:05:33.290 --> 03:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
parent support person who comes in to
 
03:05:35.269 --> 03:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
help The Homeschool parent they have to
 
03:05:37.070 --> 03:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
send the background check they have to
 
03:05:38.929 --> 03:05:38.939 align:start position:0%
get a background check and send a
 
03:05:40.910 --> 03:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
background check to the local school
 
03:05:43.990 --> 03:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
what are we saying it's not
 
03:05:48.710 --> 03:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
the bill is is a fraud from a whole
 
03:05:51.830 --> 03:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
number of uh perspectives
 
03:05:54.349 --> 03:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden obviously
 
03:05:56.090 --> 03:05:56.100 align:start position:0%
disagree when you look at the service
 
03:05:59.530 --> 03:05:59.540 align:start position:0%
provider list I'm not talking about
 
03:06:02.690 --> 03:06:02.700 align:start position:0%
putting parents through a criminal
 
03:06:05.269 --> 03:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
background check talking about the
 
03:06:05.279 --> 03:06:06.469 align:start position:0%
background check talking about the
providers

03:06:06.469 --> 03:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
providers
 
03:06:09.469 --> 03:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
that are giving some sort of
 
03:06:12.349 --> 03:06:12.359 align:start position:0%
lesson or education
 
03:06:14.150 --> 03:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
to a child whether they're a homeschool
 
03:06:16.490 --> 03:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
child or not it's to me is irrelevant
 
03:06:19.429 --> 03:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
it's the service provider
 
03:06:23.090 --> 03:06:23.100 align:start position:0%
that people are using efas for
 
03:06:25.550 --> 03:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
if they are ever in a small group with a
 
03:06:28.070 --> 03:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
kid so the onus is not on the parent to
 
03:06:30.530 --> 03:06:30.540 align:start position:0%
get the background check but as a parent
 
03:06:33.769 --> 03:06:33.779 align:start position:0%
if I'm homeschooling and I want my child
 
03:06:37.250 --> 03:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
to go to McIntyre Ski area for a private
 
03:06:38.990 --> 03:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
ski lesson and I pay for it with the
 
03:06:41.990 --> 03:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
efas I'd want that instructed to have a
 
03:06:43.309 --> 03:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
criminal background check because I
 
03:06:45.769 --> 03:06:45.779 align:start position:0%
wouldn't trust anybody to be with my
 
03:06:47.090 --> 03:06:47.100 align:start position:0%
child so it's more on the service
 
03:06:49.309 --> 03:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
provider same when I go back to the
 
03:06:51.830 --> 03:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
driving school do you want your teenage
 
03:06:53.929 --> 03:06:53.939 align:start position:0%
daughter to get into a driving school
 
03:06:58.070 --> 03:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
situation not knowing any background on
 
03:06:59.929 --> 03:06:59.939 align:start position:0%
that driver
 
03:07:02.150 --> 03:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely not nobody would want that
 
03:07:04.610 --> 03:07:04.620 align:start position:0%
but that's the intent here for those
 
03:07:04.620 --> 03:07:06.110 align:start position:0%
but that's the intent here for those
vendors

03:07:06.110 --> 03:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
vendors
 
03:07:08.210 --> 03:07:08.220 align:start position:0%
to have criminal background checks so
 
03:07:11.389 --> 03:07:11.399 align:start position:0%
that they can advertise that they are
 
03:07:13.870 --> 03:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
safe they're on a service provider list
 
03:07:16.429 --> 03:07:16.439 align:start position:0%
we don't know if they're ex-felons or
 
03:07:16.439 --> 03:07:17.630 align:start position:0%
we don't know if they're ex-felons or
not

03:07:17.630 --> 03:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:07:20.269 --> 03:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
I mean what's the vehicle to do that so
 
03:07:21.710 --> 03:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
that's what this Bell would do in my
 
03:07:24.230 --> 03:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
opinion representative cordelli
 
03:07:26.870 --> 03:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh I agree with one aspect
 
03:07:29.150 --> 03:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
of what you said uh that parent who
 
03:07:32.690 --> 03:07:32.700 align:start position:0%
takes their child to a ski area for ski
 
03:07:35.150 --> 03:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
instruction it's up to them whether they
 
03:07:37.610 --> 03:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
have this uh ski instructor get a pro
 
03:07:40.010 --> 03:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
get a background check or not it's not
 
03:07:42.050 --> 03:07:42.060 align:start position:0%
my responsibility as an education
 
03:07:44.710 --> 03:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
Committee Member to do it or the state
 
03:07:46.849 --> 03:07:46.859 align:start position:0%
responsibility to do which the parents
 
03:07:49.250 --> 03:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
responsibility to do it if they want and
 
03:07:50.929 --> 03:07:50.939 align:start position:0%
let me just quote from the letter that
 
03:07:54.769 --> 03:07:54.779 align:start position:0%
we got from the Catholic Church also
 
03:07:54.779 --> 03:07:55.429 align:start position:0%
we got from the Catholic Church also
um

03:07:55.429 --> 03:07:55.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:55.439 --> 03:07:57.110 align:start position:0%
um
that

03:07:57.110 --> 03:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:08:00.950 --> 03:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
that is why the fingerprint based checks
 
03:08:03.170 --> 03:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
for the Diocese of Manchester schools
 
03:08:05.030 --> 03:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
are carried out by the division of State
 
03:08:07.370 --> 03:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
Police pursuant to the federal Adam
 
03:08:09.650 --> 03:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
Walsh act specifically the school SAFE
 
03:08:15.410 --> 03:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:17.450 --> 03:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
so they're doing checks on their
 
03:08:17.460 --> 03:08:20.330 align:start position:0%
so they're doing checks on their
personnel

03:08:20.330 --> 03:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:22.130 --> 03:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
 
03:08:25.190 --> 03:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
that's good representative
 
03:08:27.650 --> 03:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
I wonder if all those McIntyre people do
 
03:08:29.990 --> 03:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
have checks because you brought it up
 
03:08:32.929 --> 03:08:32.939 align:start position:0%
but I realized that our school Ski Club
 
03:08:32.939 --> 03:08:34.610 align:start position:0%
but I realized that our school Ski Club
goes

03:08:34.610 --> 03:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
goes
 
03:08:37.969 --> 03:08:37.979 align:start position:0%
I mean our school Ski Club goes to
 
03:08:41.330 --> 03:08:41.340 align:start position:0%
Mcintyre and and so the question is are
 
03:08:43.969 --> 03:08:43.979 align:start position:0%
they are are they not I have no idea but
 
03:08:47.030 --> 03:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think I partic I I was a
 
03:08:50.690 --> 03:08:50.700 align:start position:0%
chaperone and anyway
 
03:08:54.730 --> 03:08:54.740 align:start position:0%
for further discussion yes yes
 
03:08:57.650 --> 03:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
so I'm a newbie here thank you very much
 
03:09:00.110 --> 03:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
for letting me speak I just have a
 
03:09:02.450 --> 03:09:02.460 align:start position:0%
question for clarification
 
03:09:05.750 --> 03:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
current School Personnel are subject to
 
03:09:09.830 --> 03:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
background checks and this would
 
03:09:11.809 --> 03:09:11.819 align:start position:0%
do background checks on anyone related
 
03:09:14.269 --> 03:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
to a school district and that includes
 
03:09:16.190 --> 03:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
people who would be
 
03:09:18.469 --> 03:09:18.479 align:start position:0%
receiving any kind of EFA
 
03:09:18.479 --> 03:09:19.550 align:start position:0%
receiving any kind of EFA
money

03:09:19.550 --> 03:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:09:19.560 --> 03:09:22.370 align:start position:0%
money
yes

03:09:22.370 --> 03:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:26.090 --> 03:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
so the question is
 
03:09:28.429 --> 03:09:28.439 align:start position:0%
we just
 
03:09:31.010 --> 03:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
voted down
 
03:09:34.429 --> 03:09:34.439 align:start position:0%
for are in debate about whether or not
 
03:09:36.650 --> 03:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
to make everybody's salary a
 
03:09:39.050 --> 03:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
transparency issue wouldn't this fall
 
03:09:40.490 --> 03:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
under that same kind of thing like
 
03:09:42.710 --> 03:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
transparency issues
 
03:09:45.530 --> 03:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
if we're doing background checks at the
 
03:09:47.269 --> 03:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
school level shouldn't anyone who
 
03:09:49.309 --> 03:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
receives the fa funds do background
 
03:09:52.969 --> 03:09:52.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:56.990 --> 03:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:59.450 --> 03:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
at the school level
 
03:10:02.030 --> 03:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
it's done by the school but if there's
 
03:10:04.190 --> 03:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
not a school who's going to do the
 
03:10:05.570 --> 03:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
background check
 
03:10:08.150 --> 03:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
and and we did have the department of
 
03:10:11.690 --> 03:10:11.700 align:start position:0%
safety here explaining who who can do
 
03:10:17.150 --> 03:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
those and they did not find a way yet
 
03:10:20.510 --> 03:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
for the random parent to do it
 
03:10:23.809 --> 03:10:23.819 align:start position:0%
for other random parents who gets the
 
03:10:25.550 --> 03:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
who and according to this it would be
 
03:10:27.650 --> 03:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
the school what school
 
03:10:30.889 --> 03:10:30.899 align:start position:0%
which school if you have parents getting
 
03:10:33.769 --> 03:10:33.779 align:start position:0%
together from five different towns
 
03:10:35.510 --> 03:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
who's doing the background check who's
 
03:10:37.130 --> 03:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
getting the background check they're not
 
03:10:39.710 --> 03:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
employees of the school how is the
 
03:10:41.330 --> 03:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
school even going to get it I mean
 
03:10:44.750 --> 03:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
that's it's it's a nice idea but we
 
03:10:47.210 --> 03:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
don't have anything in place for those
 
03:10:49.309 --> 03:10:49.319 align:start position:0%
fingerprint checks to actually be done
 
03:10:52.010 --> 03:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
yes you can do a New Hampshire one but
 
03:10:54.530 --> 03:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be that full level
 
03:10:56.750 --> 03:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
one that they're talking about here I
 
03:10:58.490 --> 03:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
don't see how you can even
 
03:11:00.410 --> 03:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
pass this when we don't have the
 
03:11:03.910 --> 03:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
mechanism in place to do it yet
 
03:11:06.830 --> 03:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative miler
 
03:11:08.929 --> 03:11:08.939 align:start position:0%

further discussion from the committee

just something for clarification
 
03:11:27.050 --> 03:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
purposes as a superintendent when you go
 
03:11:28.849 --> 03:11:28.859 align:start position:0%

answered and and if amendments need to
 
03:14:05.450 --> 03:14:05.460 align:start position:0%
be made they could be made to this bill
