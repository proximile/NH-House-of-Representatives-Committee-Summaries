00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:38.569 --> 00:11:38.579 align:start position:0%
yeah good okay let's go good morning
 
00:11:38.579 --> 00:11:40.670 align:start position:0%
yeah good okay let's go good morning
everybody

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:43.019 align:start position:0%
um we have about 20 minutes here which
 
00:11:44.449 --> 00:11:44.459 align:start position:0%
we're going to be using just for
 
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
imparting some information to committee
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
members uh then we will act on the first
 
00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:50.519 align:start position:0%
bill that we'll be hearing this session
 
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
at uh 10 o'clock
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
so on the ride down today I had a pretty
 
00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:00.180 align:start position:0%
lengthy conversation with Caitlyn Davis
 
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
over at doe regarding our uh
 
00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
presentation we're going to be given on
 
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
January the 17th that's going to be at
 
00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
Granite State College and we'll get
 
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
directions for you if you don't know
 
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
where that is it's just on the other
 
00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
side of town here not more than a 10
 
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
minute drive from here uh so uh but they
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
have a room over there a conference room
 
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
which has all the bells and whistles and
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
the technology to facilitate the
 
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:30.140 align:start position:0%
presentation that she's going to be
 
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
presenting and other directors at the
 
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:34.740 align:start position:0%
department so we'll have a lot of
 
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity to learn about these
 
00:12:39.769 --> 00:12:39.779 align:start position:0%
programs so I ask that everybody try to
 
00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
make an effort to get there this is
 
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
going to be an important aspect of what
 
00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
we're doing
 
00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:47.940 align:start position:0%
uh it's um what they have the capability
 
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
of streaming too we're going to decide
 
00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:51.959 align:start position:0%
today whether they have to do that we
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
have a number of times when the
 
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
education committee has taken field
 
00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
trips and we've gone to various schools
 
00:12:59.690 --> 00:12:59.700 align:start position:0%
whether it be down in the southern part
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
of the state up in the northern part of
 
00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
the state or going to some small charter
 
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
schools which don't have streaming
 
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.110 align:start position:0%
schools which don't have streaming
capability

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
capability
 
00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:08.700 align:start position:0%
when we do these types of activities
 
00:13:11.569 --> 00:13:11.579 align:start position:0%
we're not taking any action we never
 
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:14.220 align:start position:0%
take action like that at all on a bill
 
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
or we just go to learn and observe and
 
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:19.740 align:start position:0%
to see the programs that are in effect
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
so there are going to be times when it's
 
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
not streamed and it just can't be
 
00:13:26.449 --> 00:13:26.459 align:start position:0%
streamed so I want to find out whether
 
00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
we have to do it over there as well they
 
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
have the capability so I have no
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
problems in doing it I think it'd be
 
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
great for the public to see it as well
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
even those that are home that couldn't
 
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
make it here for some reason so that's
 
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
the 17th
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
last night I also went through and
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
reviewed the bills that are already on
 
00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
the web that been get taken from LSR to
 
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
Bill fashion and we have now 40 Bells
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
and of those bills there's
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
13 to 15 of them that have FNS from the
 
00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
financial notes
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
that means there are early bills
 
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
and they're going to be dealt with we
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
know we have probably 40 bills there we
 
00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
have another 60 bills hitting us and of
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be more of them
 
00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
early bills have to be out of this
 
00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
committee by February the 16th we're
 
00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
looking at about one month
 
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
that me and these early bills oftentimes
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
are bills which we the hearing process
 
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
is longer than it is for some of the
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
other bills seeing we're also discussing
 
00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:27.779 align:start position:0%
the implications that associated with
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
that Financial note and in terms of
 
00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
policy decisions that have to be made
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
staffing issues all that so they take a
 
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:38.220 align:start position:0%
little bit longer to schedule
 
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking now at when we're going
 
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
to start scheduling this we've got to
 
00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
start hopping on our early bills
 
00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
immediately so next week I meet with uh
 
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
uh Lindsay our administrative assistant
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
and Jen later on this this morning
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
sometime and try to get the schedule
 
00:14:59.449 --> 00:14:59.459 align:start position:0%
built our schedules have to be submitted
 
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
for the calendar by noon or 12 30 today
 
00:15:05.629 --> 00:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
on Wednesdays when we have to have that
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
all done unfortunately we're just
 
00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:09.959 align:start position:0%
receiving these bills
 
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:12.180 align:start position:0%
um like last night and the speaker is
 
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:15.180 align:start position:0%
doing more today so uh we'll do the best
 
00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:17.459 align:start position:0%
we can but I believe we're going to have
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
to have meetings next week on the 18th
 
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
and the 19th that is the Wednesday and
 
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
the Thursday following our Tuesday
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
presentation over at Granite State so
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
Mark in your calendars those those dates
 
00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:36.500 align:start position:0%
that would be the 18th and the 19th
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
those are all going to be primarily
 
00:15:43.129 --> 00:15:43.139 align:start position:0%
bills with FN numbers on our FN on the
 
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
back of those house bills so we're going
 
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:47.220 align:start position:0%
to be dealing with those early bills
 
00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
so there's a potential to on some of
 
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
them to do maybe six a day uh counting
 
00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
on well those bills sometimes take 30 to
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
40 to you know over 60 Minutes depending
 
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:03.660 align:start position:0%
upon the nature and the complications
 
00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:05.420 align:start position:0%
and the issues associated with the bill
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
so and I don't want to have to rush
 
00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
through some of this I want to be able
 
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
to do it carefully and so it'd be
 
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
probably maybe six like a day maybe
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
seven or maybe we can work in a non FN
 
00:16:20.569 --> 00:16:20.579 align:start position:0%
Bill and polish that off uh during the
 
00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:23.459 align:start position:0%
time when we schedule hearings we
 
00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
schedule specific times the bills will
 
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:29.220 align:start position:0%
be heard so the public knows when
 
00:16:30.829 --> 00:16:30.839 align:start position:0%
they're going to be excuse me when
 
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to be heard
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
so if we finish a bill early let's say
 
00:16:38.329 --> 00:16:38.339 align:start position:0%
in 20 or 30 minutes we schedule 45
 
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
minutes for it it's just basically a
 
00:16:42.889 --> 00:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
break for us and we can't schedule
 
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
anything else in there at that time and
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
we can't and we're not going to do this
 
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
year do any exacting of anything in the
 
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
past we had a little line underneath of
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
the day of the bills uh May exact bills
 
00:16:58.249 --> 00:16:58.259 align:start position:0%
that have been previously heard so we
 
00:16:59.870 --> 00:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
could pump anything in there and maybe
 
00:17:02.329 --> 00:17:02.339 align:start position:0%
get it done this year the only way we
 
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
will ever do that if we have unanimous
 
00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:08.579 align:start position:0%
consent if we have both parties agreeing
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
and we can get that out of the way get
 
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
over it to Paul Smith and get it heard
 
00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:14.339 align:start position:0%
in the floor and move it on to the
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
second committee or to the Senate
 
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
so that's where we are with those those
 
00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
bills on the 20th that's Friday
 
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
um I do have a trustee meeting on the
 
00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:26.579 align:start position:0%
19th and the 20th of next week I'm going
 
00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
to skip the 19th meeting and be there
 
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
down in Durham on the 20th so
 
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
um that takes care of that week the
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
following week I I think you guarantee
 
00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
having three days
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
every week that we're going to be just
 
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:41.820 align:start position:0%
guarantee in three days and we'll try to
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
hit those middle three days Tuesday
 
00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
Wednesday Thursday Mondays I said try
 
00:17:48.289 --> 00:17:48.299 align:start position:0%
not to touch so if you're scheduling
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
appointments there or Fridays go ahead
 
00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
and do the same thing I know that there
 
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
are some even today that have doctor's
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
appointments and you just got to do that
 
00:17:59.810 --> 00:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
you know to get into Hitchcock it takes
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
a month to just try to get the call
 
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
received by them and then another month
 
00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
to get it scheduled and another month to
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
go down to the meeting of that
 
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
consultation where it's been rescheduled
 
00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
so if you can get a meeting with a doc
 
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
get it and take it so don't let this
 
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
hold you back we won't be exacting any
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
of these bills for a while we won't be
 
00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
executing them when we do exec the bills
 
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
you'll see them in the calendar they've
 
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
got to be noticed in the calendar and
 
00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
all we do is put for example we start at
 
00:18:33.169 --> 00:18:33.179 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock and we list the bills for
 
00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:35.700 align:start position:0%
executing we don't list specific times
 
00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
for when we exec so we we can jump
 
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
around you know and just take up any
 
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
Bill we want during that day and we
 
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
oftentimes will do that we'll say well
 
00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
we have 20 minutes left where's the bill
 
00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0%
I oftentimes meet with represent a mile
 
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
or represent luno and I'll say okay
 
00:18:54.289 --> 00:18:54.299 align:start position:0%
which ones can you guys agree to and not
 
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
agree to and where are we and we can
 
00:18:57.529 --> 00:18:57.539 align:start position:0%
just polish It Off
 
00:19:00.529 --> 00:19:00.539 align:start position:0%
so so that's where the way that works
 
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
are there any questions now regarding
 
00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
where we are and we have about 10
 
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
minutes here before we yeah represent
 
00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:08.990 align:start position:0%
minutes here before we yeah represent
cascadden

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
cascadden
 
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair who do we notify if
 
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
we must be absent you should notify your
 
00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:16.919 align:start position:0%
ranking uh you would represent ranking
 
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
member Miler or if you can't even
 
00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:22.220 align:start position:0%
represent luno okay um they will notify
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh we have to notify your leadership uh
 
00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:28.860 align:start position:0%
the minority leadership and and it has
 
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
to be notified in in the majority
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
leadership 24 hours in advance so it we
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
so if you're knowing you're going to be
 
00:19:39.049 --> 00:19:39.059 align:start position:0%
out if you have a now if you're going to
 
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
be up that's for exact sessions on the
 
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
hearing side we can get I can conduct a
 
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
hearing here or we can conduct a hearing
 
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
with one person present a hearing is a
 
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
different Beast than executive sessions
 
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
executive sessions you need to have a
 
00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
quorum but on hearing there are days
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
that it may be snowing really hard down
 
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
the southern part of the State Northern
 
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
Star Park that's the way it's been
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
lately doesn't have as much snow unless
 
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
you're right up in the ski country and
 
00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
we can make it down and we we can have
 
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
that hearing and so that's what we'll
 
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
try to do if the the shop is open here
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
if the capital is open
 
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
I'm inclined to go ahead with hearings I
 
00:20:21.529 --> 00:20:21.539 align:start position:0%
was an administrator up in Alaska for 25
 
00:20:21.539 --> 00:20:22.669 align:start position:0%
was an administrator up in Alaska for 25
years

00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
and we never never called off schools
 
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
because of snow or ice never they were
 
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
not caught the only time they were
 
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
called off once when the volcano went
 
00:20:33.529 --> 00:20:33.539 align:start position:0%
off and we had Ash in the air and you
 
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
couldn't drive anything for fear of you
 
00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:37.100 align:start position:0%
know losing your engine
 
00:20:40.669 --> 00:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
so we will go ahead I always say yes you
 
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
know now if you can't come to a hearing
 
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
that's okay because that's you know I
 
00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
don't want you getting yourself in an
 
00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
unsafe situation or getting hurt coming
 
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
down or or if something doesn't start
 
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:54.440 align:start position:0%
too cold Etc
 
00:20:57.529 --> 00:20:57.539 align:start position:0%
stay home that's fine because on a
 
00:20:59.570 --> 00:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
hearing we are not making any decisions
 
00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
at all we're just listening because I
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
was watching here first you can watch it
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
on YouTube but I haven't heard anything
 
00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:08.820 align:start position:0%
in the past the deals were made with
 
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
local hotels to get a really cheap rate
 
00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
if people had to stay over and I haven't
 
00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
heard anything I'm just thinking of
 
00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
people like
 
00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
um rep cascadden who it takes two and a
 
00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
half hours to get here and I remember at
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
the time the rate at the hotels was just
 
00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
about equal to the mileage so it
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes makes sense to to stay over
 
00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:31.740 align:start position:0%
but I have you heard anything there is
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
less alcohol
 
00:21:36.649 --> 00:21:36.659 align:start position:0%
yeah um there's several different and I
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
don't know if new people knew about it
 
00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919 align:start position:0%
yeah okay right oh okay yeah we can get
 
00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
that list yeah it's it's worth looking
 
00:21:45.409 --> 00:21:45.419 align:start position:0%
at that list too I know that oftentimes
 
00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
I couldn't get back up to Haverhill it's
 
00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:49.140 align:start position:0%
about an hour and a half drive one way
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
and I stay at the Hampton Inn for 40
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
bucks a night
 
00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
and that's just right over in boat
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
so the check them all out there there
 
00:22:00.049 --> 00:22:00.059 align:start position:0%
are some good deals I know that's what
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh speaker Chandler when he came down
 
00:22:06.049 --> 00:22:06.059 align:start position:0%
from down from uh uh up north up in uh
 
00:22:09.289 --> 00:22:09.299 align:start position:0%
near Bartlett up in Grafton notched and
 
00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
all that
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
he used to stay down here often at the
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
Holiday Inn or one of his favorite
 
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
places and they got to know him and they
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
gave him the same room all the time so
 
00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
so it take advantage of that
 
00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:24.740 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you got to pay for it too
 
00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:28.220 align:start position:0%
you get a little travel but Rick yes
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks
 
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
um just to uh to karine's question a
 
00:22:33.649 --> 00:22:33.659 align:start position:0%
little bit too and I think to the point
 
00:22:36.409 --> 00:22:36.419 align:start position:0%
you made earlier that unlike last
 
00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
session where uh where bills could be
 
00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:41.820 align:start position:0%
exact at the um at the call the chair
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
following uh following a hearing uh day
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
uh that's not going to happen
 
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
um uh unless unless as Rick said
 
00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
everybody's in agreement so we're really
 
00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:55.860 align:start position:0%
talking about and not all but but
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
consent calendar type type bills uh
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
where there's widespread agreement
 
00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
across the community so if Korean if um
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
or anybody can't make it to a hearing
 
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
because of weather because of you know
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
your your or you're under the weather or
 
00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:13.799 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
um you don't feel like you need to get a
 
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
um get a sub for that because nothing's
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
going to happen
 
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
in your in your absence that wasn't the
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
case last um last session and we had the
 
00:23:27.649 --> 00:23:27.659 align:start position:0%
same number of bills last session so you
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
know there were times where things had
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
to move through all that being said Rick
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
you've you've uh you mentioned that um
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
that uh uh February 16th is um is a is a
 
00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
due out so so
 
00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not looking at my calendar so
 
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
I don't know what that day is that a
 
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
Thursday yeah so so it's really the 15th
 
00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
if they're if they're going to be in the
 
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
calendar for the following week
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
um so so and and I suspect if if you
 
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
know so that we're not executing a ton
 
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
of bills on one day and having a ton of
 
00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:08.820 align:start position:0%
bills Hit the Floor all at the same time
 
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
um you may be in you're probably looking
 
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
at a few exact days prior to oh yes and
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
that that is so representative luno and
 
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
and uh I can recall
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
a number of times whether a reception
 
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
guile here or represented by Balboni
 
00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
that was running the at that time or or
 
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
Mel or or myself that remember we also
 
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
have to have the committee reports
 
00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:35.700 align:start position:0%
written and we have been coming right
 
00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:37.799 align:start position:0%
down to the wire where they have to be
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
submitted out by 12 o'clock on a given
 
00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:45.260 align:start position:0%
day and and we're acting on it at 11 30
 
00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:48.299 align:start position:0%
and and so 12 you know so we have to
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
have those you know when we get down
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
like that that's where I have to start
 
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
working very closely with representative
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
Miler and representative luno and
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli here to make
 
00:25:00.409 --> 00:25:00.419 align:start position:0%
sure that we have all that in place so
 
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
that because it's going to have to go to
 
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
Lindsay Lindsay has to look it over
 
00:25:06.529 --> 00:25:06.539 align:start position:0%
let's go upstairs so Jennifer 4 they
 
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
look at that for other issues upstairs
 
00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
all our reports then it comes down and
 
00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
goes back over to Paul Smith and then to
 
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
the speaker's office and all this has to
 
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
transpire so they can get this in the
 
00:25:21.649 --> 00:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
calendar they later on in that same week
 
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
so it it's it's uh it's real crunch time
 
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
and and people are pretty harried at
 
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
about that time so running around
 
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
everywhere so so Rick
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
so Rick as as um as you're you're sort
 
00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
of putting together our our work path
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
um leading up to this February 16th and
 
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
then leading up to um to you know
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
crossover day but particularly the on
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
the first stage of this meeting February
 
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
16th if you can let us know what your
 
00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:51.059 align:start position:0%
what your thoughts are for the two or
 
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:53.940 align:start position:0%
three exact days
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
um so that we can at least you know I
 
00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
can tell you right now for example when
 
00:25:59.930 --> 00:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
we're going to have the hearings coming
 
00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:01.559 align:start position:0%
up here next week we're going to be
 
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
taking those those FN bills you can look
 
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
at the list you can see while all the
 
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
EFA bills are going to be there uh
 
00:26:09.409 --> 00:26:09.419 align:start position:0%
there's some bills dealing with
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
breakfast and meal programs gonna be
 
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
there there's some rewriting adequacy
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
formula that's going to be there so you
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
pretty much tell which bills you're
 
00:26:18.649 --> 00:26:18.659 align:start position:0%
going to have to handle there but the
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
exact sessions then we're going to try
 
00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.070 align:start position:0%
exact sessions then we're going to try
to

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
take care of some of these bills as
 
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
quickly as we can or at least a week or
 
00:26:30.289 --> 00:26:30.299 align:start position:0%
two before they have to be out if it's
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
possible seeing that we oftentimes get
 
00:26:35.149 --> 00:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
an exact session and we do find times
 
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
when we want to have an amendment
 
00:26:39.409 --> 00:26:39.419 align:start position:0%
and so we have to have time to write the
 
00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
amendment and
 
00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:43.559 align:start position:0%
it's really contrary to my position
 
00:26:45.769 --> 00:26:45.779 align:start position:0%
where I want to send the bill to the
 
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
house floor where I know it's not right
 
00:26:51.049 --> 00:26:51.059 align:start position:0%
or the best that we can do if we have to
 
00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
have floor amendments in this in the in
 
00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
the house that's not my my thing so
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
let's try take care of it here if we're
 
00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:00.299 align:start position:0%
not ready to send it out then we've got
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
to work on it that's our job
 
00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
um but I and I do not want to send a
 
00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
bill over to the Senate say well
 
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
Senate's going to fix it
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
they usually don't fix it and they make
 
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
it worse and so that's that it there may
 
00:27:18.169 --> 00:27:18.179 align:start position:0%
be our neighbors but sometimes they're
 
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
not our friends so
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
um so we got to you know I I've said
 
00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
that publicly even at the well in the
 
00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
house you know so I I'm wrong I'm always
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
really cautious so let's try to get our
 
00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
work done here and so we're closing in
 
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
here in three minutes any other you know
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
questions so just to comment on that
 
00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:40.980 align:start position:0%
Rick so there's there's basically five
 
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
weeks between now and when we need to
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
have those those early bills uh leaving
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
our committee so um so uh you know as
 
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
soon as you can sort of get us what what
 
00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
your thoughts are on maybe an exec
 
00:27:58.730 --> 00:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
during the final not next week but the
 
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
final week of January
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
yeah we want we we want to get them out
 
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
on the house floor you know as fast as
 
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
we can that's the first and second week
 
00:28:09.409 --> 00:28:09.419 align:start position:0%
of February yeah right something like
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
that so and there may be some of these
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
bills too we're dealing with that are
 
00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
going to go to more than two committees
 
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
we could have something going in the
 
00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:19.559 align:start position:0%
criminal justice we could go on the
 
00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services there are
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
possibilities there and to finance
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
so so and then a fun fact that I learned
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
from from Jen uh a few years ago was
 
00:28:33.169 --> 00:28:33.179 align:start position:0%
when you take a look at the the um you
 
00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:34.740 align:start position:0%
look at all the bills that have come to
 
00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:37.100 align:start position:0%
education you click on Bill status
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
you'll see the date that it has to leave
 
00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
the committee and that that that that
 
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
really is the determination of whether
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's an early bill because some bills
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
with with fiscal notes are not early
 
00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:53.700 align:start position:0%
bills a few we we used to get a packet
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
from the clerk's office on on the early
 
00:28:59.690 --> 00:28:59.700 align:start position:0%
bills and it was just in a folder and it
 
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
had a Big E on it and all that we don't
 
00:29:03.049 --> 00:29:03.059 align:start position:0%
get that anymore
 
00:29:06.769 --> 00:29:06.779 align:start position:0%
and all we do is we get this long list
 
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
that you can pull up on the web as well
 
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
and you look at status and all these FN
 
00:29:12.529 --> 00:29:12.539 align:start position:0%
bills there's nothing there there's no
 
00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
dates at this point in time no dates and
 
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
so they're on the system
 
00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
they're in the system they may be in the
 
00:29:21.889 --> 00:29:21.899 align:start position:0%
system but yeah you have to click on
 
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
status on that okay and that's right and
 
00:29:27.169 --> 00:29:27.179 align:start position:0%
you got to go to it to get it but in in
 
00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
the case of this one I'm just assuming
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
that all these FN bills are going to
 
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:32.940 align:start position:0%
have to get out of here quickly
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
and that's probably a good assumption so
 
00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:37.380 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do right now we're
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
right at 10 o'clock
 
00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
and so let's you know get on to our
 
00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
hearings here the first hearing if if
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
you have your calendars you can see the
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
order in which we take these off the
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
first one is going to be HB 71
 
00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
and HP 71 is repealing a Department of
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
Education report on Charter Public
 
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
School funding
 
00:29:59.870 --> 00:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
so do we have a representative here do
 
00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
we have any pink cards okay
 
00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:05.940 align:start position:0%
prep ceremony welcome
 
00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:07.740 align:start position:0%
now for all those that are first time we
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
should see what representative Mooney's
 
00:30:10.669 --> 00:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
doing right now she's handing in that
 
00:30:12.649 --> 00:30:12.659 align:start position:0%
pink card which also States her name
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
where she's from what she's doing the
 
00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
time that's necessary and you know I
 
00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
hope she put a reasonable time down
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
there three minutes wonderful
 
00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:28.520 align:start position:0%

simple

00:32:00.649 --> 00:32:00.659 align:start position:0%
address of the school the amount of the
 
00:32:03.049 --> 00:32:03.059 align:start position:0%
payment and the number of students
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
currently enrolled at the school
 
00:32:09.649 --> 00:32:09.659 align:start position:0%
each report shall be submitted no later
 
00:32:12.769 --> 00:32:12.779 align:start position:0%
than 30 days after the payment date
 
00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:17.220 align:start position:0%
specified in subparagraph C
 
00:32:19.149 --> 00:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
close quote
 
00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:22.860 align:start position:0%
the reason for this deletion is due to a
 
00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:25.820 align:start position:0%
law change in 2016
 
00:32:30.289 --> 00:32:30.299 align:start position:0%
causing the reporting requirement to now
 
00:32:32.049 --> 00:32:32.059 align:start position:0%
be moot
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to defer questions about that
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
2016 rule change to those that will
 
00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
speak after me as they were here at that
 
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
time with that I'm going to close my
 
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:46.740 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.120 align:start position:0%

00:32:58.010 --> 00:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:33:03.049 --> 00:33:03.059 align:start position:0%
not seeing any yes representative Damon
 
00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:04.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:33:06.289 --> 00:33:06.299 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney
 
00:33:06.299 --> 00:33:06.950 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney
um

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering what kind of
 
00:33:10.909 --> 00:33:10.919 align:start position:0%
reporting there is on the charter school
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
excellent question thank you
 
00:33:18.409 --> 00:33:18.419 align:start position:0%
representative for that I'm going to
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
defer that to just in the messengers of
 
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:23.460 align:start position:0%
time uh to the doe that will be
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
testifying after me
 
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
I think uh just in the interest of time
 
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:31.019 align:start position:0%
that would be a more concise accurate
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
answer but thank you
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for further questions
 
00:33:39.049 --> 00:33:39.059 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative uh we
 
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
don't have any other pink cards up here
 
00:33:42.769 --> 00:33:42.779 align:start position:0%
but is the department is it represented
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
on the representative you've got
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
we will just need a card for a penguin
 
00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
for technical information you got it
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
I'm so pleased with myself good morning
 
00:34:03.649 --> 00:34:03.659 align:start position:0%
everyone my name is Diana Fenton I'm an
 
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:04.740 align:start position:0%
attorney with the Department of
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
Education you will soon learn that I
 
00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:08.700 align:start position:0%
usually come before you with information
 
00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:10.919 align:start position:0%
as it pertains to child safety and
 
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks code of
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
conduct issues I'm a former prosecutor
 
00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
from another lifetime so uh that is my
 
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
only skill set so Frank edelboot said
 
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
you're going to do child safety
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
initiatives I'm here today uh filling in
 
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
for Caitlin Davis so I assure you I have
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
really big shoes to fill and I cannot
 
00:34:29.869 --> 00:34:29.879 align:start position:0%
answer all the questions that she will
 
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
answer for you next Tuesday on the 17th
 
00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:34.980 align:start position:0%
when you go to the um training at
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
Granite State but this bill uh was a
 
00:34:40.849 --> 00:34:40.859 align:start position:0%
request by the Department of Education
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
so thank you to representative Mooney
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
for bringing it forward
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
this bill is in response to a law change
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
from 2016 which quite simply made the
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement uh a non-issue it
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
made it moot the change allowed for a
 
00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
warrant to be drawn so there was no need
 
00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
for a report as to your question that
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
you alluded to all of this information
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
as to charter school funding is on the
 
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
Department's website
 
00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
and so this report requirement is just
 
00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
taking up staff time that could be
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
utilized for other things and so that's
 
00:35:17.089 --> 00:35:17.099 align:start position:0%
why the department asked that this bill
 
00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
be brought forward
 
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
um again I am playing the role of
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
Caitlin Davis big shoes to fill as I'm
 
00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:25.140 align:start position:0%
sure you know and I'm going to request
 
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
that any questions technical questions
 
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
about charter school funding be deferred
 
00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:31.740 align:start position:0%
until uh the presentation next week if
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's okay so I waived a Caitlyn as she
 
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
was going up to Laconia today when I was
 
00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:38.220 align:start position:0%
driving South she was driving north did
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
you pass fire yeah well I saw her going
 
00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
up the road when the two lanes were
 
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
closed but uh so this is a bill that's
 
00:35:47.569 --> 00:35:47.579 align:start position:0%
being put forth it's one of those
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
technical bills put forth by the
 
00:35:52.609 --> 00:35:52.619 align:start position:0%
department correct talking it's a
 
00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
technical change Bill what will happen
 
00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
is the department will identify areas in
 
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
the statute that are no longer necessary
 
00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
they might conflict with other laws or
 
00:36:04.849 --> 00:36:04.859 align:start position:0%
in this particular instance another law
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
was passed which made this unnecessary
 
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
but because it's still on the books it
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
has to be followed and it's taking up
 
00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:13.619 align:start position:0%
staff time that could be utilized for
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
other purposes so that's why it if you
 
00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:17.820 align:start position:0%
want to you could call it a technical
 
00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
bill or we often refer to them as
 
00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
cleanup bills okay for representative
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%

00:36:25.609 --> 00:36:25.619 align:start position:0%

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
bill or RSA that was impacted by that

bill or RSA that was impacted by that
bill

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
I do not off the top of my head but I
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
can look in the source notes
 
00:36:44.329 --> 00:36:44.339 align:start position:0%
um I'm the lucky one who has the brand
 
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
new book so I can look in the source
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
notes and get you that information thank
 
00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:49.980 align:start position:0%

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
I Knew by bringing my book up here I
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
would uh cause problems well I'm going
 
00:36:59.630 --> 00:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
to ask that question where
 
00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner is going to ask
 
00:37:03.849 --> 00:37:03.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:06.420 align:start position:0%

thank you all very much so
 
00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:14.780 align:start position:0%
representative did you have a question
 
00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
thanks very much Mr really a quick
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
um you had mentioned that um that it's
 
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
it's really uh
 
00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
you know sort of the the report to the
 
00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:29.940 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee's moot because
 
00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
uh there's a warrant to be drawn and I
 
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:34.380 align:start position:0%
see that in language I'm not quite sure
 
00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
what that does in terms of replacing the
 
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:37.740 align:start position:0%
report but you said that there's a
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
there's a there's there is a report on
 
00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:43.140 align:start position:0%
the doe website is there any difference
 
00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
between the report on the doe I guess
 
00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:46.980 align:start position:0%
there's two parts of the question any
 
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
difference on the the report on the doe
 
00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:52.140 align:start position:0%
website compared with what is currently
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
being presented to the fiscal committee
 
00:37:57.890 --> 00:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
and is there a statutory requirement for
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
the doe to uh to make this report
 
00:38:04.609 --> 00:38:04.619 align:start position:0%
available on the doe website those are
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
great questions to the best of my
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
knowledge there's no difference as to
 
00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:08.460 align:start position:0%
the information that's in the report
 
00:38:10.849 --> 00:38:10.859 align:start position:0%
that might be a difference in as to the
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
formatting but not to the information
 
00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:14.990 align:start position:0%
formatting but not to the information
um

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:17.700 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what statutory Authority if
 
00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
any requires the report to be on the
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
website I do know that most of the
 
00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:23.220 align:start position:0%
information the department deals with is
 
00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
public information and our website is a
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
great resource to find all the
 
00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
information that we have in terms of
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
funding and the different projects that
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
we do so
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
it is our go-to to put that information
 
00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
on the website to make it publicly
 
00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:39.300 align:start position:0%
available even if there's not a
 
00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:41.940 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement to do so here I'm
 
00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
not sure if there is a statutory
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
requirement for that I'm going to defer
 
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
to Caitlin Davis on that sure because I
 
00:38:50.329 --> 00:38:50.339 align:start position:0%
you know I I yeah I just thought it
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
would be it would be good to uh to learn
 
00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
that on Tuesday next week because I
 
00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
think it'd be important to uh to members
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
of the public not to lose any
 
00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
transparent Financial transparency when
 
00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
it comes to any any payments to um to
 
00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:07.069 align:start position:0%
it comes to any any payments to um to
schools

00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
absolutely and the department agrees
 
00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
with that completely and to the best of
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
my knowledge that information is already
 
00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
publicly available and this is just
 
00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
really as I mentioned one of those
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
cleanup bills to recognize we do have
 
00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
limited staff time and the information
 
00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
is already there so uh we appreciate
 
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
do you have a question yes thank you Mr
 
00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:26.750 align:start position:0%
do you have a question yes thank you Mr
chair

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
um from what I could find on a report
 
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:30.780 align:start position:0%
the charter school accountability plan
 
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
is based on goals and objectives I
 
00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:34.140 align:start position:0%
didn't see anything that requires them
 
00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
to report uh an update on the funding
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
um so I guess my question would be
 
00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
um whether you can answer it or we wait
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
till Caitlyn is where's the
 
00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:47.460 align:start position:0%
accountability for for charter schools
 
00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:49.740 align:start position:0%
in terms of their Public Funding
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
I'm going to defer to Caitlin okay thank
 
00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:52.950 align:start position:0%
you appreciate that
 
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:53.990 align:start position:0%
you appreciate that
[Music]

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:39:56.089 --> 00:39:56.099 align:start position:0%
would be nice if you could convey these
 
00:39:58.250 --> 00:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
types of questions to Caitlin ahead of
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
time so we can you know she can be
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
prepared to respond to us on Tuesday I
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
will certainly do that thank you
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions for
 
00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
attorney Fenton
 
00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
you're off the hook thank you very much
 
00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
we don't have any other pink cards on
 
00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
this from the public is there anybody
 
00:40:19.069 --> 00:40:19.079 align:start position:0%
else here in the public would like to
 
00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
speak on this
 
00:40:22.849 --> 00:40:22.859 align:start position:0%
not seeing anybody we're going to close
 
00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:25.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
and and what we will do is we will hang
 
00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
those here for about 10 minutes we can't
 
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
start the next one until
 
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
so you can get up and stretch if you
 
00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.490 align:start position:0%
so you can get up and stretch if you
want

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
and another thing folks you can get up
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
anytime you need to get up
 
00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
in in a hearing just be polite in doing
 
00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:50.220 align:start position:0%
so when you come back
 
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
always go back to chair after somebody
 
00:40:54.349 --> 00:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
has stopped speaking not during the time
 
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:05.220 align:start position:0%
good question yeah is this where all
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
these commentary so those suggest those
 
00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:10.740 align:start position:0%
are just basically for boosting
 
00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
attendance today you would Circle those
 
00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:15.300 align:start position:0%
then you would just do what you've done
 
00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
here you've got the first one repeat
 
00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
what it's about and then you should say
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
it turn again yeah that's fine that's
 
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
all you have to do okay you're good I
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure good morning just
 
00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
a couple of those were passed down
 
00:41:30.900 --> 00:50:42.410 align:start position:0%
a couple of those were passed down
about

00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli will be
 
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
presenting the bill we've had some bills
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
at times just for a quick note
 
00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:52.859 align:start position:0%
where we didn't have either the prime
 
00:50:56.329 --> 00:50:56.339 align:start position:0%
sponsor or the co-sponsor present
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
I would say to another Committee Member
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
take the bill introduce the bill we'd
 
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
introduce it and close it so we had our
 
00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:06.349 align:start position:0%
introduce it and close it so we had our
hearing

00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
so what we'll do right now I'll welcome
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli to our our
 
00:51:14.809 --> 00:51:14.819 align:start position:0%
hearing today on 147. welcome uh thank
 
00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:17.220 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh thank you committee
 
00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:19.980 align:start position:0%
members uh for the record I'm Glenn
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
cordelli representing Tuftonboro
 
00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:25.020 align:start position:0%
Wolfeboro endosopy in the beautiful
 
00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:29.300 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region and uh I will introduce
 
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
this bill which is relative to the
 
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:34.740 align:start position:0%
membership of the advisory committee on
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
the education of students with
 
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
disabilities I have been a member of
 
00:51:45.049 --> 00:51:45.059 align:start position:0%
that uh committee for the past two terms
 
00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
um it is a large committee that is
 
00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
mandated by the federal government under
 
00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:53.630 align:start position:0%
mandated by the federal government under
idea

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:54.950 align:start position:0%
idea
um

00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned it's a large committee
 
00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
there are currently I think 36 members
 
00:52:04.849 --> 00:52:04.859 align:start position:0%
so it is sometimes uh difficult to get
 
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
business done in a concise time with
 
00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
that number of members
 
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
and the prime sponsor of this bill is
 
00:52:19.309 --> 00:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
making two adjustments to the membership
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
um the first
 
00:52:23.329 --> 00:52:23.339 align:start position:0%
um is related to the Department of
 
00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:25.460 align:start position:0%
Corrections representative
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
currently in our law the uh there's a
 
00:52:31.069 --> 00:52:31.079 align:start position:0%
department from extreme representative
 
00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:33.660 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Corrections Plus
 
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
a representative from a County
 
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facility uh federal law
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
just requires someone from the
 
00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections not someone
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
from a County facility as well so um the
 
00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor is adjusting that to be in
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
line with federal law and not require
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
someone from the correctional facility
 
00:52:58.329 --> 00:52:58.339 align:start position:0%
to be present
 
00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:01.940 align:start position:0%
my recollection from meetings is that
 
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:04.740 align:start position:0%
in many if not most cases there is no
 
00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
one present from a County Correctional
 
00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
Facility anyway
 
00:53:12.049 --> 00:53:12.059 align:start position:0%
the second adjustment is to add someone
 
00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
to the advisory committee and that is a
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
health care provider who has who does
 
00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
work with special needs children
 
00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
um to offer advice on questions on
 
00:53:28.930 --> 00:53:28.940 align:start position:0%
disabilities that might come up during
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
discussions of the committee
 
00:53:36.109 --> 00:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
so basically that is the intent of the
 
00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
bill and I'd be glad to take any
 
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative are there any questions
 
00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:47.450 --> 00:53:47.460 align:start position:0%
not yes reps in the hall thank you Mr
 
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:51.180 align:start position:0%
question I'm just curious so you did
 
00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:53.700 align:start position:0%
mention that they don't show up anyway
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
um but are they okay with this change
 
00:53:58.250 --> 00:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
at the corrections
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh I am not sure I I have not been
 
00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
present at a meeting when this is
 
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
um uh been discussed
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
um I know that the uh Committee of the
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
council has um uh a list of possible uh
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
bills that uh uh impact uh children with
 
00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
disabilities in their education uh but I
 
00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
have not been present for any discussion
 
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
about any bill in particular
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:30.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:33.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss representative cardelli
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the addition was someone
 
00:54:37.849 --> 00:54:37.859 align:start position:0%
who was specialized in working with
 
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities but it
 
00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the words with disabilities
 
00:54:49.609 --> 00:54:49.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
um I I think online uh six and seven
 
00:54:58.130 --> 00:54:58.140 align:start position:0%
in the heading of the new paragraph it
 
00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
does mention disabilities uh but
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
possibly not in um my nine or ten as as
 
00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
you indicate
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up question yes so which
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
interpretation is give is would be taken
 
00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:18.230 align:start position:0%
interpretation is give is would be taken
then

00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:20.220 align:start position:0%
um actually what we'll go into statute
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
is line nine and ten and D
 
00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:24.530 align:start position:0%
is line nine and ten and D
um

00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
if the committee would like to offer an
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
amendment to uh put that uh the
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
pediatrician would specialize in working
 
00:55:34.849 --> 00:55:34.859 align:start position:0%
or does work with children with
 
00:55:34.859 --> 00:55:36.349 align:start position:0%
or does work with children with
disabilities

00:55:36.349 --> 00:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
00:55:40.849 --> 00:55:40.859 align:start position:0%
um I would not see a problem with that
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
I I think there might be additional
 
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
amendments anyway relative to the
 
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
membership of the council representative
 
00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
I was just gonna say that there needs to
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
be an amendment anyways because it says
 
00:55:58.849 --> 00:55:58.859 align:start position:0%
who is our the r didn't get struck and
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
so while doing that it would be fine
 
00:56:05.329 --> 00:56:05.339 align:start position:0%
with you and the and the the put with
 
00:56:07.790 --> 00:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
disabilities in as well
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
I was not an English major but I think
 
00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:12.660 align:start position:0%
that would be appropriate thank you
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of times too when this goes back
 
00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:18.140 align:start position:0%
legislative services will correct those
 
00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:22.020 align:start position:0%
grammatical punctuation type errors are
 
00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:23.390 align:start position:0%
grammatical punctuation type errors are
miscues

00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
miscues
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
where the chairman might yeah that's
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
correct reps represent Cornell
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.010 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:56:32.809 --> 00:56:32.819 align:start position:0%
um it says one representative from the
 
00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:34.380 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections and one
 
00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
representative from a County
 
00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facility both of whom are
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
responsible for administering the
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
provision of special education services
 
00:56:44.569 --> 00:56:44.579 align:start position:0%
do you do you know what the difference
 
00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
is between the different populations
 
00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
that are serviced by these two
 
00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:52.490 align:start position:0%
that are serviced by these two
departments

00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
departments
 
00:56:55.790 --> 00:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
um to a degree but I I know also that
 
00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
some County correctional facilities also
 
00:57:01.370 --> 00:57:01.380 align:start position:0%
House State prisoners
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
um but there are different
 
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and statutes uh
 
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
impacting uh the state facility versus
 
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
County facilities
 
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
and different programs that are offered
 
00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:16.010 align:start position:0%
and different programs that are offered
between

00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:17.470 align:start position:0%
between
um

00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:17.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
whether uh you know there are
 
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
differences in terms of the population
 
00:57:25.370 --> 00:57:25.380 align:start position:0%
of prisoners with disabilities
 
00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
um I I think that that would be on an
 
00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
individual basis
 
00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:29.809 align:start position:0%
individual basis
um

00:57:29.809 --> 00:57:29.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
but I I think my interpretation is that
 
00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
it's uh repetitive to have both
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
especially when we in the commission
 
00:57:41.569 --> 00:57:41.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:46.020 align:start position:0%
I also know there's I think 23 parents
 
00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
on it too which might be kind of on what
 
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
we'll leave well actually the Federal
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
Law requires there to be a majority of
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
the committee members uh to be parents
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
further questions of Representative
 
00:58:05.329 --> 00:58:05.339 align:start position:0%
cordelli yes represent whitcock
 
00:58:08.210 --> 00:58:08.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you just
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
following up on my seat mates uh
 
00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
question so uh when you send this back
 
00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
to correct the grammar on line four are
 
00:58:17.809 --> 00:58:17.819 align:start position:0%
you going to add in on line 9 at 10
 
00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:19.740 align:start position:0%
after the word children with
 
00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:20.940 align:start position:0%
disabilities so we're talking about
 
00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
someone specialize with disabilities we
 
00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
can we can yes we can do that and I
 
00:58:29.329 --> 00:58:29.339 align:start position:0%
think that there might be some
 
00:58:32.089 --> 00:58:32.099 align:start position:0%
additional adjustments um
 
00:58:35.049 --> 00:58:35.059 align:start position:0%
along the line with an amendment okay
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
yes you may follow up thank you
 
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
um in in line ten Ender nine and
 
00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
entertainment it suggests a pediatrician
 
00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
but does that preclude any other health
 
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
care provider this is just just like so
 
00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:49.740 align:start position:0%
just maybe a pediatrician or it could be
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
a someone who works in a nursing office
 
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:59.089 --> 00:58:59.099 align:start position:0%
or an r and it doesn't be a pediatrician
 
00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's my question uh representative
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
um uh I I I imagine it could be but we
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
can also talk to the prime sponsor
 
00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:13.380 align:start position:0%
um after this uh uh hearing and see what
 
00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
her original intent was in specifying
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
the pediatrician okay thank you thank
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:22.140 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden thank you Mr
 
00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
chair uh just clarification uh
 
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative on the federal laws
 
00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:28.020 align:start position:0%
requiring representation from
 
00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:29.510 align:start position:0%
requiring representation from
Corrections

00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
Corrections
 
00:59:33.289 --> 00:59:33.299 align:start position:0%
is it requiring someone from both state
 
00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
level Corrections and County Corrections
 
00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:38.940 align:start position:0%
or one or the other uh I believe it's
 
00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:41.220 align:start position:0%
specified state
 
00:59:42.970 --> 00:59:42.980 align:start position:0%
so a County
 
00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
Corrections could substitute for a state
 
00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
person or my recollection and reading
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
idea was that it was a state corrections
 
00:59:56.089 --> 00:59:56.099 align:start position:0%
Department official that is in state law
 
00:59:59.089 --> 00:59:59.099 align:start position:0%
teaching me in federal law okay
 
01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
my follow-up on Health Care
 
01:00:03.049 --> 01:00:03.059 align:start position:0%
um certainly is a great idea to
 
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
recommend a health care provider and
 
01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
wondered if
 
01:00:08.809 --> 01:00:08.819 align:start position:0%
as you pursue the details that
 
01:00:11.089 --> 01:00:11.099 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock just asked is
 
01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:14.220 align:start position:0%
that nurse practitioners and
 
01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:16.140 align:start position:0%
um Physicians assistance so maybe the
 
01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:17.460 align:start position:0%
term could be used as health care
 
01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:18.890 align:start position:0%
term could be used as health care
provider

01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:18.900 align:start position:0%
provider
 
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:22.210 --> 01:00:22.220 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
01:00:24.049 --> 01:00:24.059 align:start position:0%

01:00:24.059 --> 01:00:25.609 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative

representative cordelli did a pretty
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:58.730 --> 01:00:58.740 align:start position:0%

01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
children such as a pediatrician my
 
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
intent was to have it
 
01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
be open enough that considering this is
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
a volunteer position that we would
 
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
be able to fill it for years to come and
 
01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
so I would
 
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
like it ideally to be a pediatrician or
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
a developmental pediatrician or a nurse
 
01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:22.140 align:start position:0%
practitioner and so the intent is for it
 
01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
to be a graduate level provider and not
 
01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:26.150 align:start position:0%
to be a graduate level provider and not
for

01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:28.380 align:start position:0%
let's say an L A or something of that
 
01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:29.390 align:start position:0%
let's say an L A or something of that
sort

01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
sort
 
01:02:31.549 --> 01:02:31.559 align:start position:0%
I do feel that having this type of a
 
01:02:33.770 --> 01:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
position would help to enhance the
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
overall benefit of the committee
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
the committee is
 
01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
rather large it has a 22
 
01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
non-parent State positions and then it
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
has 23 parent slash individuals with
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
disability positions and as mentioned it
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
is a requirement under federal law that
 
01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee be
 
01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
parents or individuals with disabilities
 
01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
so in adding a position I wanted to be
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
sure to take one off that maybe wasn't
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
required and so under federal law there
 
01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
are certain requirements it does require
 
01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
a state's corrections officer but it
 
01:03:15.289 --> 01:03:15.299 align:start position:0%
doesn't require a County corrections
 
01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
officer I do believe that that is an
 
01:03:20.089 --> 01:03:20.099 align:start position:0%
underserved population and should
 
01:03:22.849 --> 01:03:22.859 align:start position:0%
certainly be represented and so having
 
01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
two would still allow for that
 
01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.730 align:start position:0%
two would still allow for that
representation

01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:25.740 align:start position:0%
representation
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
the pediatrician would be able to
 
01:03:30.609 --> 01:03:30.619 align:start position:0%
represent a much wider population
 
01:03:34.329 --> 01:03:34.339 align:start position:0%
including that very same subset that the
 
01:03:38.809 --> 01:03:38.819 align:start position:0%
County officer could also represent
 
01:03:40.849 --> 01:03:40.859 align:start position:0%
happy to take very much representative
 
01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:42.540 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
 
01:03:45.049 --> 01:03:45.059 align:start position:0%
for the representative yes
 
01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh representative
 
01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
kutab um I don't know if you heard the
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
the discussion just when you came in but
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
when representative cordelli introduced
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
the bill he talked about
 
01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
um you're looking for a health care
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
provider who specialized in working with
 
01:04:02.569 --> 01:04:02.579 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities that text
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
isn't in the your your proposal and we
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
wondered if that's your intent are you
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
looking for someone who specializes with
 
01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
children or with children with
 
01:04:12.359 --> 01:04:13.849 align:start position:0%
children or with children with
disabilities

01:04:13.849 --> 01:04:13.859 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:18.829 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:18.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
to answer the question better
 
01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
a pediatrician who is working with
 
01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
children although
 
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
not specializing specifically in
 
01:04:30.049 --> 01:04:30.059 align:start position:0%
disabilities does have a lot of vast
 
01:04:31.609 --> 01:04:31.619 align:start position:0%
experience treating children with
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
disabilities oftentimes they're the ones
 
01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
who are doing regular developmental
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
screenings and they may be part of the
 
01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
team that's working with other
 
01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
Specialists to diagnose certain
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
disabilities with children and so I
 
01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
didn't want to make it so specific that
 
01:04:49.309 --> 01:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
it had to be like a developmental
 
01:04:51.289 --> 01:04:51.299 align:start position:0%
pediatrician because to my knowledge
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
there's currently I believe three
 
01:04:56.890 --> 01:04:56.900 align:start position:0%
developmental pediatricians at Elliott
 
01:04:59.809 --> 01:04:59.819 align:start position:0%
one who is only part-time at Dartmouth
 
01:05:02.089 --> 01:05:02.099 align:start position:0%
and then there's a few nurse
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
practitioners and so I didn't want it to
 
01:05:05.410 --> 01:05:05.420 align:start position:0%
be so
 
01:05:08.329 --> 01:05:08.339 align:start position:0%
confining that it could only be you know
 
01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
a handful of people within the state and
 
01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
so I do feel a pediatrician with
 
01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
experience in all pediatricians should
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
certainly have experience in working
 
01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:18.299 align:start position:0%
with children with disabilities as well
 
01:05:20.089 --> 01:05:20.099 align:start position:0%
as a nurse practitioner who's who's
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
specializing in Pediatrics a PNP would
 
01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.530 align:start position:0%
specializing in Pediatrics a PNP would
have

01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
a vast amount of experience working with
 
01:05:28.130 --> 01:05:28.140 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities follow-up
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
question Mr chairman yes thank you for
 
01:05:33.650 --> 01:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
taking this so then the text as it
 
01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
stands is more of your intent than
 
01:05:38.210 --> 01:05:38.220 align:start position:0%
adding the words with disabilities to
 
01:05:39.890 --> 01:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
Children specializing with children with
 
01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:41.210 align:start position:0%
Children specializing with children with
disabilities

01:05:41.210 --> 01:05:41.220 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
01:05:44.569 --> 01:05:44.579 align:start position:0%
yes other than I it probably would make
 
01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
sense possibly to clarify that it should
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
be a graduate level provider because the
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
intent was for it to be either a
 
01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
pediatrician or a nurse practitioner and
 
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.010 align:start position:0%
pediatrician or a nurse practitioner and
not

01:05:55.010 --> 01:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:05:56.450 --> 01:05:56.460 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:05:59.329 --> 01:05:59.339 align:start position:0%
something less than that
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
okay other further questions of the
 
01:06:03.890 --> 01:06:03.900 align:start position:0%
representative thank you very much thank
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
you we have two cards remember uh
 
01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:07.730 align:start position:0%
you we have two cards remember uh
remaining

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
remaining
 
01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
um Mariah Ryan I would like to speak on
 
01:06:12.289 --> 01:06:12.299 align:start position:0%
this bill we also have Rebecca Fredette
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
who is from the Department of Education
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
special education that is here
 
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
um I see Rebecca you have asked for 10
 
01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
minutes to speak or is it just boiled
 
01:06:28.010 --> 01:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
down to you know technical support
 
01:06:30.170 --> 01:06:30.180 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:54.049 --> 01:06:54.059 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Maura Ryan and I
 
01:06:55.609 --> 01:06:55.619 align:start position:0%
represent parents in the state of New
 
01:06:58.609 --> 01:06:58.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of children with disabilities
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to speak
 
01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.190 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to speak
um

01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:04.970 --> 01:07:04.980 align:start position:0%
in support of hb147 I'm a four-term
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
member of the sac committee at present
 
01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
as a parent representative
 
01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:11.579 align:start position:0%
um we've had a doctor on our committee
 
01:07:13.549 --> 01:07:13.559 align:start position:0%
in the past who is very instrumental in
 
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
getting assistance for children with
 
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.309 align:start position:0%
getting assistance for children with
disabilities

01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
um and unfortunately she wasn't able to
 
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
continue but she was very good at
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
bringing information regarding testing
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
and disabilities particularly if parents
 
01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
aren't knowledgeable on those subject
 
01:07:28.849 --> 01:07:28.859 align:start position:0%
matters I also wanted to point out that
 
01:07:30.049 --> 01:07:30.059 align:start position:0%
there's sort of been a Divergence
 
01:07:31.609 --> 01:07:31.619 align:start position:0%
between medical disability and
 
01:07:34.010 --> 01:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
educational management of disability so
 
01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
having some type of medical knowledge of
 
01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:39.799 align:start position:0%
testing would be very beneficial
 
01:07:43.130 --> 01:07:43.140 align:start position:0%
the law regarding the state advisory
 
01:07:47.809 --> 01:07:47.819 align:start position:0%
committee and the composition is 300.168
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
um which states that there has to be a
 
01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
State Correctional person on the
 
01:07:53.450 --> 01:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
committee we currently have three
 
01:07:55.010 --> 01:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
Correctional members on the committee so
 
01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
it is a bit of Overkill
 
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.930 align:start position:0%
it is a bit of Overkill
um

01:07:59.930 --> 01:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
I think one of the other issues too was
 
01:08:05.569 --> 01:08:05.579 align:start position:0%
that we only have one County uh
 
01:08:07.309 --> 01:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
Correctional person and some of the
 
01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
other counties were saying like why
 
01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
didn't we get representation so I think
 
01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:11.700 align:start position:0%
the state overall is a better
 
01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
representation I do agree with the
 
01:08:16.809 --> 01:08:16.819 align:start position:0%
suggestion of a higher degree
 
01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
level medical person
 
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
um but the purpose of the state advisory
 
01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
committee is to be a parent-led
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
committee and it is to have parent voice
 
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:26.100 align:start position:0%
on students with disabilities because
 
01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
they live with it so I'm here in support
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
of that bill and I'm happy to take any
 
01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:31.370 align:start position:0%
of that bill and I'm happy to take any
questions

01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:31.380 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mariah are there any
 
01:08:37.249 --> 01:08:37.259 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent Damon thank you
 
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:08:41.209 --> 01:08:41.219 align:start position:0%
um I just want a clarification the
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
draft of the bill speaks about two
 
01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
Correctional positions as has been
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
discussed but both you and
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative could top reference three
 
01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
so who's the third what are the
 
01:08:54.650 --> 01:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
qualifications of third party
 
01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
the other correctional officer so
 
01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
there's one who specializes in Adult
 
01:08:59.930 --> 01:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
Services one who Services State
 
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
Correctional populations and there's a
 
01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
County correctional person so there are
 
01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
three at present
 
01:09:09.849 --> 01:09:09.859 align:start position:0%
further questions yes
 
01:09:12.410 --> 01:09:12.420 align:start position:0%
so the one who represents the adult
 
01:09:15.229 --> 01:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
population is also at the state level I
 
01:09:17.209 --> 01:09:17.219 align:start position:0%
believe Federal level
 
01:09:19.249 --> 01:09:19.259 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
are there further questions yes
 
01:09:23.329 --> 01:09:23.339 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell Thank you thank
 
01:09:25.249 --> 01:09:25.259 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question you said that
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
the medical person would have medical
 
01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:29.460 align:start position:0%
knowledge of testing I'm not quite sure
 
01:09:30.530 --> 01:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
what you mean
 
01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:32.699 align:start position:0%
so when your child gets diagnosed with a
 
01:09:34.189 --> 01:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
disability they go through a battery of
 
01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
tests those could be things like a towel
 
01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:39.900 align:start position:0%
four a whisk a Wyatt things of that
 
01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
nature which I happen to be a registered
 
01:09:43.849 --> 01:09:43.859 align:start position:0%
nurse so I understand what those things
 
01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
are but the average parent doesn't and
 
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
in the past a lot of um disability
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
groups will try and approach parents
 
01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
after their children have been diagnosed
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
through pediatricians offices to try and
 
01:09:57.290 --> 01:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
help them manage and deal with the
 
01:09:59.630 --> 01:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
situation at hand and sort of turn it
 
01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
into something positive and get supports
 
01:10:04.970 --> 01:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
so they're connected and I think in the
 
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
past historically they've been more
 
01:10:07.610 --> 01:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
connected but there's been a little bit
 
01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
of a Divergence as management of medical
 
01:10:12.430 --> 01:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
disability has changed
 
01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
versus educational disability they've
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
sort of gone on two different paths does
 
01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
that answer your question thank you yes
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we have the
 
01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:23.340 align:start position:0%

01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.090 align:start position:0%
um just for clarification
um

01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:29.149 --> 01:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
yes we do have two Representatives on
 
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
the committee from both the County
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
correctional facility and the um state
 
01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.310 align:start position:0%
correctional facility and the um state
prison

01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
prison
 
01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
um there are I would just note that
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
there are differences in their
 
01:11:39.169 --> 01:11:39.179 align:start position:0%
responsibilities in regards to Ida I
 
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
believe somebody had asked that question
 
01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
I couldn't see so I'm not sure who it
 
01:11:44.570 --> 01:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
was um for the state facility they are
 
01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
required to provide education through
 
01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
the Granite State High School that they
 
01:11:50.209 --> 01:11:50.219 align:start position:0%
have within their facility for County
 
01:11:52.189 --> 01:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
correctional facilities they have to
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
collaborate with leas to provide special
 
01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
education so it is a different role but
 
01:11:59.689 --> 01:11:59.699 align:start position:0%
they do both work in the correctional
 
01:11:59.699 --> 01:12:01.430 align:start position:0%
they do both work in the correctional
facility

01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:02.990 align:start position:0%
facility
um

01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:04.610 --> 01:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
the other one was the three
 
01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:06.780 align:start position:0%
Representatives I I guess I was unclear
 
01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:08.460 align:start position:0%
on the three Representatives as well
 
01:12:10.130 --> 01:12:10.140 align:start position:0%
there is the state facility there's the
 
01:12:11.689 --> 01:12:11.699 align:start position:0%
county facility and we had previously
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
had one that was part of the sununu
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
Youth Services Center but they do not
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
have a representative at this point and
 
01:12:20.090 --> 01:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
have chosen to send somebody from dcyf
 
01:12:21.410 --> 01:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know if that was the third
 
01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative so I just wanted to
 
01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
clarify those pieces from just the
 
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
conversations that we had but if you
 
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
have any other questions I'm willing to
 
01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
answer them thank you very much are
 
01:12:31.550 --> 01:12:31.560 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:12:45.530 --> 01:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
How are um how are people uh I guess
 
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
um recommended to be nominated to the um
 
01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh the this the the SEC so there's um
 
01:12:55.490 --> 01:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
two ways that they can be appointed by
 
01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
the governor they can go to the SAC
 
01:12:59.689 --> 01:12:59.699 align:start position:0%
meeting and express their interest on
 
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
being on the committee and then the sack
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
through their bylaws um
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
State advisory committee acronym Sac I
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
apologize they can come to they ask that
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
you come to two meetings and then that
 
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
you submit a resume and then they vote
 
01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
on it at the SEC at the second meeting
 
01:13:18.169 --> 01:13:18.179 align:start position:0%
as to whether you would be appointed to
 
01:13:20.090 --> 01:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
or sent to the governor and the
 
01:13:21.890 --> 01:13:21.900 align:start position:0%
commissioner for appointment you can
 
01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
also send a letter directly to the
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
governor and ask for an appointment
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
there it does come back to us so that
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
the commissioner is aware of it and we
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
do make sure that they would meet the
 
01:13:32.330 --> 01:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
requirements of being on the on the
 
01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
committee but then it would go back to
 
01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
the governor and then be appointed
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
through there
 
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
thanks very much Mr that's actually very
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
helpful to know thanks did you have
 
01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you I have
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
two actually
 
01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:49.140 align:start position:0%
um good morning how are you doing yes
 
01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
it's a horrible place for that by the
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
way Mr chair uh that being said one
 
01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
question is the membership capped at 36
 
01:14:00.910 --> 01:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
so the membership um is to however many
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
required individuals so the required the
 
01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
correctional facility a state a special
 
01:14:06.649 --> 01:14:06.659 align:start position:0%
ed director
 
01:14:07.729 --> 01:14:07.739 align:start position:0%
um and then you fill all of those
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
positions and you have to have 51 of
 
01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:12.780 align:start position:0%
parents so if you so you always have to
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
have more parents than you do the other
 
01:14:14.159 --> 01:14:15.470 align:start position:0%
have more parents than you do the other
positions

01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:14:18.649 --> 01:14:18.659 align:start position:0%
thank you um the follow-up to that is uh
 
01:14:21.169 --> 01:14:21.179 align:start position:0%
you talked a minute ago it was wonderful
 
01:14:22.669 --> 01:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
because I didn't understand it at all
 
01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
actually so the state prison does the
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
high school program within the facility
 
01:14:29.689 --> 01:14:29.699 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and the county
 
01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
representative of the Lea does the does
 
01:14:35.689 --> 01:14:35.699 align:start position:0%
the IEP for students that are within
 
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
under lsnas right so if we eliminated
 
01:14:41.689 --> 01:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
the county uh position County correct
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
position from this membership would that
 
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
mean that those youngsters wouldn't have
 
01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
uh someone representing them in terms of
 
01:14:51.410 --> 01:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
their IEP or creating those things no
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
they would still have represent they
 
01:14:54.169 --> 01:14:54.179 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have representation on this
 
01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
committee but they do still have
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
representation from their school
 
01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
districts that the County correctional
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
facilities work with Okay so there's a
 
01:15:03.050 --> 01:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
process by which they they work with us
 
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
in collaboration with us to identify
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
students that may be identified as
 
01:15:09.530 --> 01:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
having a disability and then they would
 
01:15:12.050 --> 01:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
reach out to the Lea that so wherever
 
01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
that child or or young adult lived
 
01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
before they were incarcerated they would
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
reach out to that local Education Agency
 
01:15:21.890 --> 01:15:21.900 align:start position:0%
and they would collaborate with them to
 
01:15:23.149 --> 01:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
ensure that they were getting the
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
services that they may need okay just
 
01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:27.900 align:start position:0%
one more if I may as a chair yes so so
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
just to clarify that so that means uh
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
assuming this bill goes through with
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
with the deletion of that County
 
01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
representative then a youngster who is
 
01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
incarcerated in the county facility
 
01:15:41.450 --> 01:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
um would the county facilities
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility then to what you're
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
telling me if I understand this the
 
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
county facilities responsibility then
 
01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
somewhere there would be responsible to
 
01:15:50.570 --> 01:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
get back to the home school Sunday
 
01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:51.649 align:start position:0%
get back to the home school Sunday
District

01:15:51.649 --> 01:15:51.659 align:start position:0%
District
 
01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
that's what they already do they are so
 
01:15:56.090 --> 01:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
the the committee position doesn't um
 
01:15:57.950 --> 01:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
oversee any of that it's just that it's
 
01:15:59.570 --> 01:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
a representative from one of the
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
counties and they rotate that through
 
01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
the different counties so that they have
 
01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
some you know they have a voice yeah
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarity thank you Mr
 
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
chairman uh represent Woodcock that it's
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
on a good point that's very difficult
 
01:16:12.649 --> 01:16:12.659 align:start position:0%
sometimes for counties to track that
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
down a person is
 
01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:17.640 align:start position:0%
done something down in Hanover but was
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
not uh a resident of Hanover but a
 
01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
resident of Plymouth and you've got to
 
01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
determine whether it's an IEP whether
 
01:16:27.410 --> 01:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
they've graduated yet all those things
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
come in the bundle and I know that where
 
01:16:31.130 --> 01:16:31.140 align:start position:0%
I've been on the executive committee at
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
Grafton County it's been a real chore
 
01:16:35.570 --> 01:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
trying to find out where the the
 
01:16:37.850 --> 01:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
resident district is oftentimes less
 
01:16:41.689 --> 01:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions here with this whole
 
01:16:44.930 --> 01:16:44.940 align:start position:0%
thing but this is another topic are
 
01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
there any other questions for Rebecca
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
yes representative hall or Damon I mean
 
01:16:51.709 --> 01:16:51.719 align:start position:0%
excuse me it's okay thank you
 
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:55.430 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
um

01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:59.390 --> 01:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
do you have any data on what portion of
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
the students with disabilities are in
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
County facilities versus State
 
01:17:08.570 --> 01:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
facilities so I would not have the
 
01:17:10.669 --> 01:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
numbers on the state facilities and then
 
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
the information that I have because it
 
01:17:13.970 --> 01:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
is for the correctional facilities
 
01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
because it's such a small number it is
 
01:17:18.649 --> 01:17:18.659 align:start position:0%
considered personally identifiable
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
information so I would have to look to
 
01:17:23.209 --> 01:17:23.219 align:start position:0%
see if I could put that out but really
 
01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
what we do with the county is they send
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
us newly incarcerated individuals within
 
01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
the age range and then we say yes you
 
01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
should reach out to Concord School
 
01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
District or you should reach out to this
 
01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
this is the last one we have of record
 
01:17:38.229 --> 01:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
but they are very small numbers
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
thanks very much we're right at the end
 
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
of our time here so uh if there are any
 
01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
other real questions that we have we can
 
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
ask them of the department when we meet
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have any other cards uh on 147
 
01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
here so with that I'm going to close the
 
01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:04.250 align:start position:0%
here so with that I'm going to close the
hearing

01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
and the next hearing which we have which
 
01:18:09.890 --> 01:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
we're going to move right into
 
01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:12.430 align:start position:0%
we're going to move right into
foreign

01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:18:16.450 --> 01:18:16.460 align:start position:0%
scheduled for 10 40 uh
 
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
hb102 102 local requiring high schools
 
01:18:22.729 --> 01:18:22.739 align:start position:0%
to include instruction the nature and
 
01:18:27.310 --> 01:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
okay so I'd like to invite forward the
 
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of the bill that would be
 
01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:44.340 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
and it is going to be back to see some
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
familiar faces uh for the record my name
 
01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
is Mike moffatt I'm the state
 
01:19:02.689 --> 01:19:02.699 align:start position:0%
representative from Merrimack District
 
01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
for the towns of Canterbury Loudoun so
 
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
to get right through this
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
um this bill simply requires
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
an hour one hour of classroom attention
 
01:19:17.630 --> 01:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
to be paid to the uh
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
origin and nature of communism
 
01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
it's been inspired by numerous
 
01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
conversations with parents and citizens
 
01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
who are very concerned that the Young
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
Folks today do not know some some
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
important things that they do need to
 
01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
know in terms of
 
01:19:36.530 --> 01:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
uh how our world has come to be
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
many schools do not teach history like
 
01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
they used to many schools do not teach
 
01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
history it is a social science major of
 
01:19:48.169 --> 01:19:48.179 align:start position:0%
course I'm distressed by that as are
 
01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
others so anyway there are at least four
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
Uh current and former house members
 
01:19:56.570 --> 01:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
colleagues who have first seen
 
01:19:59.450 --> 01:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
experience with with Communism
 
01:20:01.370 --> 01:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
uh such as the former member of this
 
01:20:03.169 --> 01:20:03.179 align:start position:0%
committee representative sodi whose
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
parents came from or refugees from
 
01:20:08.709 --> 01:20:08.719 align:start position:0%
Hungary after the 1956 Revolution there
 
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh current rep exploration he uh he
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
still has relatives in Kiev cave in the
 
01:20:19.450 --> 01:20:19.460 align:start position:0%
Ukraine uh former rep Michael yokovic
 
01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:21.719 align:start position:0%
whose family escaped from the former
 
01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
Soviet Union
 
01:20:26.209 --> 01:20:26.219 align:start position:0%
in one of the spilled sponsors uh who
 
01:20:27.530 --> 01:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here today I'll take some of
 
01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
his time uh representative Jose
 
01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
Campbells who was a refugee from
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
Castro's communist Cuba so like any
 
01:20:36.169 --> 01:20:36.179 align:start position:0%
worthy measure I think this is a worthy
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
measure this bill invites some questions
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
and I'll try to quickly run through them
 
01:20:42.410 --> 01:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
uh now and and later if there are any
 
01:20:45.709 --> 01:20:45.719 align:start position:0%
questions so question why communism why
 
01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
not uh a period of instruction on uh
 
01:20:52.010 --> 01:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
Mussolini or islamo fascism Aryan Nation
 
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
Q Anon whatever
 
01:20:57.169 --> 01:20:57.179 align:start position:0%
and good question in these and other
 
01:20:59.570 --> 01:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
violent movements rate attention and
 
01:21:03.290 --> 01:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
study but to try to include all these in
 
01:21:04.970 --> 01:21:04.980 align:start position:0%
in the statute would just simply be
 
01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:07.070 align:start position:0%
in the statute would just simply be
unwieldy

01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
unwieldy
 
01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
educated citizens in America today need
 
01:21:14.570 --> 01:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
to understand the or what communism is
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
and how that political and economic
 
01:21:18.890 --> 01:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
system has shaped our history and
 
01:21:22.189 --> 01:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
profoundly affects all of us today
 
01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
uh dictionary definition of communism
 
01:21:27.290 --> 01:21:27.300 align:start position:0%
political Theory derived from Karl Marx
 
01:21:30.050 --> 01:21:30.060 align:start position:0%
I think I hope most all of you know the
 
01:21:33.070 --> 01:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
basics advocating class Warfare
 
01:21:36.290 --> 01:21:36.300 align:start position:0%
resulting in all property being state
 
01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:37.810 align:start position:0%
resulting in all property being state
owned

01:21:37.810 --> 01:21:37.820 align:start position:0%
owned
 
01:21:41.450 --> 01:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
involves a centrally planned economy as
 
01:21:43.130 --> 01:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
opposed to one that reflects Market
 
01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:44.810 align:start position:0%

forces
 
01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
so without exception communist countries
 
01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
depend on vast networks of secret police
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
to impose party will on everyone and
 
01:21:55.729 --> 01:21:55.739 align:start position:0%
while there are different gradations and
 
01:21:58.130 --> 01:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
shades of Communism Yugoslavia was a
 
01:22:00.250 --> 01:22:00.260 align:start position:0%
little was was different from
 
01:22:02.630 --> 01:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
Czechoslovakia it was different from
 
01:22:05.770 --> 01:22:05.780 align:start position:0%
Soviet Union so
 
01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
it Still Remains a totalitarian ideology
 
01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
incompatible without it's an atheist
 
01:22:15.050 --> 01:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
totalitarian ideology incompatible many
 
01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
of us think with America and our values
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
and our system of government
 
01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
so throughout the 20th century and into
 
01:22:24.669 --> 01:22:24.679 align:start position:0%
the current sensory this incompatibility
 
01:22:27.770 --> 01:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
I just mentioned
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
reflected in hot Wars and cold Wars
 
01:22:34.130 --> 01:22:34.140 align:start position:0%

the union of the Soviet Socialist
 
01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
republics was born violence and
 
01:22:46.130 --> 01:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
bloodshed after the 1917 Russian
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
Revolution it then established a common

01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
turn
 
01:22:52.130 --> 01:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
um and that was the Communist
 
01:22:54.530 --> 01:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
International to spread communism
 
01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
worldwide by whatever means necessary
 
01:22:59.630 --> 01:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
whatever the cost slavery replaced by
 
01:23:02.410 --> 01:23:02.420 align:start position:0%
the common form so let's try to
 
01:23:05.689 --> 01:23:05.699 align:start position:0%
quantify this movement in terms of lives

socialism but communism predated Nazi
 
01:23:52.189 --> 01:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
Nazism is a totalitarian ideology in
 
01:23:53.930 --> 01:23:53.940 align:start position:0%
many ways very similar in some
 
01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
fundamental ways they're different
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's why they went to war in 1941 but
 
01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:00.719 align:start position:0%
Hitler and the Nazis long gone
 
01:24:03.709 --> 01:24:03.719 align:start position:0%
although that movement remains and
 
01:24:06.430 --> 01:24:06.440 align:start position:0%

we speak there are communist nuclear
 
01:24:20.570 --> 01:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
missiles pointed at us and some of us
 
01:24:22.130 --> 01:24:22.140 align:start position:0%
don't think much about it some of us
 
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
don't even know that and that's one of
 
01:24:25.610 --> 01:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
the reasons why we want to focus a
 
01:24:27.410 --> 01:24:27.420 align:start position:0%
little attention on this
 
01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
speaking of nuclear missiles I know
 
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
there are others here besides me as I
 
01:24:35.149 --> 01:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
look around at least a few who remember
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 I'm
 
01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
sure I know at least a few of you I was
 
01:24:42.649 --> 01:24:42.659 align:start position:0%
seven years old
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
and for a week or two weeks
 
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
when I was in the second grade it was
 
01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
one of the most it might have been the
 
01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
most terrifying time of my life and and
 
01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
in that when you're seven years old and
 
01:24:57.070 --> 01:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
all the grown-ups are scared to death
 
01:24:59.570 --> 01:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
that nuclear missiles are going to come
 
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
in and and kill us all really uh that's
 
01:25:05.570 --> 01:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
something that stays with you so I'm
 
01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
talking about it today
 
01:25:10.610 --> 01:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
my dad at that time in 1962 explained
 
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
that if if or when the bombs came uh
 
01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
we'd I'll quickly go to the underground
 
01:25:18.290 --> 01:25:18.300 align:start position:0%
Fallout shelters beneath the Groveton
 
01:25:21.890 --> 01:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
paper mill I don't know if you had the
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
same guidance represent piles also from
 
01:25:24.719 --> 01:25:26.030 align:start position:0%
same guidance represent piles also from
Groveton

01:25:26.030 --> 01:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
Groveton
 
01:25:28.430 --> 01:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
to the so yeah so we're ready to go to
 
01:25:30.050 --> 01:25:30.060 align:start position:0%
the following shelter in the bronze came
 
01:25:32.090 --> 01:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
and they didn't come we survived that
 
01:25:34.189 --> 01:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
crisis but there were many lessons to be
 
01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
learned and how many high school
 
01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
graduates today have a hot clue hot clue
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
is an expression I get from the chair
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
have a hot clue
 
01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:43.130 align:start position:0%
have a hot clue
um

01:25:43.130 --> 01:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:45.169 --> 01:25:45.179 align:start position:0%
about the Cuban Missile Crisis I won't
 
01:25:47.209 --> 01:25:47.219 align:start position:0%
put I won't put representative McDonald
 
01:25:50.810 --> 01:25:50.820 align:start position:0%
on the spot I want to ask but I won't
 
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh because I'm sure but but how many
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
students have a hot clue about the Cuban
 
01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
Missile Crisis that impacted some of us
 
01:25:59.330 --> 01:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
so profoundly you're the Korean War the
 
01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
Vietnam War our own chair again
 
01:26:03.530 --> 01:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
representative in Vietnam where
 
01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
Communists tried to kill him you imagine
 
01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
trying to kill such a nice man as that I
 
01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:09.350 align:start position:0%
trying to kill such a nice man as that I
mean

01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
and that's history and out of Vietnam
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
came the boat people
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
how many high schoolers today know about
 
01:26:19.490 --> 01:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
the boat people who are the boat people
 
01:26:21.649 --> 01:26:21.659 align:start position:0%
can you imagine a Communist Regime so
 
01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
heinous that hundreds or thousands of
 
01:26:27.649 --> 01:26:27.659 align:start position:0%
Vietnamese get into boats and sailed off
 
01:26:29.629 --> 01:26:29.639 align:start position:0%
in the ocean because
 
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
they would rather face drowning Pirates
 
01:26:35.209 --> 01:26:35.219 align:start position:0%
rapists on the high seas than have to
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
live under communism this is just a
 
01:26:38.510 --> 01:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
short time ago
 
01:26:43.010 --> 01:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
again representative lab was in Vietnam
 
01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:44.209 align:start position:0%
again representative lab was in Vietnam
um

01:26:44.209 --> 01:26:44.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
and then there were those lucky boat
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
people who came to America
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
and again but so many Americans don't
 
01:26:54.290 --> 01:26:54.300 align:start position:0%
know this history history is not taught
 
01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
like it should be I think many of us
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
think next door to Vietnam is Cambodia
 
01:27:02.570 --> 01:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
if you look at a map uh you know who who
 
01:27:04.610 --> 01:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
knows where Cambodia is I'm afraid a lot
 
01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
of people don't even know where it is or
 
01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
why it's important what happened there's
 
01:27:09.890 --> 01:27:09.900 align:start position:0%
next to Vietnam
 
01:27:13.129 --> 01:27:13.139 align:start position:0%
between 1975 when the Communists took
 
01:27:16.129 --> 01:27:16.139 align:start position:0%
over just a short time ago really
 
01:27:20.810 --> 01:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
in 1979 during their four-year period
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
over 2 million cambodians were murdered
 
01:27:27.290 --> 01:27:27.300 align:start position:0%
by the communist genocide classic
 
01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:29.689 align:start position:0%

how many Young Americans today know what
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
the Killing Fields or The Killing Fields
 
01:27:37.129 --> 01:27:37.139 align:start position:0%
of Cambodia some of you know some I know
 
01:27:40.669 --> 01:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
some of you know I'm aware of it is that
 
01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
important to know why these millions of
 
01:27:44.330 --> 01:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
people just a short time ago in Cambodia
 
01:27:46.129 --> 01:27:46.139 align:start position:0%
were murdered
 
01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
and yet people don't know do they care
 
01:27:52.850 --> 01:27:52.860 align:start position:0%
they should care and someone care if if
 
01:27:54.169 --> 01:27:54.179 align:start position:0%
we would do a little bit to raise
 
01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
awareness about some some recent history
 
01:27:58.970 --> 01:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
that they should know Ronald Reagan
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
correctly called the Soviet Union a evil
 
01:28:04.250 --> 01:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
empire or he was right communist entity
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
created the Iron Curtain how many high
 
01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
school students are who I think all of
 
01:28:10.970 --> 01:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
us know what the Iron Curtain was
 
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
but how did it come about why was it why
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
was there an iron curtain how does that
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
affect us today affects us a lot again
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative saudi's family came from
 
01:28:23.810 --> 01:28:23.820 align:start position:0%
behind the Iron Curtain he's not here
 
01:28:26.810 --> 01:28:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
but if folks with some Curious you might
 
01:28:33.530 --> 01:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
ask him that question
 
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
so anyway to try to finish this up I'll
 
01:28:37.550 --> 01:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
use a minute or two representative
 
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
Campbell's time he was very passionate
 
01:28:41.450 --> 01:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
about this as a refugee from Cuba
 
01:28:42.910 --> 01:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
himself a member of this house
 
01:28:45.649 --> 01:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill I faced
 
01:28:47.810 --> 01:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
communist Weaponry myself I was my
 
01:28:51.370 --> 01:28:51.380 align:start position:0%
battalion's anti-mac officer in Kuwait
 
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
1991 Desert Sun and the enemy had these
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
t-62 t-72 tags pointed at us which we
 
01:29:00.410 --> 01:29:00.420 align:start position:0%
took out these are tanks manufactured by
 
01:29:02.689 --> 01:29:02.699 align:start position:0%
the Soviets Communists built these
 
01:29:04.250 --> 01:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
weapons that were shooting at us the
 
01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
scud missiles that flew over our heads
 
01:29:09.050 --> 01:29:09.060 align:start position:0%
uh they killed two not too many people
 
01:29:12.649 --> 01:29:12.659 align:start position:0%
from Arabia to Israel uh communist
 
01:29:15.410 --> 01:29:15.420 align:start position:0%
weapons so how many of us are concerned
 
01:29:17.450 --> 01:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
that so many people don't have that that
 
01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
hot clue about who Stalin and Lenin were
 
01:29:22.970 --> 01:29:22.980 align:start position:0%
or Mao iron curtains Sputnik Bay of Pigs
 
01:29:25.209 --> 01:29:25.219 align:start position:0%

01:29:28.090 --> 01:29:28.100 align:start position:0%
perestroika the rosenbergs
 
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
why did we execute this this American
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
couple husband and wife executed why
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
something that Bears discussion I think
 
01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
today what is a gulag
 
01:29:42.890 --> 01:29:42.900 align:start position:0%
what was the Cold War as I said earlier
 
01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:43.729 align:start position:0%
what was the Cold War as I said earlier
so

01:29:43.729 --> 01:29:43.739 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
the philosopher George Santana said and
 
01:29:48.649 --> 01:29:48.659 align:start position:0%
I know you've heard this
 
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
those who do not remember the past or
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
condemned to repeat it there's much
 
01:29:54.110 --> 01:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
truth to that but how can you remember
 
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
the past important past if you don't
 
01:30:00.250 --> 01:30:00.260 align:start position:0%
study freedom of history courses
 
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
across the street
 
01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:04.629 align:start position:0%
across the street
Elizabeth

01:30:04.629 --> 01:30:04.639 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
maybe met her the wonderful building
 
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
right across the street the New
 
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Historical Society
 
01:30:14.209 --> 01:30:14.219 align:start position:0%
um Sometimes some of the youngsters who
 
01:30:15.950 --> 01:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
come to visit the state house go there
 
01:30:18.890 --> 01:30:18.900 align:start position:0%
after they visit the state house and
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth told me that uh she gets very
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
sad when she quickly realizes that the
 
01:30:28.729 --> 01:30:28.739 align:start position:0%
the youngsters and holsters who visit
 
01:30:31.370 --> 01:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
right across the street I've only been
 
01:30:34.129 --> 01:30:34.139 align:start position:0%
there once and I don't know if you've
 
01:30:37.070 --> 01:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
ever been a it it's wonderful
 
01:30:40.129 --> 01:30:40.139 align:start position:0%
uh it costs seven bucks but
 
01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
folks like her who I've spoken with and
 
01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:45.110 align:start position:0%
folks like her who I've spoken with and
others

01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:30:48.350 --> 01:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
um are afraid and Disturbed and I say
 
01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
it's right they're fearful about our
 
01:30:53.810 --> 01:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
country's future when so many extras
 
01:30:56.570 --> 01:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
just don't know
 
01:30:59.689 --> 01:30:59.699 align:start position:0%
where we came from and things that they
 
01:31:02.689 --> 01:31:02.699 align:start position:0%
shouldn't especially Ukraine today uh
 
01:31:06.290 --> 01:31:06.300 align:start position:0%
Vladimir Putin was in his a communist I
 
01:31:09.010 --> 01:31:09.020 align:start position:0%
mean he was the head of the Soviet KGB
 
01:31:12.770 --> 01:31:12.780 align:start position:0%
and you know he he had his country
 
01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
invade Ukraine does that affect people
 
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
today heck yes you know from the big oil
 
01:31:21.530 --> 01:31:21.540 align:start position:0%
prices to he's threatened to use nuclear
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
missiles I I I'm sure most of you know
 
01:31:27.050 --> 01:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
that do you think our young people
 
01:31:29.209 --> 01:31:29.219 align:start position:0%
or everyone should have a little bit
 
01:31:33.410 --> 01:31:33.420 align:start position:0%
more awareness of the the potential of
 
01:31:34.910 --> 01:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
these nuclear missiles that he's
 
01:31:38.330 --> 01:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
threatening to use enveloping escalating
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
into a nuclear war so this proposed
 
01:31:44.689 --> 01:31:44.699 align:start position:0%
statute does not require any course it
 
01:31:46.910 --> 01:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't even require an assessment it
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
simply asked it's still to spend at
 
01:31:50.570 --> 01:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
least one hour
 
01:31:53.209 --> 01:31:53.219 align:start position:0%
embedded or however they want to do it
 
01:31:55.490 --> 01:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
locally one hour to just start the
 
01:31:57.950 --> 01:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
process of raising some basic awareness
 
01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
of this subject of the history and
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
nature of Communism and how would it
 
01:32:06.770 --> 01:32:06.780 align:start position:0%
impacts us today
 
01:32:09.530 --> 01:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
so implementing this would be subject to
 
01:32:11.810 --> 01:32:11.820 align:start position:0%
local control if it moves forward which
 
01:32:14.110 --> 01:32:14.120 align:start position:0%
obviously I hope it does
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
and we would expect that uh if it did
 
01:32:20.330 --> 01:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
before doe as they always do would issue
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
a little advisory or some basic guidance
 
01:32:24.169 --> 01:32:24.179 align:start position:0%
in terms of helping districts to
 
01:32:24.179 --> 01:32:26.030 align:start position:0%
in terms of helping districts to
implement

01:32:26.030 --> 01:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
implement
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
the uh the statute now I've heard of her
 
01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
today that some folks worry though if
 
01:32:33.709 --> 01:32:33.719 align:start position:0%
this were to move forward fair question
 
01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
what about proselytation what if some
 
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
Marxist educator takes this hour and and
 
01:32:43.689 --> 01:32:43.699 align:start position:0%
tries to uh
 
01:32:46.669 --> 01:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
provide a shade or a biased view of
 
01:32:49.490 --> 01:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
choice this what how communism came
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
about what it is it's fair question I
 
01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
don't I I don't worry too much about
 
01:32:57.530 --> 01:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
that I I think that discretion is good I
 
01:33:00.290 --> 01:33:00.300 align:start position:0%
think out of this one hour if if you
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
move it forward
 
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
this window requirement many other hours
 
01:33:07.129 --> 01:33:07.139 align:start position:0%
will flow from that and and discussion
 
01:33:10.610 --> 01:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
will locally will happen uh about this
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
and then the questions about you know
 
01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
why don't we have an hour on Queue or
 
01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:15.530 align:start position:0%
why don't we have an hour on Queue or
not

01:33:15.530 --> 01:33:15.540 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:33:19.129 --> 01:33:19.139 align:start position:0%
good question well Q10 doesn't have uh
 
01:33:21.050 --> 01:33:21.060 align:start position:0%
nuclear missiles pointed at us for one
 
01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
thing so anyway I trust the districts
 
01:33:29.330 --> 01:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
and uh I don't worry excessively about
 
01:33:32.090 --> 01:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
the hour being abused
 
01:33:34.010 --> 01:33:34.020 align:start position:0%
so anyway that's that's about it local
 
01:33:36.350 --> 01:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
control I'm sure this uh will have some
 
01:33:37.970 --> 01:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
robust discussion thanks for your time
 
01:33:41.090 --> 01:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
and for uh letting me say if you want
 
01:33:43.010 --> 01:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:33:44.090 --> 01:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
um are there questions for our
 
01:33:47.050 --> 01:33:47.060 align:start position:0%
representative representative luno
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair thank you
 
01:33:51.290 --> 01:33:51.300 align:start position:0%
very much representative Moffett for
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
joining us this morning
 
01:33:55.850 --> 01:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
um at the uh at the start of the uh I
 
01:33:57.950 --> 01:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
feel like I've just had an hour crash
 
01:34:01.850 --> 01:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
course in um in communism uh but at the
 
01:34:03.950 --> 01:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
start of it you mentioned um you you
 
01:34:06.110 --> 01:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
made a comment schools don't teach
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
history where'd that come from
 
01:34:09.649 --> 01:34:09.659 align:start position:0%
sure thanks for your question the
 
01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
question representative Bruno that's uh
 
01:34:12.890 --> 01:34:12.900 align:start position:0%
maybe we call it in a slight
 
01:34:15.770 --> 01:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
exaggerational embellishment uh that's
 
01:34:17.450 --> 01:34:17.460 align:start position:0%
what people say to me you know schools
 
01:34:19.010 --> 01:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
of course they do they're all different
 
01:34:22.970 --> 01:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
some teach it better than others stem
 
01:34:26.990 --> 01:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
has been the emphasis in uh in so many
 
01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:29.340 align:start position:0%
people have said and you can do the
 
01:34:32.570 --> 01:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
research schools curriculum do not any
 
01:34:35.209 --> 01:34:35.219 align:start position:0%
longer include in many cases uh U.S
 
01:34:38.209 --> 01:34:38.219 align:start position:0%
history or world history uh and thank
 
01:34:40.270 --> 01:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
you for nodding your head is
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
yes let's put it this way history is not
 
01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
taught like it used to be it's been it's
 
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
being taught less and that's that's the
 
01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:49.850 align:start position:0%
being taught less and that's that's the
concern

01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:49.860 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:34:53.450 --> 01:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
did it follow up on that a quick one
 
01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
um are you are you aware of the um the
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
current status of the uh the
 
01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
Department's effort to revise the social
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
studies curriculum in New Hampshire oh
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
great thank you for the question very
 
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
much I've actually had a little bit of
 
01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
input there and I support that and I'm
 
01:35:10.189 --> 01:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
pleased that that's that is is happening
 
01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:12.300 align:start position:0%
and I hope it leads to uh some more
 
01:35:15.410 --> 01:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
attention in this all right so and uh so
 
01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
can you can you address that Rick yeah
 
01:35:20.689 --> 01:35:20.699 align:start position:0%
yeah I I have a question here because we
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
are going to we have about 20 more 20
 
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
minutes on this
 
01:35:27.050 --> 01:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
um I'm concerned the area that I have
 
01:35:29.330 --> 01:35:29.340 align:start position:0%
some concern with is there are students
 
01:35:32.149 --> 01:35:32.159 align:start position:0%
that have IEPs which are and you say
 
01:35:34.669 --> 01:35:34.679 align:start position:0%
every student here and there's some
 
01:35:38.689 --> 01:35:38.699 align:start position:0%
conditions where a child may have
 
01:35:41.689 --> 01:35:41.699 align:start position:0%
multiple handicap uh situations written
 
01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:47.460 align:start position:0%
in and or or is uh placed in a uh a
 
01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:49.620 align:start position:0%
hospital situation or a residential
 
01:35:53.209 --> 01:35:53.219 align:start position:0%
place basement and for for some severe
 
01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:56.159 align:start position:0%
issues that's one one exception I'm
 
01:35:58.129 --> 01:35:58.139 align:start position:0%
concerned about the other is that we
 
01:36:00.410 --> 01:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
have a lot of transition between our
 
01:36:02.209 --> 01:36:02.219 align:start position:0%
school districts in this state and
 
01:36:03.890 --> 01:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
throughout this country as far as
 
01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:05.149 align:start position:0%
throughout this country as far as
movement

01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:05.159 align:start position:0%
movement
 
01:36:07.610 --> 01:36:07.620 align:start position:0%
and we have some students that come in
 
01:36:10.370 --> 01:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
during the middle of the senior year
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
and I know you're talking about a
 
01:36:14.209 --> 01:36:14.219 align:start position:0%
one-hour course but if the student says
 
01:36:17.870 --> 01:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
I've taken U.S history and we talked
 
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
about that and it was an accredited U.S
 
01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:22.860 align:start position:0%
history course through the New England
 
01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
Association of schools and colleges
 
01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
would that suffice for your one hour of
 
01:36:31.129 --> 01:36:31.139 align:start position:0%
uh required instruction if they've had
 
01:36:33.410 --> 01:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
or if they've had a course specifically
 
01:36:35.050 --> 01:36:35.060 align:start position:0%
in world history
 
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
where that they could show that yes it
 
01:36:39.649 --> 01:36:39.659 align:start position:0%
did touch upon this particular subject
 
01:36:41.450 --> 01:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
area thank you for the question Mr
 
01:36:45.050 --> 01:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
Sheriff uh to answer that uh the point
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
of this one hour it's not a course and
 
01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
you mentioned you said the word course
 
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
it's not a corset so one hour period of
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
information on on this uh it's like the
 
01:36:56.750 --> 01:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh the Civics measure which we passed
 
01:36:58.430 --> 01:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
which is now long
 
01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
um where and now that you have the bill
 
01:37:03.229 --> 01:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
you obviously can do whatever you you do
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
with it but in the Civics management we
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
specifically mentioned that uh special
 
01:37:08.930 --> 01:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
needs students you know special
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
Arrangements could be made for special
 
01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
need students
 
01:37:14.570 --> 01:37:14.580 align:start position:0%
if there's a one hour video it's if this
 
01:37:15.950 --> 01:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
move forward I'm sure somebody would
 
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
create one that could be shown if the
 
01:37:20.330 --> 01:37:20.340 align:start position:0%
district's ordered so that one hour
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
video could be shown uh to such a
 
01:37:25.490 --> 01:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
transfer or anywhere very easily in my
 
01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:26.570 align:start position:0%
transfer or anywhere very easily in my
view

01:37:26.570 --> 01:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
view
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
I I and just to follow up though when I
 
01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
talk about course of course you talk
 
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
about course in the bill here because it
 
01:37:34.750 --> 01:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
may be embedded in a course right right
 
01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
and so if a student can say this was
 
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
embedded in the course that I had where
 
01:37:43.850 --> 01:37:43.860 align:start position:0%
I got credit for graduation based upon
 
01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
the military compact which we have
 
01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
signed uh with the other 49 states on
 
01:37:50.689 --> 01:37:50.699 align:start position:0%
top of ours
 
01:37:54.169 --> 01:37:54.179 align:start position:0%
um so would that then suffice
 
01:37:57.290 --> 01:37:57.300 align:start position:0%
as meeting this particular end sure
 
01:37:58.729 --> 01:37:58.739 align:start position:0%
thank you it's a good question and the
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
answer right is it lines with guidance
 
01:38:02.330 --> 01:38:02.340 align:start position:0%
departments you know I've been in high
 
01:38:04.250 --> 01:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
schools and colleges so when transfer
 
01:38:06.649 --> 01:38:06.659 align:start position:0%
occurs the receiving institution whether
 
01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
it's a college or High School the the
 
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
registrar or the guidance office
 
01:38:13.850 --> 01:38:13.860 align:start position:0%
evaluates the TR the course of being
 
01:38:16.189 --> 01:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
transferred and locally they would make
 
01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
that decision as to if if they think it
 
01:38:20.689 --> 01:38:20.699 align:start position:0%
did satisfy the one hour requirement
 
01:38:22.729 --> 01:38:22.739 align:start position:0%
then good to go if they think it didn't
 
01:38:25.010 --> 01:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
then they would need to have the student
 
01:38:27.890 --> 01:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
uh watch the one hour video or or be in
 
01:38:29.810 --> 01:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
the session
 
01:38:31.729 --> 01:38:31.739 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
01:38:33.709 --> 01:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
representative Allison
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:38:38.810 --> 01:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
taking my question two quick ones one uh
 
01:38:41.689 --> 01:38:41.699 align:start position:0%
were any social studies teachers uh
 
01:38:43.610 --> 01:38:43.620 align:start position:0%
interviewed talked to about this
 
01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
particular Bill did you have contact
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
with any of them before you put this
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
together oh sure I'm in touch again that
 
01:38:53.149 --> 01:38:53.159 align:start position:0%
was my my area and I'm in touch uh
 
01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:55.679 align:start position:0%
routinely all the time with former
 
01:38:58.490 --> 01:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
current social studies teachers and yeah
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
I none of them are are testifying today
 
01:39:04.729 --> 01:39:04.739 align:start position:0%
but to your question yeah absolutely
 
01:39:09.290 --> 01:39:09.300 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so one more follow-up uh and
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
just looking at the uh number of topics
 
01:39:14.930 --> 01:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
that you listed in your testimony or
 
01:39:17.090 --> 01:39:17.100 align:start position:0%
Gulag rosenberg's vote people Killing
 
01:39:20.209 --> 01:39:20.219 align:start position:0%
Fields iron Curtin and a whole host of
 
01:39:21.250 --> 01:39:21.260 align:start position:0%
other things
 
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
are you pretty clear that all of that
 
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
will be covered in a one-hour course
 
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's over one hour period of
 
01:39:32.229 --> 01:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
time sometime during a high school
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
experience or frankly it could be done
 
01:39:36.350 --> 01:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
at Junior High it could be done in
 
01:39:38.270 --> 01:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
kindergarten I guess according to the
 
01:39:41.209 --> 01:39:41.219 align:start position:0%
bill sure that's a great question and my
 
01:39:44.330 --> 01:39:44.340 align:start position:0%
answer is uh yes there's a lot there and
 
01:39:46.209 --> 01:39:46.219 align:start position:0%
to put into an hour
 
01:39:48.410 --> 01:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
again this should be implemented locally
 
01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
if it moves forward and what I see
 
01:39:52.250 --> 01:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
happening is perhaps a handout would
 
01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
like uh a couple dozen terms that we
 
01:39:57.709 --> 01:39:57.719 align:start position:0%
just mentioned things to know a few
 
01:40:00.530 --> 01:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
dates a few names and and uh you know
 
01:40:02.570 --> 01:40:02.580 align:start position:0%
these are things that on on your own
 
01:40:06.290 --> 01:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
students that you might want to uh the
 
01:40:08.450 --> 01:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
research investigate read about on your
 
01:40:09.890 --> 01:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
own and that would be part of the one
 
01:40:12.050 --> 01:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
hour and then you know I'm sure some
 
01:40:14.330 --> 01:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
students would be suddenly if they
 
01:40:17.330 --> 01:40:17.340 align:start position:0%
realize uh the importance of this on
 
01:40:19.310 --> 01:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
their own I might I would hope they
 
01:40:21.530 --> 01:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
would go beyond that hour and and find
 
01:40:23.149 --> 01:40:23.159 align:start position:0%
out and learn more
 
01:40:25.750 --> 01:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
01:40:29.090 --> 01:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
okay we I'll take two more uh
 
01:40:31.310 --> 01:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock and then
 
01:40:33.050 --> 01:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner but we're gonna have to
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
get out we have other people who want to
 
01:40:37.250 --> 01:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
testify in this bill as well so so let's
 
01:40:39.709 --> 01:40:39.719 align:start position:0%
uh go rep some woodcock
 
01:40:41.149 --> 01:40:41.159 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
01:40:42.890 --> 01:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner
 
01:40:44.570 --> 01:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:40:47.390 --> 01:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock uh and thank you
 
01:40:49.490 --> 01:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett for taking my
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
question my questions about local
 
01:40:54.649 --> 01:40:54.659 align:start position:0%
control and uh you briefly mentioned it
 
01:40:56.870 --> 01:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
as you were sure you were going to hear
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
it so I didn't want you to be
 
01:40:58.080 --> 01:40:59.209 align:start position:0%
it so I didn't want you to be
disappointed

01:40:59.209 --> 01:40:59.219 align:start position:0%
disappointed
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
but it is my understanding that
 
01:41:05.149 --> 01:41:05.159 align:start position:0%
curriculum is really the purview of the
 
01:41:09.169 --> 01:41:09.179 align:start position:0%
local school district and as I say all
 
01:41:10.970 --> 01:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
the time the school district that I was
 
01:41:13.370 --> 01:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
from has a robust
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
American history course American
 
01:41:18.050 --> 01:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
government course
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
um courses that combined English and
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
social studies together to study
 
01:41:24.410 --> 01:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
different areas and
 
01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:25.310 align:start position:0%
different areas and
um

01:41:25.310 --> 01:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
the different leas have curriculum
 
01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:29.159 align:start position:0%
committees as well
 
01:41:31.930 --> 01:41:31.940 align:start position:0%
so I think if someone was really
 
01:41:35.450 --> 01:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
in a local area very concerned about
 
01:41:38.990 --> 01:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
this particular subject I would ask that
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
they contact their local school district
 
01:41:43.250 --> 01:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
because that's where curriculum's made
 
01:41:46.729 --> 01:41:46.739 align:start position:0%
and also isn't this an unfunded mandate
 
01:41:49.550 --> 01:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
that so my two questions is isn't it the
 
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
purview of the local school district to
 
01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
set curriculum and isn't it an unfunded
 
01:41:56.750 --> 01:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
mandate because once you put in an hour
 
01:41:58.550 --> 01:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
of this you've got to take an hour of
 
01:42:00.530 --> 01:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
something else out or if you add it as
 
01:42:03.290 --> 01:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
an extra hour that's you know time is
 
01:42:05.450 --> 01:42:05.460 align:start position:0%
money sure thanks for your question real
 
01:42:07.689 --> 01:42:07.699 align:start position:0%
quick um yeah I'm big on local control
 
01:42:12.590 --> 01:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
however there we uh routinely look at
 
01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
the rsa's how many rsas are you know the
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
this committee the state of New
 
01:42:18.239 --> 01:42:19.209 align:start position:0%
this committee the state of New
Hampshire

01:42:19.209 --> 01:42:19.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:42:23.570 --> 01:42:23.580 align:start position:0%
routinely provide input and guidance and
 
01:42:26.270 --> 01:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
direction to the districts on what's an
 
01:42:28.010 --> 01:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
educated student what needs to be part
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
of curriculum
 
01:42:33.229 --> 01:42:33.239 align:start position:0%
um so I there's plenty of precedent for
 
01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
the State uh taking some interest and
 
01:42:37.729 --> 01:42:37.739 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons why this is
 
01:42:41.450 --> 01:42:41.460 align:start position:0%
such a I don't see a one-hour uh period
 
01:42:44.330 --> 01:42:44.340 align:start position:0%
of discussion or video being a an
 
01:42:46.250 --> 01:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandated at all I don't think
 
01:42:48.109 --> 01:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
yeah I would take some time but I don't
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
think we need to hire anybody or spend
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
huge amounts of money to implement this
 
01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
is why we kept it to a to an hour just
 
01:42:57.530 --> 01:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
to uh get this on the radar screens and
 
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
and yes I know every District had
 
01:43:03.649 --> 01:43:03.659 align:start position:0%
somewhere than others have some courses
 
01:43:06.649 --> 01:43:06.659 align:start position:0%
in social sciences but the reason that
 
01:43:09.050 --> 01:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
this has come forth is because many of
 
01:43:12.709 --> 01:43:12.719 align:start position:0%
us believe or know uh I mean if we could
 
01:43:14.810 --> 01:43:14.820 align:start position:0%
quiz people I won't do it in here if we
 
01:43:16.129 --> 01:43:16.139 align:start position:0%
could Chris people and just some of the
 
01:43:19.129 --> 01:43:19.139 align:start position:0%
basic things I said earlier I I believe
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
is that most my sense
 
01:43:24.350 --> 01:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh anecdotally in and from surveys that
 
01:43:27.169 --> 01:43:27.179 align:start position:0%
are done uh young people do not know
 
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
things that I and many of us think they
 
01:43:31.129 --> 01:43:31.139 align:start position:0%
crucially need to know anyway that's a
 
01:43:32.689 --> 01:43:32.699 align:start position:0%
lot sorry mysterious long answer but
 
01:43:33.410 --> 01:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:43:35.470 --> 01:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and uh brother Martha
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
good to see you again I think
 
01:43:44.450 --> 01:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
um but I I I I say that uh in Australia
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's like I agree with representative
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
Tanner from the from the get-go that
 
01:43:50.330 --> 01:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
this is a local curriculum option uh to
 
01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%
start with but the the lady Fair
 
01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
approach to one hour of instruction
 
01:43:56.629 --> 01:43:56.639 align:start position:0%
somewhere sometime during it and with
 
01:43:57.950 --> 01:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
nothing with accountability there's no
 
01:43:59.629 --> 01:43:59.639 align:start position:0%
way to track that there's no way to say
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
you did it and honestly I mean any world
 
01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
anywhere else of course any world
 
01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
history course uh Congress any current
 
01:44:09.229 --> 01:44:09.239 align:start position:0%
study that of the Ukrainian conflict
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
right now this is going to be there when
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
you say
 
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
um things it was just a short time ago a
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
short time ago but a short time ago for
 
01:44:18.590 --> 01:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
you and perhaps representative Ladd and
 
01:44:20.570 --> 01:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
myself but in reality that was five
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
decades ago
 
01:44:24.410 --> 01:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
but not a short time ago now for maybe
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
someone like representative McDonald
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
maybe was uh moonlights ago right uh
 
01:44:31.370 --> 01:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
anyhow my point is that this doesn't
 
01:44:33.470 --> 01:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
have any accountability in it and that
 
01:44:36.530 --> 01:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
if I was uh as I was Associated person
 
01:44:38.629 --> 01:44:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh at that time I would say to my
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
principal I'm already covering communism
 
01:44:42.590 --> 01:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
I can't do any of this in an hour
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
zero you can't do Killing Fields you
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
can't do you can't do any of that in an
 
01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
hour it's sort of like a broad brush of
 
01:44:50.330 --> 01:44:50.340 align:start position:0%
nothing it's just a waste of my time and
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to tell you Mr principle
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
yes we already cover it I was like I
 
01:44:57.709 --> 01:44:57.719 align:start position:0%
just don't see the the value uh honestly
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh one trying to tell local school boys
 
01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
to do things uh like this as we
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
shouldn't in my mind but beyond that we
 
01:45:04.970 --> 01:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
have no accountability for it in the way
 
01:45:06.649 --> 01:45:06.659 align:start position:0%
the bill is structured so I'm just
 
01:45:07.609 --> 01:45:07.619 align:start position:0%
trying how are you going to get
 
01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
accountability that happens
 
01:45:10.970 --> 01:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
that's the question I was going to try
 
01:45:13.370 --> 01:45:13.380 align:start position:0%
again I was waiting for this thank you
 
01:45:15.770 --> 01:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
we got there you got there sure thank
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
you for that representative uh in terms
 
01:45:19.729 --> 01:45:19.739 align:start position:0%
of accountability again this is not an
 
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
assessment that the intent of this is to
 
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
get this broad issue on the radar
 
01:45:28.370 --> 01:45:28.380 align:start position:0%
screens of folks that we don't think
 
01:45:30.890 --> 01:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
it's on their radar screens now
 
01:45:32.810 --> 01:45:32.820 align:start position:0%
um and so just the fact that we're
 
01:45:34.609 --> 01:45:34.619 align:start position:0%
having a hearing and we're having this
 
01:45:37.490 --> 01:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
discussion and and people and and hello
 
01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
to everybody who's out watching on
 
01:45:41.209 --> 01:45:41.219 align:start position:0%
YouTube and who we'll watch on YouTube
 
01:45:41.219 --> 01:45:42.590 align:start position:0%
YouTube and who we'll watch on YouTube
later

01:45:42.590 --> 01:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
later
 
01:45:44.689 --> 01:45:44.699 align:start position:0%
um thanks for watching uh all these
 
01:45:46.250 --> 01:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
people in committee and watching later
 
01:45:49.129 --> 01:45:49.139 align:start position:0%
watching now are gonna are thinking and
 
01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
they're saying uh what glass notes I
 
01:45:53.629 --> 01:45:53.639 align:start position:0%
remember that and and your in your point
 
01:45:55.669 --> 01:45:55.679 align:start position:0%
about it being five decades ago it's
 
01:45:58.189 --> 01:45:58.199 align:start position:0%
it's very relative I know but in the
 
01:46:00.649 --> 01:46:00.659 align:start position:0%
broad sweep of History five decades is a
 
01:46:00.659 --> 01:46:01.790 align:start position:0%
broad sweep of History five decades is a
heartbeat

01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
heartbeat
 
01:46:04.129 --> 01:46:04.139 align:start position:0%
um and but I'm very aware that that's uh
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
ancient history for for some of the yet
 
01:46:09.050 --> 01:46:09.060 align:start position:0%
younger folks here hopefully that
 
01:46:11.209 --> 01:46:11.219 align:start position:0%
responds somewhat to your your good
 
01:46:11.219 --> 01:46:12.290 align:start position:0%
responds somewhat to your your good
point

01:46:12.290 --> 01:46:12.300 align:start position:0%

01:47:07.609 --> 01:47:07.619 align:start position:0%
testimony that I'm about to offer on
 
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
this one contemplated for any curriculum
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
topic really that comes before this
 
01:47:15.770 --> 01:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
committee this session
 
01:47:15.780 --> 01:47:16.330 align:start position:0%
committee this session
um

01:47:16.330 --> 01:47:16.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:19.570 --> 01:47:19.580 align:start position:0%
with regards to 102 local
 
01:47:23.090 --> 01:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
communism as well as other curriculum
 
01:47:26.090 --> 01:47:26.100 align:start position:0%
bills cursive writing multiplication
 
01:47:29.050 --> 01:47:29.060 align:start position:0%
tables teaching New Hampshire government
 
01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
are all local decisions
 
01:47:34.970 --> 01:47:34.980 align:start position:0%
there are without exception training
 
01:47:38.090 --> 01:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
Staffing and fiscal implications for any
 
01:47:39.970 --> 01:47:39.980 align:start position:0%
and all of these well-intended
 
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
curriculum bills and those costs are
 
01:47:45.169 --> 01:47:45.179 align:start position:0%
borne by local taxpayers
 
01:47:47.930 --> 01:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
many of these bills are duplicative of
 
01:47:49.850 --> 01:47:49.860 align:start position:0%
what already happens in local schools
 
01:47:52.669 --> 01:47:52.679 align:start position:0%
I've worked in seven different districts
 
01:47:56.270 --> 01:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
throughout my 48-year career and can say
 
01:47:59.090 --> 01:47:59.100 align:start position:0%
without question that each of these
 
01:48:01.970 --> 01:48:01.980 align:start position:0%
topics of curriculum are taught in those
 
01:48:05.450 --> 01:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
districts including conversations of
 
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%

01:48:16.970 --> 01:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
taught at local school districts levels
 
01:48:19.370 --> 01:48:19.380 align:start position:0%
and if there is if you have some element
 
01:48:22.669 --> 01:48:22.679 align:start position:0%
of doubt in that I would invite each and
 
01:48:25.370 --> 01:48:25.380 align:start position:0%
every one of you to to visit your local
 
01:48:27.050 --> 01:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
school district officials and have a
 
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
conversation about what is taught in any
 
01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
of these areas that any citizen is
 
01:48:34.430 --> 01:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
certainly welcome to do that there are
 
01:48:36.350 --> 01:48:36.360 align:start position:0%
curriculum nights in districts there are
 
01:48:38.990 --> 01:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
presentations by students there are open
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
houses there are parent conferences
 
01:48:43.129 --> 01:48:43.139 align:start position:0%
there are curriculum materials available
 
01:48:45.709 --> 01:48:45.719 align:start position:0%
I would encourage every one of you and
 
01:48:48.050 --> 01:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
every legislator quite honestly to
 
01:48:49.609 --> 01:48:49.619 align:start position:0%
become familiar with What's Done in
 
01:48:51.290 --> 01:48:51.300 align:start position:0%
their local school districts before they
 
01:48:54.290 --> 01:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
take action on any of these bills that
 
01:48:57.470 --> 01:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
potentially are duplicative and uh
 
01:49:00.109 --> 01:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
really something that that's already
 
01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
happening in schools
 
01:49:06.709 --> 01:49:06.719 align:start position:0%
I'd like to submit that the state
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
requirements themselves which are
 
01:49:10.850 --> 01:49:10.860 align:start position:0%
currently under view as suggested by
 
01:49:13.250 --> 01:49:13.260 align:start position:0%
representative Tana in the 306 and I
 
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
believe representative luno in the 306
 
01:49:19.209 --> 01:49:19.219 align:start position:0%
review that is a vehicle for
 
01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
requirements in communism or cursive
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
writing or multiplication tables or
 
01:49:25.729 --> 01:49:25.739 align:start position:0%
whatever curriculum requirements that is
 
01:49:28.729 --> 01:49:28.739 align:start position:0%
a vehicle to include those things those
 
01:49:32.330 --> 01:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
topics in rules that school districts
 
01:49:34.850 --> 01:49:34.860 align:start position:0%
have to follow currently every High
 
01:49:37.550 --> 01:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
School in the state is required to offer
 
01:49:40.570 --> 01:49:40.580 align:start position:0%
one unit in uni in United States history
 
01:49:44.090 --> 01:49:44.100 align:start position:0%
and uh new in the United States and New
 
01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire history
 
01:49:48.350 --> 01:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
a half unit of United States and New
 
01:49:49.729 --> 01:49:49.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire government
 
01:49:52.490 --> 01:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
half unit in economics personal finance
 
01:49:55.669 --> 01:49:55.679 align:start position:0%
a half unit in world history Global
 
01:49:58.490 --> 01:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
Studies or geography in order for a
 
01:50:00.109 --> 01:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
student to graduate from any High School
 
01:50:02.330 --> 01:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
in the state at least those social
 
01:50:04.729 --> 01:50:04.739 align:start position:0%
studies and that's the minimum
 
01:50:08.629 --> 01:50:08.639 align:start position:0%
most school districts require more than
 
01:50:11.090 --> 01:50:11.100 align:start position:0%
the minimum graduation requirements and
 
01:50:12.890 --> 01:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
that's just in the area of social
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
studies so I would encourage you to
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
explore what your local districts
 
01:50:20.270 --> 01:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
require as minimum because I would
 
01:50:24.229 --> 01:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
submit that these topics are covered and
 
01:50:24.239 --> 01:50:24.910 align:start position:0%
submit that these topics are covered and
um

01:50:24.910 --> 01:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:27.530 --> 01:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
in what is already done
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the sponsor's interest in
 
01:50:33.410 --> 01:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive and high quality public
 
01:50:33.420 --> 01:50:34.910 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive and high quality public
education

01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:50:38.930 --> 01:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
and respect that again they work through
 
01:50:42.169 --> 01:50:42.179 align:start position:0%
the rules process and their local school
 
01:50:44.689 --> 01:50:44.699 align:start position:0%
district officials to ensure that these
 
01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
types of topics are included in their
 
01:50:50.330 --> 01:50:50.340 align:start position:0%
local educational program
 
01:50:52.850 --> 01:50:52.860 align:start position:0%
we ask that this committee treat all
 
01:50:56.330 --> 01:50:56.340 align:start position:0%
curriculum decisions as locally driven
 
01:50:59.149 --> 01:50:59.159 align:start position:0%
decisions and that you find any bills
 
01:51:02.270 --> 01:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
that we would require a state law to
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
implement these topics be considered in
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate
 
01:51:11.629 --> 01:51:11.639 align:start position:0%
and I would say thank you and invite any
 
01:51:12.649 --> 01:51:12.659 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
01:51:14.330 --> 01:51:14.340 align:start position:0%
representative luck you're willing to
 
01:51:16.370 --> 01:51:16.380 align:start position:0%
take any questions I am willing to take
 
01:51:18.770 --> 01:51:18.780 align:start position:0%
questions thank you represent Lucas
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering my question
 
01:51:28.250 --> 01:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
um my understanding and and what you're
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
saying seems to go against what my
 
01:51:33.050 --> 01:51:33.060 align:start position:0%
understanding is is that
 
01:51:36.590 --> 01:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
this number one is not a local control
 
01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:38.570 align:start position:0%
this number one is not a local control
state

01:51:38.570 --> 01:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:51:43.370 --> 01:51:43.380 align:start position:0%
but Dylan's rule state that the towns
 
01:51:45.890 --> 01:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
Etc are given
 
01:51:49.370 --> 01:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
I told may you know whatever and that
 
01:51:52.370 --> 01:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
part of the education committee's job is
 
01:51:55.550 --> 01:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
to and also that rules aren't just made
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
up by
 
01:52:00.350 --> 01:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
um departments but they come from the
 
01:52:03.410 --> 01:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
legislative branch and that part of our
 
01:52:07.250 --> 01:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
job is to say okay these things will be
 
01:52:11.390 --> 01:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
taught and then within rules the doe
 
01:52:14.510 --> 01:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
comes up with what the rules are and
 
01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
then the local control do you have a
 
01:52:19.370 --> 01:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
question to do it well I'm get there
 
01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:21.770 align:start position:0%
question to do it well I'm get there
quickly

01:52:21.770 --> 01:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:24.590 --> 01:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
but what you said was opposite of what I
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
understand and so I'm hoping you can
 
01:52:32.330 --> 01:52:32.340 align:start position:0%
correct me or explain how curriculum now
 
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
is solely the responsibility of the
 
01:52:37.970 --> 01:52:37.980 align:start position:0%
towns and the doe rules come from where
 
01:52:40.430 --> 01:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
do they come from and how does the towns
 
01:52:42.830 --> 01:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
decide what needs to be in the
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
curriculum Etc I I thought that was our
 
01:52:47.689 --> 01:52:47.699 align:start position:0%
job and you've said it's not and I'm
 
01:52:49.609 --> 01:52:49.619 align:start position:0%
wanting you to enlighten me thank you
 
01:52:51.169 --> 01:52:51.179 align:start position:0%
for the question representative like us
 
01:52:52.729 --> 01:52:52.739 align:start position:0%
and I will try to be brief in my
 
01:52:52.739 --> 01:52:53.750 align:start position:0%
and I will try to be brief in my
response

01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
response
 
01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:54.890 align:start position:0%
response
um

01:52:54.890 --> 01:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
local curriculum decisions there are
 
01:52:59.410 --> 01:52:59.420 align:start position:0%
local curriculum committees there are
 
01:53:02.209 --> 01:53:02.219 align:start position:0%
folks in each district who work on
 
01:53:04.189 --> 01:53:04.199 align:start position:0%
curriculum and what the content of
 
01:53:07.090 --> 01:53:07.100 align:start position:0%
different areas are going to be
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
the state tells us what we have to what
 
01:53:13.609 --> 01:53:13.619 align:start position:0%
topics we have to teach what courses if
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
you will and then within that and there
 
01:53:17.930 --> 01:53:17.940 align:start position:0%
are elective courses that are developed
 
01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
within each school system and then
 
01:53:22.189 --> 01:53:22.199 align:start position:0%
within that it's up to the local folks
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
to determine how that curriculum is
 
01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
going to be delivered that's that was my
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
understanding thank you thank you are
 
01:53:31.129 --> 01:53:31.139 align:start position:0%

from the New Hampshire school boards
 
01:53:41.639 --> 01:53:46.250 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire school boards
Association

relations for the New Hampshire school
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
boards Association I would agree with
 
01:53:59.570 --> 01:53:59.580 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock that this is
 
01:54:01.189 --> 01:54:01.199 align:start position:0%
right in the way of seeing everybody's
 
01:54:04.490 --> 01:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
face so I will do my best
 
01:54:06.350 --> 01:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
um we would like to thank the sponsors
 
01:54:08.209 --> 01:54:08.219 align:start position:0%
of this bill for bringing forward topics
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
that they feel are of significant
 
01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:11.209 align:start position:0%
that they feel are of significant
importance

01:54:11.209 --> 01:54:11.219 align:start position:0%
importance
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
um however regardless of the
 
01:54:15.410 --> 01:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
instructional content or concepts
 
01:54:16.970 --> 01:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
proposed in these curriculum related
 
01:54:19.250 --> 01:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
bills the ability for local school
 
01:54:20.689 --> 01:54:20.699 align:start position:0%
boards to determine their local
 
01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
curriculum is at the heart of nhsba's
 
01:54:26.090 --> 01:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
opposition to these curriculum related
 
01:54:29.990 --> 01:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
bills this bill adding specific and
 
01:54:32.990 --> 01:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
detailed somewhat curriculum imposed on
 
01:54:35.930 --> 01:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
all school districts goes against our
 
01:54:38.330 --> 01:54:38.340 align:start position:0%
resolutions that support again the local
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
control and the local ability for school
 
01:54:42.649 --> 01:54:42.659 align:start position:0%
boards to determine their local
 
01:54:45.050 --> 01:54:45.060 align:start position:0%
curriculum that meets the needs of their
 
01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
own Community with their community input
 
01:54:50.649 --> 01:54:50.659 align:start position:0%
we would go back again to the fact that
 
01:54:52.970 --> 01:54:52.980 align:start position:0%
school boards oversee An approved
 
01:54:55.729 --> 01:54:55.739 align:start position:0%
curriculum within their communities and
 
01:54:57.129 --> 01:54:57.139 align:start position:0%
it does not
 
01:55:00.649 --> 01:55:00.659 align:start position:0%
necessarily work for every school
 
01:55:03.470 --> 01:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
district to implement the same exact one
 
01:55:06.109 --> 01:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
hour whatever that would be the school
 
01:55:08.570 --> 01:55:08.580 align:start position:0%
board is required to ensure that their
 
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
programs cover as Mr fruit said certain
 
01:55:13.370 --> 01:55:13.380 align:start position:0%
graduation requirements that are put
 
01:55:15.169 --> 01:55:15.179 align:start position:0%
forth by the state but it is also up to
 
01:55:16.910 --> 01:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
the local school board to determine
 
01:55:20.209 --> 01:55:20.219 align:start position:0%
their own local diploma requirements as
 
01:55:22.669 --> 01:55:22.679 align:start position:0%
Mr fruit said if you went to any of your
 
01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
local school boards or your school
 
01:55:26.570 --> 01:55:26.580 align:start position:0%
districts and looked at the requirements
 
01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
for graduation there are oftentimes a
 
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
state approved graduation diploma which
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
will have certain requirements there are
 
01:55:37.370 --> 01:55:37.380 align:start position:0%
also Local District requirements for
 
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
other diplomas there are also New
 
01:55:41.450 --> 01:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Scholars diploma requirements
 
01:55:43.750 --> 01:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
all of those are different at different
 
01:55:46.070 --> 01:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
districts and that is because we believe
 
01:55:47.629 --> 01:55:47.639 align:start position:0%
strongly that the school board should be
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
making those decisions with their local
 
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
Administration on the curriculum that is
 
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
taught in those districts
 
01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
in addition we are as many of you are
 
01:56:00.290 --> 01:56:00.300 align:start position:0%
aware undergoing a pretty significant
 
01:56:02.810 --> 01:56:02.820 align:start position:0%
revision of the minimum standards for
 
01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
public school approval the 306s if these
 
01:56:08.830 --> 01:56:08.840 align:start position:0%
curriculum aspects are very important to
 
01:56:11.330 --> 01:56:11.340 align:start position:0%
the legislature it would be important
 
01:56:13.070 --> 01:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
for those things to be taken up as part
 
01:56:15.550 --> 01:56:15.560 align:start position:0%
of that process as opposed to
 
01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
individually looked at in terms of
 
01:56:19.790 --> 01:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
skills and content throughout this
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
upcoming session that is going to drive
 
01:56:25.010 --> 01:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
again to representative Lucas's point
 
01:56:27.470 --> 01:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
the specifics that are given to
 
01:56:29.229 --> 01:56:29.239 align:start position:0%
districts in terms of
 
01:56:33.169 --> 01:56:33.179 align:start position:0%
very intentional skills and content that
 
01:56:34.669 --> 01:56:34.679 align:start position:0%
need to be covered and how those things
 
01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
are covered and what curriculum what
 
01:56:39.470 --> 01:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
courses Etc to still be determined at
 
01:56:42.830 --> 01:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
the local level and then to speak to a
 
01:56:44.209 --> 01:56:44.219 align:start position:0%
point that was brought up earlier about
 
01:56:46.729 --> 01:56:46.739 align:start position:0%
the social studies standards again those
 
01:56:51.050 --> 01:56:51.060 align:start position:0%
have been to some extent revised several
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
years ago and I believe are sort of
 
01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
stalled out at this point at the
 
01:56:56.450 --> 01:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
department I'm not sure with the status
 
01:56:58.609 --> 01:56:58.619 align:start position:0%
is of updating the social studies
 
01:57:01.310 --> 01:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
standards from a state perspective but
 
01:57:02.750 --> 01:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
that again is a place where this
 
01:57:04.729 --> 01:57:04.739 align:start position:0%
particular content area could be
 
01:57:06.830 --> 01:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
discussed on a much broader level with
 
01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
input from larger communities teachers
 
01:57:13.129 --> 01:57:13.139 align:start position:0%
students parents Etc so that's at the
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
heart of our opposition to these bills
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
it is not specific to the content but to
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
the decision-making ability of the local
 
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
school board to make those decisions and
 
01:57:22.250 --> 01:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions thank
 
01:57:25.129 --> 01:57:25.139 align:start position:0%
you very much Becky uh just as a a
 
01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
information for the whole committee here
 
01:57:29.330 --> 01:57:29.340 align:start position:0%
yesterday the legislative oversight
 
01:57:31.490 --> 01:57:31.500 align:start position:0%

01:57:33.229 --> 01:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
was it yesterday yeah it was yesterday
 
01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
everything passed together and we looked
 
01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
at the minimum standards Public School
 
01:57:41.089 --> 01:57:41.099 align:start position:0%
approval and the academic standards
 
01:57:44.689 --> 01:57:44.699 align:start position:0%
which are two different beasts and the
 
01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee is
 
01:57:48.350 --> 01:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
concerned that we look further into
 
01:57:51.530 --> 01:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
social studies and the Improvement in
 
01:57:54.649 --> 01:57:54.659 align:start position:0%
assessment materials used for that so
 
01:57:56.450 --> 01:57:56.460 align:start position:0%
that is a topic there was a task force
 
01:58:00.410 --> 01:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
At Doe that is now defunct it's gone
 
01:58:02.450 --> 01:58:02.460 align:start position:0%
um the last time this stuff was reviewed
 
01:58:06.890 --> 01:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
or updated was back over 12 14 years ago
 
01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:08.510 align:start position:0%
or updated was back over 12 14 years ago
so

01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:10.490 --> 01:58:10.500 align:start position:0%

grew up in South American Peru uh as you
 
01:58:47.390 --> 01:58:47.400 align:start position:0%

as a parent of two children in the
 
01:59:11.990 --> 01:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
public education system in New Hampshire
 
01:59:14.870 --> 01:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh communism is something the absolute
 
01:59:18.050 --> 01:59:18.060 align:start position:0%

01:59:19.910 --> 01:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
is not killing us right now you know
 
01:59:21.229 --> 01:59:21.239 align:start position:0%

employed in but within the same SAU and
 
02:02:28.609 --> 02:02:28.619 align:start position:0%
he would have to or anyone who in this
 
02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
like position would have to recuse
 
02:02:31.550 --> 02:02:31.560 align:start position:0%
themselves for anything to do with the
 
02:02:34.609 --> 02:02:34.619 align:start position:0%
superintendent's terms of employment
 
02:02:37.669 --> 02:02:37.679 align:start position:0%
um having said that I am going to let
 
02:02:40.189 --> 02:02:40.199 align:start position:0%
him make his case to you and I really
 
02:02:42.290 --> 02:02:42.300 align:start position:0%
appreciate you taking the time to take a
 
02:02:44.209 --> 02:02:44.219 align:start position:0%
look at it thank you thank you very much
 
02:02:48.370 --> 02:02:48.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:50.270 --> 02:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:53.290 --> 02:02:53.300 align:start position:0%
I know nothing huh okay
 
02:02:55.850 --> 02:02:55.860 align:start position:0%
so do we have the card from your
 
02:02:57.770 --> 02:02:57.780 align:start position:0%
constituent he just there are a couple
 
02:03:01.729 --> 02:03:01.739 align:start position:0%
coming up okay I've got two and for me
 
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
are we talking about Greg great
 
02:03:09.470 --> 02:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
Whitmore yes okay welcome to education
 
02:03:11.810 --> 02:03:11.820 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for having me
 
02:03:15.169 --> 02:03:15.179 align:start position:0%
uh so very briefly what got me here
 
02:03:16.910 --> 02:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
um as Miss Roy said I'm a teacher at a
 
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
public school and last year I ran for
 
02:03:22.010 --> 02:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
school board at my daughter's school a
 
02:03:24.109 --> 02:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
few weeks before the election I was
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
informed that I am ineligible uh because
 
02:03:29.450 --> 02:03:29.460 align:start position:0%
my school and her school are in the same
 
02:03:32.810 --> 02:03:32.820 align:start position:0%
the same SAU
 
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
um the town was not aware of this I mean
 
02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:36.719 align:start position:0%
really nobody was it came as a a
 
02:03:39.350 --> 02:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
complete shock to say the least
 
02:03:42.669 --> 02:03:42.679 align:start position:0%
um so really what it comes down to is
 
02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:45.060 align:start position:0%
the pool of individuals that's willing
 
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
to serve on a school board is already
 
02:03:51.410 --> 02:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
quite limited and the RSA is written uh
 
02:03:53.390 --> 02:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
really puts unnecessary restrictions on
 
02:03:55.010 --> 02:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
individuals whose background in
 
02:03:58.430 --> 02:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
education would be invaluable in the
 
02:04:00.530 --> 02:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
role of a school board member so if we
 
02:04:02.330 --> 02:04:02.340 align:start position:0%
were to look at my specific case the two
 
02:04:04.010 --> 02:04:04.020 align:start position:0%
schools have nothing to do with one
 
02:04:07.790 --> 02:04:07.800 align:start position:0%
another besides being in the same SAU we
 
02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
do share a superintendent but there is
 
02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
really nothing on a day-to-day basis
 
02:04:16.669 --> 02:04:16.679 align:start position:0%
whatsoever that really involves the two
 
02:04:17.810 --> 02:04:17.820 align:start position:0%
of them
 
02:04:20.330 --> 02:04:20.340 align:start position:0%
um so what I'm looking for what I what I
 
02:04:22.910 --> 02:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
think would be reasonable is to rewrite
 
02:04:26.450 --> 02:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
a portion of the of the RSA to State
 
02:04:28.490 --> 02:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
something along the lines of a person
 
02:04:31.129 --> 02:04:31.139 align:start position:0%
who is a salaried employee at a school
 
02:04:34.669 --> 02:04:34.679 align:start position:0%
within an SAU shall be able to serve on
 
02:04:36.589 --> 02:04:36.599 align:start position:0%
the school board of a school within the
 
02:04:38.990 --> 02:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
SAU with the exception of the school
 
02:04:41.689 --> 02:04:41.699 align:start position:0%
with which they are employed by
 
02:04:44.330 --> 02:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
and must recuse themselves from any
 
02:04:46.070 --> 02:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
school board matters pertaining to the
 
02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
hiring firing and disciplinary actions
 
02:04:50.770 --> 02:04:50.780 align:start position:0%
involving the superintendent because
 
02:04:53.149 --> 02:04:53.159 align:start position:0%
with you know I've spoken to a lot of
 
02:04:54.709 --> 02:04:54.719 align:start position:0%
Educators about this just to get their
 
02:04:56.629 --> 02:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
perspective and really the only issue
 
02:04:58.910 --> 02:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
that could come up is they say well you
 
02:05:00.229 --> 02:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
know the superintendent is technically
 
02:05:02.330 --> 02:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
your boss and you would be the boss of
 
02:05:03.770 --> 02:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
the superintendent if you were on the
 
02:05:05.450 --> 02:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
school board that's the yeah that
 
02:05:07.729 --> 02:05:07.739 align:start position:0%
certainly is the case but if you were to
 
02:05:10.189 --> 02:05:10.199 align:start position:0%
put in you know a stipulation where you
 
02:05:12.950 --> 02:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
know anytime a specific matter between
 
02:05:15.290 --> 02:05:15.300 align:start position:0%
myself and the superintendent came up or
 
02:05:17.030 --> 02:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
the school board such as you know hiring
 
02:05:19.970 --> 02:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
firing or disciplinary actions if I were
 
02:05:22.370 --> 02:05:22.380 align:start position:0%
to recuse myself from those actions then
 
02:05:25.189 --> 02:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
that really could be the only issue
 
02:05:25.199 --> 02:05:26.750 align:start position:0%
that really could be the only issue
so

02:05:26.750 --> 02:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:28.729 --> 02:05:28.739 align:start position:0%
um you know it's it's certainly not a
 
02:05:30.709 --> 02:05:30.719 align:start position:0%
unique situation I find myself in but it
 
02:05:32.149 --> 02:05:32.159 align:start position:0%
is a rare situation to say the least
 
02:05:33.709 --> 02:05:33.719 align:start position:0%
it's something that I'm sure would not
 
02:05:35.750 --> 02:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
come up very often but you know when you
 
02:05:38.209 --> 02:05:38.219 align:start position:0%
have someone that's willing and really
 
02:05:40.669 --> 02:05:40.679 align:start position:0%
wants to serve on a board
 
02:05:42.410 --> 02:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
um a limitation like this just seems
 
02:05:42.420 --> 02:05:45.169 align:start position:0%
um a limitation like this just seems
unnecessary

02:05:45.169 --> 02:05:45.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:47.030 --> 02:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Greg thank you uh
 
02:05:51.169 --> 02:05:51.179 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for for Greg
 
02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:54.719 align:start position:0%
yes representative Luna yeah um thank
 
02:05:57.229 --> 02:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
you um thank you very much Mr Whitmore
 
02:06:01.370 --> 02:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
for um uh for bringing this up
 
02:06:01.380 --> 02:06:03.649 align:start position:0%
for um uh for bringing this up
um

02:06:03.649 --> 02:06:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:05.330 --> 02:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
first of all I'm having a hard time
 
02:06:07.310 --> 02:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
understanding how the language being
 
02:06:09.649 --> 02:06:09.659 align:start position:0%
proposed here actually addresses what
 
02:06:12.770 --> 02:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
your um what your what what your um what
 
02:06:15.250 --> 02:06:15.260 align:start position:0%
you ran into but I'm also
 
02:06:17.629 --> 02:06:17.639 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
02:06:20.990 --> 02:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
about how the current statute would have
 
02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:22.490 align:start position:0%
about how the current statute would have
prevented

02:06:22.490 --> 02:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
prevented
 
02:06:23.870 --> 02:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
um well I could see it preventing you
 
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
from running for school board in the
 
02:06:29.629 --> 02:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
same SAU but not in a not in a different
 
02:06:32.209 --> 02:06:32.219 align:start position:0%
essay which is what you're you know I
 
02:06:35.089 --> 02:06:35.099 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm referring to if I wanted to
 
02:06:37.970 --> 02:06:37.980 align:start position:0%
serve on a board in the same SAU so
 
02:06:40.010 --> 02:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
they're different schools yeah
 
02:06:41.390 --> 02:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
um but I would like to serve on the
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
school board of a different School
 
02:06:45.370 --> 02:06:45.380 align:start position:0%
within the same SAU and the current
 
02:06:47.930 --> 02:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
statue clearly you know prohibits that
 
02:06:50.629 --> 02:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
okay and what I'm suggesting is having a
 
02:06:52.970 --> 02:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
stipulation allowing someone that would
 
02:06:54.890 --> 02:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
be in my situation to serve on the
 
02:06:56.689 --> 02:06:56.699 align:start position:0%
school board of a school that I don't
 
02:07:01.070 --> 02:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
work for but is in the same SAU and just
 
02:07:03.770 --> 02:07:03.780 align:start position:0%
with the stipulation that with you know
 
02:07:05.750 --> 02:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
anything that deals specifically with
 
02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:07.679 align:start position:0%
the only shared instance which is the
 
02:07:08.930 --> 02:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
superintendent it's the only thing we
 
02:07:10.010 --> 02:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
share right
 
02:07:11.450 --> 02:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
um that if matters come up that I would
 
02:07:13.910 --> 02:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
have to recuse myself so just a
 
02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up for Clarity on that so it
 
02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
would be not the essay you board but the
 
02:07:22.430 --> 02:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
the school board itself yeah for example
 
02:07:25.490 --> 02:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
a school within the essay yes
 
02:07:27.830 --> 02:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
for a clarification uh representative
 
02:07:30.050 --> 02:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
Roy did speak with me prior to this
 
02:07:32.510 --> 02:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
meeting early this morning saying he did
 
02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
have some amending language to try and
 
02:07:38.629 --> 02:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
clarify uh and and state this the way
 
02:07:40.970 --> 02:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
the intent okay because it's not coming
 
02:07:43.250 --> 02:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
yeah that's exactly there the reads are
 
02:07:45.290 --> 02:07:45.300 align:start position:0%
and that Amendment would be provided to
 
02:07:46.669 --> 02:07:46.679 align:start position:0%
somebody on this committee which we
 
02:07:48.770 --> 02:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
could introduce ourselves in the
 
02:07:50.870 --> 02:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
executive session to
 
02:07:54.290 --> 02:07:54.300 align:start position:0%
address that yes representative Roy
 
02:07:57.129 --> 02:07:57.139 align:start position:0%
the amendment was sent to representative
 
02:08:00.589 --> 02:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
he has it I've never met my position
 
02:08:02.810 --> 02:08:02.820 align:start position:0%
before they've been this over Facebook
 
02:08:05.930 --> 02:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
and the language is a result of that
 
02:08:05.940 --> 02:08:06.709 align:start position:0%
and the language is a result of that
match

02:08:06.709 --> 02:08:06.719 align:start position:0%
match
 
02:08:08.870 --> 02:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
um however we've clarified it and the
 
02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
amendment was sent and it does exactly
 
02:08:13.250 --> 02:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
what the constituents asked okay yeah
 
02:08:15.169 --> 02:08:15.179 align:start position:0%
okay good thank you representative
 
02:08:16.450 --> 02:08:16.460 align:start position:0%
represent Cornell you have a question
 
02:08:18.589 --> 02:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
question would you not be voting on
 
02:08:23.450 --> 02:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
teacher contracts so teacher contracts
 
02:08:25.070 --> 02:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
are negotiated just within the schools
 
02:08:27.830 --> 02:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
themselves so my you know my high school
 
02:08:29.270 --> 02:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
would have nothing to do with my
 
02:08:30.410 --> 02:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
daughter's school as far as teacher
 
02:08:34.310 --> 02:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
contracts so the follow-up so the SAU
 
02:08:37.850 --> 02:08:37.860 align:start position:0%
doesn't vote on all teacher contracts
 
02:08:37.860 --> 02:08:38.750 align:start position:0%
doesn't vote on all teacher contracts
um

02:08:38.750 --> 02:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:41.270 --> 02:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
so it would not be an SAU vote it would
 
02:08:44.030 --> 02:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
be an individual School Board vote
 
02:08:46.430 --> 02:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Woodcock
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr and this is probably
 
02:08:51.530 --> 02:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
more for president cordelli
 
02:08:53.570 --> 02:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
um in the the amendment which we don't
 
02:08:56.270 --> 02:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
see which we don't have uh I'm I'm
 
02:08:59.030 --> 02:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
concerned on this particular bill in
 
02:09:01.550 --> 02:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
lines fourth four and five where it
 
02:09:03.950 --> 02:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
deals with Municipal budget committees
 
02:09:06.830 --> 02:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
and and the affiliation with uh that and
 
02:09:09.050 --> 02:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering if that information
 
02:09:11.450 --> 02:09:11.460 align:start position:0%
if that line is taken off of the
 
02:09:14.270 --> 02:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
amendment because I know in many seus as
 
02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
in ours required the Schoolboy members
 
02:09:22.629 --> 02:09:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:25.970 --> 02:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you um yeah I had this discussion
 
02:09:29.149 --> 02:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
with representative Roy uh yesterday
 
02:09:31.010 --> 02:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
um he uh submitted
 
02:09:33.109 --> 02:09:33.119 align:start position:0%
um for drafting an amendment and I
 
02:09:34.490 --> 02:09:34.500 align:start position:0%
believe have sent it to me I haven't had
 
02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
a chance to read it yet however
 
02:09:39.830 --> 02:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
okay so Master chair then so what we
 
02:09:42.649 --> 02:09:42.659 align:start position:0%
want to do is that we recognize is going
 
02:09:46.129 --> 02:09:46.139 align:start position:0%
to this doesn't say what is the intent
 
02:09:47.689 --> 02:09:47.699 align:start position:0%
of you know and there may be some
 
02:09:49.850 --> 02:09:49.860 align:start position:0%
conflicts with other areas I think we
 
02:09:51.530 --> 02:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
got to address that during the executive
 
02:09:53.209 --> 02:09:53.219 align:start position:0%
session time I think everybody's
 
02:09:54.830 --> 02:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
agreeing there's it needs to be cleaned
 
02:09:56.689 --> 02:09:56.699 align:start position:0%
up okay so my only question of the show
 
02:09:59.450 --> 02:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
is that in the so knowing here except
 
02:10:01.490 --> 02:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
representative Roy couldn't answer that
 
02:10:03.470 --> 02:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
question is could you answer that
 
02:10:06.169 --> 02:10:06.179 align:start position:0%
question if you wrote the amendment
 
02:10:10.490 --> 02:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that portion is still in there
 
02:10:13.010 --> 02:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
representative but it doesn't conflict
 
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
with the statute that requires a member
 
02:10:18.350 --> 02:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
this says at large so that's what that
 
02:10:20.149 --> 02:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
means of someone you wouldn't have
 
02:10:22.129 --> 02:10:22.139 align:start position:0%
several of them on here 100
 
02:10:24.830 --> 02:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
representative order selectman and the
 
02:10:26.030 --> 02:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
one from the school board that's already
 
02:10:28.189 --> 02:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
there this would be an additional so you
 
02:10:30.229 --> 02:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to run for
 
02:10:32.450 --> 02:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
um that large position of the medicinal
 
02:10:34.430 --> 02:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
budget community and the school board if
 
02:10:36.589 --> 02:10:36.599 align:start position:0%
you follow what I mean my followers to
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
choose I read it here okay thank you
 
02:10:39.709 --> 02:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yeah and as soon
 
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
as we get that Amendment and so we can
 
02:10:43.850 --> 02:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
start working on it prior to
 
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful are there any other
 
02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:47.689 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful are there any other
questions

02:10:47.689 --> 02:10:47.699 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:10:51.169 --> 02:10:51.179 align:start position:0%
of Greg yes representative cascadden
 
02:10:53.990 --> 02:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair be quick
 
02:10:55.790 --> 02:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
um just for clarification on the
 
02:10:55.800 --> 02:10:57.410 align:start position:0%
um just for clarification on the
terminologies

02:10:57.410 --> 02:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
terminologies
 
02:10:59.030 --> 02:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
the way that I'm interpreting your
 
02:11:00.890 --> 02:11:00.900 align:start position:0%
request is that
 
02:11:05.870 --> 02:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
if schools are in different towns yes
 
02:11:09.410 --> 02:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
and they may be one SAU but the towns
 
02:11:11.390 --> 02:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
operate under their own school boards
 
02:11:13.729 --> 02:11:13.739 align:start position:0%
that's where you're going so the
 
02:11:15.290 --> 02:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
language may be clarified in the
 
02:11:17.390 --> 02:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
amendment because a municipality would
 
02:11:19.310 --> 02:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
not have multiple towns but might have
 
02:11:21.470 --> 02:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
multiple schools it is very difficult to
 
02:11:23.510 --> 02:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
get the wording right enough thank you
 
02:11:26.030 --> 02:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
that's a good point yeah
 
02:11:28.189 --> 02:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:11:31.790 --> 02:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:36.350 --> 02:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
um let's see on 103 uh bear Christina
 
02:11:45.970 --> 02:11:45.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:48.589 --> 02:11:48.599 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee uh
 
02:11:50.330 --> 02:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman lad bear Christina
 
02:11:51.709 --> 02:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire school boards
 
02:11:53.689 --> 02:11:53.699 align:start position:0%
Association I want to thank
 
02:11:55.729 --> 02:11:55.739 align:start position:0%
representative Roy for clarifying that
 
02:11:58.430 --> 02:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
an amendment may be coming the testimony
 
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
both by representative Roy and uh the
 
02:12:03.470 --> 02:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
the other individual
 
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
um caught me off guard to be quite
 
02:12:06.470 --> 02:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
honest with you seemed very different
 
02:12:08.270 --> 02:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
than what I thought it was going to be
 
02:12:10.129 --> 02:12:10.139 align:start position:0%
based on on the language of the bill and
 
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
I see everybody sort of nodding and
 
02:12:13.070 --> 02:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
whatnot so
 
02:12:16.010 --> 02:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
um if I could respectfully maybe just
 
02:12:19.149 --> 02:12:19.159 align:start position:0%
ask a favor that before I spend time
 
02:12:22.609 --> 02:12:22.619 align:start position:0%
dealing with this which is a completely
 
02:12:24.770 --> 02:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
the the bill in front of us is
 
02:12:26.030 --> 02:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
completely different than what I thought
 
02:12:27.169 --> 02:12:27.179 align:start position:0%
it was going to be based on the
 
02:12:29.089 --> 02:12:29.099 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard if I could have
 
02:12:31.070 --> 02:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to perhaps address the
 
02:12:33.530 --> 02:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
committee if and when the the revised
 
02:12:35.330 --> 02:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
Bill comes out I know that may be during
 
02:12:36.589 --> 02:12:36.599 align:start position:0%
executive session and you don't
 
02:12:38.330 --> 02:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
necessarily take testimony during
 
02:12:40.550 --> 02:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
executive session but my testimony right
 
02:12:42.410 --> 02:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
now I'm not prepared to talk about what
 
02:12:44.750 --> 02:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
may be coming out because I thought this
 
02:12:46.729 --> 02:12:46.739 align:start position:0%
was I thought this was truck
 
02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
in reading this bill I thought it was
 
02:12:50.810 --> 02:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
restricting who could run for school
 
02:12:53.450 --> 02:12:53.460 align:start position:0%
board I thought it was restricting
 
02:12:55.069 --> 02:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
um family members
 
02:12:56.870 --> 02:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
um uh from working in the schools if
 
02:12:59.089 --> 02:12:59.099 align:start position:0%
they if they if they if they had a
 
02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
spouse or a child that was on the school
 
02:13:03.530 --> 02:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
board so I'm I'm a little confused which
 
02:13:05.569 --> 02:13:05.579 align:start position:0%
is very not the best way to get my first
 
02:13:07.870 --> 02:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
testimony before I had the same
 
02:13:10.010 --> 02:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
impression and understanding as you just
 
02:13:11.870 --> 02:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
presented to us and when we do this
 
02:13:13.970 --> 02:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
working with this amendment you've
 
02:13:15.470 --> 02:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
helped us out with manifest education
 
02:13:18.169 --> 02:13:18.179 align:start position:0%
hardship and we looked at your support
 
02:13:20.149 --> 02:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
to work with you in trying to clean this
 
02:13:21.950 --> 02:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
up thank you very much Mr chair you're
 
02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:23.270 align:start position:0%

questions for yeah it's real real really
 
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
question to the chair and um and um uh
 
02:13:33.470 --> 02:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
attorney Christina uh uh also when when
 
02:13:35.990 --> 02:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
considering the amendment for this and
 
02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
the language for the uh considering the
 
02:13:41.569 --> 02:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
the potential intersection with RSA 32
 
02:13:43.430 --> 02:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
which is the municipal budget committee
 
02:13:45.950 --> 02:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
I can address that now if that's all
 
02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:46.669 align:start position:0%
I can address that now if that's all
right

02:13:46.669 --> 02:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:13:48.589 --> 02:13:48.599 align:start position:0%
um the provision about prohibited from
 
02:13:50.270 --> 02:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
being a member at large on the municipal
 
02:13:51.830 --> 02:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
budget committee that's already in
 
02:13:56.149 --> 02:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
current law RSA 32 colon 15 sub
 
02:13:56.159 --> 02:13:57.589 align:start position:0%
current law RSA 32 colon 15 sub
paragraph

02:13:57.589 --> 02:13:57.599 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
02:14:00.350 --> 02:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
um five Roman numeral five no selectman
 
02:14:02.390 --> 02:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
Town manager member of the school board
 
02:14:05.089 --> 02:14:05.099 align:start position:0%
Village District commissioner full-time
 
02:14:07.189 --> 02:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
employee part-time Department had so on
 
02:14:09.770 --> 02:14:09.780 align:start position:0%
and so forth none of those Shall Serve
 
02:14:11.810 --> 02:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
as a member at large of a municipal
 
02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
budget committee under 32. so if that
 
02:14:15.709 --> 02:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
provision is already covered in law
 
02:14:17.569 --> 02:14:17.579 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:14:20.629 --> 02:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
yes represent Damon I think this is
 
02:14:23.209 --> 02:14:23.219 align:start position:0%
actually a question for you chairman is
 
02:14:27.050 --> 02:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
there ever a hearing on an amendment
 
02:14:29.209 --> 02:14:29.219 align:start position:0%
when it sounds like the amendment will
 
02:14:31.729 --> 02:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
be a considerably different Bill than
 
02:14:34.810 --> 02:14:34.820 align:start position:0%
what we have in front of us
 
02:14:37.609 --> 02:14:37.619 align:start position:0%
yes if the amendment is totally
 
02:14:39.589 --> 02:14:39.599 align:start position:0%
different than the bill but the decision
 
02:14:42.229 --> 02:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
would be have to you know be made is
 
02:14:45.350 --> 02:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment non-germaine to uh the
 
02:14:47.270 --> 02:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
bill that we're discussing I don't think
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
what we're discussing right now is
 
02:14:53.209 --> 02:14:53.219 align:start position:0%
really non-germaine it's uh we just have
 
02:14:56.089 --> 02:14:56.099 align:start position:0%
I think a wording problem and linkage
 
02:14:58.669 --> 02:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
with other statutes and that we can
 
02:15:00.910 --> 02:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
clean all this stuff up
 
02:15:04.310 --> 02:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we can great thank you for
 
02:15:06.490 --> 02:15:06.500 align:start position:0%
the clarification yeah
 
02:15:11.290 --> 02:15:11.300 align:start position:0%
so any other questions for Mr Christina
 
02:15:14.030 --> 02:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:15:18.050 --> 02:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
do we have any more cards on this yes uh
 
02:15:18.060 --> 02:15:20.510 align:start position:0%
do we have any more cards on this yes uh
Brian

02:15:20.510 --> 02:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
Brian
 
02:15:23.330 --> 02:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
Hawkins Nea New Hampshire
 
02:15:25.430 --> 02:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I think I'll be
 
02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
even shorter than uh Mr Christina uh I
 
02:15:31.609 --> 02:15:31.619 align:start position:0%
originally checked off opposition to
 
02:15:34.430 --> 02:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
this bill but having heard the intent
 
02:15:38.089 --> 02:15:38.099 align:start position:0%
um you know I I I scratched that off
 
02:15:41.450 --> 02:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
um and so uh what not having the
 
02:15:43.010 --> 02:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
amendment I would the only thing I would
 
02:15:45.530 --> 02:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
just offer is that uh whatever the
 
02:15:47.450 --> 02:15:47.460 align:start position:0%
committee arrives at that it it we're
 
02:15:51.109 --> 02:15:51.119 align:start position:0%
not going in uh a more restrictive uh
 
02:15:55.850 --> 02:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
qualifications for uh than
 
02:15:58.790 --> 02:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
um and certainly you know
 
02:16:01.609 --> 02:16:01.619 align:start position:0%
I have no problem with what the what the
 
02:16:03.169 --> 02:16:03.179 align:start position:0%
intent that sounds like of the bill is
 
02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
so I'll just I'll just leave it when we
 
02:16:07.189 --> 02:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
get all this squared away and you've
 
02:16:08.629 --> 02:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
worked with us in the code of ethics and
 
02:16:10.129 --> 02:16:10.139 align:start position:0%
all that we'd be glad to work with you
 
02:16:18.050 --> 02:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:20.209 --> 02:16:20.219 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of timing right now I
 
02:16:22.729 --> 02:16:22.739 align:start position:0%
think we can put together just a group
 
02:16:25.370 --> 02:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
of people to work on that so we'll do
 
02:16:27.109 --> 02:16:27.119 align:start position:0%
something on that end so we can get
 
02:16:28.970 --> 02:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
going on it because I think we know
 
02:16:30.589 --> 02:16:30.599 align:start position:0%
where we want to go it's just we got
 
02:16:36.009 --> 02:16:36.019 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:39.230 --> 02:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
instead of running out the door I think
 
02:16:40.610 --> 02:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
you're off the hook representative Roy
 
02:16:42.310 --> 02:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
you've been using Facebook
 
02:16:45.589 --> 02:16:45.599 align:start position:0%
Okay are there any other uh questions or
 
02:16:48.589 --> 02:16:48.599 align:start position:0%
people like to testify on the on this
 
02:16:48.599 --> 02:16:50.929 align:start position:0%
people like to testify on the on this
intent

02:16:50.929 --> 02:16:50.939 align:start position:0%
intent
 
02:16:52.669 --> 02:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much we're going to
 
02:16:55.370 --> 02:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
close this hearing
 
02:16:58.070 --> 02:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
and it's about a quarter of right now
 
02:17:01.969 --> 02:17:01.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:04.450 --> 02:17:04.460 align:start position:0%
 we're at lunch
 
02:17:07.490 --> 02:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
yes it's the best part of the day you
 
02:17:09.650 --> 02:17:09.660 align:start position:0%
know or maybe a German is but we're
 
02:17:11.870 --> 02:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
trying to reconvene Mr chair we we can
 
02:17:14.990 --> 02:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
be in at one o'clock to do HP 168. thank
 
02:17:16.310 --> 02:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
you yep
 
02:17:19.310 --> 02:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
so we're we're reconvening at one
 
02:17:21.169 --> 02:17:21.179 align:start position:0%
o'clock thank you
 
03:37:13.570 --> 03:37:13.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:15.710 --> 03:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:37:17.630 --> 03:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
committee members uh for the record
 
03:37:20.510 --> 03:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
Glenn cordelli uh representing uh tuft
 
03:37:22.309 --> 03:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
and Borough Wolfeboro and Ossipee in the
 
03:37:24.590 --> 03:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
beautiful Lakes Region
 
03:37:28.030 --> 03:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
um this is a pretty simple Bill uh just
 
03:37:32.150 --> 03:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
adjusts the requirement for Surety bonds
 
03:37:35.870 --> 03:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh to protect student tuitions
 
03:37:38.630 --> 03:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
um for students going to a career School
 
03:37:41.929 --> 03:37:41.939 align:start position:0%
and the reason I'm happy to sponsor this
 
03:37:44.870 --> 03:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
is because I had involvement in a
 
03:37:47.690 --> 03:37:47.700 align:start position:0%
situation with a career School
 
03:37:51.889 --> 03:37:51.899 align:start position:0%
um several years ago well 10 12 years
 
03:37:54.769 --> 03:37:54.779 align:start position:0%
ago our County built a new nursing home
 
03:37:57.530 --> 03:37:57.540 align:start position:0%
we still have and still to this day have
 
03:37:59.870 --> 03:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
the old Nursing Home in place
 
03:38:02.809 --> 03:38:02.819 align:start position:0%
uh the old nursing home
 
03:38:04.429 --> 03:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
um has a beautiful
 
03:38:08.210 --> 03:38:08.220 align:start position:0%
well equipped kitchen and a large dining
 
03:38:10.190 --> 03:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
room that's
 
03:38:13.490 --> 03:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
doing nothing right now
 
03:38:18.370 --> 03:38:18.380 align:start position:0%
um several years ago a a group
 
03:38:22.729 --> 03:38:22.739 align:start position:0%
had the idea to form a Culinary Academy
 
03:38:27.349 --> 03:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
came to the county to talk about use of
 
03:38:30.170 --> 03:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
the space and worked out Arrangements
 
03:38:30.180 --> 03:38:32.510 align:start position:0%
the space and worked out Arrangements
but

03:38:32.510 --> 03:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:38:35.269 --> 03:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
there are procedures you have to go
 
03:38:37.190 --> 03:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
through to start a career School a
 
03:38:40.729 --> 03:38:40.739 align:start position:0%
Career Academy and this is part of it
 
03:38:40.739 --> 03:38:41.330 align:start position:0%
Career Academy and this is part of it
um

03:38:41.330 --> 03:38:41.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:45.349 --> 03:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
so what happened is that they ran into
 
03:38:48.290 --> 03:38:48.300 align:start position:0%
problems with the process and
 
03:38:50.870 --> 03:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
um as local representative they reached
 
03:38:52.309 --> 03:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
out to me
 
03:38:57.130 --> 03:38:57.140 align:start position:0%
and I got involved and had multiple
 
03:38:59.150 --> 03:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
meetings with the Department of
 
03:38:59.160 --> 03:39:01.690 align:start position:0%
meetings with the Department of
Education

03:39:01.690 --> 03:39:01.700 align:start position:0%
Education
 
03:39:05.570 --> 03:39:05.580 align:start position:0%
Mr Appleby's predecessor Dr McCabe who
 
03:39:09.170 --> 03:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
was in charge of queer schools back then
 
03:39:11.150 --> 03:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
um the problem was with the amount of
 
03:39:14.630 --> 03:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
the surety bond that was being required
 
03:39:16.729 --> 03:39:16.739 align:start position:0%
of them
 
03:39:19.370 --> 03:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
um I forget the exact dollars involved
 
03:39:23.690 --> 03:39:23.700 align:start position:0%
but it was a a very substantial monthly
 
03:39:23.700 --> 03:39:25.150 align:start position:0%
but it was a a very substantial monthly
amount

03:39:25.150 --> 03:39:25.160 align:start position:0%
amount
 
03:39:29.750 --> 03:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh to pay for the surety bond well
 
03:39:31.790 --> 03:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
beyond their means
 
03:39:36.469 --> 03:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
um to to do to get donors to help them
 
03:39:39.349 --> 03:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
on a monthly basis with uh funding of
 
03:39:41.690 --> 03:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
the surety bond
 
03:39:41.700 --> 03:39:42.370 align:start position:0%
the surety bond
um

03:39:42.370 --> 03:39:42.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:46.130 --> 03:39:46.140 align:start position:0%
so long story short it
 
03:39:49.910 --> 03:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
um finally uh got stalled
 
03:39:51.950 --> 03:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
um they probably were not going to be
 
03:39:54.170 --> 03:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
able to go forward but uh then
 
03:39:56.690 --> 03:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the um
 
03:39:59.570 --> 03:39:59.580 align:start position:0%
uh one of the principals who was a
 
03:40:04.010 --> 03:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
career CTE a culinary instructor who was
 
03:40:05.410 --> 03:40:05.420 align:start position:0%
the lead
 
03:40:08.630 --> 03:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
instructor for this Culinary Academy uh
 
03:40:14.210 --> 03:40:14.220 align:start position:0%
uh took ill and the group dissolved um
 
03:40:16.910 --> 03:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
just an interesting note that during the
 
03:40:20.510 --> 03:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
past general election a local Democrat
 
03:40:22.490 --> 03:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
State Rep candidate
 
03:40:25.190 --> 03:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
um who had conversation with turned out
 
03:40:29.469 --> 03:40:29.479 align:start position:0%
that um that Chef was her father
 
03:40:32.389 --> 03:40:32.399 align:start position:0%
so we had very nice conversations she
 
03:40:34.130 --> 03:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
didn't realize that I was the person who
 
03:40:37.910 --> 03:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
had been trying to help them but
 
03:40:42.469 --> 03:40:42.479 align:start position:0%
I am well aware of the problems in
 
03:40:46.370 --> 03:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
trying to get started a career School in
 
03:40:49.429 --> 03:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
this case a Culinary Academy and
 
03:40:52.269 --> 03:40:52.279 align:start position:0%
would very much like to see
 
03:40:56.630 --> 03:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
a reasonable requirements for the surety
 
03:40:59.150 --> 03:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
bond both to cover the students but also
 
03:41:01.670 --> 03:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
to allow the Career Academy get started
 
03:41:05.030 --> 03:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
the more we can do you know I come from
 
03:41:06.950 --> 03:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
the Lakes Region right below the White
 
03:41:09.830 --> 03:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
Mountains hospitality is huge in our
 
03:41:13.610 --> 03:41:13.620 align:start position:0%
area a Culinary Academy would have been
 
03:41:17.929 --> 03:41:17.939 align:start position:0%
fantastic to help Supply people to those
 
03:41:21.969 --> 03:41:21.979 align:start position:0%
restaurants and clubs in in the area
 
03:41:25.070 --> 03:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it didn't happen but you
 
03:41:27.889 --> 03:41:27.899 align:start position:0%
know anything we can do to make it more
 
03:41:30.170 --> 03:41:30.180 align:start position:0%
accessible to people to start a career
 
03:41:32.769 --> 03:41:32.779 align:start position:0%
Academy and provide opportunities
 
03:41:36.670 --> 03:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
I think the better we all will be
 
03:41:39.769 --> 03:41:39.779 align:start position:0%
in terms of the exact
 
03:41:41.870 --> 03:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
the 10 percent
 
03:41:44.510 --> 03:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
um in the bill and so forth
 
03:41:47.210 --> 03:41:47.220 align:start position:0%
um I think Mr Appleby can better address
 
03:41:50.389 --> 03:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
that than I but I wanted to present this
 
03:41:53.630 --> 03:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
bill because of uh my personal
 
03:41:56.389 --> 03:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
involvement with a career School
 
03:42:04.030 --> 03:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:07.210 --> 03:42:07.220 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon
 
03:42:10.910 --> 03:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh we'll find Lakes Region uh I
 
03:42:12.650 --> 03:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
understand clearly Glenn about the
 
03:42:14.090 --> 03:42:14.100 align:start position:0%
community school and the county school
 
03:42:17.690 --> 03:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
and the college school my concern is
 
03:42:19.429 --> 03:42:19.439 align:start position:0%
um not that particular School my concern
 
03:42:22.670 --> 03:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
is if I recall uh the intent of this
 
03:42:25.010 --> 03:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
bill was to be able to provide
 
03:42:27.889 --> 03:42:27.899 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for a lot of those quick
 
03:42:30.550 --> 03:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
startup career schools that come and go
 
03:42:33.290 --> 03:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
and the students that participate from
 
03:42:37.130 --> 03:42:37.140 align:start position:0%
20 to 80 get their tuition back at the
 
03:42:38.630 --> 03:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
school was bankrupt that goes belly up
 
03:42:41.750 --> 03:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm concerned looking at the change
 
03:42:43.490 --> 03:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
to the percentage of the annual growth
 
03:42:46.250 --> 03:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
of projected tuition that that may not
 
03:42:48.530 --> 03:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
cover if the school starts up and goes
 
03:42:50.210 --> 03:42:50.220 align:start position:0%
out at midnight and packs the cars and
 
03:42:51.190 --> 03:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
goes away
 
03:42:55.969 --> 03:42:55.979 align:start position:0%
so is it that's my concern how what's
 
03:42:58.130 --> 03:42:58.140 align:start position:0%
your take on that as regards this bill
 
03:43:00.830 --> 03:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
I I think that that is a reasonable
 
03:43:03.590 --> 03:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
question to ask and I think Mr Appleby
 
03:43:05.210 --> 03:43:05.220 align:start position:0%
um will probably be able to address that
 
03:43:07.790 --> 03:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
better than I in terms of his experience
 
03:43:10.610 --> 03:43:10.620 align:start position:0%
with startup career academies
 
03:43:12.769 --> 03:43:12.779 align:start position:0%
um and the whole process and uh the
 
03:43:14.870 --> 03:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
protections for students okay thank you
 
03:43:17.389 --> 03:43:17.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair you're welcome uh yes
 
03:43:19.250 --> 03:43:19.260 align:start position:0%

I know it's afternoon thank you Mr chair
 
03:43:24.290 --> 03:43:24.300 align:start position:0%

doing nothing I'll share it with you uh
 
03:43:28.729 --> 03:43:28.739 align:start position:0%
just so for some clarification because
 
03:43:31.790 --> 03:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm familiar with CTE centers so are
 
03:43:34.190 --> 03:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
you talking about adding a program to a
 
03:43:36.650 --> 03:43:36.660 align:start position:0%
current career in technical Ed Regional
 
03:43:38.990 --> 03:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
Center that we have in the state no I'm
 
03:43:41.870 --> 03:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
sorry if I was confusing that um the
 
03:43:43.370 --> 03:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
principal who was involved in the
 
03:43:46.309 --> 03:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
program was a former CTE culinary
 
03:43:49.250 --> 03:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
instructor and he and a couple of other
 
03:43:51.229 --> 03:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
people were trying to start a career
 
03:43:54.530 --> 03:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
School a new Culinary Academy outside of
 
03:43:56.690 --> 03:43:56.700 align:start position:0%
CTE nothing to do with CTE so something
 
03:43:59.330 --> 03:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
in a private room correct whereas if
 
03:44:02.210 --> 03:44:02.220 align:start position:0%
that culinary program it could work in a
 
03:44:03.950 --> 03:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
partnership with the Local District to
 
03:44:06.710 --> 03:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
be a culinary arts program within their
 
03:44:09.110 --> 03:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
Korean technical Regional session we
 
03:44:12.110 --> 03:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
talked about that that CTE students upon
 
03:44:14.030 --> 03:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
graduation could come and get further
 
03:44:16.070 --> 03:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
education at The Culinary Academy before
 
03:44:18.769 --> 03:44:18.779 align:start position:0%
moving on to a local establishment and
 
03:44:21.590 --> 03:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
if it was a partnership with the
 
03:44:24.710 --> 03:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
regional center would it not then be
 
03:44:27.969 --> 03:44:27.979 align:start position:0%
covered under endemic indemnification
 
03:44:30.889 --> 03:44:30.899 align:start position:0%
of that program I'll leave that to Mr
 
03:44:34.490 --> 03:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
Appleby okay thank you
 
03:44:36.170 --> 03:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
 
03:44:36.180 --> 03:44:38.210 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
cordelli

03:44:38.210 --> 03:44:38.220 align:start position:0%
cordelli
 
03:44:43.370 --> 03:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
uh Steve Mr Appleby uh
 
03:44:46.490 --> 03:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
do you have a pink card done or not okay
 
03:44:48.650 --> 03:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
after don't worry about it right now
 
03:44:51.110 --> 03:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
this moment yeah
 
03:44:51.120 --> 03:44:51.950 align:start position:0%
this moment yeah
um

03:44:51.950 --> 03:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:53.809 --> 03:44:53.819 align:start position:0%
perhaps what you could do Steve is
 
03:44:55.670 --> 03:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
explain a little bit about these
 
03:44:57.710 --> 03:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
post-secondary career schools because I
 
03:44:59.150 --> 03:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
know that's your bailiwick over there
 
03:45:01.550 --> 03:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
with certification yep um good afternoon
 
03:45:03.769 --> 03:45:03.779 align:start position:0%
everyone um thank you for your time this
 
03:45:04.969 --> 03:45:04.979 align:start position:0%
afternoon for the record my name is
 
03:45:07.070 --> 03:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
Stephen Appleby I am the director of
 
03:45:09.469 --> 03:45:09.479 align:start position:0%
educator support in higher education at
 
03:45:11.929 --> 03:45:11.939 align:start position:0%
the department of Ed one of the programs
 
03:45:15.590 --> 03:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
I oversee is the chair alluded to is the
 
03:45:17.690 --> 03:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
licensing of post-secondary career
 
03:45:21.170 --> 03:45:21.180 align:start position:0%
schools just by way of history as
 
03:45:22.729 --> 03:45:22.739 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli mentioned some
 
03:45:24.889 --> 03:45:24.899 align:start position:0%
history with this issue I was an owner
 
03:45:26.510 --> 03:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
at one time of a licensed Career School
 
03:45:29.889 --> 03:45:29.899 align:start position:0%
in our state so my involvement with
 
03:45:32.570 --> 03:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
Career School licensing statutes and
 
03:45:34.550 --> 03:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
administrative rules goes back about 23
 
03:45:37.090 --> 03:45:37.100 align:start position:0%
years 24 years
 
03:45:40.309 --> 03:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
there was a change so a little bit of
 
03:45:42.650 --> 03:45:42.660 align:start position:0%
explanation post-secondary career
 
03:45:44.450 --> 03:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
schools the key words there are
 
03:45:46.910 --> 03:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
post-secondary right these are schools
 
03:45:48.410 --> 03:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
that are started that are geared towards
 
03:45:51.229 --> 03:45:51.239 align:start position:0%
folks who have completed high school and
 
03:45:53.650 --> 03:45:53.660 align:start position:0%
they may be looking for vocational
 
03:45:56.809 --> 03:45:56.819 align:start position:0%
training of some sort or computer
 
03:45:58.429 --> 03:45:58.439 align:start position:0%
training maybe they want to work in an
 
03:45:59.630 --> 03:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
office they need Microsoft Office
 
03:46:03.889 --> 03:46:03.899 align:start position:0%
training or LNA training outside it so
 
03:46:06.170 --> 03:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
you know they're they're closest if you
 
03:46:07.910 --> 03:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
want to think about equivalence they're
 
03:46:09.590 --> 03:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
closest to Nature typically to our
 
03:46:11.690 --> 03:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
community colleges
 
03:46:11.700 --> 03:46:12.410 align:start position:0%
community colleges
um

03:46:12.410 --> 03:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:14.870 --> 03:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
but again they also fulfill niches so we
 
03:46:17.570 --> 03:46:17.580 align:start position:0%
have a school in Manchester that teaches
 
03:46:19.309 --> 03:46:19.319 align:start position:0%
individuals how to be professional dog
 
03:46:19.319 --> 03:46:21.290 align:start position:0%
individuals how to be professional dog
groomers

03:46:21.290 --> 03:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
groomers
 
03:46:23.929 --> 03:46:23.939 align:start position:0%
so we have that and we run the gamut we
 
03:46:26.450 --> 03:46:26.460 align:start position:0%
have an HVAC school we have a heavy
 
03:46:29.690 --> 03:46:29.700 align:start position:0%
equipment operator school and they I'm
 
03:46:32.030 --> 03:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
sorry this is a little bit in the way
 
03:46:32.040 --> 03:46:35.450 align:start position:0%
sorry this is a little bit in the way
yeah

03:46:35.450 --> 03:46:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:38.210 --> 03:46:38.220 align:start position:0%
um so these schools fulfill it you know
 
03:46:41.269 --> 03:46:41.279 align:start position:0%
training for a number of professions
 
03:46:43.030 --> 03:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
um but but that fall outside they're
 
03:46:45.889 --> 03:46:45.899 align:start position:0%
typically not accredited and they are
 
03:46:47.330 --> 03:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
typically for-profit although they're
 
03:46:50.450 --> 03:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
exceptions to both of those statements
 
03:46:52.309 --> 03:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
um so The Surety and then vacation was
 
03:46:54.530 --> 03:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
put in place many many years ago to
 
03:46:56.870 --> 03:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
protect students from exactly the type
 
03:46:58.370 --> 03:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
of concern that a school closes
 
03:47:00.590 --> 03:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
precipitously students have paid tuition
 
03:47:02.630 --> 03:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
and because the school is a
 
03:47:04.550 --> 03:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
tuition-based school they of course
 
03:47:06.349 --> 03:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
can't pay it back because they've gone
 
03:47:09.590 --> 03:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
bankrupt we
 
03:47:13.790 --> 03:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
in 2021 in the fall of 2021 we had our
 
03:47:15.950 --> 03:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
largest licensed career post-secondary
 
03:47:17.570 --> 03:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
career School in the State closed
 
03:47:17.580 --> 03:47:19.370 align:start position:0%
career School in the State closed
precipitously

03:47:19.370 --> 03:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
precipitously
 
03:47:22.250 --> 03:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
um and that school had a bond and that
 
03:47:24.290 --> 03:47:24.300 align:start position:0%
bond to date has reimbursed about two
 
03:47:25.670 --> 03:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
hundred and four thousand dollars in
 
03:47:27.469 --> 03:47:27.479 align:start position:0%
tuition to its students
 
03:47:29.389 --> 03:47:29.399 align:start position:0%
I would note that that is less than 10
 
03:47:33.710 --> 03:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
percent of its annual adjusted gross
 
03:47:35.450 --> 03:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
tuition it's more in the order of about
 
03:47:37.790 --> 03:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
seven percent and this was our largest
 
03:47:41.750 --> 03:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
school prior to that closure in 2021 the
 
03:47:44.510 --> 03:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
last time we had to exercise a bond was
 
03:47:48.110 --> 03:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
I believe 2015 so these are not common
 
03:47:48.120 --> 03:47:49.969 align:start position:0%
I believe 2015 so these are not common
events

03:47:49.969 --> 03:47:49.979 align:start position:0%
events
 
03:47:53.750 --> 03:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
um in my 20 to 23 years gosh I don't
 
03:47:55.130 --> 03:47:55.140 align:start position:0%
want to date myself
 
03:47:58.370 --> 03:47:58.380 align:start position:0%
um I I can think of four instances where
 
03:48:00.229 --> 03:48:00.239 align:start position:0%
we've had to collect on a bond that I'm
 
03:48:02.389 --> 03:48:02.399 align:start position:0%
aware of of course for a good part of
 
03:48:03.710 --> 03:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
that time I was on the other side of the
 
03:48:03.720 --> 03:48:04.670 align:start position:0%
that time I was on the other side of the
table

03:48:04.670 --> 03:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
table
 
03:48:06.889 --> 03:48:06.899 align:start position:0%
but it's a small community most of us
 
03:48:08.690 --> 03:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
know each other most schools know each
 
03:48:11.030 --> 03:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
other we used to have a career School
 
03:48:12.830 --> 03:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
Association that I helped co-found many
 
03:48:14.929 --> 03:48:14.939 align:start position:0%
years ago and
 
03:48:16.969 --> 03:48:16.979 align:start position:0%
um again with an idea of strengthening
 
03:48:20.750 --> 03:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
the industry and keeping folks who
 
03:48:22.550 --> 03:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
aren't serious out of the industry
 
03:48:23.870 --> 03:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
because it hurts everyone right when a
 
03:48:25.729 --> 03:48:25.739 align:start position:0%
one school closes it hurts all the other
 
03:48:29.090 --> 03:48:29.100 align:start position:0%
schools regardless of what they teach so
 
03:48:30.410 --> 03:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit of background
 
03:48:34.370 --> 03:48:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:34.380 --> 03:48:35.630 align:start position:0%
 
great

03:48:35.630 --> 03:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
great
 
03:48:38.690 --> 03:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
um prior to 2018 the standard that we
 
03:48:41.389 --> 03:48:41.399 align:start position:0%
had for many many years was that a
 
03:48:44.269 --> 03:48:44.279 align:start position:0%
school would would get up obtain a bond
 
03:48:46.870 --> 03:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
for 10 percent of their annual tuition
 
03:48:46.880 --> 03:48:48.410 align:start position:0%
for 10 percent of their annual tuition
and

03:48:48.410 --> 03:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:48:50.330 --> 03:48:50.340 align:start position:0%
um that worked well for licensure
 
03:48:52.490 --> 03:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
purposes because schools could go to a
 
03:48:55.070 --> 03:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
bond company point to the RSA say here's
 
03:48:56.809 --> 03:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
my tax return or here's my first year
 
03:49:00.410 --> 03:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
business projection and it here's the
 
03:49:03.110 --> 03:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
statute says 10 of that so if my first
 
03:49:06.229 --> 03:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
year projection is 250 000 in tuition
 
03:49:08.030 --> 03:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
then I need a bond for twenty five
 
03:49:10.250 --> 03:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars the bond companies it
 
03:49:12.530 --> 03:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
was clean for them they understood it
 
03:49:15.410 --> 03:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
they could write that Bond since the
 
03:49:17.389 --> 03:49:17.399 align:start position:0%
change in 2018
 
03:49:20.210 --> 03:49:20.220 align:start position:0%
the way the change was to move to more
 
03:49:23.090 --> 03:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
of an ongoing what your potential
 
03:49:25.070 --> 03:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
liability is in any given year at any
 
03:49:27.170 --> 03:49:27.180 align:start position:0%
given time the bond companies have
 
03:49:28.969 --> 03:49:28.979 align:start position:0%
struggled to write bonds and
 
03:49:30.950 --> 03:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
subsequently have charged schools more
 
03:49:33.469 --> 03:49:33.479 align:start position:0%
to obtain those bonds because it's not
 
03:49:36.110 --> 03:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
as clean it's harder for the schools to
 
03:49:37.790 --> 03:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
to talk about liability throughout the
 
03:49:39.290 --> 03:49:39.300 align:start position:0%
year because it may change depending on
 
03:49:41.750 --> 03:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
number of students they have as programs
 
03:49:44.389 --> 03:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
start and programs and that number goes
 
03:49:47.150 --> 03:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
up and down the liability likewise where
 
03:49:48.590 --> 03:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
that those students on a particular
 
03:49:48.600 --> 03:49:49.490 align:start position:0%
that those students on a particular
program

03:49:49.490 --> 03:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:49:51.650 --> 03:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
the school that I mentioned that closed
 
03:49:54.950 --> 03:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
in 2021 we had a number of students who
 
03:49:58.670 --> 03:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
were 95 completed with their program
 
03:50:01.790 --> 03:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
and the liability of undelivered
 
03:50:03.830 --> 03:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
training at that point was very very
 
03:50:06.170 --> 03:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
small and in fact was taught out by
 
03:50:08.510 --> 03:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
another school so
 
03:50:10.729 --> 03:50:10.739 align:start position:0%
um in that instance the liability was
 
03:50:13.550 --> 03:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
very very small and the industry stepped
 
03:50:17.090 --> 03:50:17.100 align:start position:0%
up and covered for that school but based
 
03:50:19.670 --> 03:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
on the current statute the school had to
 
03:50:22.910 --> 03:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
carry a bond for that full tuition so
 
03:50:27.769 --> 03:50:27.779 align:start position:0%
this is in in the proposed change is a
 
03:50:30.410 --> 03:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
reaction to comments from school owners
 
03:50:32.990 --> 03:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
around the state that the 10 percent was
 
03:50:35.389 --> 03:50:35.399 align:start position:0%
much easier our bond company understood
 
03:50:37.729 --> 03:50:37.739 align:start position:0%
it and frankly it cost us less to
 
03:50:39.110 --> 03:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
maintain that Bond than the current
 
03:50:42.349 --> 03:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
system so
 
03:50:42.359 --> 03:50:43.750 align:start position:0%
system so
okay

03:50:43.750 --> 03:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:50:46.130 --> 03:50:46.140 align:start position:0%
so are you willing to take any questions
 
03:50:48.050 --> 03:50:48.060 align:start position:0%
from the committee here are there any
 
03:50:50.330 --> 03:50:50.340 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr Appleby representative
 
03:50:54.290 --> 03:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
luno okay in fact thanks very much Mr
 
03:50:56.510 --> 03:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you very much
 
03:50:58.790 --> 03:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
um Steve Appleby for uh joining us this
 
03:51:00.590 --> 03:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon and taking taking some
 
03:51:03.050 --> 03:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
questions what are um what are other
 
03:51:06.050 --> 03:51:06.060 align:start position:0%
states doing with respect to um um
 
03:51:08.090 --> 03:51:08.100 align:start position:0%
post-secondary career
 
03:51:11.450 --> 03:51:11.460 align:start position:0%
um again schools so um it really runs
 
03:51:15.170 --> 03:51:15.180 align:start position:0%
the gamut from a small percentage to
 
03:51:18.590 --> 03:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
full year so if your Revenue was one
 
03:51:20.030 --> 03:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars last year you need to
 
03:51:22.610 --> 03:51:22.620 align:start position:0%
carry a bond for one million dollars to
 
03:51:22.620 --> 03:51:24.110 align:start position:0%
carry a bond for one million dollars to
potentially

03:51:24.110 --> 03:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
03:51:25.969 --> 03:51:25.979 align:start position:0%
um requiring other schools to do
 
03:51:28.729 --> 03:51:28.739 align:start position:0%
teachouts and having teachout agreements
 
03:51:30.469 --> 03:51:30.479 align:start position:0%
in place with other schools
 
03:51:35.870 --> 03:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:37.729 --> 03:51:37.739 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chair
 
03:51:41.690 --> 03:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm intrigued by the the teachout
 
03:51:44.210 --> 03:51:44.220 align:start position:0%
um Clauses that's something that uh that
 
03:51:46.130 --> 03:51:46.140 align:start position:0%
you think um if if we were to move
 
03:51:48.469 --> 03:51:48.479 align:start position:0%
forward in this direction that having a
 
03:51:51.170 --> 03:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
a teachout requirement might be a good
 
03:51:55.010 --> 03:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
um um I think uh frankly
 
03:51:57.229 --> 03:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
um the states that were that rely on
 
03:51:58.570 --> 03:51:58.580 align:start position:0%
teachouts are states like Pennsylvania
 
03:52:01.370 --> 03:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
that have hundreds and hundreds of these
 
03:52:04.429 --> 03:52:04.439 align:start position:0%
schools we have less than 60.
 
03:52:06.710 --> 03:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
so the challenge would be that for
 
03:52:08.630 --> 03:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
example the dog grooming school that I
 
03:52:08.640 --> 03:52:09.590 align:start position:0%
example the dog grooming school that I
mentioned

03:52:09.590 --> 03:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
03:52:11.090 --> 03:52:11.100 align:start position:0%
they're it
 
03:52:13.490 --> 03:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
so who would do the teach out
 
03:52:14.750 --> 03:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
for them
 
03:52:17.809 --> 03:52:17.819 align:start position:0%
so if we made a requirement that they
 
03:52:19.670 --> 03:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
needed to have a teachout plan in place
 
03:52:21.889 --> 03:52:21.899 align:start position:0%
with a competitor they don't have a
 
03:52:24.530 --> 03:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
competitor so does that mean they would
 
03:52:26.630 --> 03:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
have to close or a new school couldn't
 
03:52:29.450 --> 03:52:29.460 align:start position:0%
open because there was no competitor so
 
03:52:31.309 --> 03:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
that that's so the states that do
 
03:52:34.190 --> 03:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
teachouts tend to be the largest states
 
03:52:37.190 --> 03:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
so and so so since you since you sort of
 
03:52:40.070 --> 03:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
posed a question back to me on on that
 
03:52:42.229 --> 03:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
which is a little unusual
 
03:52:45.769 --> 03:52:45.779 align:start position:0%
um during hearing but uh but that's all
 
03:52:46.969 --> 03:52:46.979 align:start position:0%
right that's my style on this
 
03:52:48.590 --> 03:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
conversation the beginning of the season
 
03:52:51.190 --> 03:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
so uh yeah
 
03:52:54.229 --> 03:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
but but but I would I would I would I
 
03:52:56.690 --> 03:52:56.700 align:start position:0%
would suggest though that if the dog
 
03:52:58.969 --> 03:52:58.979 align:start position:0%
grooming school was was closing down
 
03:53:02.030 --> 03:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
that they would also be um there would
 
03:53:05.030 --> 03:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
be an availability then of um of
 
03:53:07.490 --> 03:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
teaching staff who were uh and and
 
03:53:10.070 --> 03:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
instructional space that another school
 
03:53:12.889 --> 03:53:12.899 align:start position:0%
might be able to continue to operate to
 
03:53:15.349 --> 03:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
fulfill the um you know the contracts
 
03:53:17.389 --> 03:53:17.399 align:start position:0%
that they've made with that the former
 
03:53:20.269 --> 03:53:20.279 align:start position:0%
school had with their students and that
 
03:53:22.130 --> 03:53:22.140 align:start position:0%
that another school might be able to
 
03:53:25.190 --> 03:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
pick up using those those resources so
 
03:53:26.690 --> 03:53:26.700 align:start position:0%
just by virtue of the fact that we've
 
03:53:29.330 --> 03:53:29.340 align:start position:0%
only got about 60-ish schools as opposed
 
03:53:32.090 --> 03:53:32.100 align:start position:0%
to you know thousands of ish schools uh
 
03:53:34.130 --> 03:53:34.140 align:start position:0%
like Pennsylvania that that there may be
 
03:53:37.130 --> 03:53:37.140 align:start position:0%
be a solution if if we're trying to do
 
03:53:40.429 --> 03:53:40.439 align:start position:0%
something that is favorable to uh to
 
03:53:42.410 --> 03:53:42.420 align:start position:0%
operating these schools that we also do
 
03:53:44.150 --> 03:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
something in the same construction
 
03:53:46.729 --> 03:53:46.739 align:start position:0%
that's favorable to the students
 
03:53:52.929 --> 03:53:52.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:55.670 --> 03:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
okay uh with representative Woodcock you
 
03:53:58.429 --> 03:53:58.439 align:start position:0%
are next thank you Sharon
 
03:53:58.439 --> 03:53:59.630 align:start position:0%
are next thank you Sharon
um

03:53:59.630 --> 03:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:03.309 --> 03:54:03.319 align:start position:0%
Davis Appleby I can see the church
 
03:54:06.349 --> 03:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
yeah much much better we're going to
 
03:54:07.729 --> 03:54:07.739 align:start position:0%
just move your chair so you don't have
 
03:54:09.410 --> 03:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
to worry about it I think it was nobody
 
03:54:12.950 --> 03:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
um my question is I understand the the
 
03:54:16.010 --> 03:54:16.020 align:start position:0%
the the the rationale for this uh your
 
03:54:18.469 --> 03:54:18.479 align:start position:0%
explanation Glenn's explanation clearly
 
03:54:18.479 --> 03:54:20.090 align:start position:0%
explanation Glenn's explanation clearly
uh

03:54:20.090 --> 03:54:20.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:54:22.130 --> 03:54:22.140 align:start position:0%
but the intent if I understand the
 
03:54:24.349 --> 03:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
original Law to make sure the students
 
03:54:26.450 --> 03:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
are not the one that were footing the
 
03:54:26.460 --> 03:54:27.349 align:start position:0%
are not the one that were footing the
loss

03:54:27.349 --> 03:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
loss
 
03:54:30.590 --> 03:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
so in this bill
 
03:54:33.290 --> 03:54:33.300 align:start position:0%
is the change in the best interest of
 
03:54:35.450 --> 03:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
the students for the change or in the
 
03:54:41.689 --> 03:54:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:43.610 --> 03:54:43.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:54:43.620 --> 03:54:44.750 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
um

03:54:44.750 --> 03:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:46.429 --> 03:54:46.439 align:start position:0%
I think both
 
03:54:49.610 --> 03:54:49.620 align:start position:0%
I think both because if
 
03:54:52.010 --> 03:54:52.020 align:start position:0%
it is more of a financial burden on our
 
03:54:54.530 --> 03:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
schools to carry a bond that raises
 
03:54:54.540 --> 03:54:56.990 align:start position:0%
schools to carry a bond that raises
tuition

03:54:56.990 --> 03:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:58.929 --> 03:54:58.939 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:55:01.610 --> 03:55:01.620 align:start position:0%
and it raises the bar as representative
 
03:55:03.229 --> 03:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
cordelli mentioned to even start a
 
03:55:03.239 --> 03:55:05.090 align:start position:0%
cordelli mentioned to even start a
school

03:55:05.090 --> 03:55:05.100 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:55:07.010 --> 03:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
so I
 
03:55:10.610 --> 03:55:10.620 align:start position:0%
to me it it benefits both sides it it's
 
03:55:12.889 --> 03:55:12.899 align:start position:0%
certainly clearer that it benefits a
 
03:55:14.269 --> 03:55:14.279 align:start position:0%
career School owner
 
03:55:16.370 --> 03:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
but I think it has a knock-on effect to
 
03:55:18.170 --> 03:55:18.180 align:start position:0%
their students or prospective students
 
03:55:19.969 --> 03:55:19.979 align:start position:0%
in the case of an institution trying to
 
03:55:19.979 --> 03:55:20.870 align:start position:0%
in the case of an institution trying to
open

03:55:20.870 --> 03:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
open
 
03:55:22.429 --> 03:55:22.439 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman you're
 
03:55:25.309 --> 03:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Tanner
 
03:55:28.070 --> 03:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I actually have two
 
03:55:30.349 --> 03:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
questions one was representative
 
03:55:33.110 --> 03:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
cordelli talked about payments ongoing
 
03:55:36.050 --> 03:55:36.060 align:start position:0%
payments and is it a one one time a year
 
03:55:39.290 --> 03:55:39.300 align:start position:0%
payment to an insurance company I assume
 
03:55:40.429 --> 03:55:40.439 align:start position:0%
there are insurance companies that hold
 
03:55:42.710 --> 03:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
these or is it an ongoing monthly
 
03:55:44.750 --> 03:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
payment that the school has to come up
 
03:55:46.189 --> 03:55:46.199 align:start position:0%
with thank you
 
03:55:48.229 --> 03:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
um for the question that that would be
 
03:55:49.250 --> 03:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
up to the school and its insurance
 
03:55:51.710 --> 03:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
company similar to when you buy car
 
03:55:53.269 --> 03:55:53.279 align:start position:0%
insurance you can pay annually you can
 
03:55:55.309 --> 03:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
pay monthly okay and monthly cost you a
 
03:55:56.870 --> 03:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
little more each month and you're really
 
03:55:59.870 --> 03:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
just financing that so it really depends
 
03:56:02.330 --> 03:56:02.340 align:start position:0%
on the school and and the insurance
 
03:56:04.610 --> 03:56:04.620 align:start position:0%
company and my second question is is
 
03:56:08.050 --> 03:56:08.060 align:start position:0%
there does this apply to all career
 
03:56:10.670 --> 03:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
schools that are trying to get
 
03:56:12.590 --> 03:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
um startup that they have to get a
 
03:56:15.229 --> 03:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
license uh and be under regulations or
 
03:56:18.170 --> 03:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
is there a threshold on for example
 
03:56:20.389 --> 03:56:20.399 align:start position:0%
Susie Jones who decides that she wants
 
03:56:22.729 --> 03:56:22.739 align:start position:0%
to teach two dog walkers
 
03:56:24.349 --> 03:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
um does she have to get a license or is
 
03:56:27.710 --> 03:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
there a threshold on yearly tuition
 
03:56:29.990 --> 03:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
gross tuition or even numbers of
 
03:56:32.689 --> 03:56:32.699 align:start position:0%
students in the academy great question
 
03:56:34.910 --> 03:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so I I'll point out first of
 
03:56:36.769 --> 03:56:36.779 align:start position:0%
all these are vocational schools not
 
03:56:39.889 --> 03:56:39.899 align:start position:0%
avocational schools so the person who
 
03:56:41.750 --> 03:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
decides they're going to teach kids how
 
03:56:43.670 --> 03:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
to play the piano out of their home this
 
03:56:45.229 --> 03:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover those individuals that's
 
03:56:45.239 --> 03:56:46.550 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover those individuals that's
avocational

03:56:46.550 --> 03:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
avocational
 
03:56:48.769 --> 03:56:48.779 align:start position:0%
but the person who opens a school to
 
03:56:50.689 --> 03:56:50.699 align:start position:0%
teach individuals how to be piano
 
03:56:53.510 --> 03:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
teachers as a profession that's
 
03:56:55.490 --> 03:56:55.500 align:start position:0%
vocational so those will be covered so
 
03:56:58.189 --> 03:56:58.199 align:start position:0%
that a person T you know dog walking
 
03:57:00.110 --> 03:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
that would not typically be covered
 
03:57:01.729 --> 03:57:01.739 align:start position:0%
unless they're teaching people how to
 
03:57:03.590 --> 03:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
start businesses to be dog walkers or
 
03:57:05.090 --> 03:57:05.100 align:start position:0%
something right
 
03:57:08.389 --> 03:57:08.399 align:start position:0%
um but you know the the threshold I
 
03:57:08.399 --> 03:57:09.170 align:start position:0%
um but you know the the threshold I
believe

03:57:09.170 --> 03:57:09.180 align:start position:0%
believe
 
03:57:11.630 --> 03:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
um so statutory change last year is 100
 
03:57:15.050 --> 03:57:15.060 align:start position:0%
000 a year in annual revenue below that
 
03:57:16.670 --> 03:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
they do not need a license that was a
 
03:57:18.410 --> 03:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
new statute
 
03:57:21.229 --> 03:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
um but so it all depends when a new
 
03:57:24.469 --> 03:57:24.479 align:start position:0%
school comes to the Department
 
03:57:26.750 --> 03:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
they present A business plan and that
 
03:57:28.130 --> 03:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
business plan has a revenue projection
 
03:57:29.929 --> 03:57:29.939 align:start position:0%
that Revenue projection is a hundred
 
03:57:31.130 --> 03:57:31.140 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in their first year
 
03:57:33.769 --> 03:57:33.779 align:start position:0%
then we require them to get a bond if it
 
03:57:36.889 --> 03:57:36.899 align:start position:0%
is below that then we do not require but
 
03:57:39.769 --> 03:57:39.779 align:start position:0%
uh one of they have to check back in
 
03:57:42.590 --> 03:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
with us after a year to see have they
 
03:57:44.090 --> 03:57:44.100 align:start position:0%
gone above it and it is incumbent upon
 
03:57:45.889 --> 03:57:45.899 align:start position:0%
them to tell us if they're above a
 
03:57:48.050 --> 03:57:48.060 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars then their
 
03:57:50.090 --> 03:57:50.100 align:start position:0%
exclusion expired that is no longer
 
03:57:51.590 --> 03:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
valid and they have to apply for a
 
03:57:51.600 --> 03:57:53.570 align:start position:0%
valid and they have to apply for a
license

03:57:53.570 --> 03:57:53.580 align:start position:0%
license
 
03:57:56.990 --> 03:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions of Steve
 
03:57:57.000 --> 03:57:58.610 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions of Steve
Appleby

03:57:58.610 --> 03:57:58.620 align:start position:0%
Appleby
 
03:58:01.610 --> 03:58:01.620 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much thank
 
03:58:03.349 --> 03:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
you we have another bill coming up a
 
03:58:06.410 --> 03:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
little later here on on well I see Kathy
 
03:58:08.990 --> 03:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
province is already here so you might
 
03:58:10.309 --> 03:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
want to hang around if you have a moment
 
03:58:12.110 --> 03:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
or two
 
03:58:14.030 --> 03:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
um are there any other people who want
 
03:58:18.530 --> 03:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
to testify on on this bill 168
 
03:58:20.689 --> 03:58:20.699 align:start position:0%
not seeing any so we'll close this
 
03:58:20.699 --> 03:58:22.010 align:start position:0%
not seeing any so we'll close this
hearing

03:58:22.010 --> 03:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:58:26.750 --> 03:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
okay and we'll roll into HP 155
 
03:58:29.330 --> 03:58:29.340 align:start position:0%
this bill is relative to
 
03:58:33.170 --> 03:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
um uh see 150 yeah relative to division
 
03:58:34.729 --> 03:58:34.739 align:start position:0%
of educator support in a higher
 
03:58:37.010 --> 03:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
education and relative to Surety
 
03:58:38.510 --> 03:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
indemnification for private
 
03:58:40.490 --> 03:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
post-secondary career schools somewhat
 
03:58:46.910 --> 03:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:50.450 --> 03:58:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:52.070 --> 03:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
making the show is waiting for you to
 
03:58:55.429 --> 03:58:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:58.010 --> 03:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
oh you found your way to the party or
 
03:59:00.290 --> 03:59:00.300 align:start position:0%
the table without having to be invited
 
03:59:03.290 --> 03:59:03.300 align:start position:0%
didn't you be familiar with it been here
 
03:59:05.570 --> 03:59:05.580 align:start position:0%
before uh to include even today thank
 
03:59:08.870 --> 03:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
you uh again Mr chair and members for
 
03:59:11.630 --> 03:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
the record uh I am still uh Mike Moffett
 
03:59:14.150 --> 03:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh Merrimack for
 
03:59:18.410 --> 03:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
beautiful towns of Canterbury in Loudon
 
03:59:22.070 --> 03:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
um in this uh HP 155 is an act relative
 
03:59:24.349 --> 03:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
to the division of educated support in
 
03:59:26.809 --> 03:59:26.819 align:start position:0%
higher education and relative to Surety
 
03:59:28.429 --> 03:59:28.439 align:start position:0%
indemnification for private
 
03:59:31.090 --> 03:59:31.100 align:start position:0%
post-secondary career schools
 
03:59:34.010 --> 03:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
Surety indemnification
 
03:59:35.210 --> 03:59:35.220 align:start position:0%
um I kind of would rather talk about
 
03:59:38.210 --> 03:59:38.220 align:start position:0%
communism again but let's uh let's get
 
03:59:39.830 --> 03:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
into this uh
 
03:59:42.530 --> 03:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
charity indemnification so uh you all
 
03:59:48.349 --> 03:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
have a copy of uh HP 155 so Indemnity is
 
03:59:51.410 --> 03:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
the backbone of many Surety Bonds in
 
03:59:51.420 --> 03:59:52.189 align:start position:0%
the backbone of many Surety Bonds in
short

03:59:52.189 --> 03:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
short
 
03:59:55.790 --> 03:59:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh in Indemnity compels a party to
 
03:59:59.150 --> 03:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
compensate another party for cause
 
04:00:01.610 --> 04:00:01.620 align:start position:0%
and the surety bond involves the obligee
 
04:00:04.969 --> 04:00:04.979 align:start position:0%
having the legal right to collect from
 
04:00:07.910 --> 04:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
The Surety if the principal
 
04:00:10.490 --> 04:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
of the blind fails to uphold their end
 
04:00:12.650 --> 04:00:12.660 align:start position:0%
of the bond arrangements or whatever
 
04:00:16.010 --> 04:00:16.020 align:start position:0%
agreements that they uh agreed upon
 
04:00:19.250 --> 04:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
so hb155 modifies some statutory
 
04:00:23.510 --> 04:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
language concerning uh Doe's division of
 
04:00:26.210 --> 04:00:26.220 align:start position:0%
educator support in higher education
 
04:00:28.450 --> 04:00:28.460 align:start position:0%
this would be as I'm sure you all know
 
04:00:34.849 --> 04:00:34.859 align:start position:0%
RSA 21-n colon 8-a Roman numeral two
 
04:00:37.610 --> 04:00:37.620 align:start position:0%
so they have it on so you can see the
 
04:00:41.450 --> 04:00:41.460 align:start position:0%
changes in the uh in the measure that
 
04:00:43.010 --> 04:00:43.020 align:start position:0%
you should have in front of you so on
 
04:00:46.550 --> 04:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
page one line 15 you'll see uh it
 
04:00:48.469 --> 04:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
removes section seven
 
04:00:50.450 --> 04:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
which involves one member of the higher
 
04:00:52.370 --> 04:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
education commission to be appointed by
 
04:00:54.050 --> 04:00:54.060 align:start position:0%
the governor and Council as a
 
04:00:54.060 --> 04:00:55.429 align:start position:0%
the governor and Council as a
representative

04:00:55.429 --> 04:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:00:57.889 --> 04:00:57.899 align:start position:0%
from a for-profit calls University
 
04:01:00.429 --> 04:01:00.439 align:start position:0%
that's not a member of the New Hampshire
 
04:01:03.650 --> 04:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
college and university Council
 
04:01:05.510 --> 04:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
and some of the thinking here being that
 
04:01:07.250 --> 04:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
a that a private
 
04:01:10.670 --> 04:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
for profit Institution
 
04:01:12.110 --> 04:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
um there might be some issues that being
 
04:01:14.389 --> 04:01:14.399 align:start position:0%
regulated by a competing
 
04:01:17.809 --> 04:01:17.819 align:start position:0%
uh Public School Commission
 
04:01:22.130 --> 04:01:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:26.210 --> 04:01:26.220 align:start position:0%
you will see the subsection 4
 
04:01:29.389 --> 04:01:29.399 align:start position:0%
is also removed with regard to applying
 
04:01:30.950 --> 04:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
for Grants
 
04:01:30.960 --> 04:01:31.750 align:start position:0%
for Grants
Etc

04:01:31.750 --> 04:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
04:01:33.889 --> 04:01:33.899 align:start position:0%
some some of the thinking here being
 
04:01:37.250 --> 04:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
that it is uh it could be unwieldy for a
 
04:01:38.990 --> 04:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
commission to apply for Grant a
 
04:01:40.670 --> 04:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
commission to apply for Grants as
 
04:01:42.410 --> 04:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
opposed to an institution applying for
 
04:01:45.110 --> 04:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
Grants it's it's a little different
 
04:01:48.170 --> 04:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
on page three
 
04:01:50.630 --> 04:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
lines three through seven you see
 
04:01:52.490 --> 04:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
there's more language changes and
 
04:01:54.530 --> 04:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
crossouts some of the thinking here
 
04:01:57.830 --> 04:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
being that the current Bond requirement
 
04:02:00.950 --> 04:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
is potential is potentially daunting and
 
04:02:03.410 --> 04:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
potentially overwhelming
 
04:02:06.410 --> 04:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
um which could make it unnecessarily for
 
04:02:06.420 --> 04:02:07.490 align:start position:0%
um which could make it unnecessarily for
fatal

04:02:07.490 --> 04:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
fatal
 
04:02:10.309 --> 04:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
to an institution obligated to secure a
 
04:02:12.290 --> 04:02:12.300 align:start position:0%
blind sufficient to reimburse the
 
04:02:16.969 --> 04:02:16.979 align:start position:0%
tuition for a quote any service contract
 
04:02:16.979 --> 04:02:18.530 align:start position:0%
tuition for a quote any service contract
unquote

04:02:18.530 --> 04:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
unquote
 
04:02:20.689 --> 04:02:20.699 align:start position:0%
so when you see something that says any
 
04:02:24.530 --> 04:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
service uh that kind of also means every
 
04:02:27.229 --> 04:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
service contract so the new proposed
 
04:02:29.570 --> 04:02:29.580 align:start position:0%
language I think is a is a little more
 
04:02:32.269 --> 04:02:32.279 align:start position:0%
realistic and a little more manageable
 
04:02:35.630 --> 04:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
also on page three lines 19 through 21
 
04:02:37.610 --> 04:02:37.620 align:start position:0%
you'll see the new language that
 
04:02:40.189 --> 04:02:40.199 align:start position:0%
quantifies the amount in question for an
 
04:02:42.170 --> 04:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
irrevocable letter of credit
 
04:02:45.769 --> 04:02:45.779 align:start position:0%
but you see it it says uh now it says at
 
04:02:45.779 --> 04:02:46.490 align:start position:0%
but you see it it says uh now it says at
least

04:02:46.490 --> 04:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
least
 
04:02:49.010 --> 04:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
uh changing it to be equal to at least
 
04:02:50.870 --> 04:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
10 percent of the annual gross tuition
 
04:02:54.469 --> 04:02:54.479 align:start position:0%
for the current Academic Year as opposed
 
04:02:57.650 --> 04:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
to Simply being quote determined by the
 
04:02:57.660 --> 04:02:58.910 align:start position:0%
to Simply being quote determined by the
commission

04:02:58.910 --> 04:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:03:01.130 --> 04:03:01.140 align:start position:0%
so the language of something just being
 
04:03:02.630 --> 04:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
quote unquote determined by the
 
04:03:05.809 --> 04:03:05.819 align:start position:0%
commission is a little uh a lot elastic
 
04:03:08.269 --> 04:03:08.279 align:start position:0%
to be to be sure
 
04:03:11.030 --> 04:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
um is the way the state is where the
 
04:03:12.710 --> 04:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
statute currently reads the commission
 
04:03:15.410 --> 04:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
could you know theoretically uh
 
04:03:19.189 --> 04:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
determine almost any amount so this uh
 
04:03:21.769 --> 04:03:21.779 align:start position:0%
limits and quantifies that this is where
 
04:03:23.510 --> 04:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
we get the uh
 
04:03:26.330 --> 04:03:26.340 align:start position:0%
the 10 figure
 
04:03:28.309 --> 04:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
and so that takes us through all the
 
04:03:30.950 --> 04:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
language changes in
 
04:03:34.550 --> 04:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
I would say 21-n colon 8 dash a Roman

04:04:52.670 --> 04:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
did this language come from the

good afternoon again for the record
 
04:06:15.290 --> 04:06:15.300 align:start position:0%
Steve Appley
 
04:06:16.969 --> 04:06:16.979 align:start position:0%
director of educator support and higher
 
04:06:17.809 --> 04:06:17.819 align:start position:0%
education at the New Hampshire
 
04:06:19.849 --> 04:06:19.859 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed
 
04:06:19.859 --> 04:06:20.630 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed
um

04:06:20.630 --> 04:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:24.950 --> 04:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
not recovering the ground of The Surety
 
04:06:27.050 --> 04:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
medication because that's also captured
 
04:06:30.229 --> 04:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
in previous Bill the language
 
04:06:32.389 --> 04:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
for example beginning
 
04:06:34.429 --> 04:06:34.439 align:start position:0%
um line 10
 
04:06:37.130 --> 04:06:37.140 align:start position:0%
where we added designee and you'll see a
 
04:06:38.689 --> 04:06:38.699 align:start position:0%
number of changes after that to the
 
04:06:40.389 --> 04:06:40.399 align:start position:0%
higher education commission
 
04:06:43.370 --> 04:06:43.380 align:start position:0%
this work proposal was completed in
 
04:06:45.290 --> 04:06:45.300 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the university system
 
04:06:47.990 --> 04:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
as well as the New Hampshire College
 
04:06:50.330 --> 04:06:50.340 align:start position:0%
University Council to kind of clean up
 
04:06:51.830 --> 04:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
the membership of the higher education
 
04:06:51.840 --> 04:06:54.349 align:start position:0%
the membership of the higher education
Commission

04:06:54.349 --> 04:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:56.210 --> 04:06:56.220 align:start position:0%
some of you may be aware being on this
 
04:06:58.130 --> 04:06:58.140 align:start position:0%
body that you need a quorum to hold a
 
04:07:01.490 --> 04:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
meeting well one of the things that the
 
04:07:02.990 --> 04:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
higher education commission which is a
 
04:07:04.309 --> 04:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
rule-making body struggles with
 
04:07:07.729 --> 04:07:07.739 align:start position:0%
sometimes is having a quorum and this
 
04:07:09.889 --> 04:07:09.899 align:start position:0%
bill cleans up some of those kind of
 
04:07:12.349 --> 04:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
self-inflicted wounds if you will so for
 
04:07:15.050 --> 04:07:15.060 align:start position:0%
example line 15 we have not had a
 
04:07:16.969 --> 04:07:16.979 align:start position:0%
for-profit college in our state in five
 
04:07:20.389 --> 04:07:20.399 align:start position:0%
years there are currently none so that
 
04:07:22.130 --> 04:07:22.140 align:start position:0%
is a seat that has sat open for five
 
04:07:25.309 --> 04:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
years on the higher education Commission
 
04:07:27.650 --> 04:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
um likewise if we go up a little bit to
 
04:07:30.290 --> 04:07:30.300 align:start position:0%
10 lines 10 and 11 where we add a
 
04:07:30.300 --> 04:07:31.370 align:start position:0%
10 lines 10 and 11 where we add a
designee

04:07:31.370 --> 04:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
designee
 
04:07:34.250 --> 04:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
those are instances where rarely do we
 
04:07:34.260 --> 04:07:35.389 align:start position:0%
those are instances where rarely do we
get

04:07:35.389 --> 04:07:35.399 align:start position:0%
get
 
04:07:35.399 --> 04:07:38.150 align:start position:0%
get
um

04:07:38.150 --> 04:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:40.670 --> 04:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
a Chancellor to necessarily Chancellor
 
04:07:42.710 --> 04:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
show up presidents of college is not as
 
04:07:45.950 --> 04:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
much and we currently have a situation
 
04:07:47.689 --> 04:07:47.699 align:start position:0%
where the chancellor of the University
 
04:07:49.990 --> 04:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
system is also the president of a campus
 
04:07:52.910 --> 04:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
so that individual is named twice in
 
04:07:55.969 --> 04:07:55.979 align:start position:0%
statute but can only fill one scene so
 
04:07:57.590 --> 04:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
if that individual doesn't show up we
 
04:08:00.290 --> 04:08:00.300 align:start position:0%
have two empty seats towards act warm so
 
04:08:02.689 --> 04:08:02.699 align:start position:0%
the idea behind these changes is to
 
04:08:04.370 --> 04:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
clean up the language recognize the
 
04:08:07.550 --> 04:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
current reality of our higher education
 
04:08:10.610 --> 04:08:10.620 align:start position:0%
community and quite honestly facilitate
 
04:08:12.229 --> 04:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
us holding regular higher education
 
04:08:12.239 --> 04:08:13.250 align:start position:0%
us holding regular higher education
meetings

04:08:13.250 --> 04:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
04:08:16.429 --> 04:08:16.439 align:start position:0%
so that's the background happy to answer
 
04:08:18.349 --> 04:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
04:08:21.170 --> 04:08:21.180 align:start position:0%

04:08:26.570 --> 04:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
question to you Mr Appleby is with
 
04:08:30.650 --> 04:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
respect to how the um the uh make sure I
 
04:08:32.269 --> 04:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
get the term right the higher education
 
04:08:32.279 --> 04:08:34.189 align:start position:0%
get the term right the higher education
commission

04:08:34.189 --> 04:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:08:34.199 --> 04:08:34.969 align:start position:0%
commission
um

04:08:34.969 --> 04:08:34.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:38.229 --> 04:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
um exercises it's um
 
04:08:41.630 --> 04:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility on page two line eight to
 
04:08:44.450 --> 04:08:44.460 align:start position:0%
accept uh I'm sorry to apply for accept
 
04:08:46.309 --> 04:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
and expend state federal and other
 
04:08:46.319 --> 04:08:47.630 align:start position:0%
and expend state federal and other
grants

04:08:47.630 --> 04:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
grants
 
04:08:49.370 --> 04:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:08:52.490 --> 04:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
I I did not ask for that script I'm not
 
04:08:53.809 --> 04:08:53.819 align:start position:0%
sure where that came from but I can tell
 
04:08:55.070 --> 04:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
you that
 
04:08:56.990 --> 04:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
um prior to being in my current role I
 
04:08:57.950 --> 04:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
served in the higher education
 
04:09:01.070 --> 04:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
commission for 10 years and I never
 
04:09:05.150 --> 04:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
saw us apply for except a grant at the
 
04:09:06.530 --> 04:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
commission level
 
04:09:08.510 --> 04:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
so I suspect it's just again recognize
 
04:09:10.189 --> 04:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
the reality that the commission doesn't
 
04:09:12.530 --> 04:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
do that
 
04:09:15.889 --> 04:09:15.899 align:start position:0%
um you know follow-up on yes on that
 
04:09:15.899 --> 04:09:16.670 align:start position:0%
um you know follow-up on yes on that
um

04:09:16.670 --> 04:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
I I I I appreciate the um the fact that
 
04:09:26.750 --> 04:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
maybe we we the the the prime sponsor
 
04:09:31.250 --> 04:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
and and your testimony is is it's it's
 
04:09:34.070 --> 04:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
not a definitive know the commission
 
04:09:37.370 --> 04:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that and it's never done that
 
04:09:37.380 --> 04:09:38.210 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that and it's never done that
um

04:09:38.210 --> 04:09:38.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:40.429 --> 04:09:40.439 align:start position:0%
um but I I think before we go about
 
04:09:43.790 --> 04:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
eliminating something like that we'd
 
04:09:46.370 --> 04:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that
 
04:09:49.309 --> 04:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
um I mean I I guess that you know would
 
04:09:53.870 --> 04:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
it be possible for you to produce a um a
 
04:09:58.010 --> 04:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
report on what grants the commission has
 
04:10:01.729 --> 04:10:01.739 align:start position:0%
applied for and you know what funds it
 
04:10:04.550 --> 04:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
has expended over the last decade just
 
04:10:08.150 --> 04:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
so that we can make sure that that
 
04:10:08.160 --> 04:10:08.710 align:start position:0%
so that we can make sure that that
um

04:10:08.710 --> 04:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:12.469 --> 04:10:12.479 align:start position:0%
an organ a non-profit organization in
 
04:10:14.929 --> 04:10:14.939 align:start position:0%
the state is all of a sudden
 
04:10:18.769 --> 04:10:18.779 align:start position:0%
um losing its um it's I mean I'm you
 
04:10:20.510 --> 04:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
know and there's lots of non-profit
 
04:10:22.490 --> 04:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
organizations in the state is that that
 
04:10:24.889 --> 04:10:24.899 align:start position:0%
it's losing its um
 
04:10:26.210 --> 04:10:26.220 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
04:10:28.330 --> 04:10:28.340 align:start position:0%
um you know funding
 
04:10:31.729 --> 04:10:31.739 align:start position:0%
I happy to produce a report I was named
 
04:10:34.490 --> 04:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
to the higher ed Commission in 2007 and
 
04:10:36.110 --> 04:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
when I came to the department in 2018
 
04:10:38.269 --> 04:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
resigned my position on the commission
 
04:10:43.090 --> 04:10:43.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:47.410 --> 04:10:47.420 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to put that in writing yeah
 
04:10:49.969 --> 04:10:49.979 align:start position:0%
if you can run a report from whatever
 
04:10:54.170 --> 04:10:54.180 align:start position:0%
the you know yeah yeah but yeah um no I
 
04:10:56.809 --> 04:10:56.819 align:start position:0%
I understand I suspect as well the way
 
04:10:59.150 --> 04:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
that that's written may be an artifact
 
04:11:01.490 --> 04:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
of potentially decades ago when the
 
04:11:03.170 --> 04:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
commission was set up okay I mean the
 
04:11:05.330 --> 04:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
commission goes back to the 1960s it
 
04:11:06.710 --> 04:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
used to be the post-secondary education
 
04:11:08.030 --> 04:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
commission and then it became the IRA
 
04:11:08.040 --> 04:11:09.229 align:start position:0%
commission and then it became the IRA
commission

04:11:09.229 --> 04:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:11:09.239 --> 04:11:11.090 align:start position:0%
commission
um

04:11:11.090 --> 04:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:13.309 --> 04:11:13.319 align:start position:0%
so I again I don't know where the
 
04:11:14.870 --> 04:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
language came from the strikethrough but
 
04:11:16.070 --> 04:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to just want to make sure
 
04:11:18.349 --> 04:11:18.359 align:start position:0%
we've got a clean definitive answer that
 
04:11:20.210 --> 04:11:20.220 align:start position:0%
we're not you know that there's nothing
 
04:11:23.030 --> 04:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
unintentional uh happening from this
 
04:11:25.550 --> 04:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I think we need to go back you
 
04:11:28.729 --> 04:11:28.739 align:start position:0%
know remember Ed McKay yeah
 
04:11:31.090 --> 04:11:31.100 align:start position:0%
but it dates back to him
 
04:11:35.330 --> 04:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
but okay uh any further questions uh Mr
 
04:11:35.340 --> 04:11:38.469 align:start position:0%
but okay uh any further questions uh Mr
Appleby

04:11:38.469 --> 04:11:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:40.790 --> 04:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay thank you
 
04:11:40.800 --> 04:11:41.750 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay thank you
everyone

04:11:41.750 --> 04:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
04:11:44.990 --> 04:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh okay are there any other pink slips
 
04:11:53.269 --> 04:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:53.279 --> 04:11:59.330 align:start position:0%
 
.

04:11:59.330 --> 04:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:59.340 --> 04:12:00.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:12:00.650 --> 04:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:02.689 --> 04:12:02.699 align:start position:0%
I use my mic
 
04:12:05.750 --> 04:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
so I noticed that
 
04:12:08.510 --> 04:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
wording in the two bills that we've that
 
04:12:11.330 --> 04:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
you've just testified on is slightly
 
04:12:13.010 --> 04:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
different one is equal to at least 10
 
04:12:14.870 --> 04:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
percent of the annual gross tuition in
 
04:12:17.330 --> 04:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
the year the bond is secured and the
 
04:12:18.830 --> 04:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
other one is equal to at least 10
 
04:12:21.170 --> 04:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
percent of the annual burst tuition for
 
04:12:23.150 --> 04:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
the current Academic Year
 
04:12:26.990 --> 04:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
and my question is is one preferable to
 
04:12:29.929 --> 04:12:29.939 align:start position:0%
the other and if we pass both of them
 
04:12:33.830 --> 04:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
are they going to conflict or
 
04:12:35.870 --> 04:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
I mean we got to deal with these two
 
04:12:38.809 --> 04:12:38.819 align:start position:0%
bills right and so how do we deal with
 
04:12:40.370 --> 04:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
them that I guess what is your
 
04:12:40.380 --> 04:12:42.290 align:start position:0%
them that I guess what is your
recommendation

04:12:42.290 --> 04:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
04:12:47.750 --> 04:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:49.550 --> 04:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:12:52.910 --> 04:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
um I would defer to the language of
 
04:12:55.610 --> 04:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
um hb155
 
04:12:57.889 --> 04:12:57.899 align:start position:0%
for uh for the academic year because
 
04:12:59.929 --> 04:12:59.939 align:start position:0%
we're trying to protect the students in
 
04:13:02.630 --> 04:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
the current Academic Year so thank you
 
04:13:04.429 --> 04:13:04.439 align:start position:0%
very much thank you
 
04:13:06.410 --> 04:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:13:09.349 --> 04:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
yes represent Cornell Thank you isn't
 
04:13:11.750 --> 04:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
sonua a for-profit college
 
04:13:13.910 --> 04:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
no no Southern Hampshire University is a
 
04:13:16.969 --> 04:13:16.979 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit institution okay our last
 
04:13:19.370 --> 04:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
um for-profit institution I don't know
 
04:13:21.290 --> 04:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
who closed First Mount Washington
 
04:13:23.630 --> 04:13:23.640 align:start position:0%
College or Daniel Webster college but
 
04:13:25.429 --> 04:13:25.439 align:start position:0%
before the both of those those are our
 
04:13:27.170 --> 04:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
last two and they were both for-profit
 
04:13:28.670 --> 04:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
as they were bought by out of state
 
04:13:30.830 --> 04:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
for-profit institutions
 
04:13:30.840 --> 04:13:35.530 align:start position:0%
for-profit institutions
foreign

04:13:35.530 --> 04:13:35.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:39.290 --> 04:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
okay further questions thank you very
 
04:13:43.750 --> 04:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:46.550 --> 04:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's hard to believe that dartmouth's
 
04:13:51.889 --> 04:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:53.510 --> 04:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:13:53.520 --> 04:13:54.590 align:start position:0%
all right
um

04:13:54.590 --> 04:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:56.870 --> 04:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
no more pink hearts than that so we're
 
04:14:05.150 --> 04:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:14.330 --> 04:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:16.130 --> 04:14:16.140 align:start position:0%
okay we have about a 15 minute break
 
04:14:17.630 --> 04:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
here the other one's scheduled to start
 
04:14:20.269 --> 04:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
at two o'clock yeah so we're gonna have
 
04:14:24.950 --> 04:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:44.050 --> 04:31:44.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:46.610 --> 04:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
and thank you for having me I miss you
 
04:31:46.620 --> 04:31:47.510 align:start position:0%
and thank you for having me I miss you
guys

04:31:47.510 --> 04:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
guys
 
04:31:50.149 --> 04:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
so my name is representative Deb Hobson
 
04:31:52.130 --> 04:31:52.140 align:start position:0%
and I represent Rockingham County
 
04:31:55.429 --> 04:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
District 14. so I was asked to bring
 
04:31:57.889 --> 04:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
this measure uh by one of my
 
04:31:59.990 --> 04:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
constituents and unfortunately they
 
04:32:02.090 --> 04:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
couldn't join me today
 
04:32:04.610 --> 04:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
um so I'm hoping that this measure will
 
04:32:06.710 --> 04:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
be a simple change to an existing
 
04:32:08.929 --> 04:32:08.939 align:start position:0%
statute but make a profound difference
 
04:32:10.910 --> 04:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
in the lives of students across New
 
04:32:14.210 --> 04:32:14.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire changing the term encourage in
 
04:32:20.510 --> 04:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
RSA 189 colon 11-c to require
 
04:32:22.790 --> 04:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
um so how many times have you all been
 
04:32:25.490 --> 04:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
surprised by a youngster that um can't
 
04:32:27.349 --> 04:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
read a greeting card from their
 
04:32:32.149 --> 04:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
grandmother or a note from a manager and
 
04:32:35.149 --> 04:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
so I as I was doing some research on
 
04:32:37.969 --> 04:32:37.979 align:start position:0%
this bill I was really surprised to
 
04:32:40.870 --> 04:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
learn how much cursive handwriting helps
 
04:32:43.990 --> 04:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
all kinds of learning disabilities
 
04:32:46.969 --> 04:32:46.979 align:start position:0%
it's in essence like learning a new
 
04:32:46.979 --> 04:32:48.429 align:start position:0%
it's in essence like learning a new
language

04:32:48.429 --> 04:32:48.439 align:start position:0%
language
 
04:32:53.630 --> 04:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
and uh the PBS news hour I will hand out
 
04:32:56.330 --> 04:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
this testimony at the conclusion of my
 
04:32:59.450 --> 04:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
speaking PBS NewsHour interviewed a
 
04:33:01.370 --> 04:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
ninth grade student that was diagnosed
 
04:33:04.250 --> 04:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
with dyslexia after struggling for 10
 
04:33:06.529 --> 04:33:06.539 align:start position:0%
years at school cursive writing
 
04:33:08.330 --> 04:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
exercises may have helped this student
 
04:33:10.551 --> 04:33:10.561 align:start position:0%
by integrating the hand-eye coordination
 
04:33:13.631 --> 04:33:13.641 align:start position:0%
and fine motor skills functional MRIs
 
04:33:16.910 --> 04:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
show us show a stronger Association for
 
04:33:18.349 --> 04:33:18.359 align:start position:0%
learning and memory when hands are
 
04:33:21.109 --> 04:33:21.119 align:start position:0%
involved another quote from Minds in
 
04:33:23.269 --> 04:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
motion a state that cursive writing
 
04:33:25.609 --> 04:33:25.619 align:start position:0%
creates neural Pathways required to
 
04:33:27.410 --> 04:33:27.420 align:start position:0%

socialization
 
04:33:37.010 --> 04:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
for example taking notes helps students
 
04:33:38.689 --> 04:33:38.699 align:start position:0%
facilitate deeper and more critical
 
04:33:40.970 --> 04:33:40.980 align:start position:0%
thinking and kids assimilate the content
 
04:33:43.070 --> 04:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
and remember the content better and I
 
04:33:44.689 --> 04:33:44.699 align:start position:0%
can attest because that process works
 
04:33:46.449 --> 04:33:46.459 align:start position:0%
for me
 
04:33:49.730 --> 04:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
Psychology today October 2020 indicates
 
04:33:51.709 --> 04:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
that there is accumulating evidence that
 
04:33:53.689 --> 04:33:53.699 align:start position:0%
not learning cursive handwriting May
 
04:33:56.449 --> 04:33:56.459 align:start position:0%
hinder the brain's Optimum potential to
 
04:33:58.070 --> 04:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
learn and remember
 
04:34:00.830 --> 04:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
a study out of Norway
 
04:34:04.369 --> 04:34:04.379 align:start position:0%
used high density EEG to monitor the
 
04:34:06.230 --> 04:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
brain's electrical activity when
 
04:34:08.689 --> 04:34:08.699 align:start position:0%
students use keyboards cursive writing
 
04:34:11.390 --> 04:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
and drawing visual visually presented

04:34:17.810 --> 04:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
pen paper and pencil data analysis shows
 
04:34:19.490 --> 04:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
that cursive handwriting primed the

brain for learning by synchronizing
 
04:34:23.390 --> 04:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
brain waves and stimulating more
 
04:34:26.029 --> 04:34:26.039 align:start position:0%
Electric electrical activity in the
 
04:34:28.070 --> 04:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
brain's parietal lobe and central region
 
04:34:30.349 --> 04:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
this provides the brain with optimal
 
04:34:33.051 --> 04:34:33.061 align:start position:0%
conditions for learning cursive writing
 
04:34:34.730 --> 04:34:34.740 align:start position:0%
activates a unique
 
04:34:37.250 --> 04:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
reading circuit in the brain so the
 
04:34:39.709 --> 04:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
parietal lobe that gets stimulated with
 
04:34:42.289 --> 04:34:42.299 align:start position:0%
cursive writing interprets visual
 
04:34:44.689 --> 04:34:44.699 align:start position:0%
information retains short-term memory
 
04:34:47.949 --> 04:34:47.959 align:start position:0%
senses temperature changes through touch
 
04:34:51.470 --> 04:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
helps control language mathematical
 
04:34:54.769 --> 04:34:54.779 align:start position:0%
problem solving skills these seem to be
 
04:34:57.650 --> 04:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
really helpful with some of the learning
 
04:35:00.230 --> 04:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
loss that our students have encountered
 
04:35:02.390 --> 04:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
one scientist said that pen and paper
 
04:35:05.929 --> 04:35:05.939 align:start position:0%
gives the brain more hooks in quotes to
 
04:35:07.849 --> 04:35:07.859 align:start position:0%
hang on to your memory your memories
 
04:35:10.551 --> 04:35:10.561 align:start position:0%
onto a lot of senses are activated by
 
04:35:12.949 --> 04:35:12.959 align:start position:0%
pressing the paper the pen onto the
 
04:35:14.929 --> 04:35:14.939 align:start position:0%
paper seeing letters you write and
 
04:35:16.670 --> 04:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
hearing the sound you make while writing
 
04:35:20.510 --> 04:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
these sense experiences create contact
 
04:35:23.150 --> 04:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
between different parts of the brain and
 
04:35:25.429 --> 04:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
open the brain up for learning the
 
04:35:27.890 --> 04:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
School Board Association and the
 
04:35:29.810 --> 04:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
superintendents Association this morning
 
04:35:32.510 --> 04:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
testified that this might be considered
 
04:35:34.970 --> 04:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
curriculum bill but this measure is
 
04:35:37.551 --> 04:35:37.561 align:start position:0%
already in statute and is simply a
 
04:35:40.029 --> 04:35:40.039 align:start position:0%
change from encourage to require
 
04:35:42.470 --> 04:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
districts that are that are already
 
04:35:44.330 --> 04:35:44.340 align:start position:0%
providing this program I would imagine
 
04:35:47.410 --> 04:35:47.420 align:start position:0%
they need not change their practices
 
04:35:51.051 --> 04:35:51.061 align:start position:0%
but encourage versus require means that
 
04:35:53.029 --> 04:35:53.039 align:start position:0%
some students might be getting this
 
04:35:55.551 --> 04:35:55.561 align:start position:0%
instruction and some might not
 
04:35:57.949 --> 04:35:57.959 align:start position:0%
um so that is the testimony I have and I
 
04:35:59.269 --> 04:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's any questions I'll
 
04:36:01.010 --> 04:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
try to answer them thank you very much
 
04:36:04.310 --> 04:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative Hobson represent Lucas
 
04:36:06.830 --> 04:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:36:08.689 --> 04:36:08.699 align:start position:0%
um I was talking to some people this
 
04:36:10.609 --> 04:36:10.619 align:start position:0%
morning and the other day who insisted
 
04:36:12.410 --> 04:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
that all these things are being taught
 
04:36:15.470 --> 04:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
to all of our students both the cursive
 
04:36:17.570 --> 04:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
writing and the math are being taught to
 
04:36:20.810 --> 04:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
all of our students today and so I'm
 
04:36:22.910 --> 04:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
asking do you have any examples or do
 
04:36:24.590 --> 04:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
you know of cases where that's not being
 
04:36:24.600 --> 04:36:25.609 align:start position:0%
you know of cases where that's not being
done

04:36:25.609 --> 04:36:25.619 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:36:30.109 --> 04:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
uh well I do have personal experience
 
04:36:32.330 --> 04:36:32.340 align:start position:0%
um with students that are not
 
04:36:36.170 --> 04:36:36.180 align:start position:0%
um sorry not doing uh not able to read
 
04:36:38.689 --> 04:36:38.699 align:start position:0%
cursive but I I do not know in my own
 
04:36:40.789 --> 04:36:40.799 align:start position:0%
school if that's being taught I think
 
04:36:42.349 --> 04:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
some other people are going to testify
 
04:36:46.010 --> 04:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:48.650 --> 04:36:48.660 align:start position:0%
further question represent woodcock
 
04:36:50.869 --> 04:36:50.879 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh welcome back
 
04:36:53.570 --> 04:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
thank you good to see you
 
04:36:53.580 --> 04:36:58.131 align:start position:0%
thank you good to see you
um

04:36:58.131 --> 04:36:58.141 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:00.289 --> 04:37:00.299 align:start position:0%
um as you can see I still use it nobody
 
04:37:02.570 --> 04:37:02.580 align:start position:0%
can read it uh sometimes they can't read
 
04:37:05.390 --> 04:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
an hour later uh so the Reinhardt method
 
04:37:07.490 --> 04:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
is not working well for me I think we
 
04:37:09.170 --> 04:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
can help you yeah thank you appreciate
 
04:37:09.180 --> 04:37:10.070 align:start position:0%
can help you yeah thank you appreciate
that

04:37:10.070 --> 04:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:37:11.869 --> 04:37:11.879 align:start position:0%
um but beyond those concerned about the
 
04:37:14.810 --> 04:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
the multiplication tables uh has this
 
04:37:16.849 --> 04:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
been aligned with any of the current
 
04:37:18.949 --> 04:37:18.959 align:start position:0%
elementary school curriculums have we
 
04:37:21.109 --> 04:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
talked the elementary school curriculum
 
04:37:23.769 --> 04:37:23.779 align:start position:0%
committees as it involved in the the the
 
04:37:26.750 --> 04:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh doe content piece for elementary
 
04:37:29.750 --> 04:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
schools I'm thinking I I can't imagine
 
04:37:31.970 --> 04:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
that the multiplication tables aren't
 
04:37:34.910 --> 04:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
pot and parcel uh uh what the youngsters
 
04:37:37.250 --> 04:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
do coming up as part of the elementary
 
04:37:37.260 --> 04:37:38.990 align:start position:0%
do coming up as part of the elementary
math

04:37:38.990 --> 04:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
math
 
04:37:41.769 --> 04:37:41.779 align:start position:0%
I think the part that
 
04:37:44.029 --> 04:37:44.039 align:start position:0%
concerning the fact that the requirement
 
04:37:47.810 --> 04:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
of the memorization of that and what if
 
04:37:49.429 --> 04:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
that's the difference I just I don't
 
04:37:51.170 --> 04:37:51.180 align:start position:0%
know if you've talked it I thought it
 
04:37:52.849 --> 04:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
was being done uh and I just didn't know
 
04:37:55.010 --> 04:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
if you had a chance to in this bill to
 
04:37:58.070 --> 04:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
talk to doe or Elementary theology
 
04:38:00.230 --> 04:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
Association yeah um thank you for the
 
04:38:02.090 --> 04:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
question and I did speak with
 
04:38:04.551 --> 04:38:04.561 align:start position:0%
commissioner edelblue he has provided
 
04:38:08.269 --> 04:38:08.279 align:start position:0%
technical advisories on math facts I was
 
04:38:10.609 --> 04:38:10.619 align:start position:0%
not able to get to that before testimony
 
04:38:10.619 --> 04:38:11.990 align:start position:0%
not able to get to that before testimony
today

04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:38:12.000 --> 04:38:12.709 align:start position:0%
today
um

04:38:12.709 --> 04:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:16.070 --> 04:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
so I I don't really have
 
04:38:18.109 --> 04:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
I guess concrete evidence of the
 
04:38:20.090 --> 04:38:20.100 align:start position:0%
multiplication tables but they're in the
 
04:38:22.429 --> 04:38:22.439 align:start position:0%
same statute so that's why it's we're
 
04:38:25.010 --> 04:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
being talked about today okay and one of
 
04:38:26.990 --> 04:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
the maybe one of the following and just
 
04:38:29.689 --> 04:38:29.699 align:start position:0%
um back to the question I made uh
 
04:38:29.699 --> 04:38:31.010 align:start position:0%
um back to the question I made uh
uh

04:38:31.010 --> 04:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:38:33.230 --> 04:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
not the curse of itself
 
04:38:36.109 --> 04:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
but the fact that if we integrate once
 
04:38:37.429 --> 04:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
again that should be a local piece but
 
04:38:40.310 --> 04:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
if we do that it clearly is going to be
 
04:38:43.670 --> 04:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
an identifiable cost of that and that
 
04:38:45.650 --> 04:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
youngsters now don't have pencils and
 
04:38:47.750 --> 04:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
paper and crayons we have the backpack
 
04:38:49.250 --> 04:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
movements before we start every year
 
04:38:51.349 --> 04:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
yeah you can't go to school and find
 
04:38:53.570 --> 04:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
these types of things for kids like we
 
04:38:55.849 --> 04:38:55.859 align:start position:0%
used to in our day so it's going to be
 
04:38:57.230 --> 04:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not going to say it's
 
04:38:58.970 --> 04:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
extraordinary no idea but the clearly is
 
04:39:01.310 --> 04:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
going to be a cost for Schools starting
 
04:39:02.510 --> 04:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
to which they probably should have been
 
04:39:04.429 --> 04:39:04.439 align:start position:0%
doing all along they're providing
 
04:39:06.949 --> 04:39:06.959 align:start position:0%
writing supplies for youngsters as they
 
04:39:08.750 --> 04:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
go through the system as a pot and
 
04:39:10.369 --> 04:39:10.379 align:start position:0%
parcel of this carefus piece so it would
 
04:39:13.910 --> 04:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
be some some additional cost there okay
 
04:39:15.590 --> 04:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned it's not there now there's
 
04:39:18.470 --> 04:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
no paper so is that a question I'm sorry
 
04:39:19.970 --> 04:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
yes got a question so have you looked
 
04:39:21.769 --> 04:39:21.779 align:start position:0%
into that is in terms of one of the
 
04:39:23.990 --> 04:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
extenuating circumstances of putting
 
04:39:26.209 --> 04:39:26.219 align:start position:0%
cursive into the requirement
 
04:39:29.570 --> 04:39:29.580 align:start position:0%
uh you know I I thought about that I
 
04:39:32.449 --> 04:39:32.459 align:start position:0%
can't say that um
 
04:39:34.910 --> 04:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
I thought the fiscal impact would be
 
04:39:34.920 --> 04:39:36.830 align:start position:0%
I thought the fiscal impact would be
significant

04:39:36.830 --> 04:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
significant
 
04:39:36.840 --> 04:39:38.090 align:start position:0%
significant
um

04:39:38.090 --> 04:39:38.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:40.670 --> 04:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
pretty sure schools have pencils and
 
04:39:43.190 --> 04:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
papers and crayons but
 
04:39:44.930 --> 04:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
um I think that's probably something
 
04:39:48.350 --> 04:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
that can be teased out in this committee
 
04:39:50.448 --> 04:39:50.458 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:39:53.810 --> 04:39:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:55.550 --> 04:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:39:57.590 --> 04:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative for presenting this bill
 
04:40:00.050 --> 04:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
you're preaching to the choir
 
04:40:03.410 --> 04:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
um my concern is I had a similar concern
 
04:40:06.530 --> 04:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
this morning with the communism bill
 
04:40:06.540 --> 04:40:07.730 align:start position:0%
this morning with the communism bill
um

04:40:07.730 --> 04:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:11.448 --> 04:40:11.458 align:start position:0%
instruction a certain vagueness to
 
04:40:13.250 --> 04:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
provide instruction at least that one
 
04:40:15.110 --> 04:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
said something about 60 Minutes there
 
04:40:17.930 --> 04:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
was some attainable
 
04:40:21.650 --> 04:40:21.660 align:start position:0%
goal here it seems so vague that
 
04:40:23.750 --> 04:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know a teacher could be like not
 
04:40:25.368 --> 04:40:25.378 align:start position:0%
really in agreement that this is
 
04:40:26.990 --> 04:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
something and then five minutes be like
 
04:40:28.970 --> 04:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
oh we talked about cursive yeah you know
 
04:40:30.830 --> 04:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
what I mean so that was just a concern I
 
04:40:32.030 --> 04:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring up and I didn't know if
 
04:40:35.150 --> 04:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
you had any comments on clarifying this
 
04:40:38.090 --> 04:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
yeah so I guess my uh thank you for the
 
04:40:41.150 --> 04:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
question and I guess my answer would be
 
04:40:44.868 --> 04:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
um as a state member or from the state's
 
04:40:44.878 --> 04:40:46.030 align:start position:0%
um as a state member or from the state's
perspective

04:40:46.030 --> 04:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
04:40:49.250 --> 04:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
requiring it to be taught the local
 
04:40:52.368 --> 04:40:52.378 align:start position:0%
control piece would allow the teachers
 
04:40:55.250 --> 04:40:55.260 align:start position:0%
and the administrators to decide
 
04:40:59.208 --> 04:40:59.218 align:start position:0%
what program to use how to do it so I
 
04:41:01.788 --> 04:41:01.798 align:start position:0%
don't know that we're just saying that
 
04:41:04.010 --> 04:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
it's an important piece and that it
 
04:41:06.350 --> 04:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
should be required
 
04:41:08.570 --> 04:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
so the local control piece can stay
 
04:41:10.730 --> 04:41:10.740 align:start position:0%
right where it is as far as you know
 
04:41:13.670 --> 04:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
again we can talk about in committee how
 
04:41:16.550 --> 04:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
to what that looks like
 
04:41:17.868 --> 04:41:17.878 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that answers your
 
04:41:21.170 --> 04:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
question or not sorry if we'll go to
 
04:41:23.270 --> 04:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
this side uh represent Luna
 
04:41:25.670 --> 04:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you very
 
04:41:27.650 --> 04:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
much representative Hobson for uh for
 
04:41:29.208 --> 04:41:29.218 align:start position:0%
joining us today
 
04:41:32.690 --> 04:41:32.700 align:start position:0%
um you know we've uh I think a lot of us
 
04:41:34.850 --> 04:41:34.860 align:start position:0%
obviously have been on school boards and
 
04:41:38.510 --> 04:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
and we've had you know kids our own kids
 
04:41:43.128 --> 04:41:43.138 align:start position:0%
in in public schools and uh and uh and
 
04:41:45.830 --> 04:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
so you know we've we've we've conducted
 
04:41:48.110 --> 04:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
ourselves in a variety of different
 
04:41:50.990 --> 04:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
capacities either as parents of students
 
04:41:53.690 --> 04:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
or school board members or
 
04:41:57.230 --> 04:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
um or you know State reps being in our
 
04:41:59.150 --> 04:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
communities talking with constituents
 
04:42:02.448 --> 04:42:02.458 align:start position:0%
and for sure we've all heard uh from a
 
04:42:04.430 --> 04:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
lot of people about
 
04:42:06.708 --> 04:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
um uh our schools and what we should be
 
04:42:09.470 --> 04:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
doing and concerns
 
04:42:11.930 --> 04:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
um and there's obviously you know we're
 
04:42:13.430 --> 04:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
going to be getting a pile of bills like
 
04:42:15.490 --> 04:42:15.500 align:start position:0%
this like we had last year
 
04:42:18.050 --> 04:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
regarding a lot of this stuff you know a
 
04:42:20.810 --> 04:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
lot of it will have to do with um you
 
04:42:22.730 --> 04:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
know uh you know diversity Equity
 
04:42:25.368 --> 04:42:25.378 align:start position:0%
inclusion a lot of it has to do with
 
04:42:27.530 --> 04:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
teaching credentials a lot of it has to
 
04:42:29.690 --> 04:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
do with a lot of other things but where
 
04:42:32.090 --> 04:42:32.100 align:start position:0%
in your mind does cursive
 
04:42:36.590 --> 04:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
um fit in this um you know uh I guess
 
04:42:39.890 --> 04:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
scope of uh of you know things that
 
04:42:42.410 --> 04:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
you've heard from from people in terms
 
04:42:44.510 --> 04:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
of what what schools should be doing
 
04:42:46.550 --> 04:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh well like I said I'm bringing this
 
04:42:48.708 --> 04:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
forward on behalf of a constituent I
 
04:42:51.830 --> 04:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
have I hear it constantly that schools
 
04:42:53.208 --> 04:42:53.218 align:start position:0%
should be doing this school should be
 
04:42:54.590 --> 04:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
04:42:57.708 --> 04:42:57.718 align:start position:0%
um so the statute exists I think whoever
 
04:42:59.330 --> 04:42:59.340 align:start position:0%
put it there thinks that it's an
 
04:43:01.610 --> 04:43:01.620 align:start position:0%
important piece
 
04:43:03.250 --> 04:43:03.260 align:start position:0%
um and I think that if we can help
 
04:43:06.830 --> 04:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
offset some struggles for kids
 
04:43:09.770 --> 04:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
um I think that's a good thing
 
04:43:11.930 --> 04:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
um trying to remember the other parts of
 
04:43:15.230 --> 04:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
your question is this important
 
04:43:17.628 --> 04:43:17.638 align:start position:0%
um anything that can
 
04:43:21.890 --> 04:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
make an experience for children happier
 
04:43:25.490 --> 04:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
at school and help them in their
 
04:43:27.830 --> 04:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
learning I think is worthwhile
 
04:43:30.948 --> 04:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
so so follow up on that yes
 
04:43:34.368 --> 04:43:34.378 align:start position:0%
um would it um so so you know what's in
 
04:43:35.810 --> 04:43:35.820 align:start position:0%
the statute is very different than
 
04:43:37.610 --> 04:43:37.620 align:start position:0%
what's what you've proposed here because
 
04:43:39.410 --> 04:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
what you're proposing is changing a
 
04:43:41.750 --> 04:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
statute that is advisory and turning it
 
04:43:43.430 --> 04:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
into a mandate
 
04:43:45.708 --> 04:43:45.718 align:start position:0%
um but to the point that that you make
 
04:43:49.788 --> 04:43:49.798 align:start position:0%
and I have no reason to um to to
 
04:43:52.730 --> 04:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
um to to take exception to this for
 
04:43:54.830 --> 04:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
example I think you use the um an
 
04:43:58.550 --> 04:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
example of a student with dyslexia
 
04:44:01.368 --> 04:44:01.378 align:start position:0%
um made you know see some some
 
04:44:04.910 --> 04:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
improvement uh with with cursive uh but
 
04:44:09.490 --> 04:44:09.500 align:start position:0%
would that prohibit a um a student's IEP
 
04:44:12.830 --> 04:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
from from having cursive in there even
 
04:44:16.010 --> 04:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
though not every student in the in the
 
04:44:18.530 --> 04:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
school would be learning cursive
 
04:44:20.628 --> 04:44:20.638 align:start position:0%
oh I don't think I understand your
 
04:44:23.570 --> 04:44:23.580 align:start position:0%
question uh reply now so could could the
 
04:44:25.368 --> 04:44:25.378 align:start position:0%
could the could the student with
 
04:44:27.650 --> 04:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
dyslexia have in their individualized
 
04:44:29.868 --> 04:44:29.878 align:start position:0%
educational program
 
04:44:33.770 --> 04:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
um a um uh a requirement on the on the
 
04:44:36.708 --> 04:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
school to um to help instruct that
 
04:44:39.830 --> 04:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
student in cursive without requiring the
 
04:44:41.810 --> 04:44:41.820 align:start position:0%
school to instruct every student in
 
04:44:41.820 --> 04:44:43.128 align:start position:0%
school to instruct every student in
cursive

04:44:43.128 --> 04:44:43.138 align:start position:0%
cursive
 
04:44:45.470 --> 04:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know what I probably am not
 
04:44:47.330 --> 04:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
qualified to answer that question
 
04:44:49.910 --> 04:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
um there is someone that's testifying
 
04:44:51.650 --> 04:44:51.660 align:start position:0%
um after me that probably would be
 
04:44:53.810 --> 04:44:53.820 align:start position:0%
better suited we'll take it upside great
 
04:44:55.368 --> 04:44:55.378 align:start position:0%
okay thanks
 
04:44:57.590 --> 04:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
04:45:00.890 --> 04:45:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:03.050 --> 04:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you representative
 
04:45:05.390 --> 04:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
Hobson and it's good to see you back you
 
04:45:06.830 --> 04:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
too um
 
04:45:10.610 --> 04:45:10.620 align:start position:0%
would you be uh willing to extend this
 
04:45:12.770 --> 04:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
through an amendment to uh apply to
 
04:45:15.470 --> 04:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools as well
 
04:45:15.480 --> 04:45:16.610 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools as well
um

04:45:16.610 --> 04:45:16.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:18.890 --> 04:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
well charter schools are public schools
 
04:45:21.410 --> 04:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
but they're not they don't follow any of
 
04:45:23.510 --> 04:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
the regulations unless specifically
 
04:45:28.128 --> 04:45:28.138 align:start position:0%
stated in the regulation okay uh
 
04:45:30.590 --> 04:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
I I don't know
 
04:45:33.050 --> 04:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
um I don't see why that would be a
 
04:45:35.990 --> 04:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
detraction I think it would if it helps
 
04:45:39.890 --> 04:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:41.690 --> 04:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:45:44.628 --> 04:45:44.638 align:start position:0%
yes represent dry thank you Mr chairman
 
04:45:46.910 --> 04:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative Hobson I just had a
 
04:45:49.190 --> 04:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
quick question about this letter from
 
04:45:51.890 --> 04:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
it's not signed yeah I'm sorry about
 
04:45:53.628 --> 04:45:53.638 align:start position:0%
that I was having some trouble getting
 
04:45:57.288 --> 04:45:57.298 align:start position:0%
it printed that was from uh a teacher
 
04:46:01.250 --> 04:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
that um that I had interviewed so my
 
04:46:03.530 --> 04:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
question is she mentions
 
04:46:06.170 --> 04:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
concerning math that there are some
 
04:46:08.330 --> 04:46:08.340 align:start position:0%
students that need different approaches
 
04:46:10.970 --> 04:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
to multiplication yeah so I'm wondering
 
04:46:13.190 --> 04:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
how they get incorporated into something
 
04:46:15.288 --> 04:46:15.298 align:start position:0%
that's requiring multiplication tables
 
04:46:18.170 --> 04:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
if they need a different approach well
 
04:46:20.570 --> 04:46:20.580 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question and like I
 
04:46:23.090 --> 04:46:23.100 align:start position:0%
mentioned there is some guidance from
 
04:46:25.550 --> 04:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and I think that's
 
04:46:27.230 --> 04:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
probably something that can be teased
 
04:46:30.708 --> 04:46:30.718 align:start position:0%
out in the bill I mean in committee
 
04:46:32.690 --> 04:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:46:34.430 --> 04:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative Woodcock even though
 
04:46:35.930 --> 04:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
I have two one for you and one for
 
04:46:37.490 --> 04:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
representative I'll start with you since
 
04:46:38.990 --> 04:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
you are the chairman
 
04:46:42.230 --> 04:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
um Rick was there a point in time when
 
04:46:44.570 --> 04:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
cursor was a required part of the
 
04:46:48.110 --> 04:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
curriculum way back you know well I I
 
04:46:50.330 --> 04:46:50.340 align:start position:0%
can tell you as my experience because I
 
04:46:53.510 --> 04:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
started out as a fourth grade teacher
 
04:46:56.090 --> 04:46:56.100 align:start position:0%
and cursive was taught through the
 
04:46:58.070 --> 04:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
spelling program we had and you wrote
 
04:46:59.810 --> 04:46:59.820 align:start position:0%
and we at the same time you got phonics
 
04:47:02.330 --> 04:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
out of it and you got other uh skills
 
04:47:04.070 --> 04:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
Associated so you were doing more than
 
04:47:07.368 --> 04:47:07.378 align:start position:0%
one thing at a time right my training on
 
04:47:10.128 --> 04:47:10.138 align:start position:0%
becoming a teacher was at Orono
 
04:47:13.670 --> 04:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
University of Maine yes sir and I came
 
04:47:16.250 --> 04:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
back for a certification or as a special
 
04:47:17.868 --> 04:47:17.878 align:start position:0%
student just become because my first
 
04:47:19.490 --> 04:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
degree was in geography and urban
 
04:47:22.850 --> 04:47:22.860 align:start position:0%
renewal and so I came back as a special
 
04:47:24.650 --> 04:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
teacher in elementary took another 30
 
04:47:24.660 --> 04:47:26.230 align:start position:0%
teacher in elementary took another 30
hours

04:47:26.230 --> 04:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
hours
 
04:47:30.170 --> 04:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
penmanship was a required course at that
 
04:47:32.390 --> 04:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
time as an elementary teacher
 
04:47:35.208 --> 04:47:35.218 align:start position:0%
and so I learned to use the zaner
 
04:47:37.850 --> 04:47:37.860 align:start position:0%
blowzer method some are using the Palmer
 
04:47:40.128 --> 04:47:40.138 align:start position:0%
method at the time but
 
04:47:42.410 --> 04:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
um it was something that I was required
 
04:47:44.690 --> 04:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
I remember that class well because the
 
04:47:47.570 --> 04:47:47.580 align:start position:0%
teacher at Orono said young man you come
 
04:47:50.390 --> 04:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
up and you write on the board and I did
 
04:47:52.490 --> 04:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
but I know what she was doing she was
 
04:47:54.110 --> 04:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
going to grade me based upon what I did
 
04:47:55.550 --> 04:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
then and what I did at the end of the
 
04:47:58.670 --> 04:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
course so of course you you know being a
 
04:48:00.530 --> 04:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
wise guy out of the military I just put
 
04:48:02.750 --> 04:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
anything on the board but it's important
 
04:48:04.910 --> 04:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
to believe that you can't believe that
 
04:48:08.930 --> 04:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
but I I I can tell you yes it was part
 
04:48:12.890 --> 04:48:12.900 align:start position:0%
of the required areas of study
 
04:48:15.530 --> 04:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
at the winter Winthrop Elementary School
 
04:48:19.150 --> 04:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
in Winthrop Maine New Hampshire
 
04:48:22.250 --> 04:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
I did not live I was brought up in
 
04:48:25.670 --> 04:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
Canada and then to Maine so okay um but
 
04:48:28.730 --> 04:48:28.740 align:start position:0%
all the classes throughout you know and
 
04:48:30.410 --> 04:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
of course then we didn't have we had
 
04:48:33.530 --> 04:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
type writers right right and so reports
 
04:48:35.628 --> 04:48:35.638 align:start position:0%
were handed in in cursive at the time
 
04:48:38.030 --> 04:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
okay thanks for the question thank you I
 
04:48:40.190 --> 04:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
had one for rubbing the popson
 
04:48:41.628 --> 04:48:41.638 align:start position:0%
um would you be amenable to splitting
 
04:48:44.270 --> 04:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
these between mathematics and cursive
 
04:48:45.770 --> 04:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
make it two bills
 
04:48:48.230 --> 04:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
make an amendment that has two bills but
 
04:48:51.410 --> 04:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
I see that I see the mathematics uh and
 
04:48:53.570 --> 04:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
the requirement for multiplication and
 
04:48:56.868 --> 04:48:56.878 align:start position:0%
the memorization and those as a totally
 
04:48:59.990 --> 04:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
different uh Bill uh and clearly totally
 
04:49:01.430 --> 04:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
different way to my support I thought
 
04:49:02.690 --> 04:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
the mice have one means anything for one
 
04:49:05.208 --> 04:49:05.218 align:start position:0%
person but I just think together they
 
04:49:07.310 --> 04:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
have less chance they do it divided so
 
04:49:09.110 --> 04:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
if you maybe consider that
 
04:49:10.670 --> 04:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
oh yeah thank you for the question and
 
04:49:10.680 --> 04:49:12.368 align:start position:0%
oh yeah thank you for the question and
sure

04:49:12.368 --> 04:49:12.378 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:49:15.948 --> 04:49:15.958 align:start position:0%
just as a note on that uh this is no
 
04:49:18.350 --> 04:49:18.360 align:start position:0%
longer representative Hobson's bill this
 
04:49:21.110 --> 04:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
is our bill so you have the opportunity
 
04:49:24.368 --> 04:49:24.378 align:start position:0%
to do that if you so desire to you know
 
04:49:27.350 --> 04:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
amend or scratch delete out and then
 
04:49:29.750 --> 04:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
keep part or modify one way or the other
 
04:49:31.788 --> 04:49:31.798 align:start position:0%
that's well I see she has two
 
04:49:34.430 --> 04:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
significant uh uh co-sponsors here on
 
04:49:35.448 --> 04:49:35.458 align:start position:0%
the bill in the room they could probably
 
04:49:42.230 --> 04:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:42.240 --> 04:49:43.788 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:49:43.788 --> 04:49:43.798 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:49:45.470 --> 04:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
okay if there are no further questions
 
04:49:47.270 --> 04:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
of reps and Hobbs and we have other
 
04:49:50.330 --> 04:49:50.340 align:start position:0%
people that are here Dr Michael uh
 
04:49:50.340 --> 04:49:51.650 align:start position:0%
people that are here Dr Michael uh
Gendry

04:49:51.650 --> 04:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
Gendry
 
04:49:51.660 --> 04:49:55.270 align:start position:0%
Gendry
g-e-n-d-r-e

04:49:55.270 --> 04:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:01.310 --> 04:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:03.288 --> 04:50:03.298 align:start position:0%
uh you have to press the button on the
 
04:50:05.990 --> 04:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
red button you know or yeah
 
04:50:08.750 --> 04:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
you just push down you'll see it come on
 
04:50:11.030 --> 04:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
yes my name is Michael Gendry I live in
 
04:50:13.010 --> 04:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
Northampton I'm actually on the school
 
04:50:14.990 --> 04:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
board in Northampton I've taught
 
04:50:18.590 --> 04:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
Philosophy for about 35 years in
 
04:50:18.600 --> 04:50:19.448 align:start position:0%
Philosophy for about 35 years in
Massachusetts

04:50:19.448 --> 04:50:19.458 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
04:50:22.788 --> 04:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
I can tell you I actually came to
 
04:50:26.810 --> 04:50:26.820 align:start position:0%
testify on the on the writing on the
 
04:50:28.788 --> 04:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
cursive part not so much on the
 
04:50:31.490 --> 04:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
multiplication table so I appreciate
 
04:50:34.190 --> 04:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
your your suggestion to keep something
 
04:50:34.200 --> 04:50:35.810 align:start position:0%
your your suggestion to keep something
going

04:50:35.810 --> 04:50:35.820 align:start position:0%
going
 
04:50:38.150 --> 04:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
um it's my it's been my experience that
 
04:50:41.030 --> 04:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
students cannot really read even in
 
04:50:43.190 --> 04:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
college cursive the vast majority
 
04:50:46.010 --> 04:50:46.020 align:start position:0%
perhaps at least that vast majority is
 
04:50:48.470 --> 04:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
too much but at least 40 to 50 percent
 
04:50:51.350 --> 04:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
of the students cannot read cursive and
 
04:50:52.910 --> 04:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
they're presented when they're presented
 
04:50:55.190 --> 04:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
with it they they blank out and and then
 
04:50:58.550 --> 04:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
they panic and therefore I've had to uh
 
04:51:01.610 --> 04:51:01.620 align:start position:0%
take some time extra time to in fact
 
04:51:04.368 --> 04:51:04.378 align:start position:0%
show them how it works and when I've
 
04:51:07.270 --> 04:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
done it like two or three times
 
04:51:10.010 --> 04:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
it took a number of hours but the
 
04:51:12.170 --> 04:51:12.180 align:start position:0%
students were very grateful that I spent
 
04:51:14.208 --> 04:51:14.218 align:start position:0%
the time and then they told me that they
 
04:51:17.208 --> 04:51:17.218 align:start position:0%
could use it if they learned how to now
 
04:51:19.910 --> 04:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
write in cursing as opposed to only read
 
04:51:22.250 --> 04:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
in cursive so there was two processes
 
04:51:24.590 --> 04:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
number one the reading cursive and then
 
04:51:27.350 --> 04:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
the second would be writing cursive and
 
04:51:29.628 --> 04:51:29.638 align:start position:0%
they appreciated the fact that if they
 
04:51:31.730 --> 04:51:31.740 align:start position:0%
went to the writing of cursive they
 
04:51:34.128 --> 04:51:34.138 align:start position:0%
would write this as a skill on their
 
04:51:36.350 --> 04:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
curriculum and when they applied for a
 
04:51:39.350 --> 04:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
job because in some cases the ability to
 
04:51:41.090 --> 04:51:41.100 align:start position:0%
write cursive actually makes a
 
04:51:43.730 --> 04:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
difference for getting a job
 
04:51:47.750 --> 04:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
so I can tell you that putting that in a
 
04:51:51.110 --> 04:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
bill and approving the bill moving from
 
04:51:54.470 --> 04:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
suggested to required could really
 
04:51:57.110 --> 04:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
facilitate that also for the acquisition
 
04:51:59.208 --> 04:51:59.218 align:start position:0%
of skills for students and I think I'd
 
04:52:01.430 --> 04:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
be very grateful to you all if that
 
04:52:01.440 --> 04:52:02.930 align:start position:0%
be very grateful to you all if that
happened

04:52:02.930 --> 04:52:02.940 align:start position:0%
happened
 
04:52:04.610 --> 04:52:04.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:52:06.170 --> 04:52:06.180 align:start position:0%
uh are you willing to take any questions
 
04:52:08.330 --> 04:52:08.340 align:start position:0%
sure are there any questions from the
 
04:52:08.340 --> 04:52:11.330 align:start position:0%
sure are there any questions from the
committee

04:52:11.330 --> 04:52:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:14.030 --> 04:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much oh
 
04:52:15.850 --> 04:52:15.860 align:start position:0%
okay yes
 
04:52:18.170 --> 04:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome and thank you
 
04:52:19.128 --> 04:52:19.138 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
04:52:21.708 --> 04:52:21.718 align:start position:0%
um in what capacity did you
 
04:52:23.810 --> 04:52:23.820 align:start position:0%
realized that students weren't unable to
 
04:52:27.230 --> 04:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
read the course as a teacher okay sure
 
04:52:30.230 --> 04:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
yeah in college so and did a follow-up
 
04:52:33.890 --> 04:52:33.900 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry so it did you write like
 
04:52:35.150 --> 04:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
comments on papers and they couldn't
 
04:52:37.310 --> 04:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
read them was that sort of yeah and I I
 
04:52:40.368 --> 04:52:40.378 align:start position:0%
had the students come over for uh during
 
04:52:42.230 --> 04:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
my office hours and then I taught them
 
04:52:44.090 --> 04:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
and that I showed them and that I gave
 
04:52:44.100 --> 04:52:45.230 align:start position:0%
and that I showed them and that I gave
them

04:52:45.230 --> 04:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:52:48.288 --> 04:52:48.298 align:start position:0%
um videos to to learn and to essentially
 
04:52:50.628 --> 04:52:50.638 align:start position:0%
be able to read once they were able to
 
04:52:52.128 --> 04:52:52.138 align:start position:0%
do that
 
04:52:54.350 --> 04:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
um two of them out of the three came to
 
04:52:57.288 --> 04:52:57.298 align:start position:0%
ask for how could they write and of
 
04:52:58.970 --> 04:52:58.980 align:start position:0%
course I said I'm not gonna be able to
 
04:53:01.070 --> 04:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
do that but I could tell you that there
 
04:53:03.350 --> 04:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
was an interest in in them learning how
 
04:53:05.868 --> 04:53:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:05.878 --> 04:53:07.070 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:53:07.070 --> 04:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:53:09.530 --> 04:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you I had a similar experience oh
 
04:53:11.330 --> 04:53:11.340 align:start position:0%
really thank you representative patnell
 
04:53:12.948 --> 04:53:12.958 align:start position:0%
do you have a question
 
04:53:14.930 --> 04:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair
 
04:53:17.750 --> 04:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
um in your opinion how challenging do
 
04:53:19.250 --> 04:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
you think these students found it to
 
04:53:21.650 --> 04:53:21.660 align:start position:0%
learn cursive essentially as adults as
 
04:53:23.750 --> 04:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to if they had learned it in
 
04:53:26.150 --> 04:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
first second third grade like most of us
 
04:53:29.330 --> 04:53:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:29.340 --> 04:53:31.128 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:53:31.128 --> 04:53:31.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:33.410 --> 04:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
04:53:38.628 --> 04:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
a sort of block for maybe an hour but
 
04:53:40.430 --> 04:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
then you know you just show them
 
04:53:43.670 --> 04:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
different words and and you help them at
 
04:53:45.410 --> 04:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
the beginning and then they oh yeah
 
04:53:47.690 --> 04:53:47.700 align:start position:0%
that's the G that's capital G which
 
04:53:50.810 --> 04:53:50.820 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like a cursive G
 
04:53:53.170 --> 04:53:53.180 align:start position:0%
um and they're like oh yeah okay I can
 
04:53:55.250 --> 04:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
you know they will memorize it and
 
04:53:57.230 --> 04:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
they'll be happy that they learned it
 
04:53:59.330 --> 04:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
and it's it's almost instant
 
04:54:01.850 --> 04:54:01.860 align:start position:0%
gratification on their part once they've
 
04:54:04.430 --> 04:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
acquired this uh the deciphering of this
 
04:54:08.090 --> 04:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
strange symbol they're very happy that
 
04:54:10.970 --> 04:54:10.980 align:start position:0%
they can do it from now on
 
04:54:12.650 --> 04:54:12.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:54:14.628 --> 04:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:54:19.070 --> 04:54:19.080 align:start position:0%

04:54:25.490 --> 04:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
is she here
 
04:54:33.430 --> 04:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:36.288 --> 04:54:36.298 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Lori ball I am a
 
04:54:38.448 --> 04:54:38.458 align:start position:0%
representative from District 25 which is

required to give you a little bit of my
 
04:54:52.128 --> 04:54:52.138 align:start position:0%
background I have been in education in
 
04:54:54.650 --> 04:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
some capacity for the last 30 years I've
 
04:54:54.660 --> 04:54:55.788 align:start position:0%
some capacity for the last 30 years I've
spent

04:54:55.788 --> 04:54:55.798 align:start position:0%
spent
 
04:54:58.910 --> 04:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
um 12 years teaching Middle School I'm
 
04:55:01.610 --> 04:55:01.620 align:start position:0%
certified in four areas of Education in
 
04:55:04.490 --> 04:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire one of which is a reading
 
04:55:07.128 --> 04:55:07.138 align:start position:0%
and writing specialist with an emphasis
 
04:55:09.948 --> 04:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
on teaching children with dyslexia
 
04:55:11.868 --> 04:55:11.878 align:start position:0%
a couple things
 
04:55:14.090 --> 04:55:14.100 align:start position:0%
um that I just sorry I sound nervous
 
04:55:17.150 --> 04:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:19.128 --> 04:55:19.138 align:start position:0%
a couple of things that I'd like to just
 
04:55:20.868 --> 04:55:20.878 align:start position:0%
kind of lay a little bit of a groundwork
 
04:55:23.628 --> 04:55:23.638 align:start position:0%
as a special education teacher we are
 
04:55:26.990 --> 04:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
taught to always go or think of the
 
04:55:29.510 --> 04:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
least dangerous assumption if we can
 
04:55:31.310 --> 04:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of our at-risk students
 
04:55:33.708 --> 04:55:33.718 align:start position:0%
in the general education classroom then
 
04:55:36.170 --> 04:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
all students will benefit cursive
 
04:55:38.690 --> 04:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
writing and multiplication tables is
 
04:55:40.670 --> 04:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
something that our at-risk students have
 
04:55:43.190 --> 04:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
difficulty mastering and if we worked on
 
04:55:45.050 --> 04:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
that in the general education classroom
 
04:55:47.330 --> 04:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
all students would acquire that skill as
 
04:55:47.340 --> 04:55:48.050 align:start position:0%
all students would acquire that skill as
well

04:55:48.050 --> 04:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:55:50.150 --> 04:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
a couple of questions that came up that
 
04:55:51.830 --> 04:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
I would like to address before I forget
 
04:55:54.230 --> 04:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
or before you forget
 
04:55:57.530 --> 04:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
um is I'd just like to point out that in
 
04:55:59.628 --> 04:55:59.638 align:start position:0%
Montessori School
 
04:56:01.788 --> 04:56:01.798 align:start position:0%
um children are taught to write in
 
04:56:04.550 --> 04:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
cursive from Two and a Half
 
04:56:06.530 --> 04:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
and they are taught to read and block
 
04:56:09.050 --> 04:56:09.060 align:start position:0%
and by doing that the children learn
 
04:56:09.060 --> 04:56:10.250 align:start position:0%
and by doing that the children learn
both

04:56:10.250 --> 04:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
both
 
04:56:14.030 --> 04:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
as far as why children would have
 
04:56:16.250 --> 04:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
difficulty in the benefit of teaching
 
04:56:19.250 --> 04:56:19.260 align:start position:0%
cursive writing to younger children is
 
04:56:21.590 --> 04:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
if we observe children writing or
 
04:56:23.750 --> 04:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
learning block letters they hold their
 
04:56:27.230 --> 04:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
pencils extremely tight and requires the
 
04:56:29.390 --> 04:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
child to lift and lower their pencil
 
04:56:31.788 --> 04:56:31.798 align:start position:0%
multiple times just to write one letter
 
04:56:34.788 --> 04:56:34.798 align:start position:0%
for instance to write the letter M they
 
04:56:37.610 --> 04:56:37.620 align:start position:0%
lift and lower four times to write the
 
04:56:40.190 --> 04:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
letter h a capital h and a capital N it
 
04:56:42.230 --> 04:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
would be three times so it's a constant
 
04:56:44.628 --> 04:56:44.638 align:start position:0%
lifting and lower of the pencil the
 
04:56:46.970 --> 04:56:46.980 align:start position:0%
other thing that comes into play here is
 
04:56:49.850 --> 04:56:49.860 align:start position:0%
that the students often have visual
 
04:56:52.788 --> 04:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
difficulties and they do not have good
 
04:56:54.708 --> 04:56:54.718 align:start position:0%
spacing between their letters so now
 
04:56:56.208 --> 04:56:56.218 align:start position:0%
they have to bring in their other hand
 
04:56:58.368 --> 04:56:58.378 align:start position:0%
because now they are lifting and
 
04:57:00.110 --> 04:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
lowering to write letters to form the
 
04:57:01.368 --> 04:57:01.378 align:start position:0%
words but they have to bring their other
 
04:57:03.650 --> 04:57:03.660 align:start position:0%
hand in to put it down to make sure they
 
04:57:05.868 --> 04:57:05.878 align:start position:0%
have a space between their words
 
04:57:09.770 --> 04:57:09.780 align:start position:0%
if cursive writing is taught there is it
 
04:57:11.750 --> 04:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
takes that away we don't we can't write
 
04:57:13.250 --> 04:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
letters backwards because it doesn't
 
04:57:14.810 --> 04:57:14.820 align:start position:0%
flow the children are learning to write
 
04:57:17.030 --> 04:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
from left to right and the words have a
 
04:57:19.310 --> 04:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
beginning and an end and so that's
 
04:57:23.090 --> 04:57:23.100 align:start position:0%
another component of Y cursive uh works
 
04:57:25.910 --> 04:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
for so many young children
 
04:57:27.890 --> 04:57:27.900 align:start position:0%
you had a question as to where it falls
 
04:57:29.930 --> 04:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
in the curriculum and cursive would be a
 
04:57:31.910 --> 04:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
part of literacy it is a part of
 
04:57:33.890 --> 04:57:33.900 align:start position:0%
communication in both reading and
 
04:57:36.410 --> 04:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
expressing yourself and you asked about
 
04:57:39.350 --> 04:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
would curse of adding cursive to an IEP
 
04:57:42.230 --> 04:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
cause a fiscal impact and absolutely it
 
04:57:44.930 --> 04:57:44.940 align:start position:0%
would because typically fiscal cursive
 
04:57:46.730 --> 04:57:46.740 align:start position:0%
writing is not taught by the special
 
04:57:49.490 --> 04:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
educator but by the OT specialist so
 
04:57:50.810 --> 04:57:50.820 align:start position:0%
that's another teacher that would have
 
04:57:54.170 --> 04:57:54.180 align:start position:0%
to be put on the child's IEP
 
04:57:57.170 --> 04:57:57.180 align:start position:0%
um all that being said I will now go in
 
04:57:59.330 --> 04:57:59.340 align:start position:0%
my direction
 
04:57:59.340 --> 04:58:01.490 align:start position:0%
my direction
um

04:58:01.490 --> 04:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:03.830 --> 04:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
and come from the standpoint
 
04:58:07.430 --> 04:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
of why we identify children from special
 
04:58:09.890 --> 04:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
education under specific learning
 
04:58:09.900 --> 04:58:12.708 align:start position:0%
education under specific learning
disabilities

04:58:12.708 --> 04:58:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:12.718 --> 04:58:13.610 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:58:13.610 --> 04:58:13.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:14.868 --> 04:58:14.878 align:start position:0%
now that I'm looking at this I've
 
04:58:16.128 --> 04:58:16.138 align:start position:0%
realized I forgot to thank you for
 
04:58:19.150 --> 04:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
allowing me to testify I'm sorry
 
04:58:21.770 --> 04:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
kind of jumped into it and went into my
 
04:58:24.230 --> 04:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
candidates which I tend to do
 
04:58:27.230 --> 04:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
um but I do respectfully submit this
 
04:58:29.090 --> 04:58:29.100 align:start position:0%
following argument
 
04:58:32.110 --> 04:58:32.120 align:start position:0%
if we recognize that the original Bill
 
04:58:34.970 --> 04:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
encouraging cursive writing and learning
 
04:58:37.490 --> 04:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
multiplication table addresses the needs
 
04:58:40.190 --> 04:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
of students with dyslexia dysgraphia and
 
04:58:42.770 --> 04:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
dyscalcula which means students who do
 
04:58:45.530 --> 04:58:45.540 align:start position:0%
not write do not read and do not
 
04:58:50.150 --> 04:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
calculate at Express at expected levels
 
04:58:52.670 --> 04:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
and if we understand that students who
 
04:58:55.128 --> 04:58:55.138 align:start position:0%
perform these who cannot perform these
 
04:58:58.190 --> 04:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
simple literacy tasks efficiently are
 
04:59:00.050 --> 04:59:00.060 align:start position:0%
referred to special education to rule
 
04:59:01.970 --> 04:59:01.980 align:start position:0%
out an educational disability in the
 
04:59:04.010 --> 04:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
area of special education
 
04:59:06.708 --> 04:59:06.718 align:start position:0%
and as we further understand that
 
04:59:09.050 --> 04:59:09.060 align:start position:0%
Federal Law requires the administration
 
04:59:11.448 --> 04:59:11.458 align:start position:0%
of an academic evaluation to assess
 
04:59:14.270 --> 04:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
students ability to form these simple
 
04:59:17.330 --> 04:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
tasks include the student's ability to
 
04:59:20.930 --> 04:59:20.940 align:start position:0%
formulate and write sentences quickly
 
04:59:23.510 --> 04:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
including writing sentences as many
 
04:59:25.610 --> 04:59:25.620 align:start position:0%
sentences as possible within seven
 
04:59:27.590 --> 04:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
minutes time frame
 
04:59:30.890 --> 04:59:30.900 align:start position:0%
it also evaluates the student's ability
 
04:59:33.650 --> 04:59:33.660 align:start position:0%
to perform paper and pencil math calc
 
04:59:33.660 --> 04:59:36.230 align:start position:0%
to perform paper and pencil math calc
computations

04:59:36.230 --> 04:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
computations
 
04:59:39.050 --> 04:59:39.060 align:start position:0%
it also assesses the student's ability
 
04:59:41.448 --> 04:59:41.458 align:start position:0%
to solve as many simple addition
 
04:59:44.030 --> 04:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
subtraction and multiplication facts as
 
04:59:46.490 --> 04:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
possible within three minutes
 
04:59:48.948 --> 04:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
and to this I would add
 
04:59:50.810 --> 04:59:50.820 align:start position:0%
the reason multiplication is in there
 
04:59:52.788 --> 04:59:52.798 align:start position:0%
and we don't see division is because
 
04:59:55.670 --> 04:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
students with dyslexia are right brain
 
04:59:55.680 --> 04:59:57.230 align:start position:0%
students with dyslexia are right brain
students

04:59:57.230 --> 04:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
students
 
05:00:00.830 --> 05:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
and right brain takes care of addition
 
05:00:03.530 --> 05:00:03.540 align:start position:0%
and subtraction left brain handles
 
05:00:03.540 --> 05:00:05.810 align:start position:0%
and subtraction left brain handles
multiplication

05:00:05.810 --> 05:00:05.820 align:start position:0%
multiplication
 
05:00:07.670 --> 05:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
that is the area of weakness for a
 
05:00:10.010 --> 05:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
student with dyslexia or dyscalcula so
 
05:00:11.930 --> 05:00:11.940 align:start position:0%
they have to be explicitly taught to
 
05:00:14.868 --> 05:00:14.878 align:start position:0%
work on these skills to get fluency if
 
05:00:16.368 --> 05:00:16.378 align:start position:0%
you don't teach them the multiplication
 
05:00:18.590 --> 05:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
facts if they don't learn them they will
 
05:00:20.510 --> 05:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
never because they will rely on repeat
 
05:00:24.830 --> 05:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
addition so they are way slowed down
 
05:00:27.948 --> 05:00:27.958 align:start position:0%
um getting back to this if we are aware
 
05:00:30.110 --> 05:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
that students identified as a student
 
05:00:32.150 --> 05:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
with an educational disability in the
 
05:00:33.708 --> 05:00:33.718 align:start position:0%
area of specific learning disabilities
 
05:00:36.890 --> 05:00:36.900 align:start position:0%
are not developmentally disabled meaning
 
05:00:38.930 --> 05:00:38.940 align:start position:0%
that students with specific learning
 
05:00:42.230 --> 05:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
disabilities have IQs above 70 and are
 
05:00:44.330 --> 05:00:44.340 align:start position:0%
capable of learning and improving these
 
05:00:46.490 --> 05:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
basic literacy skills Beyond a
 
05:00:48.110 --> 05:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
functional level
 
05:00:50.030 --> 05:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
and if we know that students identified
 
05:00:52.850 --> 05:00:52.860 align:start position:0%
with special with specific learning
 
05:00:55.190 --> 05:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
disabilities may be removed from the
 
05:00:57.708 --> 05:00:57.718 align:start position:0%
general education environment in order
 
05:01:00.230 --> 05:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
to receive specialized instruction
 
05:01:03.890 --> 05:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
to address these fluency deficits
 
05:01:07.070 --> 05:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
and if we also understand that according
 
05:01:10.868 --> 05:01:10.878 align:start position:0%
to the 2021 Statewide sentence census
 
05:01:13.310 --> 05:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand three hundred and nine
 
05:01:14.930 --> 05:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students are identified
 
05:01:18.288 --> 05:01:18.298 align:start position:0%
with an educational disability and of
 
05:01:20.650 --> 05:01:20.660 align:start position:0%
those 97
 
05:01:24.470 --> 05:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
767 are students with specific learning
 
05:01:24.480 --> 05:01:26.030 align:start position:0%
767 are students with specific learning
disability

05:01:26.030 --> 05:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
disability
 
05:01:29.030 --> 05:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's basic literacy skills that we
 
05:01:30.830 --> 05:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
have nine thousand over nine thousand
 
05:01:33.170 --> 05:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
students not proficient
 
05:01:35.270 --> 05:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
and if putting all these facts together
 
05:01:38.570 --> 05:01:38.580 align:start position:0%
you can see how failing to require the
 
05:01:40.190 --> 05:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
teaching of cursive writing and
 
05:01:42.530 --> 05:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
multiplication tables could result in an
 
05:01:45.110 --> 05:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
over-identified identification of New
 
05:01:46.970 --> 05:01:46.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students with an educational
 
05:01:48.948 --> 05:01:48.958 align:start position:0%
disability in the area of specific
 
05:01:52.010 --> 05:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
learning disability when in fact these
 
05:01:53.690 --> 05:01:53.700 align:start position:0%
students have not been provided the
 
05:01:56.330 --> 05:01:56.340 align:start position:0%
opportunity to learn and master the
 
05:01:58.310 --> 05:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
skills being assessed as part of the
 
05:02:00.708 --> 05:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
special education process as required by
 
05:02:02.170 --> 05:02:02.180 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
05:02:05.030 --> 05:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
then you would have to agree that for
 
05:02:06.530 --> 05:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
the sake of the students who need to
 
05:02:08.570 --> 05:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
increase these writing and math fluency
 
05:02:11.090 --> 05:02:11.100 align:start position:0%
skills you must provide
 
05:02:13.310 --> 05:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to learn and master
 
05:02:15.170 --> 05:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
cursive writing and multiplication
 
05:02:16.850 --> 05:02:16.860 align:start position:0%
skills in the general education
 
05:02:19.070 --> 05:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
classroom so these students are assured
 
05:02:21.890 --> 05:02:21.900 align:start position:0%
equal access to the curriculum and
 
05:02:24.050 --> 05:02:24.060 align:start position:0%
receive a free appropriate public
 
05:02:26.570 --> 05:02:26.580 align:start position:0%

by amending HB 170 to change the word
 
05:02:32.270 --> 05:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
from encourage to require thank you
 
05:02:34.368 --> 05:02:34.378 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Lori I have a
 
05:02:37.730 --> 05:02:37.740 align:start position:0%
question for you yes as a teacher yes
 
05:02:40.010 --> 05:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
worked with young people
 
05:02:44.330 --> 05:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
are you seeing more folks today as I
 
05:02:47.090 --> 05:02:47.100 align:start position:0%
guess I see two in stores when you the
 
05:02:50.330 --> 05:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
fine motor skills and holding a pin now
 
05:02:54.948 --> 05:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
is done in convoluted ways and it
 
05:02:57.530 --> 05:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
appears to me that kids are struggling
 
05:02:59.570 --> 05:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
or adults are struggling now and just
 
05:03:01.368 --> 05:03:01.378 align:start position:0%
getting something written down on a
 
05:03:02.510 --> 05:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
piece of paper
 
05:03:06.050 --> 05:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
are you seeing an increase in the number
 
05:03:07.788 --> 05:03:07.798 align:start position:0%
of students that you work with that just
 
05:03:09.770 --> 05:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
do not have even the concept of how to
 
05:03:12.890 --> 05:03:12.900 align:start position:0%
hold a pencil or a pen
 
05:03:16.128 --> 05:03:16.138 align:start position:0%
I will clarify that I retired in June of
 
05:03:21.350 --> 05:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
2019 Miss covet but um I and at that
 
05:03:23.690 --> 05:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
time I would say that yes there is a
 
05:03:25.250 --> 05:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
hard time of the children holding their
 
05:03:27.110 --> 05:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
pens and pencils and they do have
 
05:03:29.570 --> 05:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
difficulty as I said they over grasp and
 
05:03:31.730 --> 05:03:31.740 align:start position:0%
they hold very their pencils very
 
05:03:31.740 --> 05:03:32.868 align:start position:0%
they hold very their pencils very
tightly

05:03:32.868 --> 05:03:32.878 align:start position:0%
tightly
 
05:03:36.288 --> 05:03:36.298 align:start position:0%
yeah questions of
 
05:03:38.448 --> 05:03:38.458 align:start position:0%
the speaker
 
05:03:40.070 --> 05:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
not seeing any
 
05:03:43.910 --> 05:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
oh I I representative
 
05:03:46.128 --> 05:03:46.138 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm going to ask the same
 
05:03:47.868 --> 05:03:47.878 align:start position:0%
question I asked the previous speaker
 
05:03:50.868 --> 05:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
and that is do you know of specific
 
05:03:52.788 --> 05:03:52.798 align:start position:0%
instances where these are not being
 
05:03:56.930 --> 05:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
taught in our schools thank you
 
05:03:59.110 --> 05:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question yes I do
 
05:04:01.490 --> 05:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
when left to the discretion of the
 
05:04:03.590 --> 05:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
teacher teachers can choose to teach it
 
05:04:06.050 --> 05:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
or not to teach it I have children in
 
05:04:08.030 --> 05:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
the Salem School District One in third
 
05:04:10.250 --> 05:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
grade and I have not seen any indication
 
05:04:12.110 --> 05:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
that he is learning cursive writing
 
05:04:14.510 --> 05:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
another representative told me that she
 
05:04:16.788 --> 05:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
has two children in the Windham School
 
05:04:19.730 --> 05:04:19.740 align:start position:0%
District and these are both very quality
 
05:04:22.190 --> 05:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
school districts one child was taught
 
05:04:25.128 --> 05:04:25.138 align:start position:0%
cursive and one was not
 
05:04:27.708 --> 05:04:27.718 align:start position:0%
um and I should also mention that it is
 
05:04:29.510 --> 05:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
required that when signing legal
 
05:04:33.350 --> 05:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
documents children for adults do need to
 
05:04:36.170 --> 05:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
um sign in cursive printing is not
 
05:04:39.590 --> 05:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
accepted on legal documents
 
05:04:39.600 --> 05:04:41.150 align:start position:0%
accepted on legal documents
um

05:04:41.150 --> 05:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:43.430 --> 05:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
and I will also point out that the
 
05:04:45.890 --> 05:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
hardest part of being a special
 
05:04:48.170 --> 05:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
education teacher in the middle school
 
05:04:51.288 --> 05:04:51.298 align:start position:0%
is sitting with parents of 7th and 8th
 
05:04:53.390 --> 05:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
graders and identifying their child with
 
05:04:55.550 --> 05:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
a specific learning disability knowing
 
05:04:58.730 --> 05:04:58.740 align:start position:0%
they've never been taught the skill
 
05:05:02.330 --> 05:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the questions
 
05:05:04.128 --> 05:05:04.138 align:start position:0%
not seeing thank you very much for your
 
05:05:06.530 --> 05:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
testing thank you very much if you have
 
05:05:09.948 --> 05:05:09.958 align:start position:0%
a copy of what you read to us did you
 
05:05:11.890 --> 05:05:11.900 align:start position:0%
did you get that yeah
 
05:05:16.610 --> 05:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
okay to have a copy of that I included
 
05:05:18.470 --> 05:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
um the Woodcock Johnson that is the
 
05:05:21.530 --> 05:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
standard test other than the um the uh
 
05:05:24.110 --> 05:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
welchler I I didn't print that off and I
 
05:05:27.110 --> 05:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
also printed this off of the the census
 
05:05:29.330 --> 05:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
off of our education department thank
 
05:05:31.070 --> 05:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you
 
05:05:33.410 --> 05:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other folks who
 
05:05:36.230 --> 05:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
want to testify on on this bill
 
05:05:36.240 --> 05:05:43.128 align:start position:0%
want to testify on on this bill
yes

05:05:43.128 --> 05:05:43.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:47.690 --> 05:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
he says I saw that
 
05:05:49.730 --> 05:05:49.740 align:start position:0%
good afternoon for the record
 
05:05:51.288 --> 05:05:51.298 align:start position:0%
um nice to see everyone again Becky
 
05:05:52.550 --> 05:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
Wilson from the New Hampshire school
 
05:05:55.310 --> 05:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
boards Association again we would like
 
05:05:56.810 --> 05:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
to thank the sponsors and the
 
05:05:58.850 --> 05:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of this bill for their
 
05:06:00.948 --> 05:06:00.958 align:start position:0%
passion and bringing forward a topic and
 
05:06:02.690 --> 05:06:02.700 align:start position:0%
a Content area and the skill that they
 
05:06:05.628 --> 05:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
feel are so important for students in
 
05:06:08.330 --> 05:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we certainly do not
 
05:06:11.090 --> 05:06:11.100 align:start position:0%
um want to get into whether or not those
 
05:06:14.750 --> 05:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
skills Etc are of importance however as
 
05:06:16.430 --> 05:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
we had said earlier on other content
 
05:06:18.470 --> 05:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
bills and we will not probably testify
 
05:06:20.390 --> 05:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
on every content specific bill that
 
05:06:22.970 --> 05:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
comes to this committee however we
 
05:06:24.590 --> 05:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
currently have two long-standing
 
05:06:26.810 --> 05:06:26.820 align:start position:0%
resolutions which support local School
 
05:06:28.490 --> 05:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
Board responsibility for and the
 
05:06:30.170 --> 05:06:30.180 align:start position:0%
oversight of the local educational
 
05:06:34.070 --> 05:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
programs this again goes against
 
05:06:37.330 --> 05:06:37.340 align:start position:0%
allowing local school districts to
 
05:06:40.190 --> 05:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
determine and to oversee specific
 
05:06:43.010 --> 05:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
programs as we had stated previously
 
05:06:45.708 --> 05:06:45.718 align:start position:0%
with some of the other content specific
 
05:06:48.170 --> 05:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
bills the minimum standards for public
 
05:06:50.090 --> 05:06:50.100 align:start position:0%
school approval are currently undergoing
 
05:06:53.830 --> 05:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
a very rigorous extensive process for
 
05:06:56.448 --> 05:06:56.458 align:start position:0%
revision right now that includes lots of
 
05:06:58.330 --> 05:06:58.340 align:start position:0%
community opportunity for feedback
 
05:07:00.650 --> 05:07:00.660 align:start position:0%
feedback from teachers feedback from
 
05:07:02.990 --> 05:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
students and parents if these particular
 
05:07:06.050 --> 05:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
skills are not currently required which
 
05:07:08.030 --> 05:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
we realize the statute currently says
 
05:07:10.190 --> 05:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
encourage and to many of the points that
 
05:07:11.570 --> 05:07:11.580 align:start position:0%
have come to this committee this
 
05:07:14.690 --> 05:07:14.700 align:start position:0%
afternoon it's unclear how many
 
05:07:16.970 --> 05:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
districts are or are not doing this at
 
05:07:18.948 --> 05:07:18.958 align:start position:0%
the general classroom level versus at a
 
05:07:21.650 --> 05:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
student-specific level based on need but
 
05:07:23.270 --> 05:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
if it is something that rises to the
 
05:07:26.510 --> 05:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
level of the larger Community feeling
 
05:07:27.948 --> 05:07:27.958 align:start position:0%
that it needs to be included in the
 
05:07:29.150 --> 05:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for public school
 
05:07:31.910 --> 05:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
approval then we would encourage this
 
05:07:33.770 --> 05:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
committee to give that information to
 
05:07:34.970 --> 05:07:34.980 align:start position:0%
the groups that are working on the
 
05:07:37.910 --> 05:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
revisions for the ed306 and the other
 
05:07:39.530 --> 05:07:39.540 align:start position:0%
committee legislative committee that is
 
05:07:42.410 --> 05:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
overseeing some of that work
 
05:07:44.390 --> 05:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
again there are
 
05:07:46.250 --> 05:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
um to some of the previous points made
 
05:07:49.190 --> 05:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
many students who do have access to
 
05:07:50.930 --> 05:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
learning cursive writing and
 
05:07:52.910 --> 05:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
multiplication tables either within the
 
05:07:55.368 --> 05:07:55.378 align:start position:0%
context of the General Ed setting or in
 
05:07:57.050 --> 05:07:57.060 align:start position:0%
some other setting as part of a
 
05:07:58.490 --> 05:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
student's individualized education
 
05:07:58.500 --> 05:08:00.430 align:start position:0%
student's individualized education
program

05:08:00.430 --> 05:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:08:03.708 --> 05:08:03.718 align:start position:0%
and that's where we would suggest that
 
05:08:06.350 --> 05:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
those that information goes in terms of
 
05:08:08.330 --> 05:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
trying to incorporate those things into
 
05:08:11.150 --> 05:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
whether it is a mandatory curriculum
 
05:08:13.610 --> 05:08:13.620 align:start position:0%
aspect or at the discretion of the local
 
05:08:15.470 --> 05:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
school board we would also just remind
 
05:08:19.070 --> 05:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
people that as more skills and content
 
05:08:21.230 --> 05:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
Etc programs are incorporated into the
 
05:08:23.330 --> 05:08:23.340 align:start position:0%
minimum standards that that is part of
 
05:08:25.128 --> 05:08:25.138 align:start position:0%
what is considered an adequate education
 
05:08:27.350 --> 05:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
in the state and that is to be funded by
 
05:08:30.128 --> 05:08:30.138 align:start position:0%
by the state in that particular way
 
05:08:32.868 --> 05:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
whether or not the local district has to
 
05:08:36.350 --> 05:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
choose a program if it is being mandated
 
05:08:39.350 --> 05:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
by the legislator and by by rules and
 
05:08:40.850 --> 05:08:40.860 align:start position:0%
statute then that would fall under
 
05:08:42.948 --> 05:08:42.958 align:start position:0%
adequate education from the state level
 
05:08:44.510 --> 05:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm happy to take any
 
05:08:46.190 --> 05:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much Becky are
 
05:08:47.750 --> 05:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
there any questions of the school boards
 
05:08:47.760 --> 05:08:49.128 align:start position:0%
there any questions of the school boards
Association

05:08:49.128 --> 05:08:49.138 align:start position:0%
Association
 
05:08:51.650 --> 05:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
05:08:53.330 --> 05:08:53.340 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much and I
 
05:08:55.250 --> 05:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
actually Mr chair I think this is
 
05:08:57.530 --> 05:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
probably more of a question to you but
 
05:09:01.190 --> 05:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
it's based on what um what Ms Wilson and
 
05:09:05.510 --> 05:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
um and Dr frew were had had mentioned uh
 
05:09:07.430 --> 05:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
in their during their testimony today
 
05:09:10.850 --> 05:09:10.860 align:start position:0%
that um that you know these sorts of
 
05:09:13.430 --> 05:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
Provisions may be better placed during
 
05:09:16.368 --> 05:09:16.378 align:start position:0%
the um during the the revisions to the
 
05:09:19.070 --> 05:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
Ed 306 but I was wondering Mr chair if
 
05:09:21.350 --> 05:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
you could speak a little bit to the um
 
05:09:23.090 --> 05:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
you know the process that may be
 
05:09:25.730 --> 05:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
available to people to and members of
 
05:09:26.990 --> 05:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
the public as well as some
 
05:09:30.410 --> 05:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
representatives for um commenting and
 
05:09:33.530 --> 05:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
providing feedback on these um the Ed
 
05:09:36.350 --> 05:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
306 rules
 
05:09:40.610 --> 05:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
well first of all Ed 306 the minimum
 
05:09:42.890 --> 05:09:42.900 align:start position:0%
standards for public school approval
 
05:09:45.590 --> 05:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
are not the academic standards
 
05:09:49.430 --> 05:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
and they when we look at what are the
 
05:09:51.110 --> 05:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
targets which we have that we're going
 
05:09:54.590 --> 05:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
to take in and align our our Improvement
 
05:09:57.230 --> 05:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
and assessment uh process in the state
 
05:09:59.030 --> 05:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
with it's going to be the targets that
 
05:10:01.610 --> 05:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
we established now we put some courses
 
05:10:03.708 --> 05:10:03.718 align:start position:0%
or some requirements under the area of
 
05:10:05.990 --> 05:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
studies not necessarily underneath the
 
05:10:08.628 --> 05:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
adequate education which we feel that
 
05:10:11.208 --> 05:10:11.218 align:start position:0%
are important for you know our students
 
05:10:13.430 --> 05:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
to have when they leave the gate in 12th
 
05:10:16.910 --> 05:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
grade so to get these changes made
 
05:10:19.368 --> 05:10:19.378 align:start position:0%
there's quite a process here now I I
 
05:10:21.050 --> 05:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
think this is another area that we
 
05:10:23.810 --> 05:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
really do need to investigate because
 
05:10:26.330 --> 05:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of rain a lot of aspects
 
05:10:30.170 --> 05:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
and and results of of associated with
 
05:10:32.570 --> 05:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
that for example the teaching of cursive
 
05:10:34.910 --> 05:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
and a lot of brain research out there on
 
05:10:38.208 --> 05:10:38.218 align:start position:0%
it now as well and and and and muscle
 
05:10:42.530 --> 05:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
memory uh so I I in terms of how we
 
05:10:44.330 --> 05:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
address this one
 
05:10:47.090 --> 05:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
um in you know I the minimum Public
 
05:10:49.550 --> 05:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
School standards incorporates a whole
 
05:10:51.410 --> 05:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
lot of things so how many custodians you
 
05:10:52.850 --> 05:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
might have in the building it's not just
 
05:10:54.708 --> 05:10:54.718 align:start position:0%
you know what you learn through your
 
05:10:56.270 --> 05:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
instruction or curriculum it's you know
 
05:10:58.670 --> 05:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
oftentimes the the the
 
05:11:02.390 --> 05:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
um the the whole domain of what we call
 
05:11:05.510 --> 05:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
public and public education and and it
 
05:11:07.850 --> 05:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
deals with our competencies as well but
 
05:11:10.070 --> 05:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
I think we gotta look at those academic
 
05:11:12.230 --> 05:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
standards too you know our our
 
05:11:14.868 --> 05:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
assessment which we use as a result of
 
05:11:17.448 --> 05:11:17.458 align:start position:0%
the national assessment
 
05:11:20.330 --> 05:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
deals with certain standards which when
 
05:11:22.128 --> 05:11:22.138 align:start position:0%
adopted in the last standards for
 
05:11:23.810 --> 05:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
example mathematics came out of the
 
05:11:26.030 --> 05:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
Common Core which we now call the New
 
05:11:28.850 --> 05:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire standards for a career and and
 
05:11:32.570 --> 05:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
and college readiness and the same thing
 
05:11:34.550 --> 05:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
with the language arts area
 
05:11:36.530 --> 05:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
so we want to look at those standards
 
05:11:38.930 --> 05:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
which are applicable to those I I'm not
 
05:11:41.810 --> 05:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
so Keen I always going to the minimum uh
 
05:11:44.270 --> 05:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
standards of public school approval I'm
 
05:11:45.890 --> 05:11:45.900 align:start position:0%
looking for those standards which we
 
05:11:47.448 --> 05:11:47.458 align:start position:0%
want the kids to have when they leave
 
05:11:49.430 --> 05:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
the school where is the bar going to be
 
05:11:52.208 --> 05:11:52.218 align:start position:0%
and what do they need to teach
 
05:11:55.670 --> 05:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
I'm a strong believer that some of the
 
05:11:57.470 --> 05:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
things we did when I started teaching
 
05:12:00.410 --> 05:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
Back in 1970 after I came out of where I
 
05:12:01.490 --> 05:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
was an instructor at Maine Military
 
05:12:01.500 --> 05:12:02.590 align:start position:0%
was an instructor at Maine Military
Academy

05:12:02.590 --> 05:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
Academy
 
05:12:05.270 --> 05:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
are still valid today
 
05:12:07.250 --> 05:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
and there are a lot of things we did
 
05:12:09.650 --> 05:12:09.660 align:start position:0%
back then that we see the pendulum in
 
05:12:11.750 --> 05:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
education going back and forth we are
 
05:12:14.208 --> 05:12:14.218 align:start position:0%
great at inventing things in education
 
05:12:16.610 --> 05:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
you know we look at open classrooms
 
05:12:18.948 --> 05:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
classrooms Without Walls classrooms with
 
05:12:21.230 --> 05:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
walls and then we go on to how to teach
 
05:12:23.330 --> 05:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
science inquiry science and all this
 
05:12:26.390 --> 05:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
other stuff with the old ESS programs
 
05:12:28.810 --> 05:12:28.820 align:start position:0%
and all that and now we're into
 
05:12:30.770 --> 05:12:30.780 align:start position:0%
representative cascad you know what I'm
 
05:12:31.670 --> 05:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
05:12:36.170 --> 05:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
and and and so uh this is an area that I
 
05:12:37.850 --> 05:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
think we as a committee really need to
 
05:12:41.110 --> 05:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
look at and and and we at the end result
 
05:12:42.948 --> 05:12:42.958 align:start position:0%
represento is we got to do what's best
 
05:12:45.010 --> 05:12:45.020 align:start position:0%
for the kids
 
05:12:48.170 --> 05:12:48.180 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think we're all there on that
 
05:12:49.970 --> 05:12:49.980 align:start position:0%
that's the kids which we're trying to
 
05:12:52.070 --> 05:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
get ready for this world so
 
05:12:52.080 --> 05:12:53.690 align:start position:0%
get ready for this world so
um

05:12:53.690 --> 05:12:53.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:56.030 --> 05:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
I don't have all the answers
 
05:12:58.910 --> 05:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
you know I've been around a long time
 
05:13:01.250 --> 05:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
05:13:03.470 --> 05:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
I I'm not ready to give the ghost up I
 
05:13:04.788 --> 05:13:04.798 align:start position:0%
think there's some things which we have
 
05:13:06.708 --> 05:13:06.718 align:start position:0%
to do and accomplish here in education
 
05:13:10.070 --> 05:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
and this may be one
 
05:13:11.930 --> 05:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome anything else
 
05:13:15.110 --> 05:13:15.120 align:start position:0%

170 if not we're going to slam the gavel
 
05:13:25.368 --> 05:13:25.378 align:start position:0%
down and call it a day
 
05:13:26.990 --> 05:13:27.000 align:start position:0%

across the way tomorrow tomorrow
 
05:13:37.788 --> 05:13:37.798 align:start position:0%
morning tomorrow morning oh that's
 
05:13:40.070 --> 05:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
because that's the one yeah in the
 
05:13:41.570 --> 05:13:41.580 align:start position:0%
morning in the morning we're over there
 
05:13:43.128 --> 05:13:43.138 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon we have a couple bills
 
05:13:44.628 --> 05:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
on this side
 
05:13:44.638 --> 05:13:46.368 align:start position:0%
on this side
yeah

05:13:46.368 --> 05:13:46.378 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:13:48.350 --> 05:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
get on the web and look at all the new
 
05:13:50.150 --> 05:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
bills which are coming at us we're
 
05:13:52.310 --> 05:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
seeing over 30 bills now with fiscal
 
05:13:52.320 --> 05:13:55.730 align:start position:0%
seeing over 30 bills now with fiscal
notes

05:13:55.730 --> 05:13:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:58.368 --> 05:13:58.378 align:start position:0%
yeah 9 30. I didn't want to throw this
 
05:14:00.770 --> 05:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
into the education The Simple Solution
 
05:14:04.250 --> 05:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
to this is to link it to driver's ed
 
05:14:05.868 --> 05:14:05.878 align:start position:0%
because they have to assign a legal
 
05:14:08.030 --> 05:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
document in the script and say you can't
 
05:14:09.948 --> 05:14:09.958 align:start position:0%
take Driver's edit you can't do Thursday
 
05:14:12.590 --> 05:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
you know I I watch my Junior High kids
 
05:14:15.230 --> 05:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
now and they are absolutely laboring to
 
05:14:17.690 --> 05:14:17.700 align:start position:0%
sign their name now oh yeah and they're
 
05:14:20.090 --> 05:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
holding their Penance is ridiculous how
 
05:14:23.030 --> 05:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
they do it right here I think they're
 
05:14:25.070 --> 05:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
awesome there should be a card for Becky
 
05:14:27.948 --> 05:14:27.958 align:start position:0%
in here some for 172. I saw one
 
05:14:27.958 --> 05:14:30.430 align:start position:0%
in here some for 172. I saw one
initially

05:14:30.430 --> 05:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
initially
 
05:14:33.770 --> 05:14:33.780 align:start position:0%
oh they don't sell it yeah maybe it got
 
05:14:35.570 --> 05:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
mixed up one of these animals over here
 
05:14:37.070 --> 05:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm not going to mess up your stuff
 
05:14:39.010 --> 05:14:39.020 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:14:41.270 --> 05:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
let me give you one make sure you have
 
05:14:42.470 --> 05:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
one of each
 
05:14:42.480 --> 05:14:47.770 align:start position:0%
one of each
other

05:14:47.770 --> 05:14:47.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:59.150 --> 05:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:59.160 --> 05:15:01.128 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:15:01.128 --> 05:15:01.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:04.570 --> 05:15:04.580 align:start position:0%
see here's the one for Becky right here
 
05:15:09.610 --> 05:15:09.620 align:start position:0%
and it's 170 and see this is the 147 pie
 
05:15:12.948 --> 05:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
okay now did she also do anything here
