00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:36.680 align:start position:0%

first I'm going to turn to uh Senate
 
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.389 align:start position:0%
first I'm going to turn to uh Senate
Bill

00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
185 and uh the chair recognized
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander for a motion
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I move in expedient
 
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
to legislate is there a second for that
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
I second seconded by representative
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
cutab representative Alexander do you
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to your motion yeah very
 
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
briefly so um the senate in their
 
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
Infinite Wisdom likes to send us a lot
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
of study committees um and I think that
 
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
one of these I think that some of them
 
00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:07.160 align:start position:0%
are sorely needed I voted for some of
 
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
them but some of them um we already know
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
what the barriers are this is a
 
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
committee to study the barriers
 
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
discharged for patients I'm looking
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
currently at a um release by the
 
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
hospital Association foundation for
 
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
healthy families that basically says
 
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
that barriers such as Medicaid
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
enrollment housing and security secure
 
00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
Guardianship and the need for
 
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
specialized Services creat significant
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
roadblocks to discharge so that seems to
 
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
me like they know what the barriers are
 
00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
so um I think that they're doing their
 
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
own independent study on what they can
 
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
do on their end to fix it so in this way
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think that we need another study
 
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:41.240 align:start position:0%
committee on something that we know what
 
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
the barriers are right uh yes
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon and then
 
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
representative Smith I mean I don't
 
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:51.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily disagree with anything the
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander said but I
 
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
think the study committee and well it's
 
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
only going to meet for a short time
 
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
anyway but I think they might then be
 
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
able to move on at least examine the
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
issue of what more can be done about
 
00:11:06.509 --> 00:11:06.519 align:start position:0%
those barriers we I guess even if we do
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
know what the barriers are it knowing
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
what the barriers are is kind of not
 
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
very helpful if we don't do anything
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
about it and maybe they can represent
 
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
some actual actions I mean I know that
 
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
involves doing things differently and
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
possibly even spending more money but it
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
I I I think it might I think it would be
 
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
a useful exercise convening that group
 
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
of six people a few times over the
 
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:30.200 align:start position:0%
summer and fall and putting out putting
 
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519 align:start position:0%
out the report even though it's not
 
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
going to solve the problem so I'm going
 
00:11:34.509 --> 00:11:34.519 align:start position:0%
to I would be cined to vote against the
 
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
itl all right uh representative
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair I agree
 
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
completely with
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
everything that um
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander said um except
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
I would add one more thing
 
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
immediately which is that this bill
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
should not have come to this committee
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
it should have gone
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
to um Health and Human Services they
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
have the history on all of this we do
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
not um and we shouldn't have ever taken
 
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
it we did and once we held a hearing
 
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
we're locked into it having said that
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
this to me parallels it's exactly the
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
same um as the situation we had on
 
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
certain mental health issues where the
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
thought was that all the people who were
 
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
primarily involved weren't able on their
 
00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:36.519 align:start position:0%
own to solve the problem even though
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
that's what they're paid to do and
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
instead the legislature should act like
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
the mother and father and say now you
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
must you know you must take your
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
medicine you must do what you're
 
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
supposed to do I don't like playing that
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
role I I really am offended by that role
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
because I expect to have three equal
 
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
branches where we set the
 
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
policy and and the executive branch
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
is and I don't think we're going to
 
00:13:15.189 --> 00:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
accomplish a
 
00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
thing and I've been very clear about
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
that to my to my my caucus I've been
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
clear about that I don't think this is
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
going to accomplish a thing however as I
 
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
see yet again that the um The Campaign
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
that particularly the hospital
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
Association and others has the energy to
 
00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
uh to carry out the campaign to make
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
sure everybody knows about the study and
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
the problems but not to do the solutions
 
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
maybe it's true that they can't do it
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
without us and we ought to acknowledge
 
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
that they're not capable or competent or
 
00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:57.519 align:start position:0%
committed enough to solve their own
 
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
problems and therefore at least what we
 
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
ought to do is pass it have a committee
 
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
have them come in and say the same
 
00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
things they could say without the
 
00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
committee and then end up with
 
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
legislation perhaps that we could
 
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
recommend for the next legislature that
 
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
might be more
 
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.350 align:start position:0%
might be more
um

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
directed in terms of stepping in where
 
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't have to where they should
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
solve it on their own so that's my
 
00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:29.079 align:start position:0%
personal dilemma thank you uh rep
 
00:14:29.079 --> 00:14:30.550 align:start position:0%
personal dilemma thank you uh rep
restive

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
restive
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
Andrew thank you Mr chair I agree with
 
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
the itl I have listened to the hospital
 
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
Association etc
 
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
etc yes there is a problem but they
 
00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
should be solving that problem coming up
 
00:14:48.509 --> 00:14:48.519 align:start position:0%
what needs to be done and bring it to
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature I'm offended that they
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
want a committee and just dump
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
everything on to the legislature and you
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
solve all the problems thanks other
 
00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
people people wish to be heard on this
 
00:15:02.749 --> 00:15:02.759 align:start position:0%
yes representative Stapleton yeah thank
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
you uh Mr
 
00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:07.399 align:start position:0%
chair I know there's problems out there
 
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
I'm personally involved with helping a
 
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:12.839 align:start position:0%
constituent who was a ward of the state
 
00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital and he was stuck
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
there um for want of a bed in a suitable
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
Nursing Care
 
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
Facility um eventually a bed opened up
 
00:15:29.069 --> 00:15:29.079 align:start position:0%
and he was taken pretty much immediately
 
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
because even though there's a backlog in
 
00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Department um they took it
 
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
on a pending
 
00:15:42.509 --> 00:15:42.519 align:start position:0%
nursing basis and I would say that a lot
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
of nursing homes would do that maybe
 
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
some won't um but he was 3 months in a
 
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.910 align:start position:0%
some won't um but he was 3 months in a
pending

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
pending
 
00:15:54.509 --> 00:15:54.519 align:start position:0%
situation and um it it worked out um the
 
00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
other problem now how are we going to do
 
00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
anything about that I I don't I don't
 
00:16:01.309 --> 00:16:01.319 align:start position:0%
understand if there's a backlog in
 
00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and then there's a backlog in
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
DHHS um relative to uh guardianships and
 
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
um the courts backed up on court
 
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
awarding these things uh I don't see how
 
00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:17.959 align:start position:0%
the legislature can do anything with
 
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:19.480 align:start position:0%
that that's got to be from the
 
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
Grassroots ground up solve that problem
 
00:16:26.509 --> 00:16:26.519 align:start position:0%
and uh those are beyond our ability at
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
least those two to do anything me
 
00:16:31.309 --> 00:16:31.319 align:start position:0%
meaningful about it with a committee
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
other comments uh representative tur and
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
katab um yeah so I I intend to vote
 
00:16:42.509 --> 00:16:42.519 align:start position:0%
against the itl motion um again
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
acknowledging all the things that were
 
00:16:48.309 --> 00:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
said probably being correct um you
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
know I think the question of whether or
 
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
not this is or isn't a legislative
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
problem is sort of um not front of mind
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
for me because you know this is a a
 
00:17:01.389 --> 00:17:01.399 align:start position:0%
situation that's evolved over a long
 
00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839 align:start position:0%
time and again coming you know
 
00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:05.079 align:start position:0%
professionally from the world of healthc
 
00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
care access and delivery you know the
 
00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
idea of you know hospital beds sitting
 
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
full and
 
00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
uncompensated you know across the state
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
it you know given our need for resources
 
00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:21.079 align:start position:0%
you know is a big enough issue uh that I
 
00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:24.039 align:start position:0%
think it deserves the attention of all
 
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
possible parties and I feel like the the
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
the commitment here is relative ly low
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
we were told um that there is data and
 
00:17:35.549 --> 00:17:35.559 align:start position:0%
that there is information available
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
that's actionable enough in the time
 
00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
frame that we have to maybe move the
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
ball down the court somewhat and and um
 
00:17:45.549 --> 00:17:45.559 align:start position:0%
you know I don't I don't think the
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
amount of time that's there is enough to
 
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
maybe come up with some comprehensive
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
solution but I I don't see the problem
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
with allowing it to happen right
 
00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.669 align:start position:0%
with allowing it to happen right
representative

00:17:54.669 --> 00:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
chob so I don't disagree that there's a
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
problem I completely agree that there's
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
a problem however
 
00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
I I think it would be more effective if
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
if legislators want to work to fix the
 
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
problem together with with the
 
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
stakeholders got together and did that
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
on their own in the summer rather than
 
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
putting together a formal committee for
 
00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:15.799 align:start position:0%
it because when you put together a for
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
formal committee we have leadership that
 
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
decides who gets assigned what and you
 
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
may even have people that don't even
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
really aren't even interested in this
 
00:18:25.149 --> 00:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
topic forced to sit on it vers you could
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
get I think it would be much more
 
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
effective if people that actually wanted
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
to to take the and put in the work on
 
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
this agree to get together and just and
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
just put it in I just I guess I don't
 
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
see why it needs to be a formal
 
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
committee and then that of
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
course creates a lot
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
more things around it in the sense of
 
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
you've got to meet here and it's got to
 
00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
be in public ver if people meet together
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
without it being a quorum they can meet
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
anywhere they want and they can meet on
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
zoom and I just think that there's a lot
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
more opportunity for people to be able
 
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
to actually address the real problem
 
00:18:56.669 --> 00:18:56.679 align:start position:0%
because I do think it's going to be a
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
lot of work and I don't think that it's
 
00:18:59.630 --> 00:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
something that can just resolve in a
 
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
couple of meetings and I'm not sure
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
depending on who gets put on there their
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
level of commitment to come in for that
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
many meetings so I guess for that reason
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
I think it would be better if it was
 
00:19:12.669 --> 00:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
done informally thank you other other
 
00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:16.039 align:start position:0%
comments um yes representative
 
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
Lonzo um thank you um so I would just
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
like to say I will also be voting
 
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
against the itl because I do feel that
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
this is um a very important issue um
 
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
with um patients um sitting into the um
 
00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:35.559 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms trying to um find a u
 
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
bed placement somewhere else and I think
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
that um it is something that we need to
 
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
look at and we had a a lot of people
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
come with concern over this and I think
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's um really very important um to uh
 
00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
maybe work together um with a study
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
committee and um yes it did come to our
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
committee versus uh going to Health and
 
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
Human Services but since we did hear it
 
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
we have to now um decide on this so
 
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so you know I I know
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
representative Smith I think has
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
requested a brief recess which I'm going
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
to which we of course we will take the
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
before you do that the only thing that
 
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
that I would add as a comment of why I
 
00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
support the itl is I I agree with I
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
think everything that everybody has said
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
you may recall when we had the hearing
 
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
on this matter I was kind of of the
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
impression that that even though I
 
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
agreed with with all of the criticisms
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
that representative Smith had had laid
 
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
out my sense was kind of where some of
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
you are now well yeah this is you know
 
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
they didn't do what they should what
 
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
they should have done but maybe we
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
should just let the have this study
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
committee but as I've thought about
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
it particularly the comments of
 
00:20:54.029 --> 00:20:54.039 align:start position:0%
Representative Smith she pers she
 
00:20:56.669 --> 00:20:56.679 align:start position:0%
persuaded me now to take the position of
 
00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
itl that that I think she would was
 
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
originally at least I was under the
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
impression that she had the would would
 
00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:07.039 align:start position:0%
have supported and here's my
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
concern what what I came away from the
 
00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:15.159 align:start position:0%
hearing with was was the impression that
 
00:21:17.149 --> 00:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
when this bill was in the other it was
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
before the
 
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
Senate the it wasn't that people didn't
 
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
know what Solutions should what the
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
solutions were or what the issues were
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
they were very well um uh elaborated and
 
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
the problem was they couldn't come to an
 
00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799 align:start position:0%
agreement they couldn't come to an
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
agreement on how to solve the problem
 
00:21:41.789 --> 00:21:41.799 align:start position:0%
and so what they decided to do of course
 
00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:44.039 align:start position:0%
Let's Kick the Can down the road we'll
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
have a study commit we'll send it over
 
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
to the house and you know we'll kick the
 
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:49.559 align:start position:0%
can down the road it's not so much that
 
00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
they didn't know what to do but they
 
00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
didn't want to make the hard decisions
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
and so you know that leads me to think
 
00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.310 align:start position:0%
and so you know that leads me to think
that

00:21:59.310 --> 00:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
sorry uh having this study committee is
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
not going to is not going to advance the
 
00:22:07.269 --> 00:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
ball what needs to happen is the
 
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
legislature who has the power to make
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
the law to to change things needs to do
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
it and that's that's what should happen
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
next next year it's too late now but
 
00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
that's what should happen next year is
 
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
there should be some Bill that says
 
00:22:25.789 --> 00:22:25.799 align:start position:0%
we're going to th this is the this is
 
00:22:29.789 --> 00:22:29.799 align:start position:0%
the way we solve this problem and and
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
presumably that will not get you know
 
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
that will not get unanimous support but
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully it will get it will get a
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
majority to come to some solution as
 
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
opposed to us just you know having this
 
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
study committee of us as legislators who
 
00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
are not really in any way experts in
 
00:22:48.669 --> 00:22:48.679 align:start position:0%
this area particularly as representative
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
Smith points out that we're the
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee um so that's why I I
 
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
am going to and I am going to vote for
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
itl but I understand you know
 
00:23:00.269 --> 00:23:00.279 align:start position:0%
frustration that everybody has
 
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
experienced and with that I'm we'll take
 
00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
a brief let me if I could just add one
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
thing remember that there would only be
 
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
two members of the Judiciary Committee
 
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
involve one Democrat and one Republican
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
only two in the committee that's set up
 
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
there so in that sense the plus is only
 
00:23:22.029 --> 00:23:22.039 align:start position:0%
two of us would have to bear the brunt
 
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
the minuses only two of us would be
 
00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
bearing the brunt um the other thing and
 
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:29.919 align:start position:0%
I this is clearly something I should not
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
say and as you all know I frequently say
 
00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:35.720 align:start position:0%
things I should not say and that is as
 
00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
much as I um I thank you for agreeing
 
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
with me representative Paris I
 
00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um uh oh dear the
 
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner's leaving he's afraid I'm
 
00:23:48.669 --> 00:23:48.679 align:start position:0%
going to say something about
 
00:23:48.679 --> 00:23:50.269 align:start position:0%
going to say something about
him

00:23:50.269 --> 00:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
him
 
00:23:50.279 --> 00:23:52.470 align:start position:0%
him
um

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh well now that the laughs are over uh
 
00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
I've been I've been really amused I've
 
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
been annoyed but I'll say amused about
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that this is the time that the
 
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
hospital Association and others have
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
picked to
 
00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
publicize their report on how serious
 
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
this problem is um and indicating you
 
00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:15.159 align:start position:0%
know that they have the data to support
 
00:24:18.909 --> 00:24:18.919 align:start position:0%
it where have they been and to pick it
 
00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
now I have that problem and I will tell
 
00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
you that maybe this has nothing to do
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
with this but I was heart sick to
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
something I should have been aware of
 
00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:33.640 align:start position:0%
that I'm haven't been aware of that
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
CMC is about to go to a for-profit
 
00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:44.120 align:start position:0%
hospital and um if CMC is going to a
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
for-profit hospital um by joining
 
00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
Hospital Corporation of America we're in
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
real trouble and that's part of my
 
00:24:53.789 --> 00:24:53.799 align:start position:0%
concern and that last thing I know I
 
00:24:56.389 --> 00:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have said but I feel it deeply
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
could I ask my Democrat colleagues to
 
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
join us in our luxurious anti room here
 
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
for literally 2 minutes and then we'll
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
be back absolutely we'll take a recess
 
00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:57.230 align:start position:0%

Alexander
 
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
1678 yes all right and um I'd like to uh
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
speak to the motion just very briefly
 
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
um this uh motion would not change the
 
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:34.360 align:start position:0%
part of of 413 that is now um in the
 
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
original bill but it would
 
00:32:38.909 --> 00:32:38.919 align:start position:0%
add uh
 
00:32:41.909 --> 00:32:41.919 align:start position:0%
the the sub the substance the exact
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
substance of of uh House Bill
 
00:32:49.389 --> 00:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
1115 the bill dealing with uh uh
 
00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
termination of tency at the end of the
 
00:32:57.149 --> 00:32:57.159 align:start position:0%
lease to uh the bill as uh Section 8 and
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
it would r number the effective date to
 
00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
uh on the original Bill to section 9 UM
 
00:33:06.669 --> 00:33:06.679 align:start position:0%
as you know the this bill uh the the
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant bill passed the house by
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
a vote of I believe it was 194 to 180
 
00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
which it it seems to me indicates that
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
there was um at least some bipartisan
 
00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
support maybe up to 14 or 15 votes it
 
00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:26.519 align:start position:0%
was a uh not a roll call vote so I don't
 
00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:29.919 align:start position:0%
know for sure um at any rate the Senate
 
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
appears like they have moved in
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
committee at least to interim study it
 
00:33:37.629 --> 00:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
um they did not see the wisdom that the
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh that the house saw in this bill uh
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
perhaps um with this uh uh Amendment to
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
the Pas bill that will persuade them of
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
the wisdom of the uh of the landlord
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
tenant Bill and so that's why I uh offer
 
00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.149 align:start position:0%
tenant Bill and so that's why I uh offer
this

00:33:55.149 --> 00:33:55.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:33:58.590 --> 00:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
amendment anyone yes ask a question of
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
the chair and this will uh present my
 
00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:02.120 align:start position:0%
ignorance to the whole procedure here in
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
my second term so is there a gerus
 
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
question relative to this and how was
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
that sorted out no there there isn't and
 
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is this we can add
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
anything to a Senate bill as long as it
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
was something that has already passed
 
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
the house so this passed the house in
 
00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:24.919 align:start position:0%
EXA word for word and so that's why
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
there's not a gerine gerain is um anyone
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
else wish to be heard on
 
00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:35.599 align:start position:0%
this uh representative Oregon um I I
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
don't remember exactly but the this bill
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
will have a 60-day um effective period
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
so what was the effective period of the
 
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
uh previous tendency bill which we're
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
trying to revive here this well this one
 
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
you know this one has a
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
30-day um oh I'm sorry the when it
 
00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
becomes effective um
 
00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
that it was the same I think it was it
 
00:35:02.589 --> 00:35:02.599 align:start position:0%
was the same yes there's no there was no
 
00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:05.079 align:start position:0%
change in that all right um so that's
 
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
that's it's exactly the same um anyone

all right anyone else wish to speak
 
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you Mr
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
chair I think there's Merit to this bill
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
um happy to support contents of it but I
 
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
actually think the bill would be further
 
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
enhanced by the amendment that just
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
failed so I'm voting against the ought
 
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
to pass right
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
right anyone else wish to heard so I'm I
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
I just want to say I'm I'm also going to
 
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
vote against the motion of ought to pass
 
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
and urge my colleagues to do the same um
 
00:37:42.109 --> 00:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:37:44.589 --> 00:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
um and I understand I understand that
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
people do not agree with the uh with the
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
um with the amendment and I I'm fine
 
00:37:52.829 --> 00:37:52.839 align:start position:0%
with that I guess I would say
 
00:37:56.309 --> 00:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
to I think primarily to my caucus but
 
00:37:58.349 --> 00:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
maybe one maybe speak more broadly to
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
the floor I think we have I think that
 
00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
there is an Institutional interest of
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
the house um
 
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
to um to preserve its position and I
 
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:14.200 align:start position:0%
think we um as I said before the the
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
this bill the the the bill dealing with
 
00:38:20.589 --> 00:38:20.599 align:start position:0%
land tenant passed the house on a on a
 
00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
it wasn't you know a one or two vote
 
00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:25.640 align:start position:0%
margin it was a 14 or 15 vote margin um
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
I think the house has an institution
 
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
interest in uh in preserving its
 
00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:33.800 align:start position:0%
position so I hope that uh my CS at
 
00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:37.079 align:start position:0%
least will vote no on this on this uh
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
OTP so that we can get it to the floor
 
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
um with what I expect will be a 10 to 10
 
00:38:46.829 --> 00:38:46.839 align:start position:0%
vote and then uh take up and debate the
 
00:38:49.309 --> 00:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
uh Amendment on the floor so that's
 
00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%

Senate Bill 4 uh
 
00:40:16.829 --> 00:40:16.839 align:start position:0%
22 uh and the chair recognizes
 
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:49.069 --> 00:40:49.079 align:start position:0%
2024-the wish to speak to your uh
 
00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
motion just briefly thank you
 
00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
so this is simply changing the spots
 
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:01.640 align:start position:0%
where unless it was a medical spot from
 
00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:03.640 align:start position:0%
birth mother to mother and the reason
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
behind that was if somebody is using a
 
00:41:09.309 --> 00:41:09.319 align:start position:0%
surrogate or a gestational carrier that
 
00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:11.079 align:start position:0%
person is the mother but they are not
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
the birth mother um and I just I think
 
00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
that while this bill is seeking to
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
include more people which is wonderful I
 
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to exclude some people that
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
were already included and I think simply
 
00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
saying mother would be inclusive to all
 
00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
situations I did leave birth mother in
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
the places where it medically made sense
 
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
such as the statistical data on if you
 
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
had gave given birth before and if the
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
patient had to be transferred out of the
 
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
hospital to another hospital due to a
 
00:41:40.589 --> 00:41:40.599 align:start position:0%
birth complication of some sort because
 
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
that was very obviously meant to be the
 
00:41:46.109 --> 00:41:46.119 align:start position:0%
person who actually gave birth so uh
 
00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:48.079 align:start position:0%
that's that's really all that this is is
 
00:41:50.349 --> 00:41:50.359 align:start position:0%
changing in there and I think that it's
 
00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
a good idea
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
that we make sure that when we're using
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
mother we're inclusive of of the
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
different families that we might have
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else wish to speak to

00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um this amendment I believe um
 
00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
adopts all of the changes we just made
 
00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:41.480 align:start position:0%
with representative kab's Amendment but
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
further adds house positions that the
 
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
Senate has chosen to um study further um
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
or not study at all um these two
 
00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
positions that have already passed the
 
00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
house include the landlord tenant bill
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%

00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:13.960 align:start position:0%

favorable way to those of us who support
 
00:45:58.510 --> 00:45:58.520 align:start position:0%

urge my colleagues to vote no on uh this
 
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
amendment um so that we as I said are in
 
00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:07.640 align:start position:0%
the most favorable position when the
 
00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
when this matter gets to the floor

you write the report uh favoring the
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
otpa with your Amendment and who will

otpa with your Amendment and who will
write

00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
right not
 
00:47:34.109 --> 00:47:34.119 align:start position:0%
represent right that was a uh it was a
 
00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
TI vote on so that failed right so so on
 
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
otpa it's
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
otpa with
 
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
representative 69
 
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
697 1697
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
right but does but you know right but
 
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't that I mean the the amendment
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
that failed would still go to the floor
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
would it
 
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
not but not on the otpa otpa would be
 
00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:04.990 align:start position:0%
not but not on the otpa otpa would be
only

00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
only
 
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
1697 okay then there would be um a
 
00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:11.800 align:start position:0%
motion of
 
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
OT there would be another motion of
 
00:48:17.589 --> 00:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
otpa with
 
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
1698 right okay and um uh it would be up
 
00:48:26.829 --> 00:48:26.839 align:start position:0%
to the speaker to decide which OTP go
 
00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
goes first I would assume he well I
 
00:48:34.549 --> 00:48:34.559 align:start position:0%
can't speak um he will decide which one
 
00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
goes first but you have we have to have
 
00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:39.160 align:start position:0%
two different performs right right
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
exactly so so there are two different
 
00:48:45.549 --> 00:48:45.559 align:start position:0%
there there's the otpa TPA that right
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
and so um representative kav you will
 
00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
write the one with your Amendment does
 
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
that make
 
00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:54.839 align:start position:0%
sense does represent Kai want to put
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
himself in that position
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
I think if I can jump in I think that
 
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
one caucus has taken a position of otpa
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
with 1698 and one caucus has taken the
 
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
position of otpa with 1697 so um I'm
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
happy to write the report for the the
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
the Republican caucus that has voted
 
00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
with 1698 okay if one of my colleagues
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
across the aisle will write the other
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
report sure that's fine somebody on the
 
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
other side want to write the report for
 
00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:41.030 align:start position:0%
other side want to write the report for
1697

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
um so uh who moved and seconded the the
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
No No the next
 
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
motion Smith so I will do I'm sorry
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
Smith and Horgan yeah yeah that's right
 
00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
I will do o t p a 1697 and Alexander
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
will do
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.079 --> 00:50:20.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
16 and when are these do Mr chair um I'd
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
like to have those I'd like to have them
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
all in tonight by the end of the the end
 
00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
of the day today if we can
 
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
please H hang on just one second let me
 
00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
just give me one second uh
 
00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:54.589 align:start position:0%
just give me one second uh
um

00:50:54.589 --> 00:50:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:59.430 --> 00:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
I I just wanted to clarify one thing
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
that I'm struggling in my head which is
 
00:51:06.789 --> 00:51:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:06.799 --> 00:51:08.910 align:start position:0%
 
otpa

00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
otpa
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
um they will reflect different vote
 
00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
counts because we did did we actually
 
00:51:17.549 --> 00:51:17.559 align:start position:0%
take an otpa vote on the first on the
 
00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment or the first amendment
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
I should say yes did both we did on both
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
the first one first
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
one p 20 to the first Amendment right
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
but did we actually vote the bill that
 
00:51:33.069 --> 00:51:33.079 align:start position:0%
yes yes we did okay all right right we
 
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:41.789 --> 00:51:41.799 align:start position:0%
um all right
 
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
so I'm purely speculating here but we
 
00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
didn't vote we didn't vote otpa on the
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
second on the Second Amendment because
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
it it had failed failed I'm sorry yes it
 
00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:55.559 align:start position:0%
failed so that was actually what I meant
 
00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:06.789 --> 00:52:06.799 align:start position:0%
so okay okay am and then the bill the
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
bill okay right all right
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
so all right
 
00:52:15.309 --> 00:52:15.319 align:start position:0%
the specul here but the disagreement was
 
00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:17.720 align:start position:0%
of course over the landlord tenant thing
 
00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:19.240 align:start position:0%
that was snuck in but probably the court
 
00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:22.280 align:start position:0%
reporter thing I maybe I shouldn't say
 
00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
that for sure but probably that has
 
00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:25.640 align:start position:0%
bipartisan supports so if we get
 
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
deadlocked on the floor there's always
 
00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
the option probably to divide the
 
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
question and take out that landlord
 
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
tenant thing and that would probably I
 
00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
but that's like but that's like a few
 
00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
days away so it's probably not for me to
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
worry about but I just mentioned that is
 
00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
just thinking ahead strategically like
 
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.230 align:start position:0%
just thinking ahead strategically like
it's

00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
probably right I I'm pretty sure our
 
00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
caucus doesn't mind the court reporter
 
00:52:50.349 --> 00:52:50.359 align:start position:0%
part we all I think we all voted for it
 
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
before I don't think you can speak no I
 
00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
can't sorry you're right yeah just speak
 
00:52:57.789 --> 00:52:57.799 align:start position:0%
s yeah yeah we that's true we have it
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
representative Manos I I also have a
 
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
procedural question um if representative
 
00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:18.440 align:start position:0%
okay all right any other all right so
 
00:53:21.789 --> 00:53:21.799 align:start position:0%
we're ready to move on then to uh Senate
 
00:53:21.799 --> 00:53:23.390 align:start position:0%
we're ready to move on then to uh Senate
Bill

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.910 align:start position:0%
Bill
462

00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
462
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
um and the
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh chair recognizes uh representative
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
trip for a motion I uh move interim
 
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
study is there a second for
 
00:53:40.829 --> 00:53:40.839 align:start position:0%
that second all right um representative
 
00:53:43.549 --> 00:53:43.559 align:start position:0%
trip do you wish to speak to your motion
 
00:53:46.589 --> 00:53:46.599 align:start position:0%
well I remember two and a half hours of
 
00:53:50.109 --> 00:53:50.119 align:start position:0%
testimony on this and uh it's it's clear
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
to me that uh uh there's
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
some uh attention as to you know
 
00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh what the problem is and what the
 
00:54:05.549 --> 00:54:05.559 align:start position:0%
solution is so I I believe that uh an
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
interim study uh committee would help to
 
00:54:10.789 --> 00:54:10.799 align:start position:0%
resolve these
 
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
problems anyone else representative
 
00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
tur uh yeah i' also speak in favor of
 
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
interim study um you know we heard a lot
 
00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
of testimony about what could have or
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
maybe should have been done by way of
 
00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:27.349 align:start position:0%
maybe should have been done by way of
prior

00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
prior
 
00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
analysis um in terms of Actuarial
 
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
studies around the impacts of you know
 
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
changing this law we heard fairly
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
Divergent um discussion about what that
 
00:54:41.789 --> 00:54:41.799 align:start position:0%
impact might be in the absence of an
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
actu study um you know from minimal to
 
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
nothing to you know catastrophic um so
 
00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
everyone seem to acknowledge that
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
the um the number that was in the amend
 
00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
bill from the Senate was not a number
 
00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
that came from any particular place
 
00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
other than a desire to walk back a full
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
you know uh repeal of the cap um and
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
so uh I would like to see that Actuarial
 
00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
study done you know particularly whether
 
00:55:15.789 --> 00:55:15.799 align:start position:0%
or not the hospital Association and
 
00:55:17.549 --> 00:55:17.559 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth and the others that came you
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
know from the from the provider side on
 
00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
the medical aspects of liability
 
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
concerned um if if you know given given
 
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
the loss of half of the maternity Wards
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
in in the state over the last you know
 
00:55:36.829 --> 00:55:36.839 align:start position:0%
couple of decades um I I I feel like
 
00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
moving forward with this without that
 
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
knowledge would be difficult and I would
 
00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:42.559 align:start position:0%
hope and I know there's been some
 
00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
questions about what this study would
 
00:55:46.349 --> 00:55:46.359 align:start position:0%
actually do that it would take into
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
account not just the change to the cap
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
on the death um versus the disability
 
00:55:57.069 --> 00:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
side of things but all the different
 
00:55:59.910 --> 00:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
variations that we heard in terms of how
 
00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:00.990 align:start position:0%
variations that we heard in terms of how
New

00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:56:04.829 --> 00:56:04.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's um Los of
 
00:56:09.309 --> 00:56:09.319 align:start position:0%
Consortium um rules operate versus other
 
00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:11.240 align:start position:0%
states because it sounded like there was
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
not just an upside potential for
 
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
insurance rates but everyone seemed to
 
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
agree the insurance rates are too high
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
you know overall and becoming
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
unaffordable and if there's a downside
 
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see that Actuarial analysis
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
take that into account as well all right
 
00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
other other representative Smith thank
 
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair I actually
 
00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
delighted to see sitting in the audience
 
00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:37.960 align:start position:0%
um the commissioner of the Department of
 
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
Insurance I'm always happy to see him
 
00:56:42.109 --> 00:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
haven't seen him for a number of years
 
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
um but I don't really have a question
 
00:56:47.309 --> 00:56:47.319 align:start position:0%
that I could ask him in All In you know
 
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
in in all honesty so I'm just going to
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
enjoy the fact that he's here and say
 
00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
that this to me is a Redux of discussion
 
00:56:59.829 --> 00:56:59.839 align:start position:0%
we had just a few minutes ago and that
 
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
is of the
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
Departments and supposedly in the
 
00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:08.200 align:start position:0%
executive branch of governor of of
 
00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
government playing Mommy mayi with the
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
legislature when they're not willing to
 
00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
do what they are expected to do we've
 
00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
heard that there is a highly competent
 
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
staff in the insurance department who
 
00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:27.400 align:start position:0%
could have done the study that we're
 
00:57:31.069 --> 00:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
waiting for and then they also we've
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
also been told that there in fact is a
 
00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
study that does have numbers but somehow
 
00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
isn't quite ready to get to us it's
 
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
exactly the same thing that the hospital
 
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
Association has said to us in another
 
00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:49.240 align:start position:0%
context and um uh there there 20 of us
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
on this committee not one of us is Henny
 
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
Penney the sky is not falling there is
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
no reason to believe believe and there's
 
00:57:59.870 --> 00:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
no evidence anywhere that has been
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
presented to us that the insurance rates
 
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
are going to go up or down based on
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
whether we take a number that was
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
appropriate many many years ago and try
 
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
taking a very small step to bring that
 
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
number into um into the current uh uh
 
00:58:27.309 --> 00:58:27.319 align:start position:0%
world that we live in um I don't know
 
00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:31.400 align:start position:0%
what we would do um in interim study in
 
00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
the next few months what would change I
 
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:36.839 align:start position:0%
don't know how we're going to be able to
 
00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:39.400 align:start position:0%
get the Departments that are involved to
 
00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:41.480 align:start position:0%
grow up and take responsibility for what
 
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
they ought to be doing um and so um on
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
that basis I don't know why we don't
 
00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
just uh go or to pass and if somebody
 
00:58:57.390 --> 00:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
can show me anything substantive that
 
00:58:59.430 --> 00:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
indicates this is the wrong thing to do
 
00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
I will change my vote immediately but at
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
at the moment
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
um uh at least we ought to do something
 
00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
and this would be doing something thank
 
00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
you right other representative
 
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
Perez representative Smith I agree with
 
00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:19.470 align:start position:0%
Perez representative Smith I agree with
you

00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:59:22.029 --> 00:59:22.039 align:start position:0%
100% don't fall over
 
00:59:22.039 --> 00:59:23.990 align:start position:0%
100% don't fall over
dead

00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
dead
 
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
um we did have test testimony that said
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
other states have done this and that
 
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
testimony was brought to us showing that
 
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
their insurance rates did not
 
00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily go up and in some cases went
 
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
down so my feeling about waiting around
 
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
and waiting to see you know you can get
 
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
don't get me started on you know it
 
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
depends on what question you ask to get
 
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
what you want that um um I just think
 
00:59:59.029 --> 00:59:59.039 align:start position:0%
you're right they have numbers they
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
didn't present them numbers in other
 
01:00:03.870 --> 01:00:03.880 align:start position:0%
states were presented in the meantime in
 
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
the meantime we have people who could be
 
01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:13.160 align:start position:0%
getting what they might deserve to get
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
that are not getting it so I know my um
 
01:00:19.109 --> 01:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
committee heads are not happy with me
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
but I definitely believe that there's no
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
point no point at all in holding off on
 
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
this if they want to come back and amend
 
01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
it later fine let them but my car rates
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
have gone up and I don't get in an
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
accident nobody cares about that so I'd
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
rather go after the insurance companies
 
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
for that thank
 
01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
you uh yes representative Paige I agree
 
01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:44.359 align:start position:0%
with representative
 
01:00:44.359 --> 01:00:46.109 align:start position:0%
with representative
Perez

01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:46.119 align:start position:0%
Perez
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
representative um well there's a
 
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
tradeoff with any type of insurance so
 
01:00:53.029 --> 01:00:53.039 align:start position:0%
the less benefits so the less ins value
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
insurance has the at least in theory the
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
cheaper you can make the price but um I
 
01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:01.799 align:start position:0%
think this uh I think this pill would uh
 
01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
people who suffer these damages would be
 
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
getting more would be getting like more
 
01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:08.680 align:start position:0%
in compensation for a loss which really
 
01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
no amount of money can compensate you
 
01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
for a s that's a positive thing which
 
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
was never really mentioned by those who
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
are saying oh insurance rates will
 
01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
Skyrock and I certainly just noticed
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
that nobody
 
01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:22.839 align:start position:0%
said which something we could have done
 
01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
it would have been a Germaine Amendment
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
oh we should eliminate this and then and
 
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
insurance rates are going to plunge you
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
know nobody was saying that so I I I
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
think uh I think this does uh get more
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
money for people who suffer these
 
01:01:39.069 --> 01:01:39.079 align:start position:0%
damages it still isn't enough so I think
 
01:01:40.829 --> 01:01:40.839 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's a good bill whether or
 
01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
not you know we could have a discussion
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
about whether or not that was the
 
01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate amount to raise it by but
 
01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
certainly hasn't been changed in what
 
01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
since 1997 so raising it somewhat my
 
01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
opinion is appropriate even if it does
 
01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:54.839 align:start position:0%
cause insurance rates to Skyrocket which
 
01:01:57.549 --> 01:01:57.559 align:start position:0%
they're already doing any anyway so I
 
01:02:00.589 --> 01:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
think it's a good bill so representative
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
ma thank you Mr chair um I was reviewing
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
the testimony in front of the um Senate
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee on this bill and at
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
that point um commissioner beton Court
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
said an Actuarial team will take a look
 
01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
at the underwriting factors and that was
 
01:02:23.549 --> 01:02:23.559 align:start position:0%
on February 6th if I uh yes February 6th
 
01:02:26.269 --> 01:02:26.279 align:start position:0%
so um we heard testimony that that
 
01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
hasn't been done yet from the insurance
 
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
department and again um if they had that
 
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
information it should have been forth
 
01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
coming by now um and so I uh I
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
definitely support this
 
01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
bill and would oppose interim study all
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
right anyone else wish to be heard so I
 
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
guess what I say is I'm going to support
 
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
the interim study um for a couple of
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
reasons first of all as I said at the
 
01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
hearing I'm I am at least skeptical of
 
01:03:00.269 --> 01:03:00.279 align:start position:0%
the um of the impact that this will have
 
01:03:04.269 --> 01:03:04.279 align:start position:0%
on insurance uh rates but I think it is
 
01:03:07.269 --> 01:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
true that insurance rates are under
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
pressure whether this you know this
 
01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
might be just a um a small factor of
 
01:03:15.549 --> 01:03:15.559 align:start position:0%
that but there I think we've all seen
 
01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
that that that rates have gone up um
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
where we have the insurance industry and
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
the insurance department and I you know
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that we as as I think we
 
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
heard at the hearing the insurance
 
01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
department it's not as if they were
 
01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
sitting around and the only thing they
 
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
had to do was work on an Actuarial study
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
in this case they have a lot of other
 
01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:39.559 align:start position:0%
work that they do and so I'm not you
 
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
know would it have been better if they
 
01:03:43.269 --> 01:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
had been far if they had been further
 
01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
along sure I guess I could say that but
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that I'm ready to make a
 
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
decision on supporting an increase in
 
01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
the in this area uh without hearing from
 
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
them when you know know it's been uh if
 
01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
if we put this off till next year before
 
01:04:02.029 --> 01:04:02.039 align:start position:0%
acting I don't think it's the it's the
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
end of the world and I think
 
01:04:06.549 --> 01:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
particularly along with with rep what
 
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
representative tur said particularly in
 
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
the area of professional liability like
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice and that kind of
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
thing I think we have to be very
 
01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:18.839 align:start position:0%
concerned not just about rates but about
 
01:04:21.269 --> 01:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
availability of that kind of insurance
 
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh we sort of went through that kind of
 
01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
thing of 20 years ago or whatever it was
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
um and I don't think we want to have
 
01:04:32.589 --> 01:04:32.599 align:start position:0%
that happen um again the last point I
 
01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
would make on this is I think that the
 
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that as I just said
 
01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
one of the things that gives me some
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
skepticism about whether this will be a
 
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
big rate increase in the end um the the
 
01:04:51.269 --> 01:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
flip side of that is that
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
I the idea that if the if we don't
 
01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
increase the rates for this kind of loss
 
01:05:01.309 --> 01:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
of Consortium coverage that this is a
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
you know a
 
01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
huge uh miscarriage of Justice I really
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
take that with with with something of a
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
grain of salt because as we heard this
 
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
is the if a person dies they're they're
 
01:05:17.309 --> 01:05:17.319 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able to co recover
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
their damages in their own right
 
01:05:22.029 --> 01:05:22.039 align:start position:0%
normally the people that benefit from
 
01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
that are the same people who would
 
01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
benefit from loss of Consortium there
 
01:05:29.829 --> 01:05:29.839 align:start position:0%
are honic damages that are available um
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
on the issue of uh you know the the the
 
01:05:36.589 --> 01:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
issue of the of the person who is not uh
 
01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:39.079 align:start position:0%
employed remember the value of the
 
01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
damages is earning capacity not earnings
 
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
so that um that can often make a
 
01:05:48.029 --> 01:05:48.039 align:start position:0%
difference at any rate for all of those
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
reasons I think the interim study is the
 
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing to do what I would say
 
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
is this if we do vote for interim study
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
and um we're back here next year and
 
01:06:02.829 --> 01:06:02.839 align:start position:0%
there is not an Actuarial study
 
01:06:06.069 --> 01:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
available to us
 
01:06:08.829 --> 01:06:08.839 align:start position:0%
um if I'm back here anyway I know what
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
my vote is going to be at that point so
 
01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:12.839 align:start position:0%
hopefully the message uh the message
 
01:06:15.269 --> 01:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
goes out that we need the interim study
 
01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
and we need it quickly I mean we need
 
01:06:19.349 --> 01:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
the the Actuarial study and we need it
 
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
quickly representative Smith thank you I
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
do agree that we need the actual AAL
 
01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
study I do agree that we need to make
 
01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
sure that um we do just the facts ma'am
 
01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
I give the example of the statement that
 
01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
was made very strongly about why York
 
01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
hospital closed um its uh its maternity
 
01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
Division and the uh the very clear and
 
01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
specific statement made by York Hospital
 
01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
as to why they closed it that had
 
01:06:50.269 --> 01:06:50.279 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with insurance it had to
 
01:06:52.589 --> 01:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
do with other issues that that that
 
01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
we're aware of um so it's I I always
 
01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
want to have just the facts ma'am and
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
that we're not getting the facts has
 
01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with whether we could it
 
01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
has to do with the willingness for
 
01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:11.480 align:start position:0%
example if you check the um
 
01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh the profit I I I'm I'm not opposing
 
01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
the capitalist system I think it's fine
 
01:07:20.589 --> 01:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
and the rules are fine and there's
 
01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong with insurance companies
 
01:07:25.789 --> 01:07:25.799 align:start position:0%
making a profit but they are making a
 
01:07:28.029 --> 01:07:28.039 align:start position:0%
profit and they're making the profit
 
01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
while pretending that the sky is stating
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
that the sky is falling and it's not
 
01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
falling and that's why I I'm supporting
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill and if it comes to
 
01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:42.839 align:start position:0%
pass that there's facts to show us
 
01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
that's something different then let's
 
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
act on those facts thank you all right
 
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
Perez we just
 
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
passed letting Physicians assistance
 
01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
have their own
 
01:08:01.349 --> 01:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
practice which I fought against because
 
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
you want to talk about insurance rates
 
01:08:06.269 --> 01:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
going up for you brought up hospital for
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
liability those are going to go up like
 
01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
crazy because of doing that and I didn't
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
see the insurance companies out fighting
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
that so I find that it's very
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
interesting that they're fighting so
 
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
hard on something that in my opinion
 
01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
appears to just be right and too
 
01:08:29.309 --> 01:08:29.319 align:start position:0%
old representative tur
 
01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
yes just turned it off just one more um
 
01:08:37.709 --> 01:08:37.719 align:start position:0%
thought on on sort of the the reason for
 
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
the interim study and I guess for me and
 
01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
believe me I'm not an expert on how
 
01:08:43.309 --> 01:08:43.319 align:start position:0%
insurance rates are are are set and
 
01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
approved um and the commissioner can
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
certainly correct me if I'm incorrect um
 
01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
but we heard a number of insurance
 
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
companies basically claiming that their
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
um assessment is that this would cause a
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
potential rate increase which to me
 
01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
makes me wonder are they then going to
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
apply for rate increases to um you know
 
01:09:10.189 --> 01:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
to account for that in the absence of an
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
Actuarial study you know by the
 
01:09:15.070 --> 01:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
insurance department that basically can
 
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
refute that if in fact the there is not
 
01:09:21.070 --> 01:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
a rate increase I worry that you know
 
01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
the studies by the insurers to support
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
their rate increases might result in
 
01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
rates going up because we don't have any
 
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
information to um question or counter
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
that so that is my reason partly for um
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
supporting the the interim study before
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
going forward with this uh
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton thank you Mr
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
chair um I'm really conflicted with this
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
bill on the one hand um a life um lost
 
01:09:55.709 --> 01:09:55.719 align:start position:0%
and Consortium should be at least um
 
01:09:58.830 --> 01:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
commensurate to the loss in in some
 
01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:00.630 align:start position:0%
commensurate to the loss in in some
measurable

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
measurable
 
01:10:05.310 --> 01:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
fashion um and inflation has hit uh the
 
01:10:07.950 --> 01:10:07.960 align:start position:0%
the limits already stated in in the bill
 
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
in the law um just like everything
 
01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
else on the other hand um looking at the
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
testimony there was a predominance of
 
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
opposition to this and being myself in
 
01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
the having been in the insurance
 
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
industry while you can get uh primary
 
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
coverage um pretty well anything over a
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
million or two in some circumstances has
 
01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
to go to
 
01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
reinsurance and there's where the big
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
uncertainty is um and it can run the
 
01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
gamut of reasonable to excessive uh and
 
01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a open market um it's it's
 
01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
uh difficult to get reinsurance on
 
01:10:56.350 --> 01:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
extended liability limits and if this
 
01:10:58.990 --> 01:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
bill were to push this over into that
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
category there could be some devastating
 
01:11:04.669 --> 01:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
Insurance impacts on
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
premiums I think we need the information
 
01:11:10.110 --> 01:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
and I would like to see further study
 
01:11:13.390 --> 01:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
impact and the Actuarial study and so
 
01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:16.280 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go for the interim study
 
01:11:17.950 --> 01:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
further com yes representative Alexander
 
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I think um I agree
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
with representative Stapleton I think a
 
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
true interm study is important on this
 
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
um I've had separate Sation with the
 
01:11:27.709 --> 01:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioner and he indicated
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
that um he has one actuary on staff so
 
01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost if if they wanted to
 
01:11:35.950 --> 01:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
do the study it would cost almost
 
01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
$100,000 to um Farm it out externally to
 
01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
have them do that study so I think if
 
01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature legislature Works in
 
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
tandem with the insurance department and
 
01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
we study it as well and have a true
 
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
interm study I think maybe next year we
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
can come back with um something that can
 
01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
raise maybe raise depending on the study
 
01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
um the the awards so I I think like if
 
01:12:00.189 --> 01:12:00.199 align:start position:0%
we if we study it for real I think that
 
01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
we could uh maybe get to a consensus all
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:10.629 --> 01:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
Andrew thank you Mr chair I'm conflicted
 
01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
with this whole
 
01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
bill I was in favor of inim study but
 
01:12:20.110 --> 01:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
listening to everyone and thinking about
 
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
it we do not live in the Middle Ages
 
01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
it used to be to get information and I
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
know this for a fact because I go back
 
01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
then you had to
 
01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
maybe call somebody on the phone or you
 
01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
may have had to go into some department
 
01:12:44.669 --> 01:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
and look for information today is a
 
01:12:44.679 --> 01:12:47.030 align:start position:0%
and look for information today is a
datadriven

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
datadriven
 
01:12:50.070 --> 01:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
country I just don't
 
01:12:52.629 --> 01:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
believe that this information that we're
 
01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
all looking for hasn't been presented
 
01:12:58.830 --> 01:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
to us I mean I I don't look for excuses
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
because I don't accept
 
01:13:04.669 --> 01:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
them here's been three months and we
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
when this came before us I swear we have
 
01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
no more information now than when it was
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
introduced in the
 
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
Senate and how do we know that this
 
01:13:16.229 --> 01:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
summer if there's such an issue coming
 
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
up with figures how do we know that an
 
01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:22.280 align:start position:0%
interim study would even uh even count
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
or just be a waste of everybody's time
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
right now I'm going to vote against
 
01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
instrum study and I may even vote
 
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
against the bill and they can bring it
 
01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
back next year when somebody can come
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
forward with a lot more information
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
thank you all right any other yes
 
01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:41.629 align:start position:0%
thank you all right any other yes
representative

01:13:41.629 --> 01:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:13:44.629 --> 01:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
gon thank you Mr chair one of the
 
01:13:48.149 --> 01:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
advantages for an interim study would be
 
01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
that we can get it right the first
 
01:13:54.669 --> 01:13:54.679 align:start position:0%
time um there would be a hesitance if we
 
01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
pass the bill now there would be a
 
01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
hesitance to make any changes that might
 
01:14:03.669 --> 01:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
be reasonable next term but we just
 
01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
passed the bill let's see how this plays
 
01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
out we may discover with with additional
 
01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
information that we can repeal the
 
01:14:12.910 --> 01:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
limits entirely and not be adversely
 
01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
affected uh but well no we've already
 
01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
put a limit on it and so then you'd get
 
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
the push back well you've passed this
 
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
limit let's let's see what happens so I
 
01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
think we let's get one bill let's get it
 
01:14:27.189 --> 01:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:28.629 --> 01:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
put put the insurance commission on the
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
hook say get us the information if you
 
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
don't get the information then we're
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
just going to repeal the
 
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
limit other comments All right we guess
 
01:14:39.629 --> 01:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
we're ready for a vote so the the motion
 
01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
before interm study on Senate Bill 462
 
01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
and i' would ask the clerk to call the
 
01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:49.360 align:start position:0%

trip the uh the problem I have with this
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
is there's really no objetive evidence
 
01:16:35.790 --> 01:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
for why the uh amounts were set to where
 
01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:36.629 align:start position:0%
for why the uh amounts were set to where
they

01:16:36.629 --> 01:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:16:36.639 --> 01:16:38.390 align:start position:0%
they
were

01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:43.750 align:start position:0%
uh the
U

01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
U
 
01:16:46.510 --> 01:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
uh there's several States I understand
 
01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
that have uh no limits which would make
 
01:16:53.550 --> 01:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
more sense to me since then the amount
 
01:16:56.590 --> 01:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
would have to be argued out in Court you
 
01:16:58.750 --> 01:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
rather than just you know some number
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
that was you know picked out of the
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
stratosphere so uh that's essentially
 
01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
why I'm going to oppose uh H to pass
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else wish to be
 
01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
heard all right so I guess we're the
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
motion then before us is ought to pass
 
01:17:18.790 --> 01:17:18.800 align:start position:0%

you okay all right we're now on to um
 
01:18:46.750 --> 01:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill uh Senate Bill 507 extending
 
01:18:50.669 --> 01:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
the time to petition for uh a a new
 
01:18:55.550 --> 01:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
trial in certain cases and um
 
01:18:57.149 --> 01:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
representative Manos you have a motion
 
01:18:59.189 --> 01:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
is that correct yes uh I have an
 
01:19:01.510 --> 01:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
amendment which I circulated yesterday
 
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:04.229 --> 01:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
all right so um represent man are you
 
01:20:09.790 --> 01:20:09.800 align:start position:0%
moving your motion I am all right and do
 
01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
right Smith and representative Manos do
 
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your motion uh yes
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
briely um Mr chair um the purpose of my
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
motion is to add to the Senate bill um
 
01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
removing the time limit on filing a
 
01:20:39.550 --> 01:20:39.560 align:start position:0%
motion for a new trial adding uh civil
 
01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
cases um uh and again this is based on
 
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
newly discovered evidence or additional
 
01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
forensic testing or new scientific
 
01:20:51.390 --> 01:20:51.400 align:start position:0%
understanding um the reason I propose my
 
01:20:54.189 --> 01:20:54.199 align:start position:0%
amendment is because it seems to me in
 
01:20:54.199 --> 01:20:55.669 align:start position:0%
amendment is because it seems to me in
Congress

01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
Congress
 
01:20:58.590 --> 01:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
um to have the situation where somebody
 
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
could be exonerated of a crime for
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
example rape and um and um
 
01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
assault uh based on newly discovered
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
evidence for example DNA testing
 
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
evolving um and that same person having
 
01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
been found um civil liable um and in
 
01:21:25.229 --> 01:21:25.239 align:start position:0%
that case not being able to f a motion
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
for a new trial based on the same change
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
in scientific evidence or scientific
 
01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
understanding um it also seems in um uh
 
01:21:39.390 --> 01:21:39.400 align:start position:0%
in congruous to me that for example a
 
01:21:42.629 --> 01:21:42.639 align:start position:0%
person would be exonerated of the crime
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
but still be liable to pay a judgment
 
01:21:48.189 --> 01:21:48.199 align:start position:0%
when there would be scientific evidence
 
01:21:51.790 --> 01:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
that um that showed that the person did
 
01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
not commit um the act for which they
 
01:21:58.950 --> 01:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
have been held civil liable um and so
 
01:22:03.149 --> 01:22:03.159 align:start position:0%
for that reason I propose that both um
 
01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
um that both a judgment in a civil case
 
01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
as well as a criminal conviction be um
 
01:22:14.669 --> 01:22:14.679 align:start position:0%
applicable for um filing a motion for a
 
01:22:17.709 --> 01:22:17.719 align:start position:0%
new trial without a time limit for new
 
01:22:19.870 --> 01:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence right is there
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak to this so I'm
 
01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
going to i' I've say I'm I'm going to
 
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
oppose the motion for a couple of
 
01:22:32.189 --> 01:22:32.199 align:start position:0%
reasons I mean basically because I I I
 
01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
hope that we will end up getting to
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
interim study on the bill itself but um
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
with regard to the particular Amendment
 
01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
um I I sort of understand where where
 
01:22:45.709 --> 01:22:45.719 align:start position:0%
you're coming from uh representative man
 
01:22:47.709 --> 01:22:47.719 align:start position:0%
but I think that it there's a I think
 
01:22:51.149 --> 01:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
that there's a problem in trying to
 
01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
equate criminal liability with civil
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
liability and criminal what we're
 
01:22:58.030 --> 01:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
talking about generally with with with
 
01:22:59.430 --> 01:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
regard to somebody who's been convicted
 
01:23:01.229 --> 01:23:01.239 align:start position:0%
and normally it doesn't have to be but
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
usually it's somebody been convicted of
 
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
a serious crime as and is in jail you C
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
you want to get that person a new trial
 
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
um or maybe even a dismissal but at
 
01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
least a new trial in the hopes that they
 
01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
would be found not guilty and wouldn't
 
01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
would no longer be in jail in the Civil
 
01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:20.950 align:start position:0%
would no longer be in jail in the Civil
context

01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
context
 
01:23:23.310 --> 01:23:23.320 align:start position:0%
though you I think it's a much different
 
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
situation because you're talking about
 
01:23:27.229 --> 01:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
private rights so let's
 
01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
assume that I that you know party a
 
01:23:34.350 --> 01:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
brings a lawsuit against party B and
 
01:23:39.310 --> 01:23:39.320 align:start position:0%
recovers a million dollars um and then
 
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
sometime after three years later uh
 
01:23:44.669 --> 01:23:44.679 align:start position:0%
there's some newly discovered evidence
 
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh well you know it's a much different
 
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
story to say we're gonna claw back I
 
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:52.639 align:start position:0%
mean suppose you know I suppose I've
 
01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
recovered a million dollars from you and
 
01:23:59.149 --> 01:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
three years later we find some um some
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh that says some new evidence it's a it
 
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
seems to me it's a much different situ I
 
01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
mean you know if I've if if I've used
 
01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
some of that money to send my kids to
 
01:24:12.990 --> 01:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
college or whatever I mean I it
 
01:24:15.149 --> 01:24:15.159 align:start position:0%
depending on how long has gone by it
 
01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
seems to me there are many many
 
01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
different factors that might enter into
 
01:24:20.719 --> 01:24:22.350 align:start position:0%
different factors that might enter into
that

01:24:22.350 --> 01:24:22.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:24:25.950 --> 01:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
uh that would go beyond simply was the
 
01:24:29.070 --> 01:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
person liable originally so I have
 
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
problems with with that U but more
 
01:24:35.149 --> 01:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
broadly the the the the other issue I
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
think with regard to with regard to this
 
01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
whole bill is it's really important to
 
01:24:46.229 --> 01:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
understand that the the
 
01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:49.400 align:start position:0%
um the remedy that this seeks for
 
01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:52.639 align:start position:0%
criminal cases of a new trial is not in
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
the overall scheme of things very
 
01:24:56.590 --> 01:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
important because there is the
 
01:24:58.750 --> 01:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
alternative avenue available of habius
 
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
Corpus and you might recall that when I
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
asked that of the witness the witness
 
01:25:05.709 --> 01:25:05.719 align:start position:0%
said well you know habus Corpus cases
 
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
are your are usually brought in the
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
district where the institution is
 
01:25:11.790 --> 01:25:11.800 align:start position:0%
located so if you're serving a sentence
 
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
in uh you know in the prison in Berlin
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
you would bring the case in Coos County
 
01:25:18.189 --> 01:25:18.199 align:start position:0%
Superior Court where as a motion for new
 
01:25:20.990 --> 01:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
trial would be brought where the trial
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
was held which might be Manchester as an
 
01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:25.030 align:start position:0%
was held which might be Manchester as an
example

01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:25:28.030 --> 01:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
that that kind of issue is a big issue
 
01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
in federal court
 
01:25:32.990 --> 01:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
proceedings um there where where habus
 
01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
Corpus motions are brought where the
 
01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
institution is so you know when I was in
 
01:25:39.669 --> 01:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
the US attorne of in New Hampshire that
 
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
Danbury was was often the closest
 
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
institution and so often um uh even for
 
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire prisoners uh they often
 
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
went to the federal correctional
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
institute in Danbury and so cases would
 
01:25:53.390 --> 01:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
be brought in the havest cases in the
 
01:25:55.229 --> 01:25:55.239 align:start position:0%
federal court in Connect
 
01:25:58.470 --> 01:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
um whereas another kind of motion which
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
is in the federal system is known as a
 
01:26:03.229 --> 01:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
2255 motion would come to the original
 
01:26:06.390 --> 01:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
court but that's not that whole issue is
 
01:26:09.149 --> 01:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
not really an issue in state practice
 
01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
because the courts have ample authority
 
01:26:15.109 --> 01:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
to transfer cases around they can always
 
01:26:16.990 --> 01:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
send it back to the original judge and
 
01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
often do that um in uh in in habus
 
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
Corpus cases depending on the issues
 
01:26:26.510 --> 01:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
that are raised so at any rate that's a
 
01:26:28.510 --> 01:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
long way of
 
01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
saying I I don't have a problem with the
 
01:26:36.229 --> 01:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
idea at least in criminal cases of
 
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
extending the the three-year limitation
 
01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
but I think if we're going to I I think
 
01:26:44.709 --> 01:26:44.719 align:start position:0%
it should be referred to interim study
 
01:26:47.070 --> 01:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
because there's a problem with our
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
habius Corpus statutes too uh our case
 
01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
law on hius Corpus is really kind of all
 
01:26:55.229 --> 01:26:55.239 align:start position:0%
over the place and if we were going to
 
01:26:58.030 --> 01:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
do if we were going to change this I
 
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
think it would make much more sense to
 
01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
have us take a look at the whole
 
01:27:02.719 --> 01:27:04.750 align:start position:0%
have us take a look at the whole
postconviction

01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
postconviction
 
01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
relief uh system which would include
 
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
habius Corpus um and so I think that
 
01:27:17.109 --> 01:27:17.119 align:start position:0%
um changing this right now is a bad idea
 
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
and I think that just making the change
 
01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
from civil to to add civil I think that
 
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
there are we would potentially be facing
 
01:27:29.470 --> 01:27:29.480 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences here that could
 
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
be could be significant so I I will be
 
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
voting against the
 
01:27:36.669 --> 01:27:36.679 align:start position:0%
amendment representative
 
01:27:39.149 --> 01:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
tur I I have a question and it's
 
01:27:41.109 --> 01:27:41.119 align:start position:0%
probably more of the technical nature so
 
01:27:43.629 --> 01:27:43.639 align:start position:0%
I may be addressing it to you or anyone
 
01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
else in the in the instance of a civil
 
01:27:51.270 --> 01:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
case not tied to some also criminal case
 
01:27:54.510 --> 01:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
um is there is there history of civil
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
cases being
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
overturned um and if so would the person
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
who received the initial
 
01:28:06.109 --> 01:28:06.119 align:start position:0%
award essentially now be liable for the
 
01:28:08.109 --> 01:28:08.119 align:start position:0%
entire amount that they were were
 
01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:10.719 align:start position:0%
awarded you know in other words to your
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
point if they do not have it would this
 
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
person who thought they had received an
 
01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:17.719 align:start position:0%
award from the court system through a
 
01:28:21.070 --> 01:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
trial now be essentially in the position
 
01:28:23.189 --> 01:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
of having to pay back resources that
 
01:28:26.590 --> 01:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
might they might leave them in a in a
 
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
deficit if that made sense you know it
 
01:28:32.229 --> 01:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
it does and I think I mean I think it
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
is it is very
 
01:28:38.189 --> 01:28:38.199 align:start position:0%
rare in civil litigation particularly
 
01:28:40.189 --> 01:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
where a case has you know been tried
 
01:28:42.270 --> 01:28:42.280 align:start position:0%
there's been a trial and a verdict in a
 
01:28:46.270 --> 01:28:46.280 align:start position:0%
in a civil case it's pretty rare for a
 
01:28:48.430 --> 01:28:48.440 align:start position:0%
motion for a new trial in those kind of
 
01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances to be made more than three
 
01:28:55.189 --> 01:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
years after the the um the Judgment has
 
01:28:57.950 --> 01:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
been ra now is it absolutely impossible
 
01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
no if you know if there was really sort
 
01:29:04.189 --> 01:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
of a massive fraud of you know somebody
 
01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
made a just a completely bogus claim and
 
01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
could that happen I think probably it I
 
01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
think probably it could um and maybe in
 
01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
that kind of a case you know it would
 
01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
you would say it would be worth it to to
 
01:29:19.149 --> 01:29:19.159 align:start position:0%
to try to go after the person but I'm
 
01:29:22.430 --> 01:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just concerned that
 
01:29:24.430 --> 01:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
there's when you're talking about a
 
01:29:27.149 --> 01:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
civil case you're you're talking about
 
01:29:31.149 --> 01:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
balancing private parties interests and
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
those interests it seems to me can often
 
01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
be um much more complicated in their
 
01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:41.560 align:start position:0%
implications um than you know in the in
 
01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
the criminal context if if somebody is
 
01:29:47.590 --> 01:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
not if somebody if newly discovered
 
01:29:49.109 --> 01:29:49.119 align:start position:0%
evidence reveals that somebody is not
 
01:29:52.030 --> 01:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
guilty the the state the state doesn't
 
01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
suffer any harm from releasing somebody
 
01:29:55.310 --> 01:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
that's not guilty that's what that's
 
01:29:57.189 --> 01:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
what you know that's what Justice is all
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
about so it's a much
 
01:30:02.750 --> 01:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
less um if the person is really not
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
guilty it's a much there's much less
 
01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
balancing in that context than it is in
 
01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
the in the Civil context and so you know
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
there it may be that there would that
 
01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:19.400 align:start position:0%
that we should extend the three years
 
01:30:22.109 --> 01:30:22.119 align:start position:0%
for some civil Con in some civil context
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
maybe there should be some conditions on
 
01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:24.470 align:start position:0%
maybe there should be some conditions on
it

01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
all of all of that kind of thing I'm
 
01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
just all I'm saying is it seems to me
 
01:30:29.199 --> 01:30:30.109 align:start position:0%
just all I'm saying is it seems to me
that

01:30:30.109 --> 01:30:30.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
this this requires more careful thinking
 
01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
than what we just than just sort of
 
01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:37.870 align:start position:0%
than what we just than just sort of
doing

01:30:37.870 --> 01:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
it uh representative trip and then
 
01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:42.629 align:start position:0%
it uh representative trip and then
representative

01:30:42.629 --> 01:30:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:45.709 --> 01:30:45.719 align:start position:0%
man it seems to me that
 
01:30:45.719 --> 01:30:47.430 align:start position:0%
man it seems to me that
uh

01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh in a uh civil
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
matter the uh
 
01:30:57.790 --> 01:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
the uh the person that brought the
 
01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh charges or whatever you want to call
 
01:31:04.629 --> 01:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
it uh
 
01:31:07.709 --> 01:31:07.719 align:start position:0%
lose then uh this would give them an
 
01:31:11.229 --> 01:31:11.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to bring the charges
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
again in a Crim in a criminal case in a
 
01:31:16.629 --> 01:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
in a civil in civil case now say say
 
01:31:19.870 --> 01:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
that the uh the uh the court judgment
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
went against them uh and they did not
 
01:31:26.350 --> 01:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
get you you know uh uh what they
 
01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
expected you know uh money or whatever
 
01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
you know so if if uh if we do this then
 
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh three years later when something new
 
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
is discovered you know they would be
 
01:31:39.109 --> 01:31:39.119 align:start position:0%
able to go back you know another swing
 
01:31:42.669 --> 01:31:42.679 align:start position:0%
at the ball you know to say to uh get
 
01:31:46.390 --> 01:31:46.400 align:start position:0%
you know money from uh whoever they were
 
01:31:50.510 --> 01:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh litigating against would that be a no
 
01:31:51.870 --> 01:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
no that's I mean no you raised a very
 
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
good point that's I was sort of thinking
 
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
about the you know recovery of a
 
01:31:57.149 --> 01:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
judgment and then trying and then trying
 
01:31:59.390 --> 01:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
to get that backed out but you're right
 
01:32:03.070 --> 01:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
that would be you would be giving the
 
01:32:06.109 --> 01:32:06.119 align:start position:0%
you would be giving the plaintiff uh
 
01:32:08.910 --> 01:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
another bite at the Apple and you know
 
01:32:11.870 --> 01:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
again in the Civil Contex it it seems to
 
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
me that there's a really fundamental
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
difference between criminal and civil if
 
01:32:18.189 --> 01:32:18.199 align:start position:0%
the if somebody's in jail and shouldn't
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
be there um then that you know as I
 
01:32:24.189 --> 01:32:24.199 align:start position:0%
think we heard from all of the witness
 
01:32:25.629 --> 01:32:25.639 align:start position:0%
including the prosecutors I think
 
01:32:28.270 --> 01:32:28.280 align:start position:0%
everybody say gez that's you know that's
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
a big problem um if you've had the
 
01:32:33.790 --> 01:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
chance to bring your civil
 
01:32:37.470 --> 01:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
case even if you know even if you didn't
 
01:32:38.910 --> 01:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
get all the evidence that you should
 
01:32:40.430 --> 01:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
have had or
 
01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
whatever unless it's I would think that
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
unless there's really been a you know a
 
01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:46.629 align:start position:0%
unless there's really been a you know a
blatant

01:32:46.629 --> 01:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
blatant
 
01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
fraud um it's once you've had your day
 
01:32:53.390 --> 01:32:53.400 align:start position:0%
in court it it's it's a you know your
 
01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
claim to have another day in court it
 
01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
seems to me is is generally much less
 
01:33:00.030 --> 01:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
compelling than in the criminal context
 
01:33:02.109 --> 01:33:02.119 align:start position:0%
that that's what I the way I would raise
 
01:33:04.149 --> 01:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
it representative Vanos thank you Mr
 
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
chair I just I just wanted to add a
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
couple of thoughts one is that currently
 
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
the statute is three years um and for
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
both civil and criminal because there's
 
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
no there's no removal of the time limit
 
01:33:21.629 --> 01:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
for the criminal cases so in the example
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
you gave earlier of you received a
 
01:33:27.149 --> 01:33:27.159 align:start position:0%
judgment from me and you spent the money
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
on sending your children to college well
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
within 3 years I could file a motion for
 
01:33:35.870 --> 01:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
a new trial under the current statute
 
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
and you would have spent the money but
 
01:33:40.270 --> 01:33:40.280 align:start position:0%
the other thing I would add is it seems
 
01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
very unfair to me um if you've been
 
01:33:47.550 --> 01:33:47.560 align:start position:0%
exonerated criminally by new evidence
 
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
that for example if you're paying on a
 
01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
judgment if I'm paying you monthly
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
$1,000 a month on a judgment that I
 
01:33:58.149 --> 01:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
should continue to pay that to you when
 
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
I've been exonerated criminally and I
 
01:34:03.310 --> 01:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
could not possibly have done whatever
 
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
I'm paying you $1,000 a month for and so
 
01:34:11.189 --> 01:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
I just see that as as a an an
 
01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
incongruous situation that doesn't seem
 
01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
fair right well you know I I guess what
 
01:34:18.350 --> 01:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
I I I I mean I understand what you're
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
saying but I guess you know just as an
 
01:34:22.030 --> 01:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
example one of the things that
 
01:34:24.430 --> 01:34:24.440 align:start position:0%
might be the distinct iction there is
 
01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:25.830 align:start position:0%
might be the distinct iction there is
remember

01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
remember
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
the you might be entitled to be
 
01:34:30.790 --> 01:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
exonerated in a criminal case by new
 
01:34:33.470 --> 01:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
evidence that raises the question of
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
whether you were guilty Beyond a
 
01:34:39.109 --> 01:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
reasonable doubt that might not affect
 
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
the question of whether the evidence was
 
01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
sufficient to make you civil liable by
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
the much lower preponderance of the
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
evidence standard so I mean it and and I
 
01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
guess what I you know that the point
 
01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
about I I understand you're right about
 
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
the three years now would apply if I
 
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
sent my kid to college within three
 
01:34:59.790 --> 01:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
years but the problem I see is suppose
 
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
it's 20 years you know you got uh I
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
recovered a judgment against you I spent
 
01:35:08.669 --> 01:35:08.679 align:start position:0%
the money and it's now 20 years
 
01:35:12.550 --> 01:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
later my I've reordered my life and
 
01:35:13.870 --> 01:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
whatever you know you could say well you
 
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
got this
 
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
windfall okay but all I'm saying is I
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
think it's much more complicated in the
 
01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:23.159 align:start position:0%
Civil context and that maybe we ought to
 
01:35:25.229 --> 01:35:25.239 align:start position:0%
look at it more carefully that's kind of
 
01:35:28.709 --> 01:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
where I'm coming from other other
 
01:35:31.709 --> 01:35:31.719 align:start position:0%
representative me thank you Mr chair I
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
would think that in in the case of a new
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
trial though you would you would take
 
01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
all those factors into account the fact
 
01:35:40.510 --> 01:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
that um if you had a big judgment that
 
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
you spent um and this is a decade or two
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
decades down the line you and you acted
 
01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
reasonably right you had you acted upon
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
the evidence that you had you had the
 
01:35:53.070 --> 01:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
the Civil judgment and you have you have
 
01:35:55.870 --> 01:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
the money now and you spent it
 
01:35:59.590 --> 01:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
um this is I would think that the
 
01:36:01.669 --> 01:36:01.679 align:start position:0%
lawyers on both sides of the case would
 
01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
take that into account and whether it's
 
01:36:07.510 --> 01:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
the judge or the jury um they would also
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
take that into account so um and this is
 
01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
you know potentially highly relevant
 
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
evidence um so I think it it deserves at
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
least a second look even if it's um
 
01:36:24.149 --> 01:36:24.159 align:start position:0%
maybe not returning money it it would
 
01:36:26.910 --> 01:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
possibly reverse a civil a civil
 
01:36:30.030 --> 01:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
decision and um maybe that's of some
 
01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
value to some people even if it's not
 
01:36:35.709 --> 01:36:35.719 align:start position:0%
money right other com yes representative
 
01:36:39.189 --> 01:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
tur yeah just just one last thought on
 
01:36:40.990 --> 01:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
this and it comes from and I I I think
 
01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
that the point about the different
 
01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
burdens of proof of the different cases
 
01:36:48.550 --> 01:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
is is interesting you know I I was
 
01:36:51.070 --> 01:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
favorable to this I'm wavering I I would
 
01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
say my thought would be if the if the
 
01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
Civil judgment was tied to the criminal
 
01:36:59.750 --> 01:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
case that the bill originally spoke to
 
01:37:03.229 --> 01:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
you know it seems easier to justify
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
because it's tied to the same individual
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
that that is criminally responsible for
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
whatever the the situation situation is
 
01:37:13.229 --> 01:37:13.239 align:start position:0%
and since that burden's higher if that
 
01:37:15.390 --> 01:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
was to be overturned the criminal side
 
01:37:18.109 --> 01:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
if the Civil side was tied to that would
 
01:37:20.350 --> 01:37:20.360 align:start position:0%
make more sense but this sort of is more
 
01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
open-ended than that the way I read it
 
01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
it's open it basically says any civil
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
judgment versus versus a civil judgment
 
01:37:31.310 --> 01:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
that is related to a a also a criminal
 
01:37:34.109 --> 01:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
case so that makes makes it to me harder
 
01:37:37.470 --> 01:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
to sort of justify that that tiered
 
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
system of of being able to step down to
 
01:37:42.629 --> 01:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
a civil case and and reopen it
 
01:37:42.639 --> 01:37:44.310 align:start position:0%
a civil case and and reopen it
representative

01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:37:46.629 --> 01:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
K I think that this is a really
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
important bill
 
01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
and I really think we need to interim
 
01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
study it because I I I checked it into
 
01:37:55.790 --> 01:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
the DNA statue and it really has a whole
 
01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
bunch of other guardrails on it like
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
this doesn't even have anything about
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
you know you having to submit a petition
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
within a certain amount of time frame
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
after receiving the evidence it doesn't
 
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
have anything in here about successive
 
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
petitions on the same new evidence um I
 
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
know that we had asked the committee
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
researcher to kind of look into it and I
 
01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
I think it was probably a big task so
 
01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
they haven't given us the data yet I
 
01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
just I really think it's a really
 
01:38:22.149 --> 01:38:22.159 align:start position:0%
important bill and we should do it right
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
the first time and I'm not trying to
 
01:38:25.709 --> 01:38:25.719 align:start position:0%
kick the can down the road on this one
 
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
but I do think it's a it is a task that
 
01:38:30.750 --> 01:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
really needs to to spend some time
 
01:38:32.109 --> 01:38:32.119 align:start position:0%
because as I'm hearing all these things
 
01:38:34.189 --> 01:38:34.199 align:start position:0%
I do think I do I am hearing a lot of
 
01:38:36.830 --> 01:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
good points and I hadn't even considered
 
01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
the Civil part prior but I I do think we
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
really need to look into this and and
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
fix it and put something forward through
 
01:38:44.910 --> 01:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
that's a little just comprehensive but I
 
01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
do really appreciate R Mano bringing
 
01:38:49.709 --> 01:38:49.719 align:start position:0%
forward this amendment and this idea
 
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
because I I absolutely agree with you if
 
01:38:53.589 --> 01:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
if somebody's been exonerated from a
 
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
crime and is and is is paying out a
 
01:38:59.669 --> 01:38:59.679 align:start position:0%
monthly sum to somebody and we know now
 
01:39:01.950 --> 01:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
Beyond you know any doubt that they
 
01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely didn't do it why should they
 
01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
have to keep paying I I really I think
 
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
we we should look into this and I'd be
 
01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:09.320 align:start position:0%
happy to join in and in doing the work
 
01:39:10.750 --> 01:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
for it
 
01:39:13.629 --> 01:39:13.639 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's kind of where I'm at
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
other representative
 
01:39:18.910 --> 01:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
stapon yeah I have trouble with the
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
amendment I kind of feeling that uh
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
civil and criminal are two different
 
01:39:28.350 --> 01:39:28.360 align:start position:0%
animals apples and oranges and it seems
 
01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
like there's more apparency with civil
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
cases than with criminal cases because
 
01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
we have books we have
 
01:39:39.669 --> 01:39:39.679 align:start position:0%
records um you know you can subpoena
 
01:39:41.950 --> 01:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
stuff um there's there's more meat
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
there's more substance in the civil case
 
01:39:47.229 --> 01:39:47.239 align:start position:0%
generally whereas in a criminal case
 
01:39:49.709 --> 01:39:49.719 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of hidden stuff Discovery
 
01:39:53.550 --> 01:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
is difficult and um
 
01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
you know there's a tendency to um hide
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
evidence spoliation um perhaps maybe
 
01:40:05.470 --> 01:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
more than uh civil matter because of the
 
01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
penalty impacts are so
 
01:40:10.830 --> 01:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
severe uh I I think it needs the bill
 
01:40:13.070 --> 01:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
needs further study to far it out all
 
01:40:15.589 --> 01:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
aspects but I can't go with the with the
 
01:40:16.990 --> 01:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
amendment because I think there's just
 
01:40:18.629 --> 01:40:18.639 align:start position:0%
too different too much difference
 
01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
between civil and
 
01:40:23.470 --> 01:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
criminal other comments
 
01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
all right I guess we're ready then for
 
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh the motion before us is uh to adopt
 
01:40:32.910 --> 01:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
um representative Manos is uh Amendment
 
01:40:36.589 --> 01:40:36.599 align:start position:0%

01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:32.310 align:start position:0%
 
fails

01:41:32.310 --> 01:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
fails
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
um so uh now I would uh rep recognize
 
01:41:39.149 --> 01:41:39.159 align:start position:0%
representative katab for a
 
01:41:41.709 --> 01:41:41.719 align:start position:0%
motion I move in term study
 
01:41:44.350 --> 01:41:44.360 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander you second yes
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
all right um representative katab do you
 
01:41:50.189 --> 01:41:50.199 align:start position:0%
wish to say anything further I think
 
01:41:51.669 --> 01:41:51.679 align:start position:0%
I've already covered I I think we really
 
01:41:53.189 --> 01:41:53.199 align:start position:0%
need to take a deep dive into this and
 
01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
and I think we could come up with a
 
01:41:56.470 --> 01:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
really comprehensive Bill if we did and
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
I I think that there's you know once we
 
01:42:01.470 --> 01:42:01.480 align:start position:0%
get some of the research back I think we
 
01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
could really put together a good bill
 
01:42:06.910 --> 01:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
so anybody else wish to be heard
 
01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
representative tur yeah I'll just say I
 
01:42:12.189 --> 01:42:12.199 align:start position:0%
I I think you know and again as a clean
 
01:42:16.350 --> 01:42:16.360 align:start position:0%
bill just related to um criminal you
 
01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
know uh trials where somebody is in fact
 
01:42:22.510 --> 01:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
incarcerated the compelling evidence of
 
01:42:25.629 --> 01:42:25.639 align:start position:0%
the ability to extend new uh technology
 
01:42:29.790 --> 01:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
to exonerate somebody is important and I
 
01:42:31.629 --> 01:42:31.639 align:start position:0%
think you know many of my original
 
01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
concerns around the safeguards about the
 
01:42:36.030 --> 01:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
frequency with which people might bring
 
01:42:38.830 --> 01:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
these um requests you know and the
 
01:42:40.510 --> 01:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
parameters you know from what I've
 
01:42:42.750 --> 01:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
understood are addressed because they
 
01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
would have to go through you know
 
01:42:48.669 --> 01:42:48.679 align:start position:0%
Council or and through the the the judge
 
01:42:50.790 --> 01:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
in the trial so I don't feel like it's
 
01:42:54.189 --> 01:42:54.199 align:start position:0%
as open to abuse as um
 
01:42:56.109 --> 01:42:56.119 align:start position:0%
as it might seem or at least it
 
01:42:59.709 --> 01:42:59.719 align:start position:0%
initially seemed to me so I I would
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
would like to see a different
 
01:43:05.070 --> 01:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
motion all right any anyone else wish to
 
01:43:07.070 --> 01:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
be heard on that so I guess I I would
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:14.639 align:start position:0%
think particularly as limited to
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
criminal cases I think it's really I
 
01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
can't emphasize strongly
 
01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
enough that this three-year limitation
 
01:43:28.109 --> 01:43:28.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
Because unless the person is not in
 
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
custody and being on parole or probation
 
01:43:37.109 --> 01:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
is considered to be in custody unless
 
01:43:40.030 --> 01:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
the person is not in custody um there's
 
01:43:42.270 --> 01:43:42.280 align:start position:0%
a habus corpus remedy available and
 
01:43:45.629 --> 01:43:45.639 align:start position:0%
that's used so you know they as you as
 
01:43:47.950 --> 01:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
you may have heard I'm sure we've all
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
seen and heard in the paper there are
 
01:43:51.870 --> 01:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
many many cases in New Hampshire where
 
01:43:55.629 --> 01:43:55.639 align:start position:0%
somebody brings a postconviction uh
 
01:43:58.109 --> 01:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
attack on their conviction way after
 
01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
three years and it and they go you know
 
01:44:01.589 --> 01:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
those and those are heard because
 
01:44:04.390 --> 01:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
they're brought as Abus Corpus so this
 
01:44:07.149 --> 01:44:07.159 align:start position:0%
three-year limitation it it doesn't you
 
01:44:09.950 --> 01:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
know I'm I'm I'm not saying it never has
 
01:44:13.350 --> 01:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
some um implication that I think there
 
01:44:15.030 --> 01:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
probably are certain circumstances where
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
it does but the reason I would like to
 
01:44:20.109 --> 01:44:20.119 align:start position:0%
see the interim study is I think it
 
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
would make sense to look at both the
 
01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
habius Corpus and this new trial and
 
01:44:30.270 --> 01:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
come up with you know uh a
 
01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
more holistic approach I mean for
 
01:44:34.709 --> 01:44:34.719 align:start position:0%
example one of the things that might
 
01:44:38.109 --> 01:44:38.119 align:start position:0%
make sense is to say if
 
01:44:40.750 --> 01:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
you're there's no there shouldn't be any
 
01:44:43.950 --> 01:44:43.960 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations if your claim is
 
01:44:46.030 --> 01:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
that you're actually innocent that you
 
01:44:48.870 --> 01:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
were wrongfully convicted and you and
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
there and you should get a new trial or
 
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
you should get a rid of habius Corpus
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
that's one thing but the way it can be
 
01:45:01.229 --> 01:45:01.239 align:start position:0%
um the way it can be used now including
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
habus corpuses it it it often it can can
 
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
be used in a circumstance where there
 
01:45:10.109 --> 01:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
isn't really a claim of Innocence it's
 
01:45:14.109 --> 01:45:14.119 align:start position:0%
that some there was some error not NE
 
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
not really going to innocence that
 
01:45:18.990 --> 01:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
resulted in your conviction a a Fourth
 
01:45:21.030 --> 01:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment violation or a Fifth Amendment
 
01:45:23.310 --> 01:45:23.320 align:start position:0%
violation or something like that and I
 
01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
think there should there's at least a
 
01:45:27.629 --> 01:45:27.639 align:start position:0%
question about whether you should be
 
01:45:31.070 --> 01:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
able to use it for that use those kind
 
01:45:33.149 --> 01:45:33.159 align:start position:0%
of remedies for those purposes where
 
01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:34.719 align:start position:0%
there's really not a claim that that
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
you're that you're actually innocent
 
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's just that you know the police
 
01:45:41.229 --> 01:45:41.239 align:start position:0%
questioned me too long or something like
 
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
that yes representative Smith um thank
 
01:45:48.589 --> 01:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
you very much for that explanation it it
 
01:45:53.629 --> 01:45:53.639 align:start position:0%
helps a lot um what I want to point out
 
01:45:56.990 --> 01:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
is if you are moving interim study
 
01:45:59.709 --> 01:45:59.719 align:start position:0%
you're in moving interim study on the
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
bill that is before us and the section
 
01:46:08.430 --> 01:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
two lines 5 through 8 would be the ones
 
01:46:13.149 --> 01:46:13.159 align:start position:0%
that are in question if you um because
 
01:46:17.070 --> 01:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
of your certainly Superior knowledge of
 
01:46:19.470 --> 01:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
the judicial system in this state
 
01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
believe that the time has come to
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
address problems of habus Corpus then I
 
01:46:29.390 --> 01:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
commend that and think you should do
 
01:46:31.870 --> 01:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
that and it has absolutely nothing to do
 
01:46:34.709 --> 01:46:34.719 align:start position:0%
with interim study of this bill it has
 
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
to do with the time having come for new
 
01:46:41.470 --> 01:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
legislation that would address habus
 
01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
Corpus so that I don't quite see I I
 
01:46:47.790 --> 01:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
wonder if you're conflating the two
 
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
issues here and they should be kept
 
01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
separate one would be interim study of
 
01:46:59.669 --> 01:46:59.679 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 507 as amended by the Senate
 
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
and completely separate issue is how
 
01:47:06.109 --> 01:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
cabus Corpus is handled in this state
 
01:47:09.550 --> 01:47:09.560 align:start position:0%
thank you other yes representative
 
01:47:13.709 --> 01:47:13.719 align:start position:0%
maners um would habus Corpus lie for
 
01:47:17.870 --> 01:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
newly discovered um scientific evidence
 
01:47:20.270 --> 01:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
oh yeah yeah absolutely it it would
 
01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely it would yes and as as
 
01:47:26.910 --> 01:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
so just to say I I mean I think that
 
01:47:28.149 --> 01:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
these are
 
01:47:28.159 --> 01:47:29.830 align:start position:0%
these are
so

01:47:29.830 --> 01:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:32.910 --> 01:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
overlapping um that you know they really
 
01:47:35.430 --> 01:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
are related because they're both they're
 
01:47:37.589 --> 01:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
both what is referred to as
 
01:47:37.599 --> 01:47:39.830 align:start position:0%
both what is referred to as
postconviction

01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
postconviction
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
relief um and and so they they really
 
01:47:45.910 --> 01:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
are very very much related um and that's
 
01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
why I think that you know it
 
01:47:51.870 --> 01:47:51.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's hard to sort of if you wanted
 
01:47:54.669 --> 01:47:54.679 align:start position:0%
to have a comprehensive solution it's a
 
01:47:56.350 --> 01:47:56.360 align:start position:0%
comprehensive fix so to speak it's hard
 
01:47:58.750 --> 01:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
to deal with one without the
 
01:48:02.669 --> 01:48:02.679 align:start position:0%
other yes thank you Mr chair um would
 
01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
habus Corpus in New Hampshire for a
 
01:48:09.430 --> 01:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
state in in the state courts be limited
 
01:48:13.229 --> 01:48:13.239 align:start position:0%
by our three-year limit
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
on um filing a motion for a new trial
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
based on
 
01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
um scientific evidence scientific change
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
in science in other words would this be
 
01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
a limitation on habus Corpus if in other
 
01:48:32.030 --> 01:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
words if we were to pass this with it if
 
01:48:33.390 --> 01:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
we would have passed the bill without
 
01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
your Amendment would it be a limitation
 
01:48:40.270 --> 01:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
on Abus Corpus no with dis regarding um
 
01:48:42.830 --> 01:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
in other words currently there's a
 
01:48:45.910 --> 01:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
three-year limitation maybe I'm I'm
 
01:48:48.510 --> 01:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding this here so I just I
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of thinking out loud in other
 
01:48:51.119 --> 01:48:53.550 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of thinking out loud in other
words

01:48:53.550 --> 01:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
words
 
01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:55.070 align:start position:0%
words
[Music]

01:48:55.070 --> 01:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:48:58.669 --> 01:48:58.679 align:start position:0%
um is our three-year limitation would
 
01:49:02.750 --> 01:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
that be viewed under habius Corpus as as
 
01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:03.629 align:start position:0%
that be viewed under habius Corpus as as
a

01:49:03.629 --> 01:49:03.639 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:49:07.070 --> 01:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
ceiling I think the the the short answer
 
01:49:09.629 --> 01:49:09.639 align:start position:0%
is no but I but as I said before our
 
01:49:09.639 --> 01:49:11.149 align:start position:0%
is no but I but as I said before our
habius

01:49:11.149 --> 01:49:11.159 align:start position:0%
habius
 
01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
Corpus jurist Prudence is to say that
 
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
it's complicated and not particularly
 
01:49:21.669 --> 01:49:21.679 align:start position:0%
clear is would be an understatement but
 
01:49:24.510 --> 01:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
there are certain cases I mean a lot of
 
01:49:27.750 --> 01:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
cases in which the request for habus
 
01:49:31.390 --> 01:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
Corpus relief was brought way more than
 
01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
three years beyond the Beyond you know
 
01:49:37.470 --> 01:49:37.480 align:start position:0%
beyond the conviction and many of those
 
01:49:39.390 --> 01:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
cases not not all of them many of them
 
01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
are dismissed for one reason or another
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
but many of them are do go forward um so
 
01:49:46.669 --> 01:49:46.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's you know it's not the
 
01:49:48.149 --> 01:49:48.159 align:start position:0%
three-year limitation is not like the
 
01:49:49.870 --> 01:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
end of the
 
01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
matter all right any other comments
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
yes represent
 
01:49:56.910 --> 01:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
Stapleton I think I'm
 
01:50:00.229 --> 01:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
troubled that evidence is described as
 
01:50:05.229 --> 01:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
new as opposed to measuring any quality
 
01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
weight um uh um material aspect of
 
01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:12.639 align:start position:0%
evidence and in some of the discussion
 
01:50:16.189 --> 01:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
we had previously on April the
 
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
10th representative Alexander made a
 
01:50:23.910 --> 01:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
point that this could open up a flow of
 
01:50:26.709 --> 01:50:26.719 align:start position:0%
petitions and if we don't
 
01:50:31.950 --> 01:50:31.960 align:start position:0%
qualify the the qu quality weight um the
 
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
material aspect of evidence maybe that
 
01:50:36.870 --> 01:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
could happen and now we have already a
 
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
flood a tight court docket behind and
 
01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
short staffed and we could be in some
 
01:50:46.270 --> 01:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
real trouble and therefore the interim
 
01:50:49.229 --> 01:50:49.239 align:start position:0%
study needs to look at that aspect of
 
01:50:51.629 --> 01:50:51.639 align:start position:0%
quality and weight of
 
01:50:54.229 --> 01:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
evidence other comments I I just to
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
follow up I think you know as
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
representative kutab pointed out the the
 
01:50:59.229 --> 01:50:59.239 align:start position:0%
deal there is a separate statute dealing
 
01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
with DNA testing and that does have much
 
01:51:05.069 --> 01:51:05.079 align:start position:0%
more specific criteria of needing to
 
01:51:06.790 --> 01:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
make certain showings and things like
 
01:51:09.310 --> 01:51:09.320 align:start position:0%
that and so um I think that's I mean I
 
01:51:11.109 --> 01:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
think that is something that that
 
01:51:13.589 --> 01:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
interim study would look at um whether
 
01:51:16.109 --> 01:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
there should be something more uh in
 
01:51:18.350 --> 01:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
that regard so I I I tend to agree with
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
you other
 
01:51:22.910 --> 01:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
comments all right I guess the most then
 
01:51:24.830 --> 01:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
is interim study and I would ask the
 
01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the
 
01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:30.320 align:start position:0%

01:52:23.189 --> 01:52:23.199 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:52:25.589 --> 01:52:25.599 align:start position:0%

so okay so
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
um a a uh an important suggestion by the
 
01:53:20.669 --> 01:53:20.679 align:start position:0%
clerk which I think is is very important
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to when I when I said
 
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
before I get your reports in by the end
 
01:53:27.310 --> 01:53:27.320 align:start position:0%
of the day I like to make a slight
 
01:53:28.990 --> 01:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to that how about get in to me
 
01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:37.709 --> 01:53:37.719 align:start position:0%
please get I just want to make sure that
 
01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
we all know who's to blame for
 
01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:43.149 align:start position:0%
we all know who's to blame for
[Laughter]

01:53:43.149 --> 01:53:43.159 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
that three three o'clock you know these
 
01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
I mean these don't have to be long uh
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
long reports that's for sure all right
 
01:53:54.589 --> 01:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
we're on to the last bill
 
01:53:59.109 --> 01:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
um uh Senate Bill uh 576 the chair
 
01:54:01.149 --> 01:54:01.159 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative kab for a
 
01:54:03.589 --> 01:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
motion I move on to pass is there a
 
01:54:05.910 --> 01:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
second second seconded by representative
 
01:54:07.510 --> 01:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
Wallace representative kab do you wish
 
01:54:11.470 --> 01:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion no all right uh
 
01:54:13.750 --> 01:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to yes representative
 
01:54:18.629 --> 01:54:18.639 align:start position:0%
organ um well we I think we never really
 
01:54:20.350 --> 01:54:20.360 align:start position:0%
heard why this bill was necessary if
 
01:54:23.470 --> 01:54:23.480 align:start position:0%
there fact it's a problem with the dead
 
01:54:27.189 --> 01:54:27.199 align:start position:0%
people voting um I know you I know from
 
01:54:28.910 --> 01:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
personal experience and we probably all
 
01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
had the experience of a family member
 
01:54:32.629 --> 01:54:32.639 align:start position:0%
dying one of the things you do
 
01:54:34.229 --> 01:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
immediately afterwards if you working
 
01:54:35.910 --> 01:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
through a funeral home or crematorium
 
01:54:38.550 --> 01:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
fill out a long huge stack of papers
 
01:54:40.390 --> 01:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
there all kinds of different um entities
 
01:54:42.149 --> 01:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
including the state of New Hampshire
 
01:54:44.470 --> 01:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
have to be notified and this adds one
 
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
more to it which um I'm not sure why
 
01:54:50.790 --> 01:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
it's necessary and also takes effect 60
 
01:54:52.510 --> 01:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
days after its passage so I don't know
 
01:54:55.709 --> 01:54:55.719 align:start position:0%
that really gives uh the parties such as
 
01:54:59.910 --> 01:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
the funeral homes time to uh be notified
 
01:55:02.270 --> 01:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
and that this is like one more thing you
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
have to make one more official copy of
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
the death certificate and one more thing
 
01:55:08.950 --> 01:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
that the executive has to has to uh
 
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
submit submit at the time of death so I
 
01:55:15.069 --> 01:55:15.079 align:start position:0%
would I'm I'm just I'm inclined to vote
 
01:55:17.830 --> 01:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
vote against it although it's U it's not
 
01:55:20.189 --> 01:55:20.199 align:start position:0%
it's not a terrible idea but I think I I
 
01:55:22.390 --> 01:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
think I don't think I can vote for this
 
01:55:25.470 --> 01:55:25.480 align:start position:0%
pH as as it's comes to us right uh
 
01:55:26.550 --> 01:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
representative Smith and then
 
01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative Perez thank you very much
 
01:55:33.550 --> 01:55:33.560 align:start position:0%
this is um uh a bill that is absolutely
 
01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:35.030 align:start position:0%
this is um uh a bill that is absolutely
not

01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:55:38.750 --> 01:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
necessary um in fact the current uh
 
01:55:43.589 --> 01:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
system that we have uh where the the
 
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
town clerks who report deaths um who who
 
01:55:51.310 --> 01:55:51.320 align:start position:0%
get the reports of deaths the funeral
 
01:55:54.030 --> 01:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
homes don't forget that not every death
 
01:55:55.270 --> 01:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
involves an
 
01:55:59.109 --> 01:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
executive um these figures are I mean
 
01:56:01.750 --> 01:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
the deaths the these occurrences are
 
01:56:05.189 --> 01:56:05.199 align:start position:0%
reported they're reported in time
 
01:56:08.229 --> 01:56:08.239 align:start position:0%
they're reported under current
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
procedures all this is is to make
 
01:56:14.109 --> 01:56:14.119 align:start position:0%
another hoopdee doop about how our
 
01:56:17.669 --> 01:56:17.679 align:start position:0%
election system works it works very well
 
01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
we don't have dead people voting um uh
 
01:56:24.149 --> 01:56:24.159 align:start position:0%
unless they're able to Rise Up from the
 
01:56:26.189 --> 01:56:26.199 align:start position:0%
grave and vote then give them credit and
 
01:56:29.589 --> 01:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
let them vote um so that I am planning
 
01:56:33.149 --> 01:56:33.159 align:start position:0%
to vote um against this bill as
 
01:56:36.069 --> 01:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
completely unnecessary and I believe the
 
01:56:38.830 --> 01:56:38.840 align:start position:0%
town and City Clerks will support that I
 
01:56:40.830 --> 01:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
believe Health and Human Services would
 
01:56:43.470 --> 01:56:43.480 align:start position:0%
support that and I believe the Secretary
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
of State's office would support that
 
01:56:47.629 --> 01:56:47.639 align:start position:0%
thank you right anyone else wish to be
 
01:56:50.430 --> 01:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
heard on the this bill all right I think
 
01:56:53.069 --> 01:56:53.079 align:start position:0%
we're ready to oh I'm sorry represent
 
01:56:55.510 --> 01:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
I Echo um representative Smith sentiment
 
01:56:58.470 --> 01:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
and I believe that most towns do a
 
01:57:02.550 --> 01:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
report um of deaths like life they do
 
01:57:05.669 --> 01:57:05.679 align:start position:0%
reports on births deaths and marriages
 
01:57:09.229 --> 01:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
in fact my own town has a report they
 
01:57:12.589 --> 01:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
run it annually with the the death the
 
01:57:15.310 --> 01:57:15.320 align:start position:0%
date of death and um the location of the
 
01:57:18.870 --> 01:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
death so it seems unnecessary thank you
 
01:57:21.510 --> 01:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
all right any any other comments all
 
01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
right oh yes representative State I
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
support the the bill I think that even
 
01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
if there are not a lot of occasions of
 
01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:32.069 align:start position:0%
if there are not a lot of occasions of
misuse

01:57:32.069 --> 01:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
misuse
 
01:57:36.669 --> 01:57:36.679 align:start position:0%
uh um people voting for for dead people
 
01:57:40.910 --> 01:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
on absentee ballot that are um wrongly
 
01:57:43.870 --> 01:57:43.880 align:start position:0%
obtained or utilized that this uh bill
 
01:57:45.149 --> 01:57:45.159 align:start position:0%
is at least
 
01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
precautionary so that we don't have a
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
problem and can clean up and tighten up
 
01:57:52.709 --> 01:57:52.719 align:start position:0%
our record keeping relative to people
 
01:57:55.390 --> 01:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
who have passed and the voting record
 
01:57:59.149 --> 01:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:01.189 --> 01:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
better all right any other yes
 
01:58:01.199 --> 01:58:02.910 align:start position:0%
better all right any other yes
representative

01:58:02.910 --> 01:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
Perez going to the town clerk does not
 
01:58:07.990 --> 01:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
get it to the supervisor of the
 
01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
checklist you cannot guarantee that the
 
01:58:13.270 --> 01:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the checklist in some
 
01:58:16.149 --> 01:58:16.159 align:start position:0%
towns don't meet very often we have a
 
01:58:18.109 --> 01:58:18.119 align:start position:0%
bill right now trying to make them meet
 
01:58:20.790 --> 01:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
more frequently so getting it to the
 
01:58:23.589 --> 01:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
town clerk doesn't necessarily we had a
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
problem in londonairy we had over 1200
 
01:58:28.350 --> 01:58:28.360 align:start position:0%
people still on the list that voted that
 
01:58:32.229 --> 01:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
had moved out that or died and had um
 
01:58:33.669 --> 01:58:33.679 align:start position:0%
voted in
 
01:58:36.510 --> 01:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
2022 um they are now off the checklist
 
01:58:40.229 --> 01:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
but hey it's 2024 oh they voted in 20
 
01:58:44.510 --> 01:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
2020 it's now 2024 this is a
 
01:58:47.669 --> 01:58:47.679 align:start position:0%
safeguard especially for small towns
 
01:58:50.350 --> 01:58:50.360 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else wish to be heard
 
01:58:53.350 --> 01:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
on oh uh whoop representative Oregon did
 
01:58:55.229 --> 01:58:55.239 align:start position:0%
you yes thank you for letting me speak a
 
01:58:56.589 --> 01:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
second time and I hope I waited till
 
01:58:58.229 --> 01:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
everyone else has spoken just from my
 
01:59:01.589 --> 01:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
own personal experience my uh and you
 
01:59:03.149 --> 01:59:03.159 align:start position:0%
were all very kind to me it happened my
 
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
mother passed away shortly before the uh
 
01:59:07.510 --> 01:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
presidential primary and the last
 
01:59:09.189 --> 01:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
conversation she had with me was that
 
01:59:11.589 --> 01:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
she had indeed sent in her absentee
 
01:59:13.350 --> 01:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
ballot so I think
 
01:59:17.189 --> 01:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
um but that's a fairly that's a fairly
 
01:59:19.830 --> 01:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
rare I mean it's not a unique situation
 
01:59:21.270 --> 01:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
but it's fairly rare that she was
 
01:59:23.910 --> 01:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
intending to be on January 23rd and she
 
01:59:27.030 --> 01:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
ended up passing on January 16th and
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
um that's uh probably not something that
 
01:59:31.830 --> 01:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
materially affects the results of the
 
01:59:33.750 --> 01:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
election too much I guess in
 
01:59:36.709 --> 01:59:36.719 align:start position:0%
theory the ballot could have been
 
01:59:38.830 --> 01:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
challenged but also
 
01:59:41.669 --> 01:59:41.679 align:start position:0%
um but the flip side of it is I guess
 
01:59:43.629 --> 01:59:43.639 align:start position:0%
the other thing is if somebody dies and
 
01:59:45.550 --> 01:59:45.560 align:start position:0%
then somebody comes in you know somebody
 
01:59:48.069 --> 01:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
came in in person in a subsequent
 
01:59:50.430 --> 01:59:50.440 align:start position:0%
election and claimed to be my mother um
 
01:59:52.350 --> 01:59:52.360 align:start position:0%
we already have a voter ID thing and
 
01:59:55.709 --> 01:59:55.719 align:start position:0%
other protections and so if that was
 
01:59:57.270 --> 01:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
happening there's a high probability the
 
01:59:58.830 --> 01:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
person would be caught and if it was
 
02:00:01.350 --> 02:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
happening frequently there would be also
 
02:00:02.990 --> 02:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
a high probability that there' be a lot
 
02:00:04.830 --> 02:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
of irregularities on the checklist and
 
02:00:07.669 --> 02:00:07.679 align:start position:0%
people watch those closely so I think I
 
02:00:09.870 --> 02:00:09.880 align:start position:0%
think this bill is uh if the think this
 
02:00:13.189 --> 02:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
bill this bill um solves a problem that
 
02:00:14.510 --> 02:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't really exist I think it's
 
02:00:16.629 --> 02:00:16.639 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and just creates more uh
 
02:00:18.709 --> 02:00:18.719 align:start position:0%
just creates a little bit more uh
 
02:00:21.709 --> 02:00:21.719 align:start position:0%
paperwork and for families who are in a
 
02:00:23.589 --> 02:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
difficult situation already at the time
 
02:00:25.910 --> 02:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
so thanks right representative M did you
 
02:00:28.310 --> 02:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
have some yes please yes I just wanted
 
02:00:32.109 --> 02:00:32.119 align:start position:0%
to mention that um it's not clear to me
 
02:00:35.430 --> 02:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
how a personal representative or an
 
02:00:38.950 --> 02:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
executive would be notified yeah um of
 
02:00:41.629 --> 02:00:41.639 align:start position:0%
this obligation that they have and how
 
02:00:42.830 --> 02:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
02:00:45.990 --> 02:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
enforced and so I will be voting against
 
02:00:49.109 --> 02:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
this bill but it's not clear to me how
 
02:00:50.830 --> 02:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
how the executive or personal
 
02:00:52.950 --> 02:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
representative would be notified or how
 
02:00:57.270 --> 02:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
they would how they would know of their
 
02:00:59.950 --> 02:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
obligation any other comments oh
 
02:00:59.960 --> 02:01:01.629 align:start position:0%
obligation any other comments oh
representative

02:01:01.629 --> 02:01:01.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:01:05.189 --> 02:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
Anders thank you Mr chair would somebody
 
02:01:05.199 --> 02:01:06.430 align:start position:0%
Anders thank you Mr chair would somebody
please

02:01:06.430 --> 02:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
clarify I'm not exactly sure on the data
 
02:01:14.669 --> 02:01:14.679 align:start position:0%
I understand all the data goes
 
02:01:18.109 --> 02:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
in and clerks and everybody has access
 
02:01:20.709 --> 02:01:20.719 align:start position:0%
to it if they have access to it why
 
02:01:27.550 --> 02:01:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:30.390 --> 02:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
records representative Perez only
 
02:01:32.550 --> 02:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
because we've had an issue in londondary
 
02:01:34.910 --> 02:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
the town clerk no one in the town has
 
02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
any jurisdiction over your supervisor of
 
02:01:39.910 --> 02:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
the checklist the only person who has
 
02:01:42.069 --> 02:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
any jurisdiction over the supervisor of
 
02:01:45.390 --> 02:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
the checklist is the secretary of state
 
02:01:49.470 --> 02:01:49.480 align:start position:0%
so therefore therefore it doesn't
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily go from the clerk to them
 
02:01:55.709 --> 02:01:55.719 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't necessarily get taken off
 
02:01:59.629 --> 02:01:59.639 align:start position:0%
nobody is double checking that so I know
 
02:02:01.950 --> 02:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
that from experience this would be a
 
02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
safeguard and how they would know of it
 
02:02:06.990 --> 02:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
is funeral parlors give you a list of
 
02:02:09.149 --> 02:02:09.159 align:start position:0%
all the things that that you were going
 
02:02:11.350 --> 02:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
to need to do and this would just be
 
02:02:13.390 --> 02:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
added to it in my in my opinion thank
 
02:02:17.629 --> 02:02:17.639 align:start position:0%

02:02:19.990 --> 02:02:20.000 align:start position:0%

for somebody's background check it's
 
02:08:57.350 --> 02:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
going to be how the Senate is going to
 
02:08:59.189 --> 02:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
basically send that over while we're in
 
02:09:01.270 --> 02:09:01.280 align:start position:0%
session because the several of the
 
02:09:02.870 --> 02:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
victim families are going to be in the
 
02:09:04.510 --> 02:09:04.520 align:start position:0%

02:09:07.229 --> 02:09:07.239 align:start position:0%
them there like the the girl who was

daughters are coming from Connecticut
 
02:09:20.030 --> 02:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
and New Jersey so they're going to
 
02:09:21.510 --> 02:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
reconsider it right then so they and
 
02:09:24.149 --> 02:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
send it over yeah just while the
 
02:09:25.549 --> 02:09:25.559 align:start position:0%
families are there to not make them have
 
02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
