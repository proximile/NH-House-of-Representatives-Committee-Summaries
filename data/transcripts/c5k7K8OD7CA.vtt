e

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone I'd like to call
 
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 align:start position:0%
to order day two of the governor's
 
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
capital budget hearings uh if you didn't
 
00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 align:start position:0%
catch the governor's opening remarks
 
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
yesterday today uh what he stated was
 
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
typically as as many of you may know we
 
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
we issue every buy between 120 $130
 
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 align:start position:0%
million in the in the capital budget uh
 
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
this year's requests for funds came in
 
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
at 1.3 billion so uh 1.1 billion of that
 
00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 align:start position:0%
is coming from general fund sources so
 
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
um just doing the basic math uh 90% of
 
00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 align:start position:0%
these projects under our current
 
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 align:start position:0%
guidelines L are not going to be
 
00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 align:start position:0%
approved so it's um I think the uh the
 
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
headline on the union leader today was
 
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh Governor's agencies lower your
 
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 align:start position:0%
expectations so
 
00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 align:start position:0%
um the bottom line is the New Hampshire
 
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
economy uh is probably in the best shape
 
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
it's ever been uh but when you come off
 
00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
a period of U uh spending which is what
 
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
we which was what we've done over the
 
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
last few years including both in the cap
 
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
both in the capital budget the operating
 
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
budget with 800 roughly $800 million of
 
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.789 align:start position:0%
budget with 800 roughly $800 million of
surplus

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 align:start position:0%
surplus
 
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
spending uh and with uh tax cuts that
 
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.070 align:start position:0%
spending uh and with uh tax cuts that
were

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
enacted uh we're going to have some hard
 
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
decisions to make over the next uh few
 
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
months uh including not the capital
 
00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 align:start position:0%
budget but the operating budget so uh
 
00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 align:start position:0%
while everything is uh strong and robust
 
00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 align:start position:0%
uh just a cautionary tale of of
 
00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 align:start position:0%
tightening to
 
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
come uh and on that cherry note uh I'd
 
00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
like to bring up uh the first is fishing
 
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
game department like to invite you up
 
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 align:start position:0%
presentation good morning um as a
 
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
30-year career Farmer in the state of
 
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I certainly understand not
 
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 align:start position:0%
having enough money in the
 
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
budget uh but with that I would like to
 
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
discuss some of the goals that we have
 
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
at fishing game um predominantly we're
 
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 align:start position:0%
still working on on hatcheries um I'm
 
00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 align:start position:0%
sure everybody here is well aware that
 
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
we will be rebuilding our hatchery in
 
00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
New Hampton with a goer Grant of about
 
00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:24.990 align:start position:0%
New Hampton with a goer Grant of about
$58

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
$58
 
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 align:start position:0%
million but we have excuse me that
 
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
leaves us with four other hatcheries in
 
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
the state that that are in desperate
 
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
need of
 
00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 align:start position:0%
repair um we had received $4.6 million
 
00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
in capital budget I believe it was two
 
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
budget Cycles ago and once again we
 
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
rolled it over to keep it alive during
 
00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
the last budget cycle but we weren't
 
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
ready to commit to what we wanted to do
 
00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
um we were looking at the entire
 
00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 align:start position:0%
Hatchery system and we just needed more
 
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
time to study the problem um we believe
 
00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
at this point we do have a good plan on
 
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
what we think the other four hatcheries
 
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
are going to need um our primary goal is
 
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
to go in and repair any structural
 
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
issues at the buildings predominantly
 
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
roofs uh there are some uh block walls
 
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 align:start position:0%
that need to be repaired uh reeal the
 
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
raceways and then um as we studied the
 
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
issue at the new new Durham Hatchery um
 
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
one of the things that became very um
 
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
evident to us was is that we had we had
 
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
underestimated the impact that predation
 
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
has on our fish and on our management at
 
00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
these hatcheries and how that impacts
 
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
water quality at the hatcheries so those
 
00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 align:start position:0%
are the three areas that we're very
 
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
interested in trying to uh plug some of
 
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
the holes that we have at the four
 
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.070 align:start position:0%
the holes that we have at the four
hatcheries

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
hatcheries
 
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
um the 4.6 million that was approved uh
 
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
was only approved to be spent at the new
 
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
Durham Hatchery as we we went through
 
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 align:start position:0%
the process at New Durham it would cost
 
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
us roughly $60 million just to treat the
 
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
water at the new Durham Hatchery to meet
 
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
the new 12 part per billion phosphorus
 
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
level that uh EPA uh has given us for
 
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
our discharge permit we do not believe
 
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
at this time that that is a good
 
00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
investment um for example we believe
 
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
we'll be spending less than that to
 
00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
totally rebuild the Hatchery at New
 
00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 align:start position:0%
Hampton and we think excuse me we think
 
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
that that's a much better investment not
 
00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 align:start position:0%
only will we be able to maintain clean
 
00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:34.039 align:start position:0%
water but we'll be able to improve our
 
00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
ability to raise
 
00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:37.309 align:start position:0%
ability to raise
fish

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
fish
 
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
um we would like um we what we need to
 
00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
do at New Hampton at this point we are
 
00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 align:start position:0%
going to meet the uh NEP permit by
 
00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
reducing Fish Production so if you're
 
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
familiar with the Hatchery um we have a
 
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 align:start position:0%
series of round tanks at the bottom end
 
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
of the Hatchery and that those are the
 
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
tanks that we will continue to use the
 
00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
rest of the Hatchery we will not be
 
00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
using for the foreseeable future so we
 
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
would like to erect a office uh some
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
office space and bathroom spaces down at
 
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
that end of the
 
00:07:09.869 --> 00:07:09.879 align:start position:0%
Hatchery um this will probably be a
 
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
portable type structure whether it be a
 
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
a modular home or whether it be a work
 
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
trailer type structure that's what we
 
00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
would like to erect down there we would
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
like to um uh build uh some predation uh
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
structures over those over those
 
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
tanks um the the other reason for
 
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
building the office down there is we
 
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
think we could come up with a much more
 
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
energy efficient uh building that would
 
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
take a lot less money to heat um and be
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
a lot smaller building um as we go down
 
00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
through um we would like to then spend
 
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
any of the Surplus the uh 4.6 million
 
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
the balance of the 4.6 million uh at the
 
00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
Berlin Hatchery we need to do some
 
00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
re-roofing of Hatchery buildings um
 
00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:00.199 align:start position:0%
replacing of windows and doors and place
 
00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
um what is currently a 25-year-old
 
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
Predator control structures there they
 
00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
all have um worn out and need to be
 
00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:09.639 align:start position:0%
replaced at the Milford Hatchery we need
 
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
to replace the roof on the main Hatchery
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
building repair the ventilation system
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
and perform mold uh
 
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
remediation we need to R roof two of the
 
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
employees houses we have some structural
 
00:08:23.149 --> 00:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
issues with the block wall and the
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
Hatchery building that will need to be
 
00:08:27.629 --> 00:08:27.639 align:start position:0%
repaired we need to install an auto
 
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
sampling unit at this uh at the
 
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
discharge location all of the other new
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
auto sampling units that we did uh
 
00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
basically we just were able to attach
 
00:08:39.389 --> 00:08:39.399 align:start position:0%
them to the end of the line and build a
 
00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
structure over them uh this one we're
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
going to have to do some considerable uh
 
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
repiping in order to um make it so that
 
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
it'll work uh once again we'll be
 
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
sealing the Raceway tanks and replacing
 
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
doors and windows um this is for our new
 
00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
request um we would this is where we
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
were going to invest in um the the $2.1
 
00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
million request is for uh Predator
 
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
control me uh measures to be built at
 
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
the New Hampton Hatchery I'm sorry at
 
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
the Milford Hatchery at the Twin
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
Mountain Hatchery we'll replace the
 
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
roofs on the hatch house employees house
 
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
garage and Visitor Center seal the
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
raceways replace doors and windows and
 
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
repair the corner of the Hatchery
 
00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:24.519 align:start position:0%
building um at the Warren Hatchy we need
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
to re-roof offices the office Visitor
 
00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
Center and the employee resident and
 
00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:31.519 align:start position:0%
Place doors and windows at the
 
00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
facility um also as part of our as also
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
as part of our Capital request this year
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
we are also requesting $66,500 for
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
Inland Fisheries equipment which will
 
00:09:46.949 --> 00:09:46.959 align:start position:0%
consist of a
 
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:50.200 align:start position:0%
um uh what they call an autonomous
 
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
portable scientific echos Sounder so
 
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
basically a sonar unit that helps us uh
 
00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
track and keep and and develop better
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
research numbers on populations in our
 
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
in our big lakes uh as well as a new
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
generator for the Berlin facility um our
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
facilities and land division wishes to
 
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
replace a a heavy trailer for hauling
 
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:15.160 align:start position:0%
heavy equipment as well as a 25y old
 
00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:18.279 align:start position:0%
backo I'd be happy to oh um one other
 
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
thing uh we have developed a really good
 
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
presentation on our new Hampton Hatchery
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
project I know that's something that
 
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily come before this
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
committee but at your leisure we would
 
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
would certainly be willing to come back
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
and make that presentation if you folks
 
00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:34.519 align:start position:0%
have an interest in that we have
 
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
presented it in the house of the fishing
 
00:10:38.829 --> 00:10:38.839 align:start position:0%
game committee as well as in the Senate
 
00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:40.639 align:start position:0%
uh to their committee but we'd be happy
 
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
to come back and uh offer to do it here
 
00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
too are there any
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
questions I believe there are uh my my
 
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
question is if you could give us an
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
update on on the hatcheries and the last
 
00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:54.200 align:start position:0%
thing I remember hearing was that they
 
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
were about to go out for bids I think
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
you you either on the new Hampton
 
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
project yes okay so yes we have um the
 
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
engineering firm has been selected it's
 
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
HDR um we have put out to bid for uh the
 
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:11.240 align:start position:0%
bidding process for the contract
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
managers we received uh four bids we
 
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
Whitt that down to three and actually
 
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
when I get done here today I'll have
 
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
another meeting dealing with that okay
 
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
how how did the bids come in in relation
 
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
to expectations we believe that we'll be
 
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:28.120 align:start position:0%
able to build this project you know on
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
budget but once again you need to
 
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
remember we're only at 30% design this
 
00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
this this type of building uh
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
contractual agreement a little different
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
than what we're used to doing um because
 
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
usually you have 100% design before you
 
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
go get the contracted to build on it so
 
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
we're bringing in the contract manager
 
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
to be part of the design team uh it
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
allows us several things number one
 
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit better the idea is is
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
that when we get done I I don't want to
 
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
have a a a100 million Hatchery design
 
00:12:04.829 --> 00:12:04.839 align:start position:0%
and a $55 million Hatchery budget so it
 
00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
allows a little bit more reality
 
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
throughout the uh to take place during
 
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
the design better communication it also
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
allows a contract manager to pre-order
 
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
some of this equipment is pretty
 
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
specialized in today's world some of
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
this uh some of this equipment has some
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
long lead times between ordering and
 
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
delivery so that allows us to try to
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
pre-order items that we're going to need
 
00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:29.839 align:start position:0%
um so that we can meet to go for
 
00:12:31.629 --> 00:12:31.639 align:start position:0%
deadline of completion of construction
 
00:12:34.189 --> 00:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
by December 26 okay uh one other
 
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
question for me which is could you just
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
explain what the predatory control is
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
and the hat is just like a a tar or
 
00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
covering on the so what we're looking at
 
00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:45.399 align:start position:0%
um if you've been to our hatch some of
 
00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
our old hatcheries uh we've used um
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
several different methods one was they
 
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
basically kind of look like um um an
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
igloo or a tent it's a canvas structure
 
00:12:59.310 --> 00:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
that sits over round tanks the those
 
00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
were very successful we've used some uh
 
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
basically their Greenhouse Hoops with
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
netting um they can be successful we had
 
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
some problems at one of our facilities
 
00:13:11.949 --> 00:13:11.959 align:start position:0%
where we attached them to concrete
 
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
raceways where we actually attached the
 
00:13:16.189 --> 00:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
steel structure of the greenhouse hoop
 
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
to the top of the raceways and under
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
snow load or ice load we loost you know
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
that it cracked the raceways and and did
 
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:25.160 align:start position:0%
damage to our wasteway so we got some
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
issues with those but we we I still
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
believe that we can you know better
 
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
better management of it or better
 
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
placement of it we might be able to to
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
continue to use some of that um and then
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
yes what we're looking at and if you'd
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
allow me to use the word coverall that
 
00:13:41.949 --> 00:13:41.959 align:start position:0%
is a that is a name brand but basically
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
these are the fabric quantit Huts that
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
that you see uh quite often used in
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
agriculture um our DOT uses some
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
structures similar to this for salt
 
00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:54.759 align:start position:0%
sheds um so that would be what we would
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
go to one of the things that we're
 
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
trying to do is is originally a lot of
 
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
our uh structures just barely fit over
 
00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:05.839 align:start position:0%
the raceways and that did not that
 
00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
basically meant that you know they would
 
00:14:08.829 --> 00:14:08.839 align:start position:0%
catch the fish in Nets and then have to
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
haul the fish out of the structure to
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
load into the truck so it was very labor
 
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:17.240 align:start position:0%
intensive um it it causes you know
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
stress injuries in our staff so we would
 
00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:22.959 align:start position:0%
like to be able to provide um most of
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
our setups where we'd be able to put the
 
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
truck inside the Predator control
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
structure we have two typ of predators
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
basically ground Predators so we you
 
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:34.360 align:start position:0%
know some of our early thoughts really
 
00:14:37.389 --> 00:14:37.399 align:start position:0%
didn't was not effective at keeping uh
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
uh otter and mink out of these out of
 
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
the tanks and then the other predators
 
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
are are bird Predators anything you know
 
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
Eagles and Ospreys and King Fishers and
 
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
that um that helps at the end I was like
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
does he mean birds eat the fish my
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
predator control but apparently birds
 
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
and otters um I have a couple questions
 
00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:07.160 align:start position:0%
one is um your uh your Capital requests
 
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
are funded by the fishing game fund
 
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
correct and you have a debt service line
 
00:15:15.069 --> 00:15:15.079 align:start position:0%
in your budget um I don't believe
 
00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:17.959 align:start position:0%
I uh no I do because we are making debt
 
00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
payments now do you know roughly how
 
00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
much a year you're paying now I do not
 
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
know what that is I'd be happy to get
 
00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
that no it's I I don't need it today or
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
anything so um that's helpful I I had a
 
00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
question about there's a lot of talk
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
about employee housing how many
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
um I presume I presume these aren't
 
00:15:39.069 --> 00:15:39.079 align:start position:0%
people who like permanently live there
 
00:15:42.309 --> 00:15:42.319 align:start position:0%
it's overnight no they are like so like
 
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
fred is a guy who like for five years
 
00:15:47.949 --> 00:15:47.959 align:start position:0%
lives at a hatchery we correct we have
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
how many um I let me stop and think I
 
00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
think I have three in Berlin one in Twin
 
00:15:55.639 --> 00:15:59.150 align:start position:0%
think I have three in Berlin one in Twin
Mountain

00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:00.509 --> 00:16:00.519 align:start position:0%
two in
 
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
Milford two in New
 
00:16:05.309 --> 00:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
Hampton Warren Hatchery has one that
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
we're currently using but then an
 
00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
apartment that we're not currently using
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
issues and so do so the issue is is that
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
um much like an agriculture problems
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
happen in the middle of the night um
 
00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
this practice uh we've been doing this
 
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
since the beginning on our hatcheries
 
00:16:27.629 --> 00:16:27.639 align:start position:0%
where we have staff that actually live
 
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
at the hatcheries so if there's an alarm
 
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
that goes off or an issue that comes up
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
or they're out checking uh that puts our
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
staff there to be able to handle
 
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
emergencies in the middle of the night
 
00:16:42.749 --> 00:16:42.759 align:start position:0%
um it's in the world of agriculture it's
 
00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:44.360 align:start position:0%
not uncommon in the world of hatcheries
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon I understand for most
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
state employees the idea of supplying
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
housing alongside a job is a little
 
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
different but there are some
 
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
requirements that come with that no
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
there's a I mean it it's interesting I
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
was looking at Old Personnel rules and
 
00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:01.639 align:start position:0%
there's a we we have a whole whole set
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
of rules on uh compens if housing is
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
part of your compensation yeah and I
 
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
thought I wonder how many people that
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
affects but
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
mostly back in the day when the state
 
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
had Farms you had like for example at
 
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
UNH they have housing for some of their
 
00:17:20.669 --> 00:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
staff at UNH alongside the Farms um you
 
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
know the state uh prison I would assume
 
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
had housing the state hospital would
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
have would have had housing with those
 
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
Farms but they're all gone
 
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:36.679 align:start position:0%

a brief overview of each of our five
 
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
Capital project requests leaving time
 
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
for questions and I'm going to begin on
 
00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:17.919 align:start position:0%
page four of your slide Deck with our
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
first request for Road tool and in
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
preparing for this presentation today I
 
00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:26.039 align:start position:0%
was sharing with friends that I would be
 
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
talking about Road Road tool which
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
prompted a a conversation and discussion
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
around toll booth so I thought I'd start
 
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
with a definition that I'm going to be
 
00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
talking about the gas taex in the 22
 
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
cents so um our current rotal Bureau is
 
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for the collection of the
 
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
single largest source of revenue for the
 
00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.390 align:start position:0%
single largest source of revenue for the
highway

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
highway
 
00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
fund for State fisal year 23 that total
 
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.110 align:start position:0%
fund for State fisal year 23 that total
was

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
our current automated fuel tax system is
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
installed on
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
onr we have been using this system since
 
00:20:14.909 --> 00:20:14.919 align:start position:0%
2008 we are under an active maintenance
 
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
so it's been upgraded over years by the
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
vendor it is at the end of its useful
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
life we had gone out to RFP in
 
00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
2023 for a new cloud-based subscription
 
00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.750 align:start position:0%
2023 for a new cloud-based subscription
platform

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
platform
 
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
at the time we decided not to move
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
forward with the new platform as there
 
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
is a large upfront cost hence the
 
00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.029 align:start position:0%
is a large upfront cost hence the
capital

00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
capital
 
00:20:42.029 --> 00:20:42.039 align:start position:0%
request and the increase in the annual
 
00:20:42.039 --> 00:20:43.990 align:start position:0%
request and the increase in the annual
maintenance

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
cost the plan is to go out for RFP again
 
00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.230 align:start position:0%
cost the plan is to go out for RFP again
in

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
2025 and Implement in
 
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
2026 our current contract expires June
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
30 of 20
 
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
26 our future state of course would be
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
to support ongoing efficient Revenue
 
00:21:09.549 --> 00:21:09.559 align:start position:0%
collection for motor fuel tools and move
 
00:21:11.549 --> 00:21:11.559 align:start position:0%
this to the cloud-based
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
system we are looking at a
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
request our second capital project
 
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
request is for the gun range training fa
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
facility at 1.5
 
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
million our current state of this
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
training building is under sized at 23
 
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
by 20 this shed if you will is run off
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
generator power there is no restrooms or
 
00:21:51.149 --> 00:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
running water it is it's an inadequate
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
facility um and it's we really need a
 
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
facility that we can utilize year
 
00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:03.799 align:start position:0%
round funds would be used um to for
 
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
classrooms audio visual equipment um a
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
dedicated weapons room cleaning
 
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
facilities certainly power and install
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
running Waters facilities so um and the
 
00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:20.039 align:start position:0%
training facility for inuse um use of
 
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
force classroom training Force scenario
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
and practical training and live fire
 
00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:27.919 align:start position:0%
firearms training the new facility the
 
00:22:30.029 --> 00:22:30.039 align:start position:0%
new training facility would properly
 
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
support the increasing training demands
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
Police request three for troop e
 
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
renovation so over time the department
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
of safety has been evaluating the health
 
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
of all of the troop stations and this
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
has been through um really assessing the
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
buildings as well as all systems within
 
00:22:59.390 --> 00:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
each of the buildings and putting forth
 
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:01.720 align:start position:0%
um request to for renovation of all of
 
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
its sites and Troop e is really up for
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
renovation and through this analysis
 
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
it's been identified that um in troopy
 
00:23:12.669 --> 00:23:12.679 align:start position:0%
the electrical systems water issues
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
septic doors um this trivia is next for
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
us um you can see certainly through um
 
00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:24.039 align:start position:0%
some of these photos um we really need
 
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
to pay attention to this
 
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
building there is some opportunity is on
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
page seven that we've identified in just
 
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
this land and addressing one of our
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
other issues with um the impound law in
 
00:23:39.789 --> 00:23:39.799 align:start position:0%
conquered that doesn't really allow
 
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
space and it's really um we need more
 
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
space for the car unit and um that that
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
is just we don't have enough space in
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
conquered and this would allow um
 
00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
additional space for investigators to
 
00:23:57.789 --> 00:23:57.799 align:start position:0%
process complex cases so we're looking
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
to move um established that in Tamworth
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
renovation Capital request four is for
 
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
Grants management
 
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
software in fiscal year 23 oura
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
expenditures for
 
00:24:22.799 --> 00:24:25.630 align:start position:0%
expenditures for
over10

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
over10
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
million um this software would really
 
00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
this is really pre-award so this would
 
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
support our local communities it's
 
00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
forward facing it would allow
 
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
transparency in the application process
 
00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 23 we had over
 
00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
253 applications that only continue to
 
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
increase in fiscal year
 
00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
24 um and this is by month ending May so
 
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
there's this is only continuing to grow
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
um our current state is really grants
 
00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
applications managed through Excel
 
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets it's a manual process there
 
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
is no transparency for our local
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
communities in this process to find out
 
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
where their application is currently
 
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
they are calling and waiting for a call
 
00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:15.799 align:start position:0%
back um to find out their status so we
 
00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:17.480 align:start position:0%
really want to create through the system
 
00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:19.240 align:start position:0%
efficiencies in the process as well as
 
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
transpar transparency for our
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
stakeholders so our future state would
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
create those efficiencies Implement a
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
new centralized Grant management system
 
00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
to streamline processes improve
 
00:25:33.789 --> 00:25:33.799 align:start position:0%
efficiencies across across groups
 
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
centralized data standardized processes
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
and en enable future growth some of the
 
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
areas this this would also address is
 
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
the grants life cycles for sub award
 
00:25:45.789 --> 00:25:45.799 align:start position:0%
management centralized Grant data
 
00:25:47.789 --> 00:25:47.799 align:start position:0%
management improved reporting and
 
00:25:50.669 --> 00:25:50.679 align:start position:0%
Analysis we certainly would work better
 
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
together and off of spreadsheets
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
workflow automation enhance
 
00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
collaboration integrate capabilities
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
and hopefully reduce some
 
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
findings our plan for implementation for
 
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
Grants management software would be
 
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
through because this is a new software
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
for the state would be through an RFI
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
process and then RFP we would utilize
 
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
the time in fiscal year 25 for the RFI
 
00:26:23.149 --> 00:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
process and then move forward with an
 
00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
RFP to
 
00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:27.919 align:start position:0%
contract we did as a group look at um
 
00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:29.110 align:start position:0%
contract we did as a group look at um
potential

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
um available software that others are
 
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
using that would feed to um our federal
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
sources our grant funding sources that
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
are um that we work mostly with now for
 
00:26:46.269 --> 00:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
FEMA and there are available options out
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
there project request five is
 
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
modernization of plate room production
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
equipment the equipment at the
 
00:26:56.669 --> 00:26:56.679 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections which
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturers are license plates is some
 
00:27:02.909 --> 00:27:02.919 align:start position:0%
of that equipment is more than a hundred
 
00:27:07.549 --> 00:27:07.559 align:start position:0%
years old and um really needs
 
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
replacement so we are looking we got
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
this estimate for from our current ven
 
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
vendor to update that equipment and um
 
00:27:20.909 --> 00:27:20.919 align:start position:0%
and currently there are 91 different
 
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
plate types there are 12 steps in this
 
00:27:25.149 --> 00:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
current process and of course you have
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing cost of each plate
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
um we would be looking our future state
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
is certainly to increase increase
 
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
production support the Department of
 
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
Correction mission statement and um
 
00:27:42.029 --> 00:27:42.039 align:start position:0%
reduce the environmental impact
 
00:27:44.269 --> 00:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
utilizing sustainable
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
Technologies I think with that kind of
 
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
brings us back certainly to from the
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
license plate to collecting for the road
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:03.640 align:start position:0%
question thank you uh just for
 
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
clarification the on the the gun range
 
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
the gun range is an outdoor gun range
 
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
and the facility is is does not contain
 
00:28:12.269 --> 00:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
a gun range in it it's just for
 
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
administrative classrooms and things
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
like that yes sir it's really it's a
 
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
piece of land off of exit 23 in New
 
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
Hampton and there's just a a stick frame
 
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
building with um plywood and a wall that
 
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:25.240 align:start position:0%
I think we built it in the early '90s
 
00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
but there's no running water no
 
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
electricity it's generator there's no
 
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
bathroom so it's really like a it's like
 
00:28:35.789 --> 00:28:35.799 align:start position:0%
an old shed do do the Troopers have any
 
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
indoor range that they can practice at
 
00:28:39.149 --> 00:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
during the winter months or is it
 
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
strictly Outdoors it's all it's outdoors
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
that's that's all we do uh and this is a
 
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
a question sort of related to that but
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
not on your list here uh the current
 
00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
sidearms of the Troopers uh are they
 
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
iron sighted or do they have they issued
 
00:28:57.789 --> 00:28:57.799 align:start position:0%
Red Dot or lab they are they're issued
 
00:28:57.799 --> 00:28:58.990 align:start position:0%
Red Dot or lab they are they're issued
that

00:28:58.990 --> 00:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
they they are issued that the sightings
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
iron SES yeah okay and then they have
 
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
the additional sites okay any any
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
thought about upgrading the sidearm or
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
is that's not well the sidearms are um
 
00:29:12.509 --> 00:29:12.519 align:start position:0%
so yes they are the colonel and his
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
staff are looking at that and they
 
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
currently are those are toward life's
 
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
end and they're they're in process of
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
studying that and that would have to be
 
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
built into our operating budget so we
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
are having those discussions not for
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
Capital but for operating but it's it's
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
time and they've been looking at them
 
00:29:29.039 --> 00:29:30.549 align:start position:0%
time and they've been looking at them
for

00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:30.559 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:29:34.029 --> 00:29:34.039 align:start position:0%
over over a year or so okay great thank
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
you that's it for
 
00:29:38.669 --> 00:29:38.679 align:start position:0%
me good morning I have a question uh
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
surprisingly on the grants management
 
00:29:42.909 --> 00:29:42.919 align:start position:0%
system um and Amy I don't know if you
 
00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
can talk more on this but I um we just
 
00:29:47.549 --> 00:29:47.559 align:start position:0%
did we well let me back up we have a
 
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
major contract with our current vendor
 
00:29:52.269 --> 00:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
to upgrade our state Erp system which
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
includes a grants management component
 
00:29:56.669 --> 00:29:56.679 align:start position:0%
and I know that we recently did a a
 
00:29:59.070 --> 00:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
change order to add safety as the pilot
 
00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:01.039 align:start position:0%
agency to go live with that Grant
 
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
Management module so I was just trying
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
to understand that relationship with
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
coming on board with the grant
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
management system that the state is
 
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
currently upgrading versus going out
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
with a new system and how that might
 
00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
connect or not connect so I see them as
 
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
two different systems so this would this
 
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
system would focus primarily on
 
00:30:24.669 --> 00:30:24.679 align:start position:0%
pre-award so what I've what I've learned
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
with pre-award and post award system is
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
they're generally separate systems so
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
because you wouldn't necessarily want
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
all applications to feed automatically
 
00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:38.559 align:start position:0%
into your post- award compliance system
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
because not all of your applications are
 
00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
going to be funded and that budget is
 
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:47.480 align:start position:0%
not going to that that is provided
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
federally is going to um feed into your
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
Finance system it's not going to be
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
approved as what's necessarily um uh
 
00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.830 align:start position:0%
approved as what's necessarily um uh
submitted

00:30:58.830 --> 00:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
um federally they're going to make
 
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
tweaks and they're going to um edit they
 
00:31:05.149 --> 00:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
might fund certain lines and not other
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
lines so you want you'd want to have
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
some manual process within that to then
 
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
feed into your Finance system so I think
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
there is some manual process in there
 
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
the only other thing I was going to say
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
is I know that um I know Dennis might be
 
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
able to talk more about it but our
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
Salesforce contract we currently use
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
them for a lot of that pre-award process
 
00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:27.039 align:start position:0%
and um applications that we use
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
throughout sort of the here in arpa so I
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
don't know if you've looked at that
 
00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559 align:start position:0%
contract at all just to see if that
 
00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
might be a solution also for you or if
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
you haven't maybe could connect on that
 
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I can I can comment on that I
 
00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:41.240 align:start position:0%
actually I'm just messaging with Ron
 
00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
Reed your it lead as as we're speaking
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
um so uh we're actually working gopher
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
is currently running Salesforce right
 
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
now it's an older version that they
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
actually created they worked with
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
Salesforce to create um early covid for
 
00:32:01.629 --> 00:32:01.639 align:start position:0%
um for managing the cares act funds and
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
um so it's been running for years um
 
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
they're we've been speaking to them
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
about going to to the since then
 
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
Salesforce has created a commercial
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
offer shelf offer shelf version and we
 
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
have a number of agencies right now
 
00:32:16.509 --> 00:32:16.519 align:start position:0%
looking at that so it's it's possible
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
we'll end up standardizing on that for
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
the state for the pre-award stuff so so
 
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:24.440 align:start position:0%
and we we can talk about that should the
 
00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
funds get appropriated and and work with
 
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
you and I I'll you know I'll be
 
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
communicating with Ron as well that's
 
00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
yeah any other questions seeing none
 
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
time like to invite up Department of
 
00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:48.070 align:start position:0%
time like to invite up Department of
Environmental

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.389 --> 00:33:03.399 align:start position:0%
good morning commissioner good morning
 
00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
uh again I'm for the record uh Bob Scott
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
the department environmental services I
 
00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
have our chief operating officer Susan
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
Carlson with me uh so I so as you get
 
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
your your handouts uh on slide two uh
 
00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
you'll see our total requests are for
 
00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.950 align:start position:0%
you'll see our total requests are for
$63

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
$63
 
00:33:24.909 --> 00:33:24.919 align:start position:0%
million um eight of the of of the eight
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
requests two are for Dam work uh three
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
related to matching funds for federal
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
programs and particularly the uh the the
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
bill uh infrastructure funds that we're
 
00:33:38.629 --> 00:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
still getting uh in the match required
 
00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:40.519 align:start position:0%
for that and the final three are for
 
00:33:42.909 --> 00:33:42.919 align:start position:0%
ongoing capital projects that we're in
 
00:33:45.629 --> 00:33:45.639 align:start position:0%
the middle of uh I'll I'll review each
 
00:33:48.629 --> 00:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
uh in a little bit of detail uh moving
 
00:33:52.509 --> 00:33:52.519 align:start position:0%
to slide three on the slide deck uh the
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
first request is for 10 projects at dams
 
00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
either for the repair work of the dam
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
directly or for the design work to do
 
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
that repair work uh included in the list
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
of three projects for the Lakeport Dam
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh the import of that dam is Lake
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
Waki uh two projects are from Murphy Dam
 
00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:11.919 align:start position:0%
in Pittsburgh that controls the
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
headwaters of the Connecticut River uh
 
00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
in addition uh we also have two uh we're
 
00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079 align:start position:0%
calling them slope machines but for uh
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance uh of the
 
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh the uh the additional dams that we
 
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
have the
 
00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
uh and then and then also uh there's
 
00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
also embedded in that is generators for
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
the our new uh Dam facility at silk Farm
 
00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
Road uh and then uh upgrades to the uh
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
skada or industrial control systems at
 
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
several of the Lakes uh to help with
 
00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:48.919 align:start position:0%
automation not included in this but in a
 
00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
in a on slide I think slide seven but
 
00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
I'll talk to that and the IT portion of
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
our request is embedded uh our flood
 
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
monitoring Network upgrades so we can
 
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
help predict uh a little bit better
 
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
flooding to keep the dam safe and our
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
community so moving to slide
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
four uh we broken this out a little bit
 
00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
different from the uh other Dam projects
 
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
these are four empowerments on pway Lake
 
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
which is State Park as you're probably
 
00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
aware uh they're in poor condition in uh
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
becoming unstable and having seepage
 
00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:28.839 align:start position:0%
issues uh given first at the state park
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
and given that for at least to to do
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
this work we're lowering Lake the the
 
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
water Body by almost 25 ft uh we want to
 
00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:41.720 align:start position:0%
do all these at once uh so that way we
 
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
minimize the impact to the dncr for
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
revenues for our obviously for our
 
00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
citizens for recreation so in this case
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
we it only makes sense to do these at
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
once that would allow us to uh basically
 
00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
only have the uh the lake lowered that
 
00:35:58.589 --> 00:35:58.599 align:start position:0%
much for one season and then have it
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
back on on track
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
again moving to uh slide five uh as many
 
00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:07.640 align:start position:0%
of you are aware we've through the
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
infrastructure act we've received uh
 
00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
extra money that lasts it's a 5-year
 
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
period it goes through Federal fiscal
 
00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
year of 26 which greatly increased our
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
state revolving loan input uh the the
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
upshot of that is in the early years we
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
were required to do 10% match to get all
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
this extra money in the outer years
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
which we're now entering we're required
 
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
to match 20% to to receive this money so
 
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
this is this is what you're seeing in
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
slide five uh and again this would this
 
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
amount would allow us to get almost 27
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
funds slide six is just a little bit
 
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
more detail on that and again again this
 
00:36:53.309 --> 00:36:53.319 align:start position:0%
extra money as I call it uh gets us
 
00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
through Federal fiscal year
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
26 uh which is obviously not the same as
 
00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:00.200 align:start position:0%
our state fiscal year uh and then we'll
 
00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
go back to more normal uh amounts that
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
traditional we have traditionally we
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
have seen uh which will obviously
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
therefore require less match moving
 
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
forward on slide
 
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
seven uh item number four is for super
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
Sun fund uh State match so in miramac uh
 
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:26.200 align:start position:0%
in 1992 neure plating was listed as a
 
00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
superf fund site uh EPA did did remedial
 
00:37:33.069 --> 00:37:33.079 align:start position:0%
action on that there's still issues not
 
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
completely addressed that particular
 
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:38.200 align:start position:0%
site does not have a responsible party
 
00:37:40.829 --> 00:37:40.839 align:start position:0%
uh where we are right now in the the
 
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
sequence of things is additional money
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
going in the state to to remediate that
 
00:37:50.109 --> 00:37:50.119 align:start position:0%
site requires a 10 10% State match uh
 
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
this money here the uh
 
00:37:55.309 --> 00:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
$829,000 would leverage almost 13
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
money item number eight slide number six
 
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
is our groundwater well expansion so
 
00:38:10.309 --> 00:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
many of you excuse me may remember not
 
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
well not last year uh this year but last
 
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
year and the two years before that we
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
went three years running in severe
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
drought for different parts of the State
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh that that helped us realize we need
 
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
to to be able to better monitor our
 
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
groundwater to be able to not only
 
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
predict but also understand the impacts
 
00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
of these these type of things uh in the
 
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
last cycle we were able to fund uh 16 of
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
25 needed new new additional Wells along
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
with uh data loggers and Telemetry to go
 
00:38:43.309 --> 00:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
along with those uh this request would
 
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
ask us would allow us to complete the
 
00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
the rest of those uh in order to better
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
monitor those
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
activities slide seven which is uh
 
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me slide nine which is uh item
 
00:38:59.069 --> 00:38:59.079 align:start position:0%
number seven uh it infr structure uh
 
00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
we've been doing a lot of work uh on uh
 
00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
working closely with doit on our e
 
00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.470 align:start position:0%
working closely with doit on our e
permitting

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
permitting
 
00:39:10.349 --> 00:39:10.359 align:start position:0%
uh uh Evolution for one of a better word
 
00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
uh the the good and bad part is as we as
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
we evolve our customers uh at all levels
 
00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh of the State uh depend on that that
 
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
being online whether it's e per meting
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
or just environmental D data so as we're
 
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:26.440 align:start position:0%
making good strides we're also need to
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
maintain our current system while we
 
00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:31.240 align:start position:0%
develop and and move move forward so
 
00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
some some uh so that's part of this
 
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
request also as I mentioned this
 
00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
forecasting uh for flood emergencies uh
 
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
that system is embedded here also so and
 
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
then finally on slide 10 uh item number
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
eight is a request for the W Baki River
 
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
Basin so for background again for those
 
00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:55.960 align:start position:0%
who haven't followed this uh this this
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
is a waste White facility in Franklin it
 
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
with collection uh systems in 10
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
communities uh ranging from Meredith uh
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
to Alton to lonia to Franklin
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
itself uh that's uh that is funded
 
00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:13.839 align:start position:0%
entirely by user fees from those
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
communities so it's part of the part of
 
00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
our capital budget request because we
 
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
own and operate the system or or the the
 
00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment facility but they
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
fund this this is not General funded uh
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
as with many of these type of systems uh
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
we are at the point now where lines are
 
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
breaking uh with fairly
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
regularity uh the the sewer Mains and
 
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
need to be replaced so we have uh a lot
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
of this is for sewer line Replacements
 
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh the communities again are supportive
 
00:40:47.309 --> 00:40:47.319 align:start position:0%
expecting it and wanting this uh there's
 
00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
really no choice that the obviously
 
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
replacing a line before it breaks and
 
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
doing it in a controll fashion is much
 
00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
cheaper than doing many repairs as
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
things break uh
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly uh so so that's that's the
 
00:41:03.309 --> 00:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
Crux of this but again if nothing else I
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
I I just want the committee to
 
00:41:07.309 --> 00:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
understand that this is not capital
 
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
budget money excuse me it is capital
 
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
budget money but it's not general fund
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
money so with that we're very happy to
 
00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
answer any questions I have uh our
 
00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
directors R the back along with uh Corey
 
00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:20.200 align:start position:0%
Clark who runs our dam program so if
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
there's any questions we're happy to
 
00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
answer that great thank you so much uh
 
00:41:28.109 --> 00:41:28.119 align:start position:0%
two-part question uh how many dams are
 
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
are under DS's perview and and how do
 
00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
you rank them to or or do you rank them
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
to determine whether or not uh repairs
 
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
are needed is it is as simple as you
 
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
know red yellow green coating system or
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
something far more complicated than that
 
00:41:45.069 --> 00:41:45.079 align:start position:0%
so Su is going to correct me if I get
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
the exact number wrong I want to say 276
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
dams is that correct 274 I was off by a
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
small percentage uh so those are State
 
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
on dams that thees is responsible for
 
00:41:59.950 --> 00:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
for operation certainly M maintaining uh
 
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
and then we have roughly 10 times that
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
for private dams throughout the state
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
just to give you an order of magnitude
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh as far as how do they rank it's
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
really and you'll notice there's always
 
00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
uh by the way so in our request for dams
 
00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
we we typically will give here's the
 
00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
dams we want to work on and then we
 
00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
always have a a footnote saying
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
depending on needs so what you know for
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
instance if there's a sinkhole in front
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
of a dam that that suddenly develops in
 
00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
the middle of the cycle
 
00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
we we we want to fix that so nobody gets
 
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
hurt so to answer your question uh
 
00:42:36.549 --> 00:42:36.559 align:start position:0%
director is um what we do is we look at
 
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
there's different categorizations
 
00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
categorizations categorizations for dams
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
High Hazard dams are ones that are going
 
00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
going to risk if they were to breach
 
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
risk uh life and property uh those are
 
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
the highest risk so we we we base our
 
00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
priorities on that and then on condition
 
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
so we we kind of match the two so we
 
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
have a a conditioned Dam again something
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
with cracks in it or a sink hole in
 
00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:03.640 align:start position:0%
front of it that's going to if it goes
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
will will take out houses or a bridge or
 
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
something like that that gets a higher
 
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
priority than a dam uh for instance uh
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
fish and game dams you know they're for
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
more for recreation dncr dams are more
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
for recreation they're they're perhaps
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
depending on the dam less likely to have
 
00:43:22.549 --> 00:43:22.559 align:start position:0%
those type of impact so they're
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
important for recreation Etc but if
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to get hurt then they're
 
00:43:29.549 --> 00:43:29.559 align:start position:0%
lower priority do you know how many dams
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
are in categorized as poor condition uh
 
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to turn to Corey uh Clark here
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
so I don't know how we want to get him
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
chair I told him to sit up front he was
 
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
trying not to but now he knows why so
 
00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
for the record Corey Clark chief
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
engineer the Dan Bureau New Hampshire
 
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services so
 
00:43:54.829 --> 00:43:54.839 align:start position:0%
we have um out of those um High Hazard
 
00:43:56.549 --> 00:43:56.559 align:start position:0%
dams that uh commissioner Scott was
 
00:43:58.990 --> 00:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
mentioning there's 64 High Hazard dams
 
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire is in
 
00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:01.839 align:start position:0%
charge of out of the
 
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
274 mentioned earlier uh 34 of those are
 
00:44:08.109 --> 00:44:08.119 align:start position:0%
in poor condition what we're finding is
 
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
that uh the number of dams in poor
 
00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:13.960 align:start position:0%
condition is it has increased
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
um uh by over 50% in the past 10 to 20
 
00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
years the reason of that is not that
 
00:44:20.549 --> 00:44:20.559 align:start position:0%
we're building more dams that those dams
 
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
are falling into worse Condition it's
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
that the computer modeling and the
 
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
techniques used to analyze these dams is
 
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
getting better and better
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
so while the the structures themselves
 
00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
may not be deteriorating rapidly or
 
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:33.880 align:start position:0%
anything it's the fact that we're
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
finding out that they don't have
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
adequate discharge capacity because of
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
the storm events that they're seeing
 
00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
they they are unstable based on the
 
00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
different computer modeling so um so the
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
numbers are coming higher and higher as
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
far as um that's what I know for the
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
high Hazard dams as far as being in poor
 
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
condition and going back to the ranking
 
00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:55.880 align:start position:0%
um we certainly try to Target those
 
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
structures as the first ones and the
 
00:44:59.790 --> 00:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
priority to uh to get
 
00:45:02.589 --> 00:45:02.599 align:start position:0%
repaired thank you if I can put it in
 
00:45:05.069 --> 00:45:05.079 align:start position:0%
another way a d Dam design 80 or 100
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
years ago was designed to different
 
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
safety safety standards than are are
 
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
today uh I will also I have sub the
 
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
representatives and Senators here um you
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
know we did ask last year and this is
 
00:45:20.829 --> 00:45:20.839 align:start position:0%
going through so there there'll be a
 
00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:23.839 align:start position:0%
legislative study committee to look at
 
00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:25.400 align:start position:0%
generally how Dam should be funded
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
moving forward again that number of
 
00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:31.839 align:start position:0%
dams um and yes we have a a fairly large
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
ask of I think 20.8 20.7 million for
 
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
this year is really not going to be an
 
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
aberration moving forward those are
 
00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:41.720 align:start position:0%
those are the type of monies that are
 
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
going to be needed moving forward so
 
00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
recognizing there's a lot of moving
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
parts to all this uh we've asked for a
 
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
study commiss committee uh to look at
 
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
how best to fund all this okay and and
 
00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
just to to build upon that one of some
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
of the numbers that were mentioned in
 
00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
those um hearings for those the study
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
committees was last year Dees looked at
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
what would it take to um bring the
 
00:46:09.309 --> 00:46:09.319 align:start position:0%
entire inventory into compliance roughly
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
out of the 273 dams we looked at uh the
 
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
number was roughly $414 million to bring
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
all of those 273 dams into compliance
 
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:20.440 align:start position:0%
and just the 64 high-hazard dams would
 
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
be uh $300 million so those are some of
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
the numbers that we were discussing in
 
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
those those hearings
 
00:46:31.069 --> 00:46:31.079 align:start position:0%
thank you any other um I know it's going
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
to seem like one damn thing after
 
00:46:33.359 --> 00:46:35.069 align:start position:0%
to seem like one damn thing after
another

00:46:35.069 --> 00:46:35.079 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
um I couldn't resist so uh question and
 
00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like the fishing game
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
question you you're you want to fix
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
houses where people stay overnight um
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
how many people do you have staying
 
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
overnight at your dams two so we have
 
00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
two oh just two so we have uh we have I
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned Murphy Dam up in Pittsburgh
 
00:46:58.349 --> 00:46:58.359 align:start position:0%
obviously it's kind of a hike from Ed uh
 
00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
and uh so that is a dam where and the
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
reason why we have and the other one
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
real quickly is like Port Dam uh in
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
lonia uh and the reason why we have for
 
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
both those facilities we have a a
 
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
structure there where an employee stays
 
00:47:16.349 --> 00:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
uh and the reason for that is if some
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
again it's very similar but for
 
00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:19.640 align:start position:0%
different slightly different reasons
 
00:47:21.309 --> 00:47:21.319 align:start position:0%
than Scott was mentioning if there's a
 
00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
major issue with the dam we want
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
somebody to be able to react right to it
 
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
then and not take a couple hours to get
 
00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
there and you know have bad things
 
00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
happen and you know so so again those
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
are two important dams uh same kind of
 
00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
thing though he lives there yes or she
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
lives there yeah correct um just out of
 
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
curiosity is that a job somebody hangs
 
00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
on to for a
 
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:47.800 align:start position:0%
while like yes yeah I guess so yeah I
 
00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:49.839 align:start position:0%
mean we had the one up in Pittsburgh
 
00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
years ago retired out of that job um so
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
yes yeah it's just it's interesting it's
 
00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
just um You Don't See a lot of that
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
anymore I ideally I would say especially
 
00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:02.440 align:start position:0%
for Lon I'm still not sure we'd ever
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
want to do this for Pittsburgh given the
 
00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
travel distance you know the more we get
 
00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
comfortable upgrade the dam automated
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
enough so we can you know that's a
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
potential maybe one of those could go
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
away but so you're saying I shouldn't
 
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
apply you could be uh made OBS obsess
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
that's true of most of my jobs um the uh
 
00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
the the uh Federal match uh the the
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
drinking water and the uh clean water
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
grants are those
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
scalable and that is to say if we if we
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
allocated more money could we have a
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
greater match we allocated less money or
 
00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
is this say it's 9 million or
 
00:48:45.069 --> 00:48:45.079 align:start position:0%
nothing um the match is dependent on
 
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
what the federal government gives us so
 
00:48:50.109 --> 00:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
um right now we're not anticipating
 
00:48:52.829 --> 00:48:52.839 align:start position:0%
receiving any more than we estimated we
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
may receive less but we won't know until
 
00:48:57.789 --> 00:48:57.799 align:start position:0%
we get closer to those fisal years what
 
00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
EPA will have for funding in order to
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
give us those grants so let me let me
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
reverse the question then too um let's
 
00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
say the capital budget were tight um and
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
we and we looked at it and said well gez
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
we can't do nine we could do three is
 
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
that the kind of thing where the federal
 
00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
government would say no it's nine or
 
00:49:20.789 --> 00:49:20.799 align:start position:0%
nothing we could probably scale it down
 
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
but I would need to confirm with that
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
but understand too that we put in
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy um
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
The Loan program plus we put in Jeopardy
 
00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
the Staffing that is funded by this loan
 
00:49:36.789 --> 00:49:36.799 align:start position:0%
program so it might be scalable it might
 
00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
be scalable more likely might be
 
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
scalable by year not by Dollar okay
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
thank you but again stating the obvious
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
you'd we're getting it's a 20% match so
 
00:49:50.829 --> 00:49:50.839 align:start position:0%
we'd be giving up 80% Federal money no I
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
I mean there a lot of stuff like that
 
00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
something's going to something's going
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
to not get funded that has a 70 or 80%
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
Federal match though
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
mine's a followup to commissioner Arley
 
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
house which was the if I'm reading this
 
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
correctly this is Page Six the
 
00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
supplemental is that 47 million so the
 
00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
additional 20% that we're we would be
 
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
responsible for that gets us that
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
additional 47 million is that how I
 
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
could read that yes that's correct I
 
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
mean this ask gets us 96.6 million in
 
00:50:23.069 --> 00:50:23.079 align:start position:0%
federal funds in total in total correct
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
for both programs okay and so that's
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
supplemental why we the New Hampshire
 
00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
could be awarded that we would be
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
responsible for a 20% match I think
 
00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
that's where Charlie was going could we
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
get something less than 47 we would
 
00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:35.240 align:start position:0%
still have to match whatever that number
 
00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839 align:start position:0%
is at 20% yes but is that something that
 
00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
we might supplemental is pretty much a
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
set number it's the base that okay will
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
will be subject to change the
 
00:50:48.789 --> 00:50:48.799 align:start position:0%
supplemental is funded through the bill
 
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
program so those numbers are pretty much
 
00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:55.160 align:start position:0%
set okay now we may have ability if some
 
00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
other state a year to down the road
 
00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
decides not to take their supplemental
 
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
Grant we may get a reallocation and then
 
00:51:07.069 --> 00:51:07.079 align:start position:0%
we have to have additional match but um
 
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
this is what we are assured of for
 
00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
supplemental um requiring that
 
00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
additional match I think that's aent is
 
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
if if the state could not fund that
 
00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
additional 20% do we have an opportunity
 
00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
to tell the Feds that or are we on the
 
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
hook for coming up with that
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
regardless is that what you so in other
 
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
words could we tell them we don't have
 
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
that extra 20% we can't it how would
 
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
that work if we decline the
 
00:51:34.829 --> 00:51:34.839 align:start position:0%
grant um if we have no match for
 
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
supplemental then they take the money
 
00:51:39.309 --> 00:51:39.319 align:start position:0%
and they reallocate it and then they
 
00:51:40.789 --> 00:51:40.799 align:start position:0%
they would reallocate okay I'm not
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
saying that that's a good idea or not a
 
00:51:43.309 --> 00:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
good idea I'm just looking at
 
00:51:45.549 --> 00:51:45.559 align:start position:0%
mechanically how it would work okay
 
00:51:45.559 --> 00:51:47.390 align:start position:0%
mechanically how it would work okay
thank

00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:51:50.589 --> 00:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
you uh so staying with the clean
 
00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
drinking water matching funds these are
 
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
for communities right um and Community
 
00:51:59.390 --> 00:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
Water Systems to be able to upgrade
 
00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
those systems is that right yes okay in
 
00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:03.990 align:start position:0%
those systems is that right yes okay in
past

00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:52:08.109 --> 00:52:08.119 align:start position:0%
years um how much of the allocation has
 
00:52:08.119 --> 00:52:10.150 align:start position:0%
years um how much of the allocation has
been

00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
unused very
 
00:52:17.069 --> 00:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
little almost almost zero almost zero um
 
00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:19.480 align:start position:0%
what we have only seen in the last two
 
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
years is um with the additional
 
00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
supplemental um bill money some some
 
00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
states have just not been able to handle
 
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
the capacity the additional money brings
 
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
and so have not been able to ask for
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
those Awards yeah I was thinking more
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
about the communities that use the
 
00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
program do you ever have any money left
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
over I mean are there communities that
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
that don't use the money it it's over
 
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
subscribed pardon me it's over
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
subscribed not under subscribed there
 
00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
you go okay thank you yeah gener
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
generally we um
 
00:52:59.950 --> 00:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
every year we have so much money to loan
 
00:53:02.109 --> 00:53:02.119 align:start position:0%
because this is a loan program I
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
understand um and generally the ask is
 
00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:07.640 align:start position:0%
not quite a
 
00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
9010 um but it's generally twice or
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
three times what we have available to Lo
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
and in many cases isn't it true that
 
00:53:18.309 --> 00:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
communities wouldn't be able to go ahead
 
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
with the infrastructure Improvement
 
00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
without this program absolutely yeah
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
they have the same issues I was talking
 
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
about for the W basaki River basin
 
00:53:29.950 --> 00:53:29.960 align:start position:0%
you know again you could wait to the
 
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:31.720 align:start position:0%
water pipe to have a geyser on Main
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
Street but it's happening whether you
 
00:53:35.309 --> 00:53:35.319 align:start position:0%
want to fund it or not is is the problem
 
00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
they have so right so my other question
 
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
is um about P pway Lake dams what kind
 
00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:43.839 align:start position:0%
of dams are
 
00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:53.240 align:start position:0%
Cory so Cory Clark chief engineer the
 
00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:56.200 align:start position:0%
dam Bureau so bway lake is formed by
 
00:53:58.109 --> 00:53:58.119 align:start position:0%
four structures those structures were
 
00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
originally built in the mid 1800s by the
 
00:54:02.349 --> 00:54:02.359 align:start position:0%
new market manufacturing company to buy
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
water down to New Market and they are um
 
00:54:09.069 --> 00:54:09.079 align:start position:0%
essentially each one there's just's two
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
dams and two dikes each one is uh a
 
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
double ston wall Granite Dam so they
 
00:54:16.829 --> 00:54:16.839 align:start position:0%
built two Granite walls and infilled
 
00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:19.400 align:start position:0%
that area with Earth and in some cases
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
buttress the downstream side um one of
 
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
the the biggest issues in the draw down
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
that commissioner Scott was mentioning
 
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
is doll Dam which is the biggest dam on
 
00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:30.839 align:start position:0%
the lake um has a wooden gate at the
 
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
bottom that hasn't been re rehabilitated
 
00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%
um I think in over 40 years and so that
 
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
is the reason we have to draw it all the
 
00:54:39.789 --> 00:54:39.799 align:start position:0%
way down in order to do the
 
00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation project on that low-level
 
00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
gate amongst many other upgrades at all
 
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:53.309 --> 00:54:53.319 align:start position:0%

home I'm going to go ahead and start um
 
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
at uh the third page of the uh slide
 
00:55:43.029 --> 00:55:43.039 align:start position:0%
deck just to talk about what the New
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire veteran home is um in
 
00:55:50.029 --> 00:55:50.039 align:start position:0%
1889 um the the development of the
 
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
veterans home started uh they developed
 
00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
a prominent uh Board of managers and
 
00:55:58.270 --> 00:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
they opened up 1890 so we've been there
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
for 134 years uh it was first open to
 
00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
Civil War soldiers unable to care for
 
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
themselves in the last 134 years we've
 
00:56:10.349 --> 00:56:10.359 align:start position:0%
had 11 commants um with many over 20
 
00:56:12.829 --> 00:56:12.839 align:start position:0%
years the oversight of the uh New
 
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Veterans Home is the board of
 
00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:17.240 align:start position:0%
managers which is made up of 12 members
 
00:56:19.349 --> 00:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
who are appointed throughout the state
 
00:56:21.309 --> 00:56:21.319 align:start position:0%
by the governor and confirmed by the
 
00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
executive Council the commanders from
 
00:56:25.470 --> 00:56:25.480 align:start position:0%
the American Legion the veteran service
 
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
I mean excuse me the Veterans of Foreign
 
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
Affair uh Foreign Wars and disabled
 
00:56:32.069 --> 00:56:32.079 align:start position:0%
American veterans and nine citizens make
 
00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
up the board two of those members are
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire veteran home residents and
 
00:56:39.309 --> 00:56:39.319 align:start position:0%
the board has oversight of the operation
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire veterans home we
 
00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
are long-term care facility we're
 
00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
licensed for 22 uh 250 beds we are
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
budgeted for 225 and we are budgeted for
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
nearly 400 full-time staff members our
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
greatest challenge as many long-term
 
00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
care in hospitals are seeing is actual
 
00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
hiring of nurses and having uh the
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
nursing support needed so today we have
 
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
123 residents um with weight list of
 
00:57:13.549 --> 00:57:13.559 align:start position:0%
about seven we have a couple of missions
 
00:57:15.069 --> 00:57:15.079 align:start position:0%
admissions already planned off that
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
weight list and we are processing 40
 
00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:21.640 align:start position:0%
applicants um as of today we utilize the
 
00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:25.240 align:start position:0%
Veterans Affair VA Grant Program under
 
00:57:27.109 --> 00:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh 38 CF R
 
00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
5141 which allows us to have either uh
 
00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
full payment of their care or partial
 
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
payment of their care uh there's two
 
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
different levels of uh payment the
 
00:57:39.549 --> 00:57:39.559 align:start position:0%
mission of the New Hampshire Veterans
 
00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:41.240 align:start position:0%
Home is to provide the best quality of
 
00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
life for New Hampshire veterans with
 
00:57:45.069 --> 00:57:45.079 align:start position:0%
dignity honor and respect and I think
 
00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:48.200 align:start position:0%
the staff do that each and every day um
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
our strategic infrastructure priorities
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
are always veterans health health and
 
00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:55.480 align:start position:0%
life safety to meet the ADA requirements
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
to meet infection and prevention
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
controls and to meet the VA laws and
 
00:58:02.829 --> 00:58:02.839 align:start position:0%
Survey requirements which are
 
00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
extensive our current projects that we
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
have right now are the Statewide
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
drainage and water life safety
 
00:58:12.029 --> 00:58:12.039 align:start position:0%
improvements which is underway our entry
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
Life Safety improvements which is also
 
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
pending our medical installation phase
 
00:58:19.789 --> 00:58:19.799 align:start position:0%
two has been completed and the Veterans
 
00:58:22.029 --> 00:58:22.039 align:start position:0%
Home Building addition uh otherwise
 
00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:24.440 align:start position:0%
known as lid you addition is in process
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
and I just want to pause to thank Ted
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
copper and Das because they have done an
 
00:58:31.589 --> 00:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
immense amount of work to get a VA
 
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
project uh timeline met and our parking
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
lot repair and ex uh expansion was just
 
00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
approved last week so we are moving
 
00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:41.480 align:start position:0%
forward with that so for the future
 
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
projects um of course we came up with a
 
00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:46.280 align:start position:0%
lot more than this uh the few that we're
 
00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
presenting to you today uh but we
 
00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
streamlined that knowing there's a limit
 
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
here the one that just uh entered the
 
00:58:56.109 --> 00:58:56.119 align:start position:0%
list on the top and as you can app
 
00:58:58.109 --> 00:58:58.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate right now with the weather is
 
00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:01.640 align:start position:0%
our rooftop and Air Handlers on our Leo
 
00:59:06.829 --> 00:59:06.839 align:start position:0%
building which is about 22 years old 22
 
00:59:09.309 --> 00:59:09.319 align:start position:0%
years old is actually the roof uh top
 
00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
Air Handlers are no longer functioning
 
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
um so today right now we are cooling
 
00:59:18.349 --> 00:59:18.359 align:start position:0%
those 100 uh bed areas with heat pumps
 
00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:21.160 align:start position:0%
from our hallway there is no air uh in
 
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
their bedrooms and I think we're going
 
00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:25.240 align:start position:0%
to have a challenge the next couple days
 
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
to keep doing that we have a temporary
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
fix that we've worked with Department of
 
00:59:32.109 --> 00:59:32.119 align:start position:0%
Public Works to to get some blowers in
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
there um but we are putting this on the
 
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
request for a long-term fix so we have a
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
temporary fix of replacing Motors but we
 
00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:41.960 align:start position:0%
need to fix the whole unit all three
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
units we have a diesel tank removal
 
00:59:48.549 --> 00:59:48.559 align:start position:0%
request uh replacing um some tubs and
 
00:59:51.390 --> 00:59:51.400 align:start position:0%
bar and adding a bariatric tub shower uh
 
00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
elevator repairs bet veteran bed and
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
mattress repairs or replacement excuse
 
00:59:59.829 --> 00:59:59.839 align:start position:0%
me and updating tar North areas and the
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
medical lift so I'll go right into it I
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
think pictures uh can describe it much
 
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
more than I can but these are the air
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
handlers and as you can see these three
 
01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
uh resident neighborhoods that serve
 
01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:15.400 align:start position:0%
over 100 Veterans are over 30 years old
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
um well are they 30 or they 22 they were
 
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
up there 22 years old yeah sorry there's
 
01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
a typo here um and due to their age and
 
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
they're they're just Obsolete and we
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
can't repair them we have made attempts
 
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
to repair them we hired a welder they
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
came and made some repairs that bought
 
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
us a little bit of time about a month
 
01:00:36.589 --> 01:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
and then due to the loss of Integrity of
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
the metal Parts as soon as the unit
 
01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
started shaking they would crack and
 
01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
break so you can see here due to
 
01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
vibrations these are
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
broken um and they need to be
 
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
replaced the second uh Capital request
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
we are asking for is an underground
 
01:00:56.910 --> 01:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
diesel tank removal so the underground
 
01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
tank that we have is 12,000 gallons and
 
01:01:02.829 --> 01:01:02.839 align:start position:0%
that used to uh feed all of our boilers
 
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
within the buildings and uh we did
 
01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
transfer over to natural gas with the
 
01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
exception of our emergency generator um
 
01:01:14.589 --> 01:01:14.599 align:start position:0%
needing that uh Diesel and so right now
 
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
the diesel tank is quite a distance as
 
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
you can see on the map here to the
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
generator so it travels quite a distance
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
and we with us um we need to test it and
 
01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
do a backup generator that that is 100
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
KW generator to provide the required 96
 
01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
continuous hours of a power load um and
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
we had that would just take under 500
 
01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
gallons of fuel but so this is just an
 
01:01:45.309 --> 01:01:45.319 align:start position:0%
Overkill tank now it's just so much fuel
 
01:01:47.309 --> 01:01:47.319 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately what happens is diesel
 
01:01:50.109 --> 01:01:50.119 align:start position:0%
not used after a while ages out and then
 
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
you have to pump it out and it becomes
 
01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:53.319 align:start position:0%
even more costly because now we have to
 
01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
dispose of this aged Fuel and we are on
 
01:01:58.029 --> 01:01:58.039 align:start position:0%
on that line we're getting pretty close
 
01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
to that being uh too old so we would
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
like to try to get a smaller tank that
 
01:02:05.230 --> 01:02:05.240 align:start position:0%
was closer to the emergency generator to
 
01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
use that instead um and that tank would
 
01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
not be buried in the ground so we would
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
get out of the ground um the third
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
requests we have here are seven tubs and
 
01:02:20.549 --> 01:02:20.559 align:start position:0%
one bariatric stretcher shower trolley
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
um what has happened is our tubs and
 
01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
those are crucial obviously to provide
 
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
care for our residents they're just
 
01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
aging out and um we're not able to get
 
01:02:32.589 --> 01:02:32.599 align:start position:0%
the parts any longer so in areas that
 
01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
we're not using due to a lack of Staff
 
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
we have closed some of our units we are
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
now taking parts from them to fix the
 
01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
tubs in the areas of residents are using
 
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
our goal is not to keep those units
 
01:02:49.269 --> 01:02:49.279 align:start position:0%
closed we want to provide care to all of
 
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
the veterans in the state of New
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that want to come to us and so
 
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
we're working on our staffing increasing
 
01:02:56.789 --> 01:02:56.799 align:start position:0%
but we also will be stuck now because
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
we've taken Parts out of tubs and we
 
01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
we'll have difficulty getting in back
 
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
into those units so um we are asking to
 
01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
replace the seven tubs and add a
 
01:03:10.029 --> 01:03:10.039 align:start position:0%
bariatric stresser uh trolley to that
 
01:03:13.269 --> 01:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
you can see the picture on page 14 that
 
01:03:16.349 --> 01:03:16.359 align:start position:0%
allows people who are unable to um get
 
01:03:19.549 --> 01:03:19.559 align:start position:0%
up into a chair and into a tub to still
 
01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
be bathe and have um uh tub baths if
 
01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:25.039 align:start position:0%
they would like and uh so the goal would
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
be to try to assist them and also lower
 
01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
the risk of Staff
 
01:03:33.269 --> 01:03:33.279 align:start position:0%
injuries number four is replacing one of
 
01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
our elevator and updating the other two
 
01:03:39.269 --> 01:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
elevators um obviously the elevators are
 
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
the way that that our veterans get in
 
01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
and out of the facility it's how we get
 
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of our Goods up into the facility
 
01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:47.720 align:start position:0%
and so with having elevators not in
 
01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:49.960 align:start position:0%
working order um and we have a couple
 
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
staff member who have members who have
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
been stuck in an elevator so they would
 
01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
love to testify that they never want
 
01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
that to happen again uh having to be
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
pulled out from the fire department was
 
01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:02.680 align:start position:0%
not enjoyable uh one of our elevators is
 
01:04:05.309 --> 01:04:05.319 align:start position:0%
actually not operating at all so we've
 
01:04:07.630 --> 01:04:07.640 align:start position:0%
had to close it and then the other ones
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
we'd say they're they're down about 10%
 
01:04:12.029 --> 01:04:12.039 align:start position:0%
of the time where we have to get the
 
01:04:14.549 --> 01:04:14.559 align:start position:0%
company to come in and replace it the
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
company is now um using oldest El
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
Elevator Parts that they got from U
 
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
replacement elevators they know our
 
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
elevators are so old that they're
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
keeping those to try to replace ours and
 
01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
carry them along a useful life of
 
01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
elevator is estimated between 20 and 25
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
years and some of our elevators are 48
 
01:04:38.829 --> 01:04:38.839 align:start position:0%
years old so they have well ped their
 
01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
age um benefits obviously we would use
 
01:04:44.349 --> 01:04:44.359 align:start position:0%
less energy they would reduce the
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
shutdowns in the service calls we spend
 
01:04:48.029 --> 01:04:48.039 align:start position:0%
quite a bit on service calls they
 
01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
improved the safety and uh the new
 
01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:53.480 align:start position:0%
elevators allow you to have um something
 
01:04:56.589 --> 01:04:56.599 align:start position:0%
called Max link connected so we can uh
 
01:04:59.950 --> 01:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
get emergency uh calls out much quicker
 
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
we video we can text um and so we're
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
asking to replace in update to uh
 
01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
replace the resident beds so the
 
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
replacement of the beds is come really
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
about because a lot of all of our beds
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
have a middle and try I'm like a hands
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
first sorry um a uh locking breake in
 
01:05:23.109 --> 01:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
the middle of the bed and the nurse for
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
the LNA has to use their knee to lock it
 
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
in place unlike if you go to a hospital
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
it's usually foot you just step down and
 
01:05:33.069 --> 01:05:33.079 align:start position:0%
it locks the bed um this has resulted in
 
01:05:35.589 --> 01:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
nursing injuries in uh compensation
 
01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
worker compensation claims over
 
01:05:41.789 --> 01:05:41.799 align:start position:0%
$250,000 and several hours of time loss
 
01:05:43.789 --> 01:05:43.799 align:start position:0%
so then that doesn't in incorporate our
 
01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:45.880 align:start position:0%
overtime when we have to backfill those
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
positions because people are out so we
 
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
want to replace the beds with a foot
 
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
breaks so we can promote safety and
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
reduce those injuries and then on top of
 
01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
that we always need to uh update
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
mattresses mattresses only have a 5year
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
span lifespan so we need to update them
 
01:06:03.870 --> 01:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
and our goal is to update them every two
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
years 50 at a time so we're working
 
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
through the budget that
 
01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
way uh number six is our biggest ask um
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
and I believe it was here last year as
 
01:06:17.109 --> 01:06:17.119 align:start position:0%
well our last budget uh this goes along
 
01:06:20.589 --> 01:06:20.599 align:start position:0%
with the ADA requirements and
 
01:06:24.829 --> 01:06:24.839 align:start position:0%
IPC uh infection prevention control our
 
01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:27.640 align:start position:0%
doors are not wide enough so there are
 
01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
some wheelchairs that are uh larger due
 
01:06:33.549 --> 01:06:33.559 align:start position:0%
to bariatric residence that can't fit in
 
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
our rooms so we have
 
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
to decide where they're going to live in
 
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
our building based on the rooms and what
 
01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
they have for adaptive equipment so
 
01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
right now uh each room is required to be
 
01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
48 in on the door to the bedroom and uh
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
our current ba uh bedroom doors are 42
 
01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
in and the bathroom doors are even
 
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
smaller they're 36 in so they're really
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
really small um so we need to update our
 
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
doorways uh we also need to move away
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
from having four people two in one room
 
01:07:10.589 --> 01:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
two in another with an on a joining
 
01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
bathroom four veterans are using one
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
bathroom and that is not a pleasant
 
01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
experience they they do not like doing
 
01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:20.799 align:start position:0%
that and I don't blame them um and then
 
01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:23.839 align:start position:0%
if you look at the next uh slide on 19
 
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
you'll see our floors are buckling
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
uh this is a shower which is a real
 
01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:31.640 align:start position:0%
issue for tripping hazards and so the
 
01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
showers need to be replaced the doors
 
01:07:34.589 --> 01:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
01:07:38.109 --> 01:07:38.119 align:start position:0%
replaced uh in the on page
 
01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
20 the showers have to be for the VA
 
01:07:44.349 --> 01:07:44.359 align:start position:0%
requirements which who is who licensed
 
01:07:47.269 --> 01:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
us so we can get the VA payments they
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
have to be 48 in wide and they also have
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
to have a seat inside them and you can
 
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
see from this picture this is built
 
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
years and years ago this is on our older
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
side the chair the seat is outside the
 
01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
shower and I'm guessing that the goal
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
was for them to get dressed there but it
 
01:08:03.789 --> 01:08:03.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't help somebody who needs to have
 
01:08:06.910 --> 01:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
the shower chair inside the shower and
 
01:08:09.309 --> 01:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
then we also have lots of built-in
 
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
furniture that was there and as you can
 
01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:14.839 align:start position:0%
see from these pictures they are broken
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
um they we've taken off closet doors
 
01:08:19.309 --> 01:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
because they have fallen down and we
 
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to the residents to be harmed
 
01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
um on tar South it is so bad over there
 
01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
that we've actually moved our residents
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
off that unit and moved them to um one
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
of the older Memory Care units because
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
we had to close that down due to staff
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
and that's where they're living because
 
01:08:38.829 --> 01:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
we can't we just don't feel that is safe
 
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
for them to be there any
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
longer and the last one uh we are asking
 
01:08:46.110 --> 01:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
for is the continuation this would be
 
01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
phase three of installing medical lifts
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
so that we can move patients or
 
01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
residents from their chair to their bed
 
01:08:56.749 --> 01:08:56.759 align:start position:0%
or throughout the room room uh the goal
 
01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
is to get 20 more to do that uh this is
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
if anybody's seen the old Hoyer lifts
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
that you would wheel into a room you
 
01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
would try to get the resident in there
 
01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
and then you wheel them it feels very
 
01:09:11.709 --> 01:09:11.719 align:start position:0%
unsafe for them but it also um we see a
 
01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
lot of back injuries with our staff
 
01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
because of that this system is over the
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
bed and uh has a sling system similar to
 
01:09:21.709 --> 01:09:21.719 align:start position:0%
that but you lower it you can lift the
 
01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
resident and you can move them safely uh
 
01:09:26.789 --> 01:09:26.799 align:start position:0%
more securely and really they feel
 
01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
better about
 
01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
that uh we will be lapsing we're going
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
to extend to have some uh lapse
 
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
extensions uh requests here one like we
 
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
talked about was the drainage is
 
01:09:42.269 --> 01:09:42.279 align:start position:0%
underway the life safety is under way we
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
would do we would uh continue to do the
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
building project with the VA and the
 
01:09:48.990 --> 01:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
parking lot so we would be asking for
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
those extensions as
 
01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
well thank you thank you uh
 
01:09:58.270 --> 01:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
the generator I know you you want to
 
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
replace the the fuel tank for the
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
generator it's a diesel fuel tank what's
 
01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
the condition of the
 
01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
generator theor can you turn your
 
01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
microphone please thank you the
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
generator is actually in really good
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
condition so I actually applied for a
 
01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
grant to replace it with a natural gas
 
01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
generator and when they came and looked
 
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
at it they said that that thing's
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
basically brand new we're not going to
 
01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
give you any money for that so we're
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
we're and until we can get to the point
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
where we can add it to natural gas we're
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
just looking to replace the tank okay
 
01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
thought it had a bright idea there but I
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
guess it's very very
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
you any other questions I'm curious how
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
many of your patients are are bariatric
 
01:10:43.390 --> 01:10:43.400 align:start position:0%
patients oh boy I would say probably
 
01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
five residents right now are bariatric
 
01:10:48.149 --> 01:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
in the sense
 
01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of residents that are
 
01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:53.560 align:start position:0%
uh obese So when you say bariatric I'm
 
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
thinking like three four or five um
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
probably like four or five of them okay
 
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious and our new our new um
 
01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:03.640 align:start position:0%
building that we're building will
 
01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
actually have 10 bariatric rooms that's
 
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
part of our uh the new addition that uh
 
01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
we're not extending bed size we're just
 
01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
taking some of those shared rooms and
 
01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
moving into the private uh Wing that we
 
01:11:17.950 --> 01:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
hope will be built in
 
01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
2026 right I look at Ted because his
 
01:11:24.189 --> 01:11:24.199 align:start position:0%
team is helping Shepherd it through and
 
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
I'm then I'm sure it will
 
01:11:29.229 --> 01:11:29.239 align:start position:0%
yes um my question is just on more of
 
01:11:31.229 --> 01:11:31.239 align:start position:0%
the federal funding so you receive
 
01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
federal funding you talked about for you
 
01:11:34.830 --> 01:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
know the care of the residents is there
 
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
any other programs either through the VA
 
01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
or through other Federal avenues that
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
can help with more of the equipment side
 
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
of the house or some of the the
 
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
construction side no they can do
 
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
construction um like we are doing this
 
01:11:50.189 --> 01:11:50.199 align:start position:0%
project that has been underway since I
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
think it began uh with this process in
 
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
2016 and so there is a process but it's
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
very long and um you so we could ask for
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
um like a warehouse and I think in the
 
01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
past they have asked for a warehouse
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
then the VA will come and say no you
 
01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
don't qualify because your Warehouse is
 
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
actually big enough for your square
 
01:12:13.229 --> 01:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
footage from their regulations if it's
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
something that they would qualify for
 
01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
the state matches uh 35% and they do 65
 
01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
but it's I would say years to get
 
01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
something into actual and those
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
definitely sound like more um I'll say
 
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
construction type they're more
 
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
construction to I'm thinking the beds
 
01:12:31.629 --> 01:12:31.639 align:start position:0%
the lifts the more of that equipment
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
side that they is there anything
 
01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
available for that no
 
01:12:39.149 --> 01:12:39.159 align:start position:0%
okay it's a good thought
 
01:12:41.669 --> 01:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
though you talked about the generator
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
can you convert the
 
01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
generator to natural gas so yes we can
 
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
so we looked into that um and we can
 
01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
we're certainly looking to adding the
 
01:12:54.910 --> 01:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
gas line to where it needs to go um but
 
01:12:57.629 --> 01:12:57.639 align:start position:0%
we're not at that point yet so I I kind
 
01:12:59.870 --> 01:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
of kicked the tires on it and and I was
 
01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
kind of shot down initially so I lost a
 
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
little hope in it so the the easy answer
 
01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
would be to just get rid of the big tank
 
01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
and put a smaller tank in its place for
 
01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
now until we can get to natural gas so
 
01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
the generator we have we we would
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
actually need to replace the generator
 
01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
that then when they came to look at it
 
01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
there's no conversion kit for the
 
01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
place see another other questions thank
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
testimony I'd like to invite up now
 
01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
morning uh good morning uh Mr chair
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
committee members for the record I'm
 
01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
David meltis uh Commissioner of
 
01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
Department of military Affairs and
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
veteran services is AG General New
 
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire National Guard I'm joined
 
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
today by Major Matt Henry uh our deputy
 
01:14:04.629 --> 01:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
director of construction and Facilities
 
01:14:07.149 --> 01:14:07.159 align:start position:0%
maintenance so let's talk like three big
 
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
things or broad categories before we
 
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
start looking at our specific requests
 
01:14:13.629 --> 01:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
uh number one is um the size of our
 
01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and how much square
 
01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
footage that the National Garden the
 
01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
department of military Affairs manages
 
01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
conceptually speaking we have over 50
 
01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
buildings exceeding a million square ft
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
of office space in 177 communities
 
01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
throughout the state so we have a
 
01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
significant portfolio across the state
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
of infrastructure your number two is um
 
01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
when you look at the data from the other
 
01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:36.280 align:start position:0%
departments we're the number three in
 
01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
the state for bringing federal funds
 
01:14:39.629 --> 01:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
bringing those federal funds is
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
predicated on the fact that we have to
 
01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
have a state match generally speaking
 
01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
the state match is three broad
 
01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
categories 100% federal funds which is
 
01:14:50.110 --> 01:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
typically for our maintenance facilities
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
like vehicle maintenance helicopter
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
maintenance 7525 federal state cost
 
01:14:58.590 --> 01:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
share is generally for new military
 
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
construction and then 50 50 50% Federal
 
01:15:05.149 --> 01:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
50% state is for the general upkeep and
 
01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
maintenance of our 18 armories that
 
01:15:12.030 --> 01:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
exceed 350,000 sare ft so those are big
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
prod categories and the last thing I'd
 
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
like to talk about too is um leveraging
 
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
those federal funds so generally
 
01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
speaking when we get military
 
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
construction dollars um we compete
 
01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:24.280 align:start position:0%
nationally against the other 53 States
 
01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
territories in District of Colombia
 
01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
through a a pretty competitive process
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
that either says one or two things our
 
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
facili our facilities are either Legacy
 
01:15:36.669 --> 01:15:36.679 align:start position:0%
structures that are under sized or
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
they're poor condition and our ability
 
01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
to use that process through Congress to
 
01:15:44.910 --> 01:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
get these larger or midsize projects is
 
01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:47.320 align:start position:0%
a big deal getting that state match
 
01:15:49.149 --> 01:15:49.159 align:start position:0%
matters because we've competed Nally for
 
01:15:51.669 --> 01:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
these projects so we submitted nine
 
01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
projects I'm going to talk about the
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
first six and we have an additional one
 
01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
I'd like to bring to your attention um
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
the first project is the Milford
 
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
Readiness Center addition
 
01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
alteration congressionally approve
 
01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
National Guard Bureau funded addition to
 
01:16:08.229 --> 01:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
our Milford Armory um which houses our
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
Mountain infantry unit you we did
 
01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:11.960 align:start position:0%
addition about five years ago it's still
 
01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
under size we still need to build a
 
01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
bigger addition because the unit has
 
01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
significantly more
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
equipment number two is Manchester land
 
01:16:21.870 --> 01:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
replacement it remains a state priority
 
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
for us to get out of the Manchester
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
Armory if that is to Ur we need State
 
01:16:29.470 --> 01:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
money to buy land to start the process
 
01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
for that divesture we asked in the last
 
01:16:34.629 --> 01:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
bium it wasn't approved we we asked for
 
01:16:34.639 --> 01:16:35.709 align:start position:0%
bium it wasn't approved we we asked for
it

01:16:35.709 --> 01:16:35.719 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
again number three is What's called the
 
01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:40.280 align:start position:0%
Plymouth read Center addition alteration
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
um this was a congressionally directed
 
01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
spending a project that was approved by
 
01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
Congress that is part of the Manchester
 
01:16:48.990 --> 01:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
divesture which allows us to move
 
01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
another unit out of Manchester into
 
01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
pemr project number four Statewide ready
 
01:16:56.310 --> 01:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
a center roof
 
01:16:58.590 --> 01:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
Replacements asset manage Asset
 
01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
Management right we have a huge
 
01:17:03.229 --> 01:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
portfolio of armories um we just got to
 
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
do roof Replacements it's no more no
 
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
less it's not it's not attractive but
 
01:17:10.110 --> 01:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
it's just uh keeping your house in order
 
01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
number five Training land Road Trail
 
01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:14.440 align:start position:0%
maintenance um our soldiers got a train
 
01:17:15.709 --> 01:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
whether it's walking through the woods
 
01:17:17.229 --> 01:17:17.239 align:start position:0%
walking on a trail or driving a truck
 
01:17:18.990 --> 01:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
through the woods we need sort of a
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
trail Improvement system to allow our
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
soldiers to either like uh walk through
 
01:17:26.669 --> 01:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
the woods um and do different
 
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
activities I number six Aviation hanger
 
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
Edition um we've been our number one
 
01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
party for the Army guard for the about
 
01:17:35.310 --> 01:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
past four to five years is to get new
 
01:17:38.229 --> 01:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
helicopters we did it uh we get two new
 
01:17:40.629 --> 01:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
helicopters they're called a uh utility
 
01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
helicopter 72 Alpha a Lota the first one
 
01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
sitting on the tarmac over there guess
 
01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
what we don't have hanger space to put
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
it in um so we want to build an addition
 
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
we leverage our Congressional Delegation
 
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
100% further reimburse the storage of
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
those two
 
01:17:58.350 --> 01:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
helicopters and the seventh priority
 
01:17:59.830 --> 01:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
which is not on your list which we gave
 
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
you additional piece of paper for was um
 
01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
it's called the Plymouth Readiness
 
01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
Center addition um let me rephrase that
 
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
the Plymouth Readiness Center additional
 
01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:12.280 align:start position:0%
design and construction funds in the
 
01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
last bium we requested $29
 
01:18:18.629 --> 01:18:18.639 align:start position:0%
million we are approved for 25 million
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
um we want to insert the additional $4
 
01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
million to bring it up to the full
 
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
Congressional appropriation
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
why construction cost have increase we
 
01:18:29.709 --> 01:18:29.719 align:start position:0%
need the money to build a full
 
01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
requirement we have only Built one new
 
01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
Armory in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:36.199 align:start position:0%
that's a standalone facility in the last
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
20 years um this is a huge deal to give
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
us a full authorization for that
 
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
facility and uh we seek your approval
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
for that 7525 cost year subject to your
 
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
questions that's all I
 
01:18:51.149 --> 01:18:51.159 align:start position:0%
have thank you uh I was wonder if you
 
01:18:51.159 --> 01:18:52.470 align:start position:0%
have thank you uh I was wonder if you
could

01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
explain a brief overview on on actually
 
01:18:56.669 --> 01:18:56.679 align:start position:0%
how the federal funding works because I
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
I noticed like in the Milford Readiness
 
01:19:01.229 --> 01:19:01.239 align:start position:0%
Center Edition it's a million dollars of
 
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
general fund supplemented by 3 million
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
of federal funds so it's a three to1
 
01:19:06.669 --> 01:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
match whereas this the Statewide
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
Readiness roof Replacements looks to be
 
01:19:11.149 --> 01:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
a Ono one match what what's the
 
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
difference and how does a project get
 
01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
more Federal funding as opposed to
 
01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
less generally speaking all of our
 
01:19:21.629 --> 01:19:21.639 align:start position:0%
armories on state are on state land we
 
01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
only have one that's not so generally
 
01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
speaking if it's on state land it
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
dictates the cost
 
01:19:30.910 --> 01:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
share to sustain a building to roof
 
01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
placement boiler replacement it's a 5050
 
01:19:37.709 --> 01:19:37.719 align:start position:0%
cost share when you build new that cost
 
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
share changes to
 
01:19:43.470 --> 01:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
7525 and again maintenance facilities
 
01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
like our hangers our vehicle maintenance
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
shops they're all 100% fly reimbursed
 
01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
sir any other
 
01:19:57.070 --> 01:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
questions I just had one this on um
 
01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
priority three which was the pem
 
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
Readiness Center yes um and you it looks
 
01:20:04.510 --> 01:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
like on this one you had requested a
 
01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
waiver of the state match and I was just
 
01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
wondering how that process works and
 
01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
what's the likelihood that that waver
 
01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
would be approved or maybe it already is
 
01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.590 align:start position:0%
would be approved or maybe it already is
approved

01:20:14.590 --> 01:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
approved
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
it it was included in the Senate armed
 
01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
service committee markups we will tell
 
01:20:22.669 --> 01:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
you in 6 months if we were successful
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
right so it this congressionally
 
01:20:26.590 --> 01:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
directed spending projects are
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
relatively new Congress started doing
 
01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
them 3 years ago we've got I think three
 
01:20:35.070 --> 01:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
projects in FY 23 four projects in 24
 
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
this is one of the projects we're
 
01:20:38.229 --> 01:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
competing in federal fiscal year
 
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
25 we finally realized there's a process
 
01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
to ask for a uh State match waiver so
 
01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
this is our first time trying it and we
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
hope to be successful and we can tell
 
01:20:49.390 --> 01:20:49.400 align:start position:0%
you proba the answer in about six months
 
01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
unless there's a continued resolution
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay and if this um is not if the waiver
 
01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
isn't approved it um is this what is
 
01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:00.199 align:start position:0%
this fall into du oh no we'll be coming
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
back to bra or 5050 or what would it'll
 
01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:10.110 --> 01:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
you so any know other questions thank
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony thank
 
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
you and to conclude the capital budget
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
hearings I'd like to invite up the
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:41.709 align:start position:0%
 
good

01:21:41.709 --> 01:21:41.719 align:start position:0%

01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
morning good morning thank you for
 
01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
having us let's wait till the things get
 
01:21:59.070 --> 01:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:20.709 align:start position:0%
 
please

01:22:20.709 --> 01:22:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
begin a
 
01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
set good uh thank you good morning
 
01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
everyone uh my name is Bill Cass
 
01:22:29.550 --> 01:22:29.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the dot with me today I
 
01:22:32.830 --> 01:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
have uh assistant commissioner um Andre
 
01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:35.560 align:start position:0%
Grier who will assist with some of the
 
01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
um presentation on elements in his
 
01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
Division and Director of Finance um
 
01:22:42.910 --> 01:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
Danielle Shandra who will help explain
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
some of the other um financial
 
01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
implications um as well so um a quick
 
01:22:53.229 --> 01:22:53.239 align:start position:0%
overview on the first first slide um we
 
01:22:54.910 --> 01:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
typically break our capital budget
 
01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
present uh request into um into two
 
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
categories to align with departmental
 
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
funds generally in the highway fund
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
which deals with facilities and the
 
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
operational needs and general fund which
 
01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
deals with um Aeronautics Rail and
 
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
Transit needs uh so we well we have
 
01:23:16.149 --> 01:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
provided you know a com a single list of
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
of priorities uh we do tend to uh look
 
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
at uh priorities by by uh by by fund
 
01:23:28.430 --> 01:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
and then this year's uh request uh the
 
01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
highway fund uh request represents 10
 
01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:33.719 align:start position:0%
projects totaling about $25 million and
 
01:23:36.030 --> 01:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
a general fund request for seven
 
01:23:39.149 --> 01:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
projects totaling about $13 million and
 
01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
the types of requests um are are are a
 
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
little bit varied but um generally they
 
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
fall into uh categories of of recurring
 
01:23:51.669 --> 01:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh established program matches um we'll
 
01:23:54.510 --> 01:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
cover that a lot of that is uh um
 
01:23:56.830 --> 01:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
historically matching um providing some
 
01:23:59.390 --> 01:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
State funds to match the the federal
 
01:24:02.110 --> 01:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
funds for Aeronautics uh Rail and
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
Transit um facility Investments as
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
stewards of the state assets a lot of
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
these are you know programmatic or
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
systematic as we continue to um maintain
 
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
our infrastructure to do our business um
 
01:24:18.510 --> 01:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
but some are in this request are new new
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
requests for long deferred maintenance
 
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
um uh elements that uh just continue to
 
01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
deteriorate without any way of
 
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
addressing them and then um one of the
 
01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
other categories of requests is a couple
 
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
requests we have in here for replacement
 
01:24:37.629 --> 01:24:37.639 align:start position:0%
of Legacy systems um that really don't
 
01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
fit within our operational
 
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
needs uh and our growing liability as
 
01:24:46.709 --> 01:24:46.719 align:start position:0%
those Legacy systems um age out so we'll
 
01:24:48.270 --> 01:24:48.280 align:start position:0%
get into a little bit of the details of
 
01:24:52.350 --> 01:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
that slide two uh or three I guess uh I
 
01:24:53.550 --> 01:24:53.560 align:start position:0%
just wanted to give you an overview of
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:24:57.109 --> 01:24:57.119 align:start position:0%
um scope of
 
01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
operations uh in in context with this
 
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
capital budget request so we manage well
 
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
over 400 structures across the state um
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
you know valued at an original cost of
 
01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
over $90 million and just to give some
 
01:25:16.189 --> 01:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
com some context uh you know we maintain
 
01:25:18.430 --> 01:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
86 Patrol
 
01:25:21.550 --> 01:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
facilities um typically with additions
 
01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh across the state each facility
 
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
usually consists of of a patrol shed at
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
least one salt shed one sand shed and
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
other uh storage sheds at each facility
 
01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
um in addition to the overall uh Highway
 
01:25:37.709 --> 01:25:37.719 align:start position:0%
Maintenance Patrol sheds we maintain six
 
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
district offices six satellite garages
 
01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
14 uh Bridge crew uh Bridge crew
 
01:25:48.030 --> 01:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
quarters and most of our um this this
 
01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
logistical distribution is set up to
 
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
meet our logistical needs primarily for
 
01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance so um having material
 
01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
storage and a reasonable number of
 
01:25:59.149 --> 01:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
highway miles that are that are
 
01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
maintained um in those regional and
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
local uh Patrol
 
01:26:07.109 --> 01:26:07.119 align:start position:0%
sheds um additionally and we have some
 
01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
requests here uh New Hampshire dot
 
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
maintains the state uh fuel distribution
 
01:26:16.990 --> 01:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
um system so we have over 126 fuel tanks
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh and 450 miles of railroad tracks that
 
01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
that we maintain and we support 11 local
 
01:26:25.149 --> 01:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
public transit agencies
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh we run the Boston Express uh system
 
01:26:30.669 --> 01:26:30.679 align:start position:0%
in the i93 corridor and we also support
 
01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
12 federally funded airports so our
 
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
capital budget requests you know kind
 
01:26:40.149 --> 01:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
of refer to this overall
 
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
scope um with that briefly i' I'd ask uh
 
01:26:46.030 --> 01:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
Danielle to just discuss a little bit
 
01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
about the two um uh sources of funds and
 
01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
how we prioritize within those funds so
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
Danielle sure so so so on this slide we
 
01:26:59.109 --> 01:26:59.119 align:start position:0%
have um the general funded priorities
 
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
and the highway funded priorities and we
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
split them up because the funding is
 
01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
separate the highway fund priorities are
 
01:27:08.950 --> 01:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
tied we we are tied to the State
 
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
Constitution Article 6A on the use of uh
 
01:27:15.790 --> 01:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
revenues and for highways only for
 
01:27:18.629 --> 01:27:18.639 align:start position:0%
public highways so the items that are on
 
01:27:20.669 --> 01:27:20.679 align:start position:0%
the right hand side would fall under
 
01:27:23.310 --> 01:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
that the items on the leftand side would
 
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
not so the Aeronautics uh Rail and
 
01:27:28.990 --> 01:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
Transit um projects would not fun fall
 
01:27:30.629 --> 01:27:30.639 align:start position:0%
under that and would need to be General
 
01:27:34.030 --> 01:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
funded and so we have prioritized them
 
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
separately here although we are going to
 
01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
have very good so the next the next two
 
01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
slides uh uh you know summarize the
 
01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
combined list and the priorities uh
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
established by the department for the
 
01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
combined um for the compined list so
 
01:27:57.709 --> 01:27:57.719 align:start position:0%
moving on to slide seven and I'll try to
 
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
go through these in in in respect of the
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
committee's time pretty pretty quickly
 
01:28:03.709 --> 01:28:03.719 align:start position:0%
but if there are any questions on
 
01:28:06.270 --> 01:28:06.280 align:start position:0%
specific priorities as we go through it
 
01:28:09.070 --> 01:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
um please please stop and ask so our
 
01:28:11.109 --> 01:28:11.119 align:start position:0%
number one priority our first priority
 
01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
is uh continued replacement of sand and
 
01:28:16.350 --> 01:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
uh salt storage facilities this is a
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
programmatic or a systematic um uh
 
01:28:23.629 --> 01:28:23.639 align:start position:0%
project uh we label it uh as a Statewide
 
01:28:26.470 --> 01:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
project and instead of towards specific
 
01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
um salt sheds um we've listed there for
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
your information some of the priorities
 
01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:34.719 align:start position:0%
that we put this funding to but
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
typically every capital budget we ask
 
01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
for a um for um uh the Statewide funding
 
01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
to continue a uh systematic uh
 
01:28:47.470 --> 01:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
replacement of our of our sand and salt
 
01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
sheds and this this funding of about $3
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
million would um uh typically allows to
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
replace up to uh two uh sand salt shed
 
01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh facilities recent bids on some recent
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
projects that we're doing this year um
 
01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
in Bristol and Orford have been um about
 
01:29:12.189 --> 01:29:12.199 align:start position:0%
$1.5 million each for um the full full
 
01:29:13.870 --> 01:29:13.880 align:start position:0%
replacement we are typically using a
 
01:29:16.270 --> 01:29:16.280 align:start position:0%
high arch gam roll design if you look at
 
01:29:18.030 --> 01:29:18.040 align:start position:0%
any of our newer
 
01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
facilities um and a big part of this is
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
um you know many of our sand and salt
 
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
sheds were built in the 70s and 880s
 
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
they're showing uh where and um having
 
01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
the ability to store an ample amount of
 
01:29:36.510 --> 01:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
material you know helps us be efficient
 
01:29:38.510 --> 01:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of cost savings to buy in
 
01:29:43.510 --> 01:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
bulk as well as to um reduce um
 
01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
transport between sheds as well as to
 
01:29:49.950 --> 01:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
hedge against um um you know supply
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
chain issues which we have experienced
 
01:29:55.470 --> 01:29:55.480 align:start position:0%
in past years
 
01:29:59.070 --> 01:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
um priority number two is uh fairly
 
01:30:02.109 --> 01:30:02.119 align:start position:0%
similar it's a systemic or programmatic
 
01:30:06.229 --> 01:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
uh kind of a investment to uh
 
01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
continue uh addressing as many needs as
 
01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
we can with um replacement and upgrading
 
01:30:15.430 --> 01:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
of our underground fuel storage tanks uh
 
01:30:18.990 --> 01:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
currently we have about 47 of the 126
 
01:30:22.590 --> 01:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
that are over 20 years um about 39 that
 
01:30:24.990 --> 01:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
are over 30 years old
 
01:30:27.550 --> 01:30:27.560 align:start position:0%
um and uh once we get beyond that
 
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
20-year time frame some of the warranty
 
01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
periods uh expire and they come with a
 
01:30:34.750 --> 01:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
growing and increased risk of leakage
 
01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:35.470 align:start position:0%
growing and increased risk of leakage
and

01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts so
 
01:30:43.510 --> 01:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
um again this we we have found recent um
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
fuel storage uh facility
 
01:30:48.510 --> 01:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
Replacements Uh current projects have
 
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
run about
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
$800 um ,000 so this would uh try to get
 
01:30:56.910 --> 01:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
at um a couple uh uh a couple of the
 
01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
most highest needs in terms of um fuel
 
01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
tank Replacements and keeping up with
 
01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:03.430 align:start position:0%
tank Replacements and keeping up with
those

01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:31:06.109 --> 01:31:06.119 align:start position:0%
needs priority number three on slide
 
01:31:09.709 --> 01:31:09.719 align:start position:0%
nine um uh is again another uh
 
01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
continuation of Prior
 
01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:14.510 align:start position:0%
continuation of Prior
Investments

01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
Investments
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh and and and looking to address Patrol
 
01:31:20.910 --> 01:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
uh Patrol shed and facility Life Safety
 
01:31:23.470 --> 01:31:23.480 align:start position:0%
upgrades um for a number of years we
 
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
have had
 
01:31:29.310 --> 01:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
um um uh State Fire Marshall inspections
 
01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh and and U violations for compliance
 
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
with uh a number of our operational
 
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
facilities and we continue to try to um
 
01:31:41.229 --> 01:31:41.239 align:start position:0%
address those um violations some of
 
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
those things involve things like SE
 
01:31:45.790 --> 01:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
segregation of internal and external
 
01:31:48.350 --> 01:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
furnace rooms uh construction of
 
01:31:50.189 --> 01:31:50.199 align:start position:0%
compliant rest facilities for staff
 
01:31:51.870 --> 01:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
during winter maintenance
 
01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
operations uh rewiring new wiring for
 
01:31:57.189 --> 01:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
compliance with exit signs and emergency
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
lighting and things like that many of
 
01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
our facilities um have been built were
 
01:32:06.270 --> 01:32:06.280 align:start position:0%
built before current building code so um
 
01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:09.800 align:start position:0%
trying to keep up uh and keep them safe
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
um this um ongoing like I said
 
01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
programmatic uh systematic uh project or
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
funding uh allows us to continue to
 
01:32:24.109 --> 01:32:24.119 align:start position:0%
address those those um those needs
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
um and at least you know from from those
 
01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
inspections about 80% over 80% of our
 
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
Patrol facilities P at least one of the
 
01:32:37.070 --> 01:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh mentioned violations um many are
 
01:32:41.310 --> 01:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
cited for for for multiple violations so
 
01:32:43.310 --> 01:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
um it is a need that that we do try to
 
01:32:45.470 --> 01:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
keep up with and try to keep our um
 
01:32:50.109 --> 01:32:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:53.470 --> 01:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
possible priority number four uh deals
 
01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
with the a targeted replacement of our
 
01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
highest Patrol our highest priority um
 
01:33:04.350 --> 01:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
patrol shed um uh and and a facility
 
01:33:06.750 --> 01:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
replacement for the lempster ps215
 
01:33:11.149 --> 01:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
patrol shed an estimated cost of uh 3.5
 
01:33:15.430 --> 01:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
million um again it's somewhat
 
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
programmatic or systematic uh but um
 
01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
this is targeted specifically to this uh
 
01:33:25.550 --> 01:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
very outdated facility um the core of
 
01:33:28.109 --> 01:33:28.119 align:start position:0%
this facility is a is a quanset hunt
 
01:33:30.510 --> 01:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
that was previously used for military
 
01:33:32.270 --> 01:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
exercises in
 
01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
1940s um it was moved to the site um
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
urban legend that our staff has it
 
01:33:40.590 --> 01:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
either came from um odion's point and Ry
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
it came from Mount Washington but uh and
 
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
and we've tried to keep it up for a
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
number of years uh there's been you know
 
01:33:50.270 --> 01:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
out exterior Shell built around it and
 
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
extensions put on um but it is a extreme
 
01:33:57.669 --> 01:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
L dated facility um uh the district
 
01:34:00.669 --> 01:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
engineer wanted to do some further
 
01:34:03.629 --> 01:34:03.639 align:start position:0%
improvements and add-ons but uh we felt
 
01:34:06.629 --> 01:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
it was just a uh not a good uh
 
01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
investment to continue and that we
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
needed to um replace this facility the
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
facility also also floods it has
 
01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
standing water and puddles in the in the
 
01:34:20.669 --> 01:34:20.679 align:start position:0%
um in the uh uh concrete floor in the
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
spring melt uh and it has multiple um
 
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
building code violations and things like
 
01:34:28.910 --> 01:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
that so it is a uh is really one of our
 
01:34:31.709 --> 01:34:31.719 align:start position:0%
oldest outdated currently our old oldest
 
01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
outdated Patrol sheds that needs to be
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
replaced and typically in our capital
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
budget we try to replace uh one or two
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
um uh or secure funding to replace one
 
01:34:49.070 --> 01:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
or two petrol sheds per cycle um ideally
 
01:34:53.709 --> 01:34:53.719 align:start position:0%
with roughly 86 uh Patrol sheds uh
 
01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
Statewide in a um I you know a design
 
01:34:59.750 --> 01:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
life of around 50 years you know we
 
01:35:04.189 --> 01:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
would be um we would replace we would
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
replace be replacing um you know several
 
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
several of those a year the rate we're
 
01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
doing if we try to get one or two per
 
01:35:14.109 --> 01:35:14.119 align:start position:0%
cycle we're we're we're on a track of
 
01:35:16.709 --> 01:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
replacing them about every hundred years
 
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
which is not um which is not ideal but
 
01:35:22.270 --> 01:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
um it is a sustained and systemic
 
01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
investment to try to knock off the
 
01:35:27.870 --> 01:35:27.880 align:start position:0%
highest priority every every um every
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
bium um similarly priority number five
 
01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh deals with the roof replacement at
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
the Twin Mountain uh satellite garage
 
01:35:37.510 --> 01:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
for about $1.2
 
01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:39.430 align:start position:0%
for about $1.2
million

01:35:39.430 --> 01:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:35:44.109 --> 01:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
um this is an older outdated um facility
 
01:35:46.990 --> 01:35:47.000 align:start position:0%
the roof was never built structurally to
 
01:35:49.629 --> 01:35:49.639 align:start position:0%
support snow loads it was
 
01:35:53.390 --> 01:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
built excuse me in the late 60s when the
 
01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:55.070 align:start position:0%
built excuse me in the late 60s when the
um

01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:56.830 --> 01:35:56.840 align:start position:0%
the thoughts at the time were to heat
 
01:35:58.669 --> 01:35:58.679 align:start position:0%
heat the building to to melt the snow
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
off the roof and henceforth didn't need
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
the necessary um uh structural
 
01:36:05.709 --> 01:36:05.719 align:start position:0%
requirements to to support the snow
 
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
loads but that's you know the energy
 
01:36:10.830 --> 01:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
costs associated with that are very um
 
01:36:15.030 --> 01:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
outdated um and the current roof is um
 
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
you know really subject to a lot of heat
 
01:36:18.030 --> 01:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
loss and
 
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
inefficiency so um that is uh a priority
 
01:36:24.709 --> 01:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
that we would um very much like to uh
 
01:36:27.070 --> 01:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
address as
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
well our number six priority deals with
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
the federal Billing System I'll let
 
01:36:34.390 --> 01:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
Danielle speak to that um a little bit
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
within her Bailey Wick y for your for
 
01:36:39.629 --> 01:36:39.639 align:start position:0%
your um consideration we are asking to
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
replace the federal Billing System that
 
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
we use to Bill all of our federal
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
billing through
 
01:36:49.870 --> 01:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
fhwa currently that um system is built
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
in Visual Basic which is no longer
 
01:36:54.750 --> 01:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
really supported and the experts that
 
01:36:56.830 --> 01:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
we've had over the years are retiring
 
01:36:58.709 --> 01:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
and there is nobody else really to to
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
kind of do that um that system has had
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
multiple um upgrades and the programming
 
01:37:12.590 --> 01:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
for that is done it's at end of life new
 
01:37:15.310 --> 01:37:15.320 align:start position:0%
new programs uh new programming updates
 
01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
that are put in there usually tend to
 
01:37:18.990 --> 01:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
cause something else to fail we have
 
01:37:20.430 --> 01:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
several portions of that that are
 
01:37:23.070 --> 01:37:23.080 align:start position:0%
failing currently and it can only be
 
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
used for the most basic um funding
 
01:37:29.310 --> 01:37:29.320 align:start position:0%
splits like 8020 so 80 federal state
 
01:37:32.910 --> 01:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
match of 20 90 federal state match of 10
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
any of the more complicated um
 
01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
combinations can't be done through that
 
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
so they're being done um manually and
 
01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
the billing has to be has to go through
 
01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
a real rigorous process to make sure
 
01:37:47.149 --> 01:37:47.159 align:start position:0%
it's correct prior prior to going uh the
 
01:37:49.470 --> 01:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
volume on that is about 700 active
 
01:37:51.870 --> 01:37:51.880 align:start position:0%
projects and we have about $800 million
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
that actually flows through that system
 
01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
system so we're asking for um the
 
01:37:58.950 --> 01:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
funding to be able to do this not
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
internally we'd like it to go external
 
01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
with a company that that can actually do
 
01:38:06.669 --> 01:38:06.679 align:start position:0%
the upgrades on a regular basis that we
 
01:38:09.310 --> 01:38:09.320 align:start position:0%
don't do and maintain the regulations
 
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
for um
 
01:38:15.550 --> 01:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:19.709 --> 01:38:19.719 align:start position:0%
you um priority 7 deals with uh facility
 
01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
replacement another old Patrol shed in
 
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh the Twin Mountain uh area um this is
 
01:38:28.629 --> 01:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
a uh facility that was condemned and
 
01:38:30.270 --> 01:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
closed in
 
01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
2011 um we have uh tried for the last 10
 
01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
years to uh do without it but it is a
 
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
very Hub area at Twin Mountain in in the
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
North Country uh we have a salt shed uh
 
01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
on on the site that is that is that is
 
01:38:49.629 --> 01:38:49.639 align:start position:0%
strategic to the maintenance along Route
 
01:38:52.990 --> 01:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
302 uh there's a satellite garage uh uh
 
01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
up theill Hill there's a a fuel station
 
01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
there that uh is used by State Police
 
01:39:00.350 --> 01:39:00.360 align:start position:0%
and every everybody it's a hub there so
 
01:39:02.589 --> 01:39:02.599 align:start position:0%
um while we have tried to do without
 
01:39:05.589 --> 01:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
this facility uh we have found that over
 
01:39:09.070 --> 01:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years we still need and uh
 
01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
have maintained a presence there we've
 
01:39:13.790 --> 01:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
maintained the presence through um you
 
01:39:16.510 --> 01:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
know a series of of rented construction
 
01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
trailers um without facilities and um it
 
01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
has been um really a a challenge uh for
 
01:39:26.990 --> 01:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
our folks and it's really just not a a
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
good um a good situation to have our
 
01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
Personnel you know continuing to be
 
01:39:34.270 --> 01:39:34.280 align:start position:0%
housed in temporary rented trailers you
 
01:39:36.189 --> 01:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
know without without facilities and
 
01:39:39.390 --> 01:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
things like that so um one of the asks
 
01:39:43.629 --> 01:39:43.639 align:start position:0%
this year is is is uh to seek to fund a
 
01:39:45.790 --> 01:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
uh replacement facility at the Twin
 
01:39:49.470 --> 01:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
Mountain um location this would be a
 
01:39:51.589 --> 01:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
multi-divisional uh facility that would
 
01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
support not only the Highway Maintenance
 
01:39:57.310 --> 01:39:57.320 align:start position:0%
folks but the regional um regional
 
01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
bridge inspectors Regional construction
 
01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
Personnel um that would that have and
 
01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
continue to work out of that out of that
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
site so that's our number seven
 
01:40:11.390 --> 01:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
priority um our number eight priority is
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
a number is is also an additional um uh
 
01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
Legacy system that I'll ask Andre Brier
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
would speak
 
01:40:22.629 --> 01:40:22.639 align:start position:0%
to good morning I'll attempt to side
 
01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
saddle here uh this request is to engage
 
01:40:27.669 --> 01:40:27.679 align:start position:0%
a consultant to begin the planning
 
01:40:30.790 --> 01:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
process for transition from our project
 
01:40:33.229 --> 01:40:33.239 align:start position:0%
development software the original code
 
01:40:34.589 --> 01:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
was written in
 
01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
2014 um it's with a company called
 
01:40:39.149 --> 01:40:39.159 align:start position:0%
exhivision unfortunately there's not
 
01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
offthe shelf software that that handles
 
01:40:46.229 --> 01:40:46.239 align:start position:0%
the bids and the management of um
 
01:40:48.790 --> 01:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
projects this is uh right now Services
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
over 1,700 contractors and
 
01:40:52.830 --> 01:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
subcontractors along with our
 
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
Construction program um any there are
 
01:40:58.669 --> 01:40:58.679 align:start position:0%
some off-the-shelf providers but it's
 
01:41:01.709 --> 01:41:01.719 align:start position:0%
always um going to require customization
 
01:41:04.149 --> 01:41:04.159 align:start position:0%
every state is in the same boat on this
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
so the highly customized nature of the
 
01:41:08.750 --> 01:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
software uh does require the securing of
 
01:41:10.910 --> 01:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
a consultant contract to manage the
 
01:41:14.030 --> 01:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
transition it's a multi-year acquisition
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
multi-year transition from a piece of
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
software this importance and size really
 
01:41:23.470 --> 01:41:23.480 align:start position:0%
no fail um as far as Federal compliance
 
01:41:25.109 --> 01:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
managing all those federal dollars that
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
come into the state um so that's the
 
01:41:29.189 --> 01:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
request is for
 
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
$500,000 to engage a consultant for the
 
01:41:34.189 --> 01:41:34.199 align:start position:0%
planning and procurement uh of a
 
01:41:36.189 --> 01:41:36.199 align:start position:0%
replacement system this current system
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
we have um the contract expires at the
 
01:41:41.709 --> 01:41:41.719 align:start position:0%
end of 2026 there are extensions
 
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
available but our anticipation is even
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
if those extension options are exercised
 
01:41:49.109 --> 01:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
we need to begin the planning process
 
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
now um for this type of system
 
01:41:57.189 --> 01:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
priority nine is the replacement of uh
 
01:42:00.350 --> 01:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
rail um and what this really is is the
 
01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
purchase of four track miles of
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
115b rail and the the uh I mentioned
 
01:42:10.990 --> 01:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
that because it is a different weight
 
01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
and type of rail than is commonly
 
01:42:16.109 --> 01:42:16.119 align:start position:0%
installed on our railroads today most of
 
01:42:18.750 --> 01:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
our rail is over 100 years old and is
 
01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
what's called 85lb rail that 85lb rail
 
01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:23.990 align:start position:0%
what's called 85lb rail that 85lb rail
was

01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:42:26.990 --> 01:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
um was rolled they say when you when you
 
01:42:30.149 --> 01:42:30.159 align:start position:0%
construct this rail using a process from
 
01:42:33.870 --> 01:42:33.880 align:start position:0%
the 1930s and 40s uh typically which did
 
01:42:35.629 --> 01:42:35.639 align:start position:0%
not have controlled cooling it makes it
 
01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:37.679 align:start position:0%
more susceptible to unpredictable brakes
 
01:42:39.870 --> 01:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of the derailments you hear about
 
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
the country uh have to do with uh old
 
01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
85lb rail it's not even made anymore not
 
01:42:48.910 --> 01:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
commonly um accessible so this plan
 
01:42:52.870 --> 01:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
would uh secure us just the four lane
 
01:42:56.990 --> 01:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
the four ra track miles of rail of 115lb
 
01:42:59.109 --> 01:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
rail that we would use to repair and
 
01:43:03.870 --> 01:43:03.880 align:start position:0%
replace um broken outdated um or damaged
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
a old 85lb rail we will Salvage the uh
 
01:43:10.629 --> 01:43:10.639 align:start position:0%
85lb rail that we find uh passes
 
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
inspection and utilize that as well but
 
01:43:16.629 --> 01:43:16.639 align:start position:0%
with over 450 track miles um just
 
01:43:18.669 --> 01:43:18.679 align:start position:0%
maintaining our rail to an acceptable
 
01:43:21.070 --> 01:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
and safe condition requires this
 
01:43:23.470 --> 01:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
acquisition um so that that rail can be
 
01:43:26.990 --> 01:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
replaced as needs be really the same
 
01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
story here with priority 10 this is a
 
01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:30.639 align:start position:0%
replacement of railroad ties most of
 
01:43:33.070 --> 01:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
these ties were installed in the 1920s
 
01:43:36.430 --> 01:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
30s and 40s making uh the bulk of it
 
01:43:38.790 --> 01:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
over a 100 years old well past useful
 
01:43:43.149 --> 01:43:43.159 align:start position:0%
life again the danger of not replacing
 
01:43:46.669 --> 01:43:46.679 align:start position:0%
uh these ties in a timely manner um
 
01:43:48.870 --> 01:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
especially those that have disintegrated
 
01:43:51.550 --> 01:43:51.560 align:start position:0%
you can see the pictures there of of
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
many of these ties that have
 
01:43:55.709 --> 01:43:55.719 align:start position:0%
disintegrated is either closure of track
 
01:43:58.629 --> 01:43:58.639 align:start position:0%
segments or unpredictable and very
 
01:44:01.990 --> 01:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
undesirable accidents um so this again
 
01:44:05.350 --> 01:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
would get us about 16,000 ties at the
 
01:44:07.870 --> 01:44:07.880 align:start position:0%
low low price of $68 each which is
 
01:44:10.669 --> 01:44:10.679 align:start position:0%
actually pretty much a bargain uh so
 
01:44:12.910 --> 01:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
this is again necessary for the
 
01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
maintenance of our active rail
 
01:44:21.189 --> 01:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
track priority 11 uh is again kind of a
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
a similar story this is the right of way
 
01:44:25.830 --> 01:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
system software replacement of $2
 
01:44:28.350 --> 01:44:28.360 align:start position:0%
million the current systems 20 years old
 
01:44:31.350 --> 01:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
again built in Visual Basic um Beyond
 
01:44:34.870 --> 01:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
useful life um what we're finding on
 
01:44:37.950 --> 01:44:37.960 align:start position:0%
some of these systems that um you know
 
01:44:40.350 --> 01:44:40.360 align:start position:0%
as Danielle mentioned when you when you
 
01:44:43.149 --> 01:44:43.159 align:start position:0%
implement upgrades um number one the
 
01:44:45.189 --> 01:44:45.199 align:start position:0%
skill set of people that are familiar in
 
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
the programming language is becoming
 
01:44:49.830 --> 01:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
sparse number two tends to crash
 
01:44:53.790 --> 01:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
unintended parts of the system and um
 
01:44:56.229 --> 01:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
it's requiring us to go back to
 
01:44:59.589 --> 01:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
pre-digital processes just to maintain
 
01:45:01.709 --> 01:45:01.719 align:start position:0%
um our book of real estate in this case
 
01:45:05.149 --> 01:45:05.159 align:start position:0%
over uh worth over 450 million uh in
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
assets so this is a 2 million ask it's a
 
01:45:09.790 --> 01:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
very small ask to manage a very large
 
01:45:13.390 --> 01:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:16.589 --> 01:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
property number 12 is uh as the
 
01:45:18.510 --> 01:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner said this is recurring this
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
is our normal budget item uh for State
 
01:45:25.589 --> 01:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
match for FAA projects 4 milon uh
 
01:45:29.669 --> 01:45:29.679 align:start position:0%
$714 uh in change to access 63 million
 
01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
in FAA improvements and uh iiga funded
 
01:45:35.629 --> 01:45:35.639 align:start position:0%
opportunities you can see the federally
 
01:45:37.629 --> 01:45:37.639 align:start position:0%
eligible airports there that are part of
 
01:45:39.709 --> 01:45:39.719 align:start position:0%
this system we we engage with Master
 
01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
planning processes with all of these
 
01:45:44.350 --> 01:45:44.360 align:start position:0%
airports those uh
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
requested um upgrades or maintenance is
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
then prioritized with the FAA we access
 
01:45:56.589 --> 01:45:56.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:00.109 --> 01:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
priority 13 is Transit vehicle match
 
01:46:01.350 --> 01:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:46:05.229 --> 01:46:05.239 align:start position:0%
$390,000 request to access uh four over
 
01:46:07.510 --> 01:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
$4 million in FTA funding opportunities
 
01:46:11.629 --> 01:46:11.639 align:start position:0%
for ada8 compliant Transit vehicles um
 
01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
we match the lesser of 10% or half of
 
01:46:18.270 --> 01:46:18.280 align:start position:0%
the required state and local match FAA
 
01:46:21.629 --> 01:46:21.639 align:start position:0%
covers between 80 and 85% 85% for 8A
 
01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
Vehicles 80% for other
 
01:46:27.070 --> 01:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
vehicles um and this would enable us to
 
01:46:29.669 --> 01:46:29.679 align:start position:0%
continue uh maintaining and
 
01:46:31.310 --> 01:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
recapitalizing that
 
01:46:35.109 --> 01:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
Fleet Priority 14 is also an FDA program
 
01:46:39.070 --> 01:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
but this has to do with um facilities so
 
01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
you can see those three facilities on
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
the slide Coast uh down in the Sea Coast
 
01:46:45.629 --> 01:46:45.639 align:start position:0%
Area Manchester transit authority and
 
01:46:48.830 --> 01:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
advanced Transit bus storage facility um
 
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
all require um facility um mod
 
01:46:54.830 --> 01:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
appications or upgrades most of those
 
01:46:57.870 --> 01:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
are for safety reasons inspections and
 
01:47:00.030 --> 01:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
things like that and uh small
 
01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
administrative facilities that are
 
01:47:04.510 --> 01:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:08.550 --> 01:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
those priority 15 is priority 15 but it
 
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
it is a a very
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
glaring um problem uh that we have
 
01:47:16.030 --> 01:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
because all the transit modes you've
 
01:47:20.669 --> 01:47:20.679 align:start position:0%
heard about today highways airports rail
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
Transit um all have their own funding
 
01:47:25.790 --> 01:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
streams all have a federal agency that
 
01:47:29.669 --> 01:47:29.679 align:start position:0%
provides monies um unfortunately our
 
01:47:32.270 --> 01:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
rail Trails rail trails are popular
 
01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
Nationwide they're certainly very
 
01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
popular in our state it's a good use of
 
01:47:39.669 --> 01:47:39.679 align:start position:0%
abandoned rail corridors for recreation
 
01:47:41.910 --> 01:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
and they are a business generator in our
 
01:47:44.109 --> 01:47:44.119 align:start position:0%
state we get money part of the 10year
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
plan to construct rail trails and and
 
01:47:50.350 --> 01:47:50.360 align:start position:0%
build these facilities there is no
 
01:47:52.870 --> 01:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
funding stream federal or state to
 
01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
maintain these trails and these Trails
 
01:47:58.669 --> 01:47:58.679 align:start position:0%
uh which also Encompass old railroad
 
01:48:02.750 --> 01:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
Bridges culverts all of which fail um
 
01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
when they fail we are restricted as a
 
01:48:07.270 --> 01:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
department from using Highway funds to
 
01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:08.310 align:start position:0%
department from using Highway funds to
fix

01:48:08.310 --> 01:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
fix
 
01:48:10.510 --> 01:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
them therefore when they go out of
 
01:48:11.830 --> 01:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
commission they are just out of
 
01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
commission so a community that may have
 
01:48:15.709 --> 01:48:15.719 align:start position:0%
been very excited about getting a new
 
01:48:18.070 --> 01:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
rail trail after a major rain event like
 
01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
we've had a couple over this winter uh
 
01:48:23.109 --> 01:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
can find themselves U again without a
 
01:48:27.229 --> 01:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
usable Trail um we strongly urge funding
 
01:48:29.750 --> 01:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
of a very modest
 
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
$600,000 to provide for the um for the
 
01:48:37.229 --> 01:48:37.239 align:start position:0%
critical repairs to um either washed out
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
Trails failed um uh Bridges or culs it's
 
01:48:44.709 --> 01:48:44.719 align:start position:0%
it's much needed and there are multiple
 
01:48:46.350 --> 01:48:46.360 align:start position:0%
trails in our state right now that we
 
01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of money and effort building
 
01:48:50.149 --> 01:48:50.159 align:start position:0%
that are out of commission because of
 
01:48:53.189 --> 01:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
this reason we have no funding uh stream
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh we partner with the Department of
 
01:48:56.990 --> 01:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
Natural cultural resources to manage
 
01:48:58.550 --> 01:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
these Trails even though most of the
 
01:49:00.589 --> 01:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
time it's it's dot that's the underlying
 
01:49:03.910 --> 01:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
real property owner um they also don't
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
have a funding stream to maintain these
 
01:49:08.870 --> 01:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
Trails so sometimes we get lucky when a
 
01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
community is able to fix a wash out but
 
01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about a bridge or
 
01:49:14.350 --> 01:49:14.360 align:start position:0%
cul structure there's not too many
 
01:49:15.870 --> 01:49:15.880 align:start position:0%
communities around our state that have
 
01:49:19.229 --> 01:49:19.239 align:start position:0%
the independent ability to fix
 
01:49:21.709 --> 01:49:21.719 align:start position:0%
those that's my strong pitch for number
 
01:49:23.950 --> 01:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
15 even though over during the end and
 
01:49:28.229 --> 01:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
for 16 uh is uh emergency uh response
 
01:49:30.310 --> 01:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
mobile command vehicle what this really
 
01:49:33.709 --> 01:49:33.719 align:start position:0%
though is is just just like I I just
 
01:49:35.870 --> 01:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
referenced um the
 
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
multiple natural disasters in our state
 
01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh we're our state is becoming more and
 
01:49:44.109 --> 01:49:44.119 align:start position:0%
more reliant on uas and that's the
 
01:49:49.070 --> 01:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
drones um to rapidly inspect and um Aid
 
01:49:53.109 --> 01:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
in the repair of uh either washing outs
 
01:49:56.510 --> 01:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
Road failures natural disasters our
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Aeronautics Rail and Transit
 
01:50:00.390 --> 01:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
is the one who responds to that and
 
01:50:04.109 --> 01:50:04.119 align:start position:0%
provides those uh those aerial resources
 
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
this van would enable that group to get
 
01:50:09.629 --> 01:50:09.639 align:start position:0%
closer and operate continuously out of a
 
01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
location not have to come back to
 
01:50:15.430 --> 01:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
headquarters to either download data or
 
01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
recharge those systems it enables a
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
forward presence that lets us be more
 
01:50:23.910 --> 01:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
responsive uh in a natural disaster
 
01:50:26.270 --> 01:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
emergency and for 16 I'll pass it back
 
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
to commissioner
 
01:50:31.870 --> 01:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
Cass and yeah final uh priority 17 is
 
01:50:33.470 --> 01:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
another facility replacement so this
 
01:50:35.470 --> 01:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
would represent the third Patrol shed
 
01:50:38.030 --> 01:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
that's on the on the list uh it's down
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
toward toward the end uh this is the
 
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
Pinkham Notch uh Patrol shed which again
 
01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:44.109 align:start position:0%
Pinkham Notch uh Patrol shed which again
is

01:50:44.109 --> 01:50:44.119 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:50:47.069 --> 01:50:47.079 align:start position:0%
um uh very dated the existing facility
 
01:50:50.589 --> 01:50:50.599 align:start position:0%
over 90 years old um really trying to
 
01:50:56.270 --> 01:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
cram uh the the truck in in there and um
 
01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh has a failed septic system and a
 
01:51:00.430 --> 01:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
number of number of problems so it is
 
01:51:02.589 --> 01:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
number uh
 
01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
17 and and whether this can be fully
 
01:51:08.589 --> 01:51:08.599 align:start position:0%
funded at least we put this on the list
 
01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
to begin um even even some funding for
 
01:51:15.790 --> 01:51:15.800 align:start position:0%
beginning uh design and looking at the
 
01:51:19.229 --> 01:51:19.239 align:start position:0%
uh the the true needs um and true costs
 
01:51:22.629 --> 01:51:22.639 align:start position:0%
for that facility replacement so um
 
01:51:25.430 --> 01:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully we haven't over over over
 
01:51:28.149 --> 01:51:28.159 align:start position:0%
overdone our time the last slide uh just
 
01:51:31.709 --> 01:51:31.719 align:start position:0%
have have asked Danielle to speak to the
 
01:51:33.750 --> 01:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
um uh you know The Debt Service
 
01:51:36.830 --> 01:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
implications of this request so right so
 
01:51:38.830 --> 01:51:38.840 align:start position:0%
so as you know treasury is responsible
 
01:51:41.589 --> 01:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
for generating uh the general obligation
 
01:51:46.229 --> 01:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
bonds uh on behalf of the these requests
 
01:51:48.870 --> 01:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
um and the repayment of the bond debt
 
01:51:51.270 --> 01:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
for Highway funded projects anyway is
 
01:51:53.430 --> 01:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
done through the operating budget
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
and it's based on a 20-year repayment
 
01:51:58.109 --> 01:51:58.119 align:start position:0%
schedule 5% interest with 60% of that
 
01:52:03.229 --> 01:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:05.629 --> 01:52:05.639 align:start position:0%
years so those are the implications
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
there so entertain any questions I
 
01:52:11.750 --> 01:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate your um attention and um um
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
listening to our presentation thank you
 
01:52:18.030 --> 01:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um I know the the the 10-year
 
01:52:20.510 --> 01:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
plan just passed by the legislature as
 
01:52:21.750 --> 01:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
want you tell me the relationship
 
01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
between the capital budget and the
 
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
10-year plan are all some or none of
 
01:52:28.350 --> 01:52:28.360 align:start position:0%
these projects located within the 10year
 
01:52:31.709 --> 01:52:31.719 align:start position:0%
plan or what's the relationship between
 
01:52:34.589 --> 01:52:34.599 align:start position:0%
the two none of these projects are are
 
01:52:36.270 --> 01:52:36.280 align:start position:0%
contained within the 10year plan because
 
01:52:40.350 --> 01:52:40.360 align:start position:0%
they really result they really um well I
 
01:52:43.149 --> 01:52:43.159 align:start position:0%
I take that back a minute um most of
 
01:52:45.709 --> 01:52:45.719 align:start position:0%
these projects are not are not tied to
 
01:52:47.629 --> 01:52:47.639 align:start position:0%
the tene plan they deal with our uh
 
01:52:50.069 --> 01:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
operational needs the exception to that
 
01:52:53.589 --> 01:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
would be the um FAA match in the FTA
 
01:52:56.109 --> 01:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
match so the federal funding for those
 
01:52:59.790 --> 01:52:59.800 align:start position:0%
programs is um listed and contained in
 
01:53:02.390 --> 01:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
the in the ten year plan uh and the
 
01:53:05.430 --> 01:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
state match that's reflected in this
 
01:53:09.550 --> 01:53:09.560 align:start position:0%
capital budget request is also reflected
 
01:53:12.149 --> 01:53:12.159 align:start position:0%
in that uh 10-year plan but the other
 
01:53:15.310 --> 01:53:15.320 align:start position:0%
facilities Investments and uh the Legacy
 
01:53:18.510 --> 01:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
system Replacements um because they're
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
operational needs and and none of them
 
01:53:22.990 --> 01:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
are um are
 
01:53:27.470 --> 01:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
um eligible for for federal funding or
 
01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
um you know Turnpike
 
01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
funding Turnpike uh Capital needs for
 
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
example uh are not listed in in in in in
 
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
this Capital request uh turnike system
 
01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
is its own enterprise system that is um
 
01:53:47.109 --> 01:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
um captured in the um over
 
01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
overall operating budget of the
 
01:53:51.229 --> 01:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
department in the turnpike system
 
01:53:52.950 --> 01:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully that answers your question
 
01:53:55.990 --> 01:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
so in short most of this
 
01:54:00.030 --> 01:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
is uh outside or not directly uh related
 
01:54:02.189 --> 01:54:02.199 align:start position:0%
to the 10e plan except for the tie to
 
01:54:04.950 --> 01:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
those FAA and FTA programs in the state
 
01:54:07.750 --> 01:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
match contained in this request okay uh
 
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
last question for me the uh speaking of
 
01:54:12.270 --> 01:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
the FAA match uh the 4.7 of General
 
01:54:14.990 --> 01:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
funds versus the 62.6 million of federal
 
01:54:18.109 --> 01:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
funds about a 13 to1 match for the
 
01:54:20.510 --> 01:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
airports do you know how they base that
 
01:54:22.830 --> 01:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
funding or that that match what they the
 
01:54:24.229 --> 01:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
criteria they base it on and do they
 
01:54:26.830 --> 01:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
give more or less considering the type
 
01:54:28.069 --> 01:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
of airport whether it's like a
 
01:54:31.270 --> 01:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
commercial one like Manchester or uh a
 
01:54:32.910 --> 01:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
smaller one like Berlin or Mount
 
01:54:35.229 --> 01:54:35.239 align:start position:0%
Washington right and that's a that's a
 
01:54:38.709 --> 01:54:38.719 align:start position:0%
great question the uh the key to
 
01:54:40.189 --> 01:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
understanding the differences in the
 
01:54:43.229 --> 01:54:43.239 align:start position:0%
match are the types of projects that are
 
01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
funded there so the FAA subdivides even
 
01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
though we roll them all up into a state
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
match here for FAA related um uh pass
 
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
through or
 
01:54:57.109 --> 01:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
grants Runway improvements along with
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
taxiway improvements are treated
 
01:55:01.709 --> 01:55:01.719 align:start position:0%
differently than control control tower
 
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
improvements or rebuilding and each of
 
01:55:06.910 --> 01:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
those has a different match which in
 
01:55:08.709 --> 01:55:08.719 align:start position:0%
turn are different than terminal
 
01:55:11.310 --> 01:55:11.320 align:start position:0%
building improvements it's these are
 
01:55:14.430 --> 01:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
discrete types of Grants and
 
01:55:17.430 --> 01:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
authorizations that FAA does Each of
 
01:55:20.790 --> 01:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
which has slightly different matching um
 
01:55:23.470 --> 01:55:23.480 align:start position:0%
and therefore it's a slightly different
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
match um uh balance between us and the
 
01:55:29.470 --> 01:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
local airport between the state and the
 
01:55:32.229 --> 01:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
local airport in addition to that an
 
01:55:34.589 --> 01:55:34.599 align:start position:0%
added layer of complexity is the
 
01:55:37.510 --> 01:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
recently passed fa reauthorization
 
01:55:40.870 --> 01:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
act further subdivided that further
 
01:55:44.669 --> 01:55:44.679 align:start position:0%
created um to our benefit um several
 
01:55:45.870 --> 01:55:45.880 align:start position:0%
programs that are going to have a
 
01:55:47.629 --> 01:55:47.639 align:start position:0%
further reduce match that's all
 
01:55:51.229 --> 01:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
calculated in this request so that was
 
01:55:54.510 --> 01:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
signed by the president May 15th um we
 
01:55:56.910 --> 01:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
recalculated that to the
 
01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
4,724 and change that we're requesting
 
01:56:01.830 --> 01:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
so various levels of match depending on
 
01:56:04.229 --> 01:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
the type of uh of
 
01:56:06.910 --> 01:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
Grant but and I would just add it's in
 
01:56:09.510 --> 01:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
list to the in in general most of the
 
01:56:11.790 --> 01:56:11.800 align:start position:0%
GNC items and things that we take for
 
01:56:16.270 --> 01:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
it's um typically 9 9010 so it's by and
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
large a lot of it is 90% federal funds
 
01:56:21.589 --> 01:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
and the 10% match is typically split 5%
 
01:56:24.669 --> 01:56:24.679 align:start position:0%
with the state uh contribution and 5%
 
01:56:28.830 --> 01:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
from the um uh local or Regional Airport
 
01:56:31.790 --> 01:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
contribution generally that's
 
01:56:34.669 --> 01:56:34.679 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you any other questions
 
01:56:38.510 --> 01:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner thank you um rail Trails I
 
01:56:40.870 --> 01:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
appreciated your pitch um I like rail
 
01:56:44.430 --> 01:56:44.440 align:start position:0%
Trails um why do you manage rail Trails
 
01:56:45.910 --> 01:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
not the trails
 
01:56:48.990 --> 01:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
Bureau yeah so that that has to do with
 
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh the underlying rail rights along uh
 
01:56:54.270 --> 01:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
in active rail corridors which are
 
01:56:56.350 --> 01:56:56.360 align:start position:0%
distinct from abandoned rail corridors
 
01:57:00.189 --> 01:57:00.199 align:start position:0%
so if if a we usually retain the right
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
to um reestablish rail along our
 
01:57:06.390 --> 01:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
corridors um believe me I wish I could
 
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
offload a lot of these segments it would
 
01:57:10.069 --> 01:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
make our lives a lot easier we are not
 
01:57:12.870 --> 01:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
the uh Department of trails uh and we
 
01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
have one of those I just wonder if
 
01:57:15.910 --> 01:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
there's a I mean the the ownership is
 
01:57:19.270 --> 01:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
one thing right the the you know the
 
01:57:21.069 --> 01:57:21.079 align:start position:0%
they happen to we also happen to be both
 
01:57:22.910 --> 01:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
part of the same company yeah which is
 
01:57:25.470 --> 01:57:25.480 align:start position:0%
the state but um it seems like they
 
01:57:27.149 --> 01:57:27.159 align:start position:0%
probably have expertise in managing
 
01:57:29.550 --> 01:57:29.560 align:start position:0%
trails that so we do partner quite
 
01:57:32.430 --> 01:57:32.440 align:start position:0%
extensively with the NCR and we have a
 
01:57:35.189 --> 01:57:35.199 align:start position:0%
rail trail plan that was completed last
 
01:57:36.990 --> 01:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
year that
 
01:57:42.069 --> 01:57:42.079 align:start position:0%
envisions um dncr managing uh different
 
01:57:43.870 --> 01:57:43.880 align:start position:0%
type there's different types of uses and
 
01:57:45.350 --> 01:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
when you look at rail Trails across the
 
01:57:47.430 --> 01:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
country some are really used for daily
 
01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
commuting you know especially near urban
 
01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
areas most are recreation in our State
 
01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:55.679 align:start position:0%
that's even more true there's only a
 
01:57:57.750 --> 01:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
couple discrete rail trail segments that
 
01:57:59.270 --> 01:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
we have toward the southern part of our
 
01:58:01.109 --> 01:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
state that are actually used for
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
commutes for people that are using them
 
01:58:05.229 --> 01:58:05.239 align:start position:0%
as as active transportation is what we
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
is the term of art um versus Recreation
 
01:58:11.109 --> 01:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
and we are partnering with the NCR to
 
01:58:13.589 --> 01:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
take over the the the full-time
 
01:58:17.109 --> 01:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
management of several segments um but
 
01:58:20.109 --> 01:58:20.119 align:start position:0%
we're in a conundrum as the NCR also is
 
01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:22.719 align:start position:0%
not funded or man to manage these Trails
 
01:58:26.910 --> 01:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
so we are in a Cooperative dance right
 
01:58:30.550 --> 01:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
now yeah I would just add a lot of the
 
01:58:32.990 --> 01:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh trails that that we own that have are
 
01:58:35.950 --> 01:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
maintained for um recreational use there
 
01:58:38.229 --> 01:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
is a Cooperative agreement with with um
 
01:58:42.510 --> 01:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
the NCR um when storms happen when culs
 
01:58:46.229 --> 01:58:46.239 align:start position:0%
fail when when uh wash outs happen uh it
 
01:58:49.709 --> 01:58:49.719 align:start position:0%
does typically fall despite the the um
 
01:58:51.470 --> 01:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
Cooperative agreement for for managing
 
01:58:53.270 --> 01:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
if for rec ational use it typically
 
01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
falls back on the on the owner to
 
01:58:57.790 --> 01:58:57.800 align:start position:0%
replace that infrastructure and that's a
 
01:59:00.069 --> 01:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
big part of where we fall down and
 
01:59:02.350 --> 01:59:02.360 align:start position:0%
typically local clubs that pres like you
 
01:59:04.990 --> 01:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
know Friends of the rail trail Etc don't
 
01:59:07.390 --> 01:59:07.400 align:start position:0%
have significant cash well they they
 
01:59:09.709 --> 01:59:09.719 align:start position:0%
have Manpower and they do their best
 
01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
right they they could get out if if if a
 
01:59:14.229 --> 01:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
little part of the trail has a wash out
 
01:59:15.550 --> 01:59:15.560 align:start position:0%
you know that's where the local
 
01:59:17.709 --> 01:59:17.719 align:start position:0%
volunteer groups come with sand and
 
01:59:20.750 --> 01:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
wheelbarrows and try to fix it when when
 
01:59:21.709 --> 01:59:21.719 align:start position:0%
you're talking about some of these
 
01:59:24.270 --> 01:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
Bridges structures they are beefy they
 
01:59:27.430 --> 01:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
are built uh you know to carry rail so
 
01:59:29.310 --> 01:59:29.320 align:start position:0%
they're very significant structures and
 
01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
they fail and uh the the age of some of
 
01:59:34.149 --> 01:59:34.159 align:start position:0%
these structures is such that they're
 
01:59:38.069 --> 01:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
failing at an increasing uh pace so not
 
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
something I could fix with a hammer and
 
01:59:42.550 --> 01:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
scrap Lumber pretty tough pretty tough
 
01:59:44.750 --> 01:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
um I have a question about um the ipd
 
01:59:46.750 --> 01:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
software you have a half a million for a
 
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
consultant do you have a guesstimate of
 
01:59:52.870 --> 01:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
of the ballpark procurement
 
01:59:55.589 --> 01:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
of the actual
 
01:59:57.310 --> 01:59:57.320 align:start position:0%
software you're going to buy you're
 
01:59:58.990 --> 01:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
going to procure replacement software
 
02:00:01.270 --> 02:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
presum we go out to bid I can Wing like
 
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
10 or 50 of it uh the existing system I
 
02:00:07.709 --> 02:00:07.719 align:start position:0%
know when we procured it in uh 2014 was
 
02:00:10.109 --> 02:00:10.119 align:start position:0%
about $3.5 million so I'm sure that's
 
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
gone up uh yeah probably a ballpark
 
02:00:16.109 --> 02:00:16.119 align:start position:0%
figure would would be I would estimate
 
02:00:19.229 --> 02:00:19.239 align:start position:0%
around $5 million for a full system but
 
02:00:22.910 --> 02:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
that qualify that that that is a um
 
02:00:25.109 --> 02:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit of a swag but based
 
02:00:27.709 --> 02:00:27.719 align:start position:0%
on the fact that the existing system
 
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
that we did 10 years ago was about a 3
 
02:00:32.629 --> 02:00:32.639 align:start position:0%
and a half million um development effort
 
02:00:35.149 --> 02:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
um that's what I'm basing it on okay
 
02:00:35.159 --> 02:00:38.229 align:start position:0%
um that's what I'm basing it on okay
thank

02:00:38.229 --> 02:00:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:41.669 --> 02:00:41.679 align:start position:0%
you um do any of the rail Trails allow
 
02:00:43.790 --> 02:00:43.800 align:start position:0%
uh snowmobile
 
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
Recreation they do yes all of them uh
 
02:00:49.870 --> 02:00:49.880 align:start position:0%
not all of them but but I again I I
 
02:00:51.629 --> 02:00:51.639 align:start position:0%
don't want to get into the tap dancing
 
02:00:54.510 --> 02:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
but a significant proportion of them do
 
02:00:58.030 --> 02:00:58.040 align:start position:0%
isn't um the the trails Bureau don't
 
02:01:00.510 --> 02:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
they collect a fee to help with the
 
02:01:02.430 --> 02:01:02.440 align:start position:0%
maintenance of those
 
02:01:06.189 --> 02:01:06.199 align:start position:0%
Trails yeah yes they do just to maintain
 
02:01:08.270 --> 02:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
that's to maintain their
 
02:01:11.310 --> 02:01:11.320 align:start position:0%
Trails okay I see when they don't
 
02:01:13.709 --> 02:01:13.719 align:start position:0%
include yours that's correct all right
 
02:01:13.719 --> 02:01:16.750 align:start position:0%
include yours that's correct all right
thank

02:01:16.750 --> 02:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:19.430 --> 02:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
you any additional
 
02:01:21.149 --> 02:01:21.159 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
02:01:23.430 --> 02:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you all appreciate it
 
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
and with that that concludes our
