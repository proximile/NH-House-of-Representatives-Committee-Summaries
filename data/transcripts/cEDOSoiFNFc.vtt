over again some of you are probably
 
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
looking at this going gez I I thought we
 
00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:09.639 align:start position:0%
disposed of this uh just last year and
 
00:08:12.029 --> 00:08:12.039 align:start position:0%
uh you you would be right this is the
 
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:14.120 align:start position:0%
this is the bill that this committee uh
 
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
recommended ought to pass has amended uh
 
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:19.720 align:start position:0%
and the uh the house in all its wisdom
 
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
passed it on to the senate senate took
 
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.390 align:start position:0%
passed it on to the senate senate took
it

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
up and they decided that they wanted to
 
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
do a national legislative CH just to uh
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
make sure there was nothing hiding under
 
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
any stone that may have been left
 
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
unturned um this is the packet it looks
 
00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
thick and daunting uh most of the most
 
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
of the pages are like the first Pages
 
00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:44.039 align:start position:0%
there's there's nothing there um this is
 
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:46.360 align:start position:0%
in your email as of this morning so you
 
00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
can review it at your your leisure
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
between now and your your exec session
 
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
um that's that's coming
 
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
up I I've reviewed the information that
 
00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
the the Senate oh so I'm sorry so the
 
00:08:59.790 --> 00:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
Senate um
 
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
passed the bill um interim study and I
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
was encouraged by um the the chair of of
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
their committee uh to refile the bill uh
 
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
to look through this and then make any
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
any changes as as one may see fit I have
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
gone through all of this material um to
 
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
to the best of my analysis there's
 
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
nothing in this packet um that says that
 
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
this bill is is not a good idea there's
 
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
nothing in this packet that that says
 
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:30.680 align:start position:0%
that this would open up the state of New
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to Legal threat if we pass
 
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
this this bill um this is basically um a
 
00:09:39.069 --> 00:09:39.079 align:start position:0%
survey of of State statutes across the
 
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:42.440 align:start position:0%
country uh Most states are are like New
 
00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:45.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so we've got restrictions on
 
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
employment opportunities for registered
 
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
sex offenders and they basically all are
 
00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire right so it's for
 
00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:54.839 align:start position:0%
School Employees it's for people
 
00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
volunteering at uh organizations that
 
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
provide uh Direct services to
 
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
miners and we already have that on the
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
books that's well established the
 
00:10:07.069 --> 00:10:07.079 align:start position:0%
loophole that we are trying to close in
 
00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:10.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law is the loophole that
 
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:13.720 align:start position:0%
allows a convicted sex offender to be
 
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
the the direct supervisor the direct
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
management uh over a minor
 
00:10:23.949 --> 00:10:23.959 align:start position:0%
child or to to employ directly employ
 
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
minor minor children it it puts the kids
 
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
at risk it puts the registered sex
 
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
offender at risk and so this closes that
 
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
loophole I think we did the right thing
 
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
last year and I would encourage the
 
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
committee to do uh the right thing again
 
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
this year and I will go to the Senate
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
and uh review this packet with them and
 
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
say there's there's nothing here that
 
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
that causes us us
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
issues so from from my my point of view
 
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
nothing has changed I would ask the
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
committee to uh again recommend this
 
00:11:00.509 --> 00:11:00.519 align:start position:0%
thought to pass and we pass it through
 
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
the house and and and take it up with
 
00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.430 align:start position:0%
the house and and and take it up with
the

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
Senate thank you representative um the
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
bill that passed the house last year was
 
00:11:13.949 --> 00:11:13.959 align:start position:0%
amended is is this the amended version
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
or is this the original bill you filed
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
last year that should be the amended
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
version I requested through OSS that
 
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
they pass the that they they reissue the
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
the amended version that we passed
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
through the house okay because um
 
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
several people have pointed to me that
 
00:11:29.069 --> 00:11:29.079 align:start position:0%
this is the original not the amended so
 
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
want to make sure if if that is the case
 
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:35.240 align:start position:0%
that that is an error um and so I can
 
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:37.160 align:start position:0%
certainly double check that what I what
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
I am requesting is that we um pass the
 
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
the bill that the house passed so if if
 
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
OS gave me the original language I
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
apologize um it would have been a
 
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:49.720 align:start position:0%
miscommunication between them and I and
 
00:11:51.389 --> 00:11:51.399 align:start position:0%
so uh if somebody would file an
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
amendment to make it the amended version
 
00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
I would be obliged thank you
 
00:11:59.110 --> 00:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
um uh Mr chairman if I could just just
 
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
say one other thing you know one of the
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
big um issues with this bill is the
 
00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
potential that you know we're not going
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
to make any employment opportunities
 
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
available to registered sex offenders
 
00:12:11.629 --> 00:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
and I I would contend that this bill
 
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
does not do that and I would remind the
 
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
committee that New Hampshire uh it
 
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
continues with uh the lowest
 
00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate in the nation if not
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
one of the lowest so if we're not the
 
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
lowest we're we're very very close uh so
 
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:27.560 align:start position:0%
there there is a plethora of job
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities out there for for
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
everybody thank you um representative
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
Manning did you want to add some clarity
 
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
to that question I had yes thank you Mr
 
00:12:39.069 --> 00:12:39.079 align:start position:0%
chair um so I'm holding the bill that
 
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
you filed which I looked up is the it
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
appears to be the original bill you
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
filed last year I also have a copy of
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
amendment number 2023 0586 that I
 
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
believe is the amendment that we worked
 
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
on in subcommittee that's that's
 
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
different than what you are proposing
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
Then I then I apologize that was an
 
00:12:58.990 --> 00:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
oversight on my part and probably a
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
communication from OS I what I want is
 
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
what we passed last year so if that if
 
00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:06.279 align:start position:0%
that's not that I apologize I I'll take
 
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
ownership for that that oversight I want
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
to pass what we amended and pass last
 
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
year that's what I'm asking and that's
 
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
what I'm I'm asking you that's the one
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
you that is what I yeah because that's
 
00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:16.839 align:start position:0%
what we all agreed on um and and so
 
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
that's and I if that's not what you have
 
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
then I apologize that I want to pass
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
what we passed before can you tell us if
 
00:13:25.949 --> 00:13:25.959 align:start position:0%
you recall um what the change was the
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
amendment did to the bill if you don't
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
recall that's okay we can work it out so
 
00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:32.839 align:start position:0%
I I don't I don't recall the particular
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
details um there there was there was
 
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
just some language reworking um and it
 
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
it basically brought um the opposition
 
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
and the proponents of the original bill
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
um together with language that we could
 
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
all all support there was nothing
 
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
controversial um in the in the amendment
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
that we passed last year and I I think
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
that it it fully accomplishes what we're
 
00:13:58.509 --> 00:13:58.519 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish thank you I'm I'll
 
00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:00.519 align:start position:0%

Murray thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:14:24.189 --> 00:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
um for taking my question you um just
 
00:14:27.629 --> 00:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
kind of referred a couple times to um
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
potential issues the Senate saw in their
 
00:14:31.629 --> 00:14:31.639 align:start position:0%
research I I'm just curious if you've
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
heard like concerns from them um that we
 
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
should be aware of in moving the bill
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
forward thank thank you for the question
 
00:14:41.749 --> 00:14:41.759 align:start position:0%
um so if that's if that was your
 
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
takeaway then then I apologize because I
 
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
didn't communicate clearly so my
 
00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:49.240 align:start position:0%
understanding in talking with the the
 
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
chairwoman from the committee on the
 
00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:53.720 align:start position:0%
Senate was that their
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
committee wanted to get more information
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
on a nation scale relative to these
 
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
types of of laws to compare it to what
 
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
we're proposing to make sure um some
 
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
other state hadn't tried the same thing
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
and and found themselves in in trouble
 
00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
with with the the Judiciary Branch um
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
because of it so you'll and the
 
00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
Chairman's already sent it out this
 
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
morning so you'll receive the packet
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
it's not that daunting most of these
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
Pages have no no words on them um I've
 
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
reviewed this there the no by the the
 
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
other states um the the other states
 
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.350 align:start position:0%
other states um the the other states
have

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:36.839 align:start position:0%
never our law with this law when when we
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
pass it will make uh New Hampshire
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
uniquely restrictive in that we will
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
have um codified in law that you cannot
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
be the the direct manager the direct
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
supervisor of a minor child if you are a
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
registered sex offender um that's that's
 
00:15:55.309 --> 00:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
the loophole that we're trying to close
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
we all agreed on um and so they they
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
didn't have this in a timely fashion to
 
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
be able to to work it through their
 
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
system so they that's why they voted for
 
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
uh interm study so that I could refile
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
look through the packet make sure
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
there's nothing wrong so to the to the
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
best of my knowledge um this should go
 
00:16:16.829 --> 00:16:16.839 align:start position:0%
through this time thank you for the
 
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:19.240 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
Newman this I make a question to
 
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
representative Manion about the
 
00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
amendment that he has whether it was a
 
00:16:30.749 --> 00:16:30.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959 align:start position:0%
2023 this is the amendment we got out of
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
our subcommittee last year okay and a
 
00:16:37.309 --> 00:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
question to the chair may maybe if we
 
00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
could just make a copy of that for some
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
sort of reference we could have get to
 
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
comparing the two things earlier make
 
00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
make it easier yeah that's I'm going to
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
have um I'm going to have the the that
 
00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:51.880 align:start position:0%
version sent to everybody um I don't
 
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
think that um I don't think that we need
 
00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:57.160 align:start position:0%
it for questions at this point because
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
the changes um
 
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
and representa Manny perhaps you can
 
00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
speak to the changes you were on the
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee yes so if I remember
 
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.079 align:start position:0%
correctly there was some issues that
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn had with I believe
 
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
the owners being on the employer not the
 
00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
employee there is a long list of um jobs
 
00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
if you will or employer types um and if
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
you remember last year when
 
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
representative Muse mentioned the
 
00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
longest sentence in a bill that's what
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
this was there's a list of uh so it kind
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
of narrows it down to just these these
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
items it was so if I remember all of the
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
questions or concerns that
 
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn had were met they
 
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
worked on this together in this amended
 
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
version and that's the one we passed
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
through the house so thank you for for
 
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
the sake of um brevity like I said I'll
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
make sure everybody gets it I'll ask um
 
00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:47.799 align:start position:0%

what we originally came to testify on um
 
00:19:02.909 --> 00:19:02.919 align:start position:0%
we believed was the unamended version so
 
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
the amended version that went through
 
00:19:06.149 --> 00:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee process we're we're
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%

here uh no it was just clearing up our
 
00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:17.559 align:start position:0%
primary concern was clearing up direct
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
service to miners that was in the
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
original but the amended version does
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%

00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
version uh we're going to remain neutral
 
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:02.039 align:start position:0%
on that so

committee I am proud to sponsor hb24
 
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
this bill concerns the so-called Open
 
00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
Fields Doctrine uh which allows
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
officials in our case it's New Hampshire
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
officials to enter and conduct
 
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
warrantless searches of private land
 
00:32:31.389 --> 00:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
Beyond what's known as the curtilage
 
00:32:34.269 --> 00:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
immediately surrounding the home uh the
 
00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:35.720 align:start position:0%
vast majority of private land in New
 
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is subject to the Open Fields
 
00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
doctrine that means that government
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
officials currently can decide to enter
 
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
someone's private land whenever they
 
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
want for whatever reason they want even
 
00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:47.240 align:start position:0%
when the property owners uh who desire
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
security and privacy put up fences or no
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
trespassing signs and
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
Gates HB 1204 would help fix this
 
00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
situation and better protect our
 
00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
property rights under it land owners can
 
00:32:59.549 --> 00:32:59.559 align:start position:0%
make their property eligible for
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
protection against warrantless searches
 
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
by posting no trespassing signs or
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
similar marks of ownership if they do
 
00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
then hb24 would require virtually all
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
government officials to either get a
 
00:33:11.549 --> 00:33:11.559 align:start position:0%
warrant or get the owner's permission
 
00:33:12.909 --> 00:33:12.919 align:start position:0%
before they enter the
 
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
property this is not though applying to
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
anybody who needs to enter the property
 
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
because of a 911 call or probable cause
 
00:33:23.389 --> 00:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
that there's a an immediate need for
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
services or help that is addressed in
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
the bill and Exempted
 
00:33:30.629 --> 00:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
those actions are protected so that the
 
00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
you're not stopping emergency response
 
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
at all it's just saying that without
 
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
permission from the landowner or a
 
00:33:40.029 --> 00:33:40.039 align:start position:0%
warrant you can't just wander into
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
people's woods and Fields and whatnot
 
00:33:46.269 --> 00:33:46.279 align:start position:0%
uh for no reason at all they have to
 
00:33:48.029 --> 00:33:48.039 align:start position:0%
have a reason and get a warrant or they
 
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
have to get permission from the
 
00:33:52.509 --> 00:33:52.519 align:start position:0%
landowner overall hb24 seeks to restore
 
00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:53.919 align:start position:0%
balance and ensure that land owners in
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have the necess necessary
 
00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
protections against unwarranted
 
00:33:58.909 --> 00:33:58.919 align:start position:0%
government intrusion on their
 
00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:01.720 align:start position:0%
property and I can take some simple
 
00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
questions but I can tell you that I've
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
got somebody that can answer a lot more
 
00:34:07.069 --> 00:34:07.079 align:start position:0%
questions in depth from a legal
 
00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:09.800 align:start position:0%
standpoint that can also
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
testify um just if you could what did
 
00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
something occur to to cause you to want
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
to sponsor this bill no no single action
 
00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
but there has been court case perhaps
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
this this has been getting uh passed in
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
in uh several States as the situation
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
has become uh known in other states and
 
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how many exactly but I can
 
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
tell you that uh for example Vermont has
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
never allowed Open Fields they've always
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:44.109 --> 00:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
rights represent
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
PR so I know as a firefighter right now
 
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
there's an RSA if I suspect that there's
 
00:34:51.069 --> 00:34:51.079 align:start position:0%
a fire on someone's land I have the
 
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
ability to go look for it you could
 
00:34:56.349 --> 00:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
still do that even if it's just a legal
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
burning some somebody burning in a in a
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
can or something all right that's
 
00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:03.880 align:start position:0%
protected under a probable reason to
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:11.720 align:start position:0%
you represent Manion thank you Mr chair
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question as
 
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
far as the body Camera Part goes there's
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
already an RSA that covers body cameras
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
that I believe um is is similar to that
 
00:35:22.349 --> 00:35:22.359 align:start position:0%
but there might be exceptions that are
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
in the body camera Bill law I mean that
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
might conflict with that so should that
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
be better left just to that RSA or I
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
would entertain comparisons and and make
 
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
sure that it aligns but I trusted OSS to
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that these line up okay thank
 
00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
you as as we've already experienced this
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
morning that could be a questional
 
00:35:47.069 --> 00:35:47.079 align:start position:0%
decision that's why I I gave that caveat
 
00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:48.839 align:start position:0%
that uh I would ask that you um take a
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
moment and just call up that RSA just to
 
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
compare so if we need to get because
 
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:54.280 align:start position:0%
we're executing this Friday if we need
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
to amend something we we need to do it
 
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
pretty quick I will I will make that
 
00:35:59.790 --> 00:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
comparison for you thank you um no
 
00:36:04.109 --> 00:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:19.839 align:start position:0%
frer okay not used to that thank you Mr
 
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee my name
 
00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:23.720 align:start position:0%
is Robert fer I'm a senior Attorney At
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
The Institute for justice and I'm the
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
director of the stute for Justice's
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
project on the fourth amendment and I
 
00:36:33.309 --> 00:36:33.319 align:start position:0%
came up to express our support my
 
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:35.800 align:start position:0%
support for hb1 124 for really two
 
00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
reasons the first one is that it's
 
00:36:40.109 --> 00:36:40.119 align:start position:0%
important to understand what Open Fields
 
00:36:42.309 --> 00:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
Doctrine is this is a creation about 100
 
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
years ago out of whole cloth by the
 
00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
United States Supreme Court in one two
 
00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph case they say no private land
 
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
outside the immediate area around your
 
00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:52.359 align:start position:0%
home gets any protection whatso all
 
00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
under the Fourth Amendment and as a
 
00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
result in many States the vast majority
 
00:36:59.910 --> 00:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
of land is unprotected here in New
 
00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's 3 roughly 3.6 million
 
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
Acres of private land 91% of it gets no
 
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
protection whatsoever from from entries
 
00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
and what that means and I've litigated
 
00:37:14.829 --> 00:37:14.839 align:start position:0%
these cases across the country I've
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
interviewed uh law enforcement officials
 
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
other officials who will come on
 
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
property not because they suspect
 
00:37:23.069 --> 00:37:23.079 align:start position:0%
anything not because they think there's
 
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
say anything wrong but just to see
 
00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
what's going on they call it patrolling
 
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
uh they'll uh in many of my cases and
 
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
several of my cases not they haven't
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
just walked on themselves but they've
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
installed cameras you know for the
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
remote snooping where it would feed back
 
00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
to them so they'd have a 247 view of
 
00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
what was going on and in one case they
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
did even more than that they actually
 
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
went in and stole my client's camera and
 
00:37:50.109 --> 00:37:50.119 align:start position:0%
then opened it up to see what they could
 
00:37:52.309 --> 00:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
find over and over again I've heard from
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
public officials that when with regards
 
00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
to Open Fields Doctrine they really
 
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
don't make any difference
 
00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh distinction between public and
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
private land and we've seen that over
 
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
and over the country and that's why hb24
 
00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
is so important uh this bill is a modest
 
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
bill that is simply trying to empower
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents to reclaim their
 
00:38:17.109 --> 00:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
security in their premises as the bill
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
notes you know all of what people
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
private land owners have to do is put up
 
00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
fences or sign no trespassing signs
 
00:38:26.589 --> 00:38:26.599 align:start position:0%
there's a number of different ways to
 
00:38:30.309 --> 00:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
Bill allows for them to express that
 
00:38:32.109 --> 00:38:32.119 align:start position:0%
they want to keep their pri property
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
private and when they do that and of
 
00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:37.079 align:start position:0%
course some won't some will but if they
 
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
do what that means is that uh the
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
majority of the vast majority of public
 
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:45.560 align:start position:0%
officials will have to either have get
 
00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:48.200 align:start position:0%
permission to come on the property get a
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
real warrant from a real judge or have a
 
00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:54.200 align:start position:0%
real emergency uh like that's going on
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
an exigent circumstance we call it under
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
the law
 
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
now this is pretty modest uh a number of
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
states across the United States have
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
rejected the open field Doctrine uh uh
 
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:07.640 align:start position:0%
the representative mentioned probably
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
the most applicable one Vermont Vermont
 
00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079 align:start position:0%
wholly rejected the Open Fields Doctrine
 
00:39:13.079 --> 00:39:14.270 align:start position:0%
wholly rejected the Open Fields Doctrine
in

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
1991 came back in 2018 and said again no
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
we really mean it private land means
 
00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
private if you want to go on it get a
 
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
warrant and you know I don't think that
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire view their
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
property rights as any less important
 
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
than the people of Vermont or the people
 
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
of New York who also have rejected the
 
00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
Open Fields Doctrine and your
 
00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
constitutions look almost exact exactly
 
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
the same they say they protect
 
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
possessions and land is a
 
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
possession so Washington Oregon Montana
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
Mississippi New York Vermont Tennessee
 
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
all these states have rejected the Open
 
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
Fields Doctrine and we think this is a
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
this 124 is a modest step towards
 
00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
improving the security and property
 
00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
rights of ordinary New Hampshire that's
 
00:40:02.829 --> 00:40:02.839 align:start position:0%
why we support it but I off uh happy to
 
00:40:04.589 --> 00:40:04.599 align:start position:0%
take any questions anyone the committee
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
might have thank you so for
 
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
clarification it seems to me what this
 
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
does is it basically treats all of your
 
00:40:15.069 --> 00:40:15.079 align:start position:0%
property as your house with regard to
 
00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
your privacy um so in other words unless
 
00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
there's exent circumstances police can't
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
come into your house unless invited with
 
00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:23.720 align:start position:0%
a warrant the same would then apply to
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
your property if you post it if you
 
00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
leave it alone that's your risk to do is
 
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
that clear is that that's exactly right
 
00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
and that's the way it is in that's the
 
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
way it used to be before uh the Supreme
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
Court issued its decision and it's in
 
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:39.640 align:start position:0%
fact the exact same way in like every
 
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:41.720 align:start position:0%
other similar country you know we're
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
similar to England in Australia New
 
00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:45.160 align:start position:0%
Zealand none of them have the Open
 
00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:47.079 align:start position:0%
Fields Doctrine we're sort of a unique
 
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
aberration That Way NE Hampshire uses um
 
00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
appraisers every so many years to
 
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
appraise people's property would this
 
00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:55.880 align:start position:0%
stop them from coming and doing their
 
00:40:58.589 --> 00:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
job would they are they going onto
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
people's private onto the private
 
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
property in order to conduct the
 
00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
assessment yes uh if they get the
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
consent of the of the property owner as
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
part of the appraisal process I think
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
there's probably abilities to condition
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
get you know if you give consent to do
 
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
the appraisal we'll be able to then do
 
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
the appraisal and it would be more
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
accurate than if we're not allowed
 
00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
access to the property in which case
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
your your appraisal might be higher uh I
 
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
think we're going to have to check we
 
00:41:26.349 --> 00:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
may have a conflict in statute if if
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
people are mandated to I tell you
 
00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:29.480 align:start position:0%
something about that I'll let you come
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
up in a second then okay um we'll leave
 
00:41:33.309 --> 00:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
that one for him to answer and we'll
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
check um my last question is regarding
 
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
um what about drones now you you're
 
00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
protecting the the four corners of the
 
00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
property but what about the airspace
 
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
above it that's a fascinating uh
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
question chair because uh I just had a
 
00:41:49.309 --> 00:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
case before the Michigan Supreme Court
 
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh two months ago uh it's the first uh
 
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
Court in the country to consider whether
 
00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:55.640 align:start position:0%
flying a drone over someone's property
 
00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
is a Sur SE under the under either the
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
Fourth Amendment or the state analog I
 
00:42:03.069 --> 00:42:03.079 align:start position:0%
think it obviously is it's invading your
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
you could look at it from one to two
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
ways from sense of property rights it's
 
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
coming right over your property it's
 
00:42:10.349 --> 00:42:10.359 align:start position:0%
searching your property from inv from a
 
00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
privacy standpoint it's looking at your
 
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
backyard it's looking the inside of your
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
house ultimately it's the government
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
using a technology to try to acquire
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
information and I would argue that when
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's doing that that has to be subject
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
to Fourth Amendment constraint
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
and that means generally unless there's
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
an emergency or someone consents that
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
you go get a
 
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
warrant but I don't but I don't think
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
that this bill directly addresses that
 
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
because this is this is specifically
 
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
about physical entries by agents
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
themselves and not about the use of
 
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
technology so I don't know I don't think
 
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
this is directly applicable to that
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
particular issue okay my concern is if
 
00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
we decided to pass this an agent could
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
walk right up to the property line float
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
the Drone they don't cross the line and
 
00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
and they could fly 6 ft off the ground
 
00:42:59.549 --> 00:42:59.559 align:start position:0%
all through the properly and that
 
00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
defeats the bill well I that that is a
 
00:43:05.309 --> 00:43:05.319 align:start position:0%
very fair concern and you know if if the
 
00:43:09.549 --> 00:43:09.559 align:start position:0%
committee wanted to uh amend this so as
 
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
to prohibit the use of Michigan for
 
00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:15.640 align:start position:0%
instance has a statute that says uh
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
officials can't use a drone to do what
 
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
they couldn't do directly so they can't
 
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
since they can't walk on the on your
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
property directly they couldn't use a to
 
00:43:29.309 --> 00:43:29.319 align:start position:0%
S circuit that that's some kind of that
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
similar language could be here to uh
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
protect against that uh loophole yeah
 
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
that that might be a that might be a a
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
too big a bite um I think that A
 
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
legislature is going to have to examine
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
how high above your property is is your
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
airspace because frankly where I live um
 
00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
planes going to Manchester fly right
 
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
over my house every day is that my
 
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
airspace I mean what who know chair I I
 
00:43:56.589 --> 00:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
could give you I I I know you need to
 
00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
move things forward give you a
 
00:43:59.950 --> 00:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
fascinating multi-hour discussion about
 
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
this this I would be interest going
 
00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
forward too because it is it's growing
 
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
faster than we can legislate it and um
 
00:44:08.589 --> 00:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
people's rights are people's rights
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
exactly um all right uh further
 
00:44:12.589 --> 00:44:12.599 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
rhs thank you Mr chairman I I just need
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
some clarification sure when when you
 
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
were given your example you had said
 
00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:24.839 align:start position:0%
real war real warrants from real judges
 
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
yes what other kind of warrant and
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
judges are there oh no I mean but what I
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
mean by that is oftentimes we'll see
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh Court uh statutes say things like
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
court orders or subpoenas and what I
 
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
mean here and the language in the bill
 
00:44:44.549 --> 00:44:44.559 align:start position:0%
uh handles this pretty well uh the the
 
00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
definition of Warrant here talks about
 
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
uh a court order authorizing a search or
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
seizure that's supported by
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
individualized probable cause and issued
 
00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
by a judge that's what I meant by it not
 
00:44:58.990 --> 00:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
a subpoena where often times uh
 
00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
prosecutors can themselves write their
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
own subpoenas so you wouldn't want to
 
00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
have a situation where oh we want to
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
protect private land but if the officer
 
00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
just writes a form fills out a form
 
00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:12.200 align:start position:0%
saying he now has the power that sort of
 
00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
defeats it so that's what I was talking
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
about represent
 
00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
PR uh when I was up in
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
Edna we had a bunch of bills come in for
 
00:45:28.589 --> 00:45:28.599 align:start position:0%
drones um uh and I know there is some
 
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
protections already in place on what law
 
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement can and cannot do with
 
00:45:40.589 --> 00:45:40.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
warrant represent Stone thank you Mr
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:45:47.549 --> 00:45:47.559 align:start position:0%
in regards to this bill I like majority
 
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
of it I do have concerns with running uh
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
art section five if section five was to
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
be removed how problematic would that be
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
moving the bill forward did you State
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
for the committee what section five uh
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
section five is the government agent
 
00:46:02.549 --> 00:46:02.559 align:start position:0%
equipped with a body warn camera while
 
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
entering a secured premise the camera
 
00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
must be activated recording the entire
 
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
time the agent is on the premise and
 
00:46:11.069 --> 00:46:11.079 align:start position:0%
basically my concern is same as
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative Manion we have a section
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
that deals with that specifically and it
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
might be cleaner to leave that section
 
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
out of the bill I I don't think that's a
 
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
material portion of the of the of this
 
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
legislation I think it's much better to
 
00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
harmonize uh this with the existing
 
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
legislation rather than create a
 
00:46:30.109 --> 00:46:30.119 align:start position:0%
conflict so if removing this would
 
00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:32.680 align:start position:0%
resolve that a potential conflict i' I'd
 
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
recommend that I would see that as being
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
a much cleaner Avenue to go down thank
 
00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
you um representative
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
Muse thanks for taking my question in in
 
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
your opinion is there a difference
 
00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:47.720 align:start position:0%
between a law enforcement officer
 
00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:50.079 align:start position:0%
wandering around on your property
 
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
Uninvited and a hunter wandering around
 
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
on your property uninvited
 
00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
No in fact in
 
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
well no and yes no in the sense that
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
they're both trespassing you know the
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
property law is pretty clear if if I
 
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
don't have consent to enter and I do
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
that I'm trespassing doesn't matter what
 
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
hat I'm wearing I will say it's
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
different though because an ordinary
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
citizen doesn't possess the unique
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
powers of the state they you know they
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
can't they can't search they can't
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
initiate criminal proceedings they can't
 
00:47:28.349 --> 00:47:28.359 align:start position:0%
arrest you can't you know legally shoot
 
00:47:31.589 --> 00:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
you so like there's a unique while
 
00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
privacy is important I think the
 
00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
important thing is that people need to
 
00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
feel secure on their property uh against
 
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
unwarranted government interventions I
 
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
agree with you that trespass is a
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
problem no matter what it is but when
 
00:47:47.069 --> 00:47:47.079 align:start position:0%
it's an armed agent in the state that
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
that perks my ears up just a little bit
 
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
more thank you uh representative m is
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
referring to another bill that we dealt
 
00:47:55.349 --> 00:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
with last week with the hunting question
 
00:47:58.750 --> 00:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
um in to be clear both bills say you
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
have to post your land so if you post no
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
trespassing you could be a hunter a
 
00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:06.839 align:start position:0%
police officer um a Spaceman in this
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
bill you cannot trespass yeah and that's
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
why I found so uh useful about the the
 
00:48:14.549 --> 00:48:14.559 align:start position:0%
concept of secured premises that was
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
already in New Hampshire law and it
 
00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
seemed like that was a an obvious way to
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
make that distinct uh
 
00:48:22.829 --> 00:48:22.839 align:start position:0%
distinction represent
 
00:48:26.109 --> 00:48:26.119 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you mentioned in
 
00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:31.880 align:start position:0%
your testimony that there was a Supreme
 
00:48:35.109 --> 00:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
Court ruling that Open Fields
 
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
yes met the the requirements of the
 
00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
fourth amendment I believe I'm adding
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
that um what's the what's the status of
 
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:46.040 align:start position:0%
that case was that case overturned and
 
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
does it conflict with this in any way
 
00:48:50.309 --> 00:48:50.319 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is not overturned it was
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
it was started in 1924 the case is
 
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
called Hester versus United States so
 
00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
we're on its 100th year anniversary
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I'm having a celebration
 
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
this uh spring we're running having a
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
conference to talk about the uh Open
 
00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
Fields Doctrine and uh the various
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
problems with it but what states have
 
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
done a number of states like Tennessee
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
Mississippi uh Vermont they said well we
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
don't really care what the people in d
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
what the people in the Supreme Court say
 
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
you know we have our own Constitution
 
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
and it means what we think it means and
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
we know our people wanted to have this
 
00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:26.680 align:start position:0%
kind of protection and so they rejected
 
00:49:29.549 --> 00:49:29.559 align:start position:0%
under their state
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
constitutions follow follow
 
00:49:35.549 --> 00:49:35.559 align:start position:0%
up so if we pass if this state were to
 
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
pass that law they would be making would
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
have to make the same assumption that
 
00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
they just don't have to pay attention to
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
what yeah the what I'm a little bit
 
00:49:47.549 --> 00:49:47.559 align:start position:0%
confused about that okay sure yeah what
 
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
so there's the United States
 
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution which handles Federal
 
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
officials and stuff like that
 
00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
but the New Hampshire uh Supreme court
 
00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
is the ultimate Arbiter of the New
 
00:49:59.069 --> 00:49:59.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution and it is
 
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
separate and distinct and even if the
 
00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:03.640 align:start position:0%
fourth amendment allows Federal officers
 
00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
to do something like the Open Fields
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
Doctrine you all have the power to say
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
as a matter of state law or the State
 
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
Constitution that no our state officials
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
can't do that so that's what that's why
 
00:50:17.789 --> 00:50:17.799 align:start position:0%
I'm saying that the fact that the Hester
 
00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
decision from 1924 is still on the books
 
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't prevent State legislatures like
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
yourselves from saying that is too far
 
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
that is too low a floor that is not I
 
00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:31.240 align:start position:0%
disagree with that holding I think that
 
00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
is wrong I think is bad for property
 
00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
rights and I'm going to do something
 
00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:37.480 align:start position:0%
more and you are perfectly entitled to
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
do that under the both under the
 
00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
Constitution and under
 
00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you so for
 
00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
clarification now um a a New Hampshire
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
officer could have or ask a Federal
 
00:50:55.549 --> 00:50:55.559 align:start position:0%
Officer to look at something for them
 
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't stop them because this
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
would only prohibit New Hampshire law
 
00:51:00.829 --> 00:51:00.839 align:start position:0%
enforcement is that your position I
 
00:51:02.829 --> 00:51:02.839 align:start position:0%
think that that would get into a if
 
00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
you're having actor of the state type of
 
00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
thing I I think I think I think you
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
would run in I think that would be an
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
attempt to make an end run around this I
 
00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%
think it would end up being a very
 
00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:15.640 align:start position:0%
contested legal issue about whether the
 
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
Federal Officer was really exercising
 
00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
his own independent Authority or if he's
 
00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
just acting as an agent of the state
 
00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:23.349 align:start position:0%
just acting as an agent of the state
okay

00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
oh actually I I had one the the Supreme
 
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
Court has narrowed the Open Fields
 
00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:35.240 align:start position:0%
Doctrine a bit though haven't they isn't
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
it true that they've extended the
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
curtilage a little bit to places that
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
people routinely use for example if you
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
have a shed that's 50 m back in your
 
00:51:46.829 --> 00:51:46.839 align:start position:0%
yard that really wouldn't be in the
 
00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
curtilage but if you use it and have an
 
00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
expectation of pracy have they not
 
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
extended that yeah the problem there
 
00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
have been some of that and it's very
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
Case by case specific specific the
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
problem is is
 
00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:00.440 align:start position:0%
that it leads into because this
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable pardon me this reasonable
 
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:03.640 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy oh it's this
 
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
balancing test right it's like oh well
 
00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
what's reasonable and it's often very
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
fact specific and it's
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
often there's no certainty there's no
 
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
certainty with it you simply don't know
 
00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
because there are courts that have said
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
yes that's that would be a search
 
00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:20.200 align:start position:0%
despite the Open Fields Doctrine there
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
have been other courts that have said no
 
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
that's not a search because the Open
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
Fields doctrine that that kind of of
 
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
wishy-washy judicial decision making
 
00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:30.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't provide people the security they
 
00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
need and that's why I think this
 
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
legislation is so important just says
 
00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
that in no UNC terms if you want to go
 
00:52:36.349 --> 00:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
on people's land get their permission or
 
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
go get a warrant thank you uh one more
 
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
question representative Newman yeah just
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
just following up on your question
 
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that more or less be your
 
00:52:47.069 --> 00:52:47.079 align:start position:0%
curtilage would that not fall within the
 
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
curtilage what you just explained just
 
00:52:50.789 --> 00:52:50.799 align:start position:0%
well that's that's literally what they
 
00:52:53.069 --> 00:52:53.079 align:start position:0%
say like oh well if it's a barn but if
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's closely associated with the things
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
you do then maybe it's part of the
 
00:52:59.549 --> 00:52:59.559 align:start position:0%
curtilage but you never know ahead of
 
00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
time what a Court's going to say you can
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
never feel secure on your property
 
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
because you don't you don't know if the
 
00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
officer is going to think oh that's
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
kurage I can't go there and you don't
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
know if the court down the afterwards is
 
00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
going to say it's curtilage or not so
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
there's no certainty and that's why this
 
00:53:18.349 --> 00:53:18.359 align:start position:0%
legislation provides that security
 
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
because it just says very
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
clearly you post your land your land is
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
your land is secure go get a permission
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
go get permission or a warrant you don't
 
00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
have to play any guessing games like you
 
00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
do with current Fourth Amendment
 
00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
Doctrine thank
 
00:53:35.109 --> 00:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
you see you no further questions oh
 
00:53:35.119 --> 00:53:36.750 align:start position:0%
you see you no further questions oh
representative

00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
scitec I'm wondering whether we should
 
00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
wait for the court to come in are New
 
00:53:43.109 --> 00:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court come in on this
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
and here's what I'm thinking uh we have
 
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:49.240 align:start position:0%
a constitutional right to privacy can
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
can you if there were such a warrantless
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
entry and some action resulted from that
 
00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
warrantless entry could the land owner
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
go to the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
and say I have the reasonable right to
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
privacy or my property I don't need this
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
law sorry I apologize for uh talking I
 
00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
that is possible that could happen I
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
will be honest the reason this Doctrine
 
00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:17.720 align:start position:0%
has stuck around for so long is that
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
most of the time people don't do that uh
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
they don't uh press the legal issue but
 
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
there's nothing about
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh there's nothing about the new H uh
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court that should
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
give this body any pause about whether
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
to act whether it is forbade as a matter
 
00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
whether entries onto the Open Fields is
 
00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
forbade as a matter of New Hampshire
 
00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
constitutional law is a separate and
 
00:54:46.349 --> 00:54:46.359 align:start position:0%
distinct question from whether this body
 
00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:48.200 align:start position:0%
thinks as a matter of
 
00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:51.640 align:start position:0%
policy it is a bad idea to let officers
 
00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
roam wild over private land this body
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
has the power to fix that now and I
 
00:54:59.549 --> 00:54:59.559 align:start position:0%
would suggest taking that step now
 
00:55:02.109 --> 00:55:02.119 align:start position:0%
rather than kicking the can and hoping
 
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:03.880 align:start position:0%
that maybe years down the line maybe
 
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
somebody will challenge this issue while
 
00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
all the while real uh New Hampshire
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
residents are still suffering from the
 
00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:13.720 align:start position:0%
loss of their property
 
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
rights I believe the representative is
 
00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:19.640 align:start position:0%
referring to a uh a recent adoption to
 
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
our constitution regarding privacy
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
rights however we still have in our
 
00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:25.839 align:start position:0%
constitution the equival of the Fourth
 
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment so would is is it not possible
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
that the court would see that as
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
separate and distinct from the search
 
00:55:32.029 --> 00:55:32.039 align:start position:0%
but since we already we didn't amend the
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
Fourth Amendment we we added this thing
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
yeah and I believe that's section 2B and
 
00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
I believe the search and seizure
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
provision is either section 19 or
 
00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
section 20 and from what I understand
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
about the the P the legislative history
 
00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:48.200 align:start position:0%
around Tob is that it was more about
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
informational privacy uh I think that
 
00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:53.839 align:start position:0%
the the art the search and seizure
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
provision of the New Hampshire
 
00:55:57.069 --> 00:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
Constitution which uses the term
 
00:55:59.630 --> 00:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
possessions which by all counts includes
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
land should already be doing this for
 
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens it's just not but
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
you guys don't have to you this
 
00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:09.400 align:start position:0%
committee doesn't have to wait years to
 
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
see what the court does you can take
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
action now to fix it represent Stone
 
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a two-part question the
 
00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:17.240 align:start position:0%
first part is in your opinion is New
 
00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire under law as well as New
 
00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution provide a higher
 
00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
bar for privacy interest in the state of
 
00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:22.990 align:start position:0%
bar for privacy interest in the state of
New

00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could you say that one more
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
time other words do we set uh privacy to
 
00:56:28.829 --> 00:56:28.839 align:start position:0%
be a higher bar for search and seizure
 
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire States um generally uh
 
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I would say generally not
 
00:56:37.549 --> 00:56:37.559 align:start position:0%
uh I believe that the New Hampshire
 
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
courts have I'd have to go do a deeper
 
00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
dive as matter of constitutional law I
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
think it's uh pretty much flattened to
 
00:56:46.589 --> 00:56:46.599 align:start position:0%
the Fourth Amendment standard that there
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
isn't a lot of there had this is an area
 
00:56:50.829 --> 00:56:50.839 align:start position:0%
where the uh Supreme Court should do
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
more work but right now I think it's
 
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
held the two to be at equivalent level
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
so I don't think there's greater
 
00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
protections well actually now that I say
 
00:57:02.829 --> 00:57:02.839 align:start position:0%
that I think the addition of 2B probably
 
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:05.240 align:start position:0%
provides a Judicial gloss that will lead
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
to Greater recognitions of privacy going
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
forward and second part of the question
 
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
is under this uh provision of this uh
 
00:57:16.109 --> 00:57:16.119 align:start position:0%
Bill if it was to pass nothing prevents
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
a police officer government agent from
 
00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
seeking out the addition of the premises
 
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
listed here in articulable suspicion
 
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
when seeking out a warrant
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
wait I'm I'm in other words you if you
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to do the field you'd have to
 
00:57:31.349 --> 00:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
articulate in the search Point why you
 
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to search the field you'd have to
 
00:57:36.829 --> 00:57:36.839 align:start position:0%
say uh yeah like if it was yeah you'd
 
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
have to say you'd have to do
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
investigation just like officers have to
 
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
do with crimes of all other sorts you
 
00:57:45.390 --> 00:57:45.400 align:start position:0%
know you'd have to provide you know when
 
00:57:47.309 --> 00:57:47.319 align:start position:0%
they want to get a warrant to go into a
 
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
house or to a business or anything like
 
00:57:50.349 --> 00:57:50.359 align:start position:0%
that they have to provide all the
 
00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
information Pro submit a warrant and you
 
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
get approval and that's all this bill is
 
00:57:57.549 --> 00:57:57.559 align:start position:0%
trying to say is let's make that across
 
00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
the board and let's include private land
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
in that as well thank you I for my
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
clarification I think what he's asking
 
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
is when you get a search War for
 
00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
someone's house you have to be specific
 
00:58:08.589 --> 00:58:08.599 align:start position:0%
as to where you want to search and for
 
00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
what items you want to search would this
 
00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:13.480 align:start position:0%
apply them to the open field I want to
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
search in the back 20 20 yards of the
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
property where I suspect there may be X
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
and that is what I'm looking for and
 
00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
that I want to search a search would
 
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't just say you have access to the
 
00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:25.240 align:start position:0%
property walk around
 
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
a core element of the Fourth Amendment
 
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
and the New Hampshire search and seizure
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
is that warrants have to be specific
 
00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:31.640 align:start position:0%
they're not supposed to leave discretion
 
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
to the officers and so yeah a warrant in
 
00:58:37.349 --> 00:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
this kind of situation would to the best
 
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
of your ability say I believe uh at this
 
00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:43.240 align:start position:0%
location on the property I I'll find
 
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
whatever okay representative M did you
 
00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
question I had a question about how
 
00:58:58.349 --> 00:58:58.359 align:start position:0%
we're protecting privacy in this bill if
 
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:00.839 align:start position:0%
we require a law enforcement officer to
 
00:59:02.589 --> 00:59:02.599 align:start position:0%
have his body camera on the whole time
 
00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:03.839 align:start position:0%
he's on the
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
property well that was mostly in the
 
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
instance well if if there's consent
 
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
right if there was consent then let me
 
00:59:13.309 --> 00:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
go back I think that was the part of the
 
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
bill that uh I think that was the part
 
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
five of the bill that was uh people were
 
00:59:20.789 --> 00:59:20.799 align:start position:0%
considering uh
 
00:59:20.799 --> 00:59:22.950 align:start position:0%
considering uh
rejecting

00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
rejecting
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh it well it's says if he's equipped
 
00:59:27.150 --> 00:59:27.160 align:start position:0%
with a Bor camera when entering a
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
secured premises so if he's there by
 
00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
consent then then the person's consented
 
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
so there's no privacy issue and if
 
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
they're there because of a warrant they
 
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
got a warrant then a neutral judge has
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
already decided that there is probable
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
cause of some violation of law occurring
 
00:59:47.029 --> 00:59:47.039 align:start position:0%
such that it's reasonable to infringe on
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
that privacy and
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
so I again I'm I think I'd be fine with
 
00:59:55.390 --> 00:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
Section Five being removed for the bill
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
and in sense of Harmony but uh I I don't
 
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
think it necessarily undercuts the idea
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
that people want security and privacy in
 
01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:05.240 align:start position:0%
their private
 
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
land followup
 
01:00:10.270 --> 01:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
followup what was the role of your
 
01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:13.160 align:start position:0%
organization in the drafting of the
 
01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
bill uh I helped draft the bill I helped
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
draft the bill uh I've spent years
 
01:00:23.789 --> 01:00:23.799 align:start position:0%
working on this sort of work uh I've
 
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
read the
 
01:00:27.309 --> 01:00:27.319 align:start position:0%
the legislation from across the country
 
01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:30.200 align:start position:0%
the court cases from across the country
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh expressed a desire
 
01:00:37.029 --> 01:00:37.039 align:start position:0%
uh to do something in this area and we
 
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
talked and I gave him some advice and we
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
helped him put this
 
01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
together thank
 
01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you trust me you're not alone
 
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.150 align:start position:0%
you thank you trust me you're not alone
representative

01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:00:51.029 --> 01:00:51.039 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you Mr
 
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
chairman would you believe that a person
 
01:00:58.109 --> 01:00:58.119 align:start position:0%
who has a warrant going on for their
 
01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:00.799 align:start position:0%
property would want whatever the police
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
are doing on that property to be filmed
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
so that they know what is happening for
 
01:01:10.349 --> 01:01:10.359 align:start position:0%
the police search and that might be why
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
the body camera pieces in there it's
 
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
possible I feel as if I'm in a cross
 
01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
conversation about this issue uh I can
 
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
see valid reasons both to not want the C
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
not want cameras but to want cameras uh
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
that that's fine we we'll we'll save
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
that for executive session okay uh
 
01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:31.799 align:start position:0%
representative uh Newman I just have a
 
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
question about the conversation that's
 
01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:37.960 align:start position:0%
going on H how does this Bill affect the
 
01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
the a person who is under investigation
 
01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
and doesn't know it and then the police
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
want to continue an investigation would
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
they be able to do do they have to
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
present a search warrant to work on any
 
01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
part of their land if if they're under
 
01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
investigation how does that all fit in
 
01:01:56.670 --> 01:01:56.680 align:start position:0%
with this so you're saying like this
 
01:01:59.670 --> 01:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
bill passes and then the police suspect
 
01:02:03.109 --> 01:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
somebody of something wrong and the
 
01:02:05.549 --> 01:02:05.559 align:start position:0%
question is can they enter the his land
 
01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
without a warrant no they would have to
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
either get his consent or a warrant the
 
01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
fact that he's under
 
01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
investigation uh I mean that's part of
 
01:02:15.789 --> 01:02:15.799 align:start position:0%
the investig getting a warrant is part
 
01:02:19.829 --> 01:02:19.839 align:start position:0%
of the investigatory process uh so I I'm
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
not sure I
 
01:02:25.269 --> 01:02:25.279 align:start position:0%
understand a question no that's
 
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
basically my question I mean I mean if
 
01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
you if you if you apply the same um
 
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
requirements for a search warrant when
 
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court court has already the
 
01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
reason it's called open field is you
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
don't have an expectation of privacy in
 
01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:43.240 align:start position:0%
an open field right that's what they
 
01:02:45.309 --> 01:02:45.319 align:start position:0%
said so so the Supreme Court has said
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
that you can't expect
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
privacy out away far away from where you
 
01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
where you live and there could be ille
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
legal activity out there
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
so and I don't know that much about
 
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
search warrants I don't know if a judge
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
could say and could override this Som I
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
don't know no well he could issue a
 
01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:09.160 align:start position:0%
regular warrant saying I think there's
 
01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:11.839 align:start position:0%
probably cause for you to enter but I'd
 
01:03:14.349 --> 01:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
point out that none of the other nations
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
with our similar history England
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
Australia New Zealand none none of them
 
01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:21.160 align:start position:0%
have this this was a constitutional
 
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
error by the Supreme Court that's
 
01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
existed for a hundred years to the
 
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
denigration of all of our property
 
01:03:29.029 --> 01:03:29.039 align:start position:0%
rights and that's why I've spent many
 
01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
many years of my life trying to fix this
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
and that's why I think this legislation
 
01:03:35.829 --> 01:03:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:43.269 --> 01:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.279 --> 01:03:54.829 align:start position:0%
 
Walsh

01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
Walsh
 
01:03:56.829 --> 01:03:56.839 align:start position:0%
good morning uh my name is uh Chief
 
01:03:58.510 --> 01:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
Kevin Walsh I the police chief of the
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
town of Ryan New Hampshire I started my
 
01:04:02.029 --> 01:04:02.039 align:start position:0%
career in law enforcement in New
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in 1987 and just to give a
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
brief outline the way New Hampshire does
 
01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
it a lot of areas around the country are
 
01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
going to start to follow which is all
 
01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
the police officers get trained at the
 
01:04:15.789 --> 01:04:15.799 align:start position:0%
same Academy that includes on search and
 
01:04:17.589 --> 01:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
seizure so back in
 
01:04:20.029 --> 01:04:20.039 align:start position:0%
1987 first day of class for search and
 
01:04:23.069 --> 01:04:23.079 align:start position:0%
seizure a person's property per person's
 
01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:26.039 align:start position:0%
home is there castle that's what all the
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
police officers in New Hampshire are
 
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
learning so when we see a sign for no
 
01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
trespassing and there is not exent
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances that requires a search
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
warrant some of the things I listened to
 
01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
in the testimony by the two gentlemen
 
01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
are not accurate with New Hampshire law
 
01:04:43.549 --> 01:04:43.559 align:start position:0%
enforcement that doesn't happen they're
 
01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
talking about things that happen in
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
other states in other states and now
 
01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
looking at New Hampshire law enforcement
 
01:04:50.829 --> 01:04:50.839 align:start position:0%
in our Academy and how we're training
 
01:04:53.069 --> 01:04:53.079 align:start position:0%
our officers and what we do I've been a
 
01:04:55.470 --> 01:04:55.480 align:start position:0%
police chief uh since 2006 so right
 
01:04:58.029 --> 01:04:58.039 align:start position:0%
around 16 years I've had some oversight
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
with different officers and different
 
01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances and the circumstances that
 
01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
these gentlemen are describing a search
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
warrant's already
 
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
required I I don't understand why this
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
bill is necessary our courts um as a
 
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
matter of fact do those rulings and take
 
01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
care of people's property and their
 
01:05:21.549 --> 01:05:21.559 align:start position:0%
persons specifically to make sure that
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
when law enforcement are doing these
 
01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
searches are accurate if isn't exent
 
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances there isn't evidence of a
 
01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
crime that isn't going to be destroyed
 
01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
prior to getting a warrant the other
 
01:05:35.069 --> 01:05:35.079 align:start position:0%
phrase I learned as a police officer in
 
01:05:38.269 --> 01:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
1987 when in doubt get a
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
warrant and that's what the officers are
 
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
trained to do at One Police Academy it's
 
01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
reinforced with policies and training uh
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
as you can see I am wearing a body War
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
camera our department just started that
 
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
we're about six to uh 7 months into the
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
program the body Waring camera is to be
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
worn we let people know that you're
 
01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
being audio and videotaped if we're
 
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
going into private homes for a call for
 
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
service other than a domestic violence
 
01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
or something that requires evidence
 
01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
evidentiary value we turn it off at the
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
homeowners request we let them know that
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
it's on so a medical Aid call I would go
 
01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
in I would let them know I'm wearing a
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
body War camera You' be an audio and
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
videotaped I would turn it off for their
 
01:06:22.589 --> 01:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
privacy again person's home is their
 
01:06:24.990 --> 01:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
Castle I have no business doing that
 
01:06:26.910 --> 01:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
unless I'm doing something specific of a
 
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
law enforcement reason to have the
 
01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799 align:start position:0%
camera on police officers in New
 
01:06:33.069 --> 01:06:33.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do respect people's property
 
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
and their
 
01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
person trust is the most valuable thing
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
you can ever earn and law enforcement
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
realizes that we're on a trust Mission
 
01:06:43.549 --> 01:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
we need to continue that bank account of
 
01:06:46.109 --> 01:06:46.119 align:start position:0%
trust the gentleman to my right when
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
they're talking they're talking about
 
01:06:50.349 --> 01:06:50.359 align:start position:0%
things in other states I'm confused it's
 
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
not happening here so why are we doing
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
this uh someone brought up
 
01:06:56.589 --> 01:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
is there a single instance in New
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that you're talking about they
 
01:06:58.559 --> 01:06:59.870 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that you're talking about they
said

01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
no I found that extremely compelling as
 
01:07:04.269 --> 01:07:04.279 align:start position:0%
to why this bill shouldn't even move
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
forward anymore and as far as a town
 
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
assessor yes they do go on properties
 
01:07:10.829 --> 01:07:10.839 align:start position:0%
and take a look at the curtilage uh
 
01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to be looking for required
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
permission if there's a no trespass and
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
sign it is my understanding the town's
 
01:07:18.829 --> 01:07:18.839 align:start position:0%
policy that hires a private company they
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
do not move forward till they get in
 
01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
contact with the property owner if there
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
is no sign they'll take a look outside
 
01:07:26.029 --> 01:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
the curtilage they will knock on the
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
door ring the doorbell to see if they
 
01:07:30.549 --> 01:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
can permission to to look in these are
 
01:07:32.789 --> 01:07:32.799 align:start position:0%
the practices and standards that we're
 
01:07:32.799 --> 01:07:33.670 align:start position:0%
the practices and standards that we're
already

01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
following so again I'm I have no idea
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
what these two gentlemen are talking
 
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
about I don't mean any disrespect to
 
01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:41.720 align:start position:0%
them but that's not what's going on in
 
01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:43.789 align:start position:0%
them but that's not what's going on in
New

01:07:43.789 --> 01:07:43.799 align:start position:0%
New
 
01:07:47.309 --> 01:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you Chief if if that's
 
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the Hampshire what
 
01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
would be the harm in passing this bill
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
if you're already doing it would it
 
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
would it impact you in a negative way or
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
law enforcement I think it would and
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
I'll give you a circumstance um I was a
 
01:08:03.069 --> 01:08:03.079 align:start position:0%
young officer we were call for a 911
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
call for a domestic I go out there was
 
01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
an apartment building for apartments not
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
a thing it's 1:00 in the morning we left
 
01:08:12.349 --> 01:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
because there was no obvious signs and
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
it says no trespassing so we don't go up
 
01:08:16.349 --> 01:08:16.359 align:start position:0%
on the porch and knock it on the doors
 
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
there was no other than the call we got
 
01:08:21.149 --> 01:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
called back a second time so that draws
 
01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
in the suspicion that something's going
 
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
on I have an officer dropped me off I
 
01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
stood at the side of the house out on
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
the public way on the sidewalk and
 
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
waited for the for the third call or
 
01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
what I heard was a domestic assault
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
going on or an assault inside the house
 
01:08:38.309 --> 01:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
I knocked on the door person came out
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
closed the door no need to go in
 
01:08:41.709 --> 01:08:41.719 align:start position:0%
everything's all set here officer I had
 
01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
to call the other units down we had to
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
make our way in and it was in fact a
 
01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
domestic assault that was
 
01:08:49.149 --> 01:08:49.159 align:start position:0%
ongoing those trespassing signs are
 
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
going to be a hindrance and prevent us
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
from doing our quality of of life to
 
01:08:57.669 --> 01:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
other people and and what I find most
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
disturbing about this is that there is
 
01:09:02.749 --> 01:09:02.759 align:start position:0%
not a single incidence that's specific
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire as to why we're putting
 
01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
this in our system already
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
works I I don't understand why this
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
would even move forward and it is going
 
01:09:12.749 --> 01:09:12.759 align:start position:0%
to be a hindrance to it because there's
 
01:09:14.749 --> 01:09:14.759 align:start position:0%
other levels they're talking about
 
01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
government there's the assessors that
 
01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
evaluate property they're working for a
 
01:09:21.149 --> 01:09:21.159 align:start position:0%
town they're working for the government
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
they're out doing their job to do the
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
assessing they do respect the signs um
 
01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
you talk about uh hunting you know we
 
01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
advise people B based on Hunting rules
 
01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
and trespassing that they need to post
 
01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
their land 300 ft apart with with the
 
01:09:37.789 --> 01:09:37.799 align:start position:0%
signs if they do not wish to have people
 
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
hunting there uh drones that was
 
01:09:41.789 --> 01:09:41.799 align:start position:0%
something that did come up I know
 
01:09:44.590 --> 01:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
there's some cases as a law enforcement
 
01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
officer if we're going to fly a drone
 
01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
over somebody's personal private
 
01:09:50.349 --> 01:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
property their
 
01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
Castle we get a warrant because we have
 
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
time to get it if it's those
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
circumstances unless there ENT
 
01:09:59.229 --> 01:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
circumstances we don't go on people's
 
01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:08.229 --> 01:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
specifically um representative
 
01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
roads thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
I so on I'm looking at line 23 it says
 
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
upon entering private land a government
 
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
agent shall immediately notify the
 
01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
landowner leas to your occupant if
 
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
notice can be reasonably made and it's
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
talking about if there's an extend
 
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.750 align:start position:0%
talking about if there's an extend
extenda

01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
extenda
 
01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
circumstance I I know I can't help it um
 
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
is that something that is already done
 
01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
or how would this conflict where it says
 
01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
shall if it can the officers are already
 
01:10:41.550 --> 01:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
doing it at least from what I've
 
01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
experienced in my 37 years as a police
 
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
officer however there are other
 
01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances where this is just going
 
01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
to contradict what we're actually doing
 
01:10:52.110 --> 01:10:52.120 align:start position:0%
and again I'm going to remind the
 
01:10:54.430 --> 01:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
committee you asked the most important
 
01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:55.390 align:start position:0%
committee you asked the most important
question

01:10:55.390 --> 01:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:10:58.590 --> 01:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
here is there a single instance of why
 
01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
we need this bill I mean it's like we're
 
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
just making laws to make laws we already
 
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
have best practice standards we have
 
01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional laws that are in place
 
01:11:10.110 --> 01:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
and those best practice standards in
 
01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
writing in training are being followed
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:28.630 align:start position:0%
 
Muse

01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:30.590 align:start position:0%
 
represent

01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you for taking my question
 
01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
Chief Walsh um you had mentioned that uh
 
01:11:37.950 --> 01:11:37.960 align:start position:0%
the legislation would hinder your
 
01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
ability to go into a domestic violence
 
01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
case where there were four Apartments
 
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
but I'm looking at um line 20 here of
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
page one and it says to respond to
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
exigent circumstances such as a
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
lifethreatening emergency or another
 
01:11:53.149 --> 01:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
immediate threat to Public Safety that
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
was either reported to the agent or the
 
01:11:56.830 --> 01:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
agent personally observed would you then
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
say that you personally observed the
 
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
domestic violence case which is what you
 
01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
said in your uh account and therefore
 
01:12:06.669 --> 01:12:06.679 align:start position:0%
under this law would be allowed to enter
 
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
that case and deal with the domestic
 
01:12:10.629 --> 01:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
violence case as you see fit under this
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
law I can see a defense attorney filing
 
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
a motion that what I was hearing was
 
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
inaccurate so therefore if fruits from
 
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
the poisonous tree again something I
 
01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
learned the first day at the police
 
01:12:23.189 --> 01:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
academy on the search and seizure if the
 
01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
court would rule that what I was hearing
 
01:12:26.590 --> 01:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
as being an assault was in accurate and
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
I was guessing this law would help the
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh defense to have anything we saw after
 
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
going to that door to be thrown out and
 
01:12:37.709 --> 01:12:37.719 align:start position:0%
therefore none of the evidence of the
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
domestic assault would be able to be
 
01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
entered into the court and again we're
 
01:12:44.830 --> 01:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
letting a victim
 
01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
down can I get a followup Mr chairman
 
01:12:51.149 --> 01:12:51.159 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you appreciate that um
 
01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
so I I will leave that for then and you
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
and I can discuss about that after I
 
01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to debate you um but my
 
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
followup is you said that the police
 
01:13:02.189 --> 01:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
standards and training already train the
 
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
officers to do a lot of what's
 
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
articulated in the bill um I think the
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
chairman already asked a similar
 
01:13:08.159 --> 01:13:09.149 align:start position:0%
chairman already asked a similar
question

01:13:09.149 --> 01:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:13:11.870 --> 01:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
but if it's already articulated in the
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
bill in in police standards and training
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
what's in the bill is already uh in the
 
01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
rules and they're already trained to do
 
01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
that um none of us live forever none of
 
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
us work forever wouldn't you see it as a
 
01:13:23.950 --> 01:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
good thing
 
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that uh skippa and his
 
01:13:29.070 --> 01:13:29.080 align:start position:0%
great training you and your great work
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
for your department might not always be
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
there and there might be an officer
 
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere down the line who has less of
 
01:13:37.390 --> 01:13:37.400 align:start position:0%
a level of respect for the private
 
01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
property rights of our citizens here in
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire less of a respect for the
 
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
community as you do and and might end up
 
01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
doing what's outlined here in this bill
 
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
can we rely on on the training standards
 
01:13:52.669 --> 01:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
is what my question really is that's a
 
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
very good question
 
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
um since 1987 these standards and
 
01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
practices have been in place and we've
 
01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
improved on it based on what we've
 
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
learned from people and Court rulings
 
01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
and after I'm
 
01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
retired the same standards of best
 
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
practice are going to be in place and
 
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
when myself as a department head has an
 
01:14:16.229 --> 01:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
officer that would not be following best
 
01:14:18.189 --> 01:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
practice standards we have internal
 
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in place that we're following
 
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
to ensure either they can respond on to
 
01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
the training and if they can't then we
 
01:14:29.790 --> 01:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
thank them for working at that agency
 
01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:31.400 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that I think
 
01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
everybody's aware of we're pushing
 
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
forward for stra State accreditation my
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
agency is one of them we're looking
 
01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
forward to being one of the first and
 
01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
that is to answer your question we'll
 
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
have those best practice standards that
 
01:14:44.629 --> 01:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
after we're all retired hopefully on a
 
01:14:44.639 --> 01:14:46.070 align:start position:0%
after we're all retired hopefully on a
beach

01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
beach
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere these standards will be
 
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:53.870 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
Stone thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:14:58.110 --> 01:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question in your
 
01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
experience have you found that uh search
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
and seizure training continues based on
 
01:15:04.830 --> 01:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
different court cases that come down or
 
01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
is the basic training you receive at the
 
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
Academy the only search and seizure
 
01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
information that you you gain throughout
 
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
your career a good question it's based
 
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
upon everything that comes down from the
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
courts we adjust that training to meet
 
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
those standards so we know that courts
 
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
are ruling in a certain way we need to
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
adjust policy and training with that
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
followup so you're talking about in
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
service you have yearly or updated
 
01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
trainings yes and follow question so if
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
this bill was to come law that would be
 
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
part of the new training it would have
 
01:15:36.189 --> 01:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
to be yes thank
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
 
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
for representa go ahead thank you so
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
much and thank you for you said um
 
01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
you're going for accreditation is that
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
through Kalia or another organization
 
01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:48.679 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire uh State
 
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
accreditation standards okay thank you
 
01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:52.280 align:start position:0%
so much thank you if you'd like to know
 
01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:57.550 --> 01:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
any further questions seeing none thank
 
01:15:58.629 --> 01:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony thank you
 
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
time uh you representative papovich
 
01:16:19.229 --> 01:16:19.239 align:start position:0%
Miller am I saying it
 
01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr chair I I'm my name
 
01:16:26.229 --> 01:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
is Daniel popovic Mueller and yes due to
 
01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
frequent practice you are doing great at
 
01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
pronouncing the last name I'm going to
 
01:16:33.629 --> 01:16:33.639 align:start position:0%
be very very brief and I I just want to
 
01:16:35.669 --> 01:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
State really that relying on the
 
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
Constitutional protections is all nice
 
01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
and good but they do leave a lot of gray
 
01:16:40.990 --> 01:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
areas and a lot of reasonable people
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
disagree on what the interpretation of a
 
01:16:46.229 --> 01:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
particular constitutional provision is
 
01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:48.760 align:start position:0%
it is better to just have a clear law
 
01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
that the legislature sets the standards
 
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
needed to get onto private land and I
 
01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
I'm finding a bit conflicted when
 
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
hearing testimony that says really we
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
are already doing all this but then if
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
you pass this law we won't be able to do
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
some of the things we are doing you kind
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
of you can either have your cake or eat
 
01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
it but you cannot have your cake and eat
 
01:17:12.990 --> 01:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
it too either the legislation already
 
01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
follows the standards and then there is
 
01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
no harm in passing it or it requires
 
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
them to change what they're doing in
 
01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
which case there is a clear need to pass
 
01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
it so you know you got to just pick one
 
01:17:25.870 --> 01:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the references to the
 
01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
training and standards of the police and
 
01:17:29.669 --> 01:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
I'm grateful that they are high they may
 
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
change over time I don't want to rely on
 
01:17:33.669 --> 01:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
that when the legislature can set the
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
clear standards and plus officers do not
 
01:17:38.709 --> 01:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
always act as trained we are humans we
 
01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
make mistakes this is good legislation
 
01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
that is needed to clearly spell out the
 
01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
protections we have and I would
 
01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to support the
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
OTP motion and I'm done thank you thank
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:02.590 --> 01:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
Labor good
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
morning my name is John garrian I am the
 
01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
general counsel at the State Department
 
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
of Labor um I don't appear uh in support
 
01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
or in opposition we are neutral on the
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
bill however um the Department's review
 
01:18:27.229 --> 01:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
of this bill um has raised some concerns
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
for us as relates to our ability to uh
 
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
inforce and inspect and regulate uh
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
labor laws as uh here in the state of
 
01:18:40.350 --> 01:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um one of the ways that we
 
01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
enforce labor laws is through
 
01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
inspections of workplaces or of
 
01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
elevators if you see a little
 
01:18:48.270 --> 01:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
certificates in the elevator when you
 
01:18:51.229 --> 01:18:51.239 align:start position:0%
come up and down uh or boilers in in
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
other instances um
 
01:18:57.310 --> 01:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
that ability of the department and its
 
01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
employees to do that has been codified
 
01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:04.360 align:start position:0%
um in labor law in RSA 273 RSA 275 and
 
01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
others um that authorities existed uh
 
01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
fundamentally since
 
01:19:12.510 --> 01:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
1911 um in order for us to protect the
 
01:19:14.830 --> 01:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
workers and the public here in the state
 
01:19:17.790 --> 01:19:17.800 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire in the review of this
 
01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
bill the language in it is very broad it
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
applies to all government AG not just
 
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
Law Enforcement Officers or um or
 
01:19:30.669 --> 01:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
investigators um and so it it could be
 
01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
that this bill would would styme or
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
limit uh the Department's ability to
 
01:19:40.189 --> 01:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
enforce or to perform inspections of
 
01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
workplaces private workplaces um or of
 
01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
locations of say boilers or elevators in
 
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
order to um inspect them or to ascertain
 
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh if violations are occurring um one of
 
01:19:56.110 --> 01:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
the the important parts of our ability
 
01:19:58.030 --> 01:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
to inspect one is to see the workplace
 
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
as it is um and not in a state where an
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
employer has U been able to to amend or
 
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
to change um for instance perhaps their
 
01:20:09.629 --> 01:20:09.639 align:start position:0%
youth labor law violations if there are
 
01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
children working hazardous occa
 
01:20:13.709 --> 01:20:13.719 align:start position:0%
occupations where they shouldn't be um
 
01:20:16.669 --> 01:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
or other such things so the bill does
 
01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
exempt um the fishing game officers uh
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
or fishing game Personnel in their
 
01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement of Wildlife
 
01:20:26.189 --> 01:20:26.199 align:start position:0%
regulations um our recommendation would
 
01:20:31.149 --> 01:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
be to have the bill also exempt uh Labor
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh reg sorry labor inspectors uh or the
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement of Labor violations or just
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
regulatory um inspections for that
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
regard does your department um have any
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
cause ever to do inspections or
 
01:20:49.310 --> 01:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
investigations on the property that's
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
related to single family
 
01:20:51.719 --> 01:20:54.350 align:start position:0%
related to single family
homes

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
homes
 
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
I I don't like giving absolute answers
 
01:20:58.629 --> 01:20:58.639 align:start position:0%
but no as close as you can get it's sure
 
01:21:02.430 --> 01:21:02.440 align:start position:0%
um uh firing that's under construction
 
01:21:04.030 --> 01:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
labor in the state has performed in a
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
variety of locations and situations I'll
 
01:21:09.189 --> 01:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
say um so it's not outside their own
 
01:21:10.990 --> 01:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
possibility but usually we're talking
 
01:21:12.430 --> 01:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
about construction sites we're talking
 
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
about um commercial establishments but
 
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh it there are times where um that that
 
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
could come up depending on how the how
 
01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
the employment situ situation works or
 
01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
how the workplace works
 
01:21:28.990 --> 01:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative Stone thank you Mr

chair thank you for taking my question
 
01:21:32.669 --> 01:21:32.679 align:start position:0%
when you show up to do a uh I guess a
 
01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
spontaneous inspection do you announce
 
01:21:35.950 --> 01:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
that you're there with the officials
 
01:21:38.669 --> 01:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
that have control of the premise mying
 
01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
is that's is that's is the practice yes
 
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
so you just don't Slither into someone's
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh place of employment and uh kind of
 
01:21:47.550 --> 01:21:47.560 align:start position:0%

01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
thanks this
 
01:23:57.550 --> 01:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
committee uh you number of you probably
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
are looking at this going didn't we just
 
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
pass that last year and yes we did your
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
committee did pass it and we passed it
 
01:24:06.430 --> 01:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
out of the house and over in the Senate
 
01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:08.920 align:start position:0%
side they said we want to see it only
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
apply to people who are over 18 which
 
01:24:13.629 --> 01:24:13.639 align:start position:0%
was missing from that and instead of
 
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
amending it they killed it and asked me
 
01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
to put it in again with the language
 
01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
saying over 18 so what you see before
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
you is the same bill we passed last year
 
01:24:26.189 --> 01:24:26.199 align:start position:0%
but with the specificity of uh if you're
 
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
under 18 you still can't um own sell
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
possess blackjacks slungshot or brass
 
01:24:39.310 --> 01:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
knuckles that's essentially it it
 
01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:41.560 align:start position:0%
basically lines up with the way we sell
 
01:24:45.149 --> 01:24:45.159 align:start position:0%
knives to of of large lengths can't buy
 
01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
them switch blades and Long Knives if
 
01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
you're under 18 so it just basically
 
01:24:52.709 --> 01:24:52.719 align:start position:0%
lines up with that and and if there's
 
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
any questions I'll take
 
01:24:56.669 --> 01:24:56.679 align:start position:0%
them I was going to start with the same
 
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
question from last year as what is a
 
01:24:59.750 --> 01:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
slungshot but we'll just move on from
 
01:25:05.870 --> 01:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
that um does this law if passed remove
 
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
any of the restrictions on felons
 
01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
possessing weapons no does
 
01:25:15.790 --> 01:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
it is the current state of law that I
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
can have all these things if I have a
 
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
hunting license yes but if I don't have
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
a hunting license I can't have them
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
correct thank you you can also have all
 
01:25:24.910 --> 01:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
these things if you're law
 
01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.910 align:start position:0%
these things if you're law
enforcement

01:25:26.910 --> 01:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:25:30.430 --> 01:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
currently further questions seeing none
 
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else wishing to testify
 
01:25:35.629 --> 01:25:35.639 align:start position:0%

the committee
 
01:40:40.589 --> 01:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
uh HB
 
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
1539 is relative to annulling
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
resentencing or discontinuing
 
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
prosecution of certain cannabis offenses
 
01:40:51.550 --> 01:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
uh there is already a process for nment
 
01:40:55.149 --> 01:40:55.159 align:start position:0%
right now in current law uh that process
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
is outlined
 
01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
in RSA 651 colon DB um this bill amends
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
that section and then adds in some new
 
01:41:12.669 --> 01:41:12.679 align:start position:0%
sections which open up the ability for
 
01:41:14.109 --> 01:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
uh somebody and that's those new
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
sections are um let me see here uh after
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
651 inserting after section
 
01:41:25.149 --> 01:41:25.159 align:start position:0%
b-5 the following new sections which are
 
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
651 Colon 5- c uh annulment of certain
 
01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
arrests for and convictions of cannabis
 
01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
um despite the fact that this
 
01:41:37.629 --> 01:41:37.639 align:start position:0%
legislation is four pages long I would
 
01:41:41.629 --> 01:41:41.639 align:start position:0%
like to think it is decently simple um
 
01:41:44.350 --> 01:41:44.360 align:start position:0%
the process for annulments that I
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
brought forward here in this bill was
 
01:41:49.390 --> 01:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that the legislature
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
seems to be moving rapidly towards
 
01:41:55.270 --> 01:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
legalization of cannabis um the governor
 
01:41:58.350 --> 01:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
has indicated support of legalization
 
01:42:02.990 --> 01:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
the um Senate has moved more so than it
 
01:42:05.149 --> 01:42:05.159 align:start position:0%
had in the past towards legalization and
 
01:42:07.629 --> 01:42:07.639 align:start position:0%
it we have a bill that's coming before
 
01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
the floor which I think is 17 to3 and
 
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
we'll be voting on that tomorrow so I
 
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
think it's it's clear especially given
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
the last few sessions the where we're at
 
01:42:19.870 --> 01:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
with the legalization of marijuana
 
01:42:21.990 --> 01:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
despite um some objections from some of
 
01:42:25.669 --> 01:42:25.679 align:start position:0%
us here um there is an effort to move
 
01:42:27.790 --> 01:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
forward to legalization and it looks
 
01:42:30.189 --> 01:42:30.199 align:start position:0%
like decriminalization was the first
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
step to what the state will seemingly
 
01:42:36.990 --> 01:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
inevitably do um given that uh and given
 
01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
the fact that we've seen legalization
 
01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
across the country and I'm a proponent
 
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
of legalization I support legalization
 
01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
but I am concerned with what I'm seeing
 
01:42:49.589 --> 01:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
in other places Colorado California
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
places that um don't have as robust an
 
01:42:55.470 --> 01:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
analment process for their uh for people
 
01:42:57.270 --> 01:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
who were convicted of of marijuana
 
01:42:59.390 --> 01:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
charges and I'm concerned that the
 
01:43:01.790 --> 01:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
situation that we're seeing right now
 
01:43:04.109 --> 01:43:04.119 align:start position:0%
with the legalization of marijuana is
 
01:43:06.430 --> 01:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
it's being legal legalized by the state
 
01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
so people can sell buy or smoke it while
 
01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
at the same time people who bought it or
 
01:43:16.830 --> 01:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
sold it or smoked it are incarcerated as
 
01:43:19.550 --> 01:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
a result of that and I think those two
 
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
realities oper ating alongside one
 
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
another is a is a a travesty of justice
 
01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
and a bit of a moral quandry I suppose
 
01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:30.280 align:start position:0%
that I think we should that we should
 
01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
address and this is I think a process by
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
which we could address that
 
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
um I understand the cost for the
 
01:43:43.149 --> 01:43:43.159 align:start position:0%
agencies in the legislation as written
 
01:43:46.629 --> 01:43:46.639 align:start position:0%
would be High um or at least that the
 
01:43:49.910 --> 01:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
cost would be there um it would require
 
01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:53.639 align:start position:0%
new hearings it would require petitions
 
01:43:55.709 --> 01:43:55.719 align:start position:0%
uh the legislation as it was written
 
01:43:59.310 --> 01:43:59.320 align:start position:0%
requires the department to look
 
01:44:02.310 --> 01:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
proactively at some of these cases um as
 
01:44:05.070 --> 01:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
outlined based on the timeline
 
01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
here um I would be open to amendments on
 
01:44:10.350 --> 01:44:10.360 align:start position:0%
that on that on that end but I do think
 
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
that um the bill as it stands is sort of
 
01:44:15.390 --> 01:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
the golden standard of where we should
 
01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:16.719 align:start position:0%
be moving when it comes to the
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
annulments process and my direct resp
 
01:44:22.390 --> 01:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
response to the fact that there is a
 
01:44:24.629 --> 01:44:24.639 align:start position:0%
cost here would be that's the cost of
 
01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
government that unfortunately sometimes
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
there there is a cost here um we
 
01:44:33.629 --> 01:44:33.639 align:start position:0%
incarcerated these people uh for decades
 
01:44:36.310 --> 01:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
based on this charge um and it's going
 
01:44:40.990 --> 01:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
to take uh a cost when we remove that as
 
01:44:44.430 --> 01:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
a crime in our books and need to anull
 
01:44:47.070 --> 01:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
those people those people's records
 
01:44:49.830 --> 01:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
that's that is um unfortunately you know
 
01:44:51.510 --> 01:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
it it that is the the cost of government
 
01:44:53.189 --> 01:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
and and that does take money and
 
01:44:55.870 --> 01:44:55.880 align:start position:0%
resources but um that's that's the job
 
01:44:59.350 --> 01:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
that we were elected to do um Mr
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
chairman I'll I'll I could go on for for
 
01:45:04.270 --> 01:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
hours about this but I'll just end by
 
01:45:08.070 --> 01:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
saying somebody's uh record does
 
01:45:09.990 --> 01:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
seriously affect their ability to get a
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
job their ability to uh be a fully
 
01:45:15.310 --> 01:45:15.320 align:start position:0%
functioning member of society without
 
01:45:16.709 --> 01:45:16.719 align:start position:0%
illustrating everything that that
 
01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
entails um and as I said in the
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
beginning it's a seriously unfortunate
 
01:45:24.189 --> 01:45:24.199 align:start position:0%
situation where we have places all
 
01:45:26.109 --> 01:45:26.119 align:start position:0%
across this country where it's legal to
 
01:45:29.149 --> 01:45:29.159 align:start position:0%
buy sell and smoke um but people who
 
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
bought sold or smoked it are still um
 
01:45:35.350 --> 01:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
convicted or have a charge on their
 
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
record which keeps them from getting a
 
01:45:39.870 --> 01:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
job or keeps them from again being a
 
01:45:43.109 --> 01:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
fully functioning member of society um I
 
01:45:45.310 --> 01:45:45.320 align:start position:0%
mean that's just a really unfortunate
 
01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
situation and I think on top of that if
 
01:45:49.790 --> 01:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to do the state Monopoly
 
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
model it's an even more unfortunate
 
01:45:54.030 --> 01:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
situation because the state that
 
01:45:56.109 --> 01:45:56.119 align:start position:0%
incarcerated that person for again
 
01:45:58.990 --> 01:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
buying selling or smoking is now buying
 
01:46:01.310 --> 01:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
selling uh the product that it
 
01:46:03.950 --> 01:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
incarcerated that person for so I think
 
01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
just given where we're at here in New
 
01:46:08.830 --> 01:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire given where the movement
 
01:46:11.589 --> 01:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
around cannabis is um and given how
 
01:46:13.589 --> 01:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
important it is for somebody if the
 
01:46:15.390 --> 01:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
crime is no longer there to have a clean
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
record um I introduced HP 1539 and I
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
really appreciate uh the that you have
 
01:46:23.030 --> 01:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
given me here today Mr chairman thank
 
01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
you um couple quick questions which
 
01:46:29.950 --> 01:46:29.960 align:start position:0%
offenses specifically will it an
 
01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
know it outlines on page one or the
 
01:46:38.270 --> 01:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
first page of the text here and let me
 
01:46:43.229 --> 01:46:43.239 align:start position:0%
find the line here um line 10 uh so this
 
01:46:47.310 --> 01:46:47.320 align:start position:0%
is uh 651 colon
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
b-5 as amended here in the bill um line
 
01:46:53.149 --> 01:46:53.159 align:start position:0%
10 section c uh cannabis related
 
01:46:55.270 --> 01:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
offenses means the following any offense
 
01:46:57.750 --> 01:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
01:47:00.629 --> 01:47:00.639 align:start position:0%
13-b so involving Canabis or per that
 
01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
would go all the way up to trafficking
 
01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it say that again would that go
 
01:47:07.390 --> 01:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
all the way up to trafficking not on my
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
and no RSA 13-b involving cannabis or
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia intended for cannabis and
 
01:47:17.830 --> 01:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of trafficking any other um any
 
01:47:19.030 --> 01:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
other offense that doesn't have to do
 
01:47:20.669 --> 01:47:20.679 align:start position:0%
with canvis and I appreciate you me the
 
01:47:22.149 --> 01:47:22.159 align:start position:0%
time to to answer that no I mean
 
01:47:24.510 --> 01:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
trafficking in cannabis um if someone
 
01:47:26.030 --> 01:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
the selling of cannabis yeah if someone
 
01:47:28.229 --> 01:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
was selling you know 50 lbs that would
 
01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
be a trafficking I believe level offense
 
01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
would this pardon trafficking
 
01:47:37.510 --> 01:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
charges or not pardon excuse me a n well
 
01:47:42.589 --> 01:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%
the I think it would be have to be no
 
01:47:45.910 --> 01:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
more than The Possession limit and I
 
01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
think 50 lbs would be over The
 
01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
Possession limit as as Illustrated right
 
01:47:53.310 --> 01:47:53.320 align:start position:0%
now in current law and um so that's what
 
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
my question is is it yeah that's more
 
01:47:57.790 --> 01:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
simple is would this only anull things
 
01:48:00.790 --> 01:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
that we are about to possibly make legal
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
in other words selling a massive amount
 
01:48:05.390 --> 01:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
of marijuana without um whatever
 
01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
permission or whoever is going to be
 
01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
able to sell it would still be a
 
01:48:11.870 --> 01:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
crime so we wouldn't be pardoning uh
 
01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me annulling things that would
 
01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
still be a crime correct yes and it it
 
01:48:18.109 --> 01:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
it does outline that it is The
 
01:48:22.510 --> 01:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
Possession limit is the uh limit for um
 
01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
annulment and and as I said in the
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
beginning of my uh testimony here the
 
01:48:30.030 --> 01:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
process for Anan is already there this
 
01:48:32.510 --> 01:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
makes it so the 34s of an ounce is
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
turned to The Possession limit so it it
 
01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
will update itself based on whatever the
 
01:48:41.189 --> 01:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
legislature decides with hb1 1633 and
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
the other bills that we have before us
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
so if the legislature decides to do
 
01:48:49.229 --> 01:48:49.239 align:start position:0%
nothing then this text will sit there as
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
taking up space in the criminal code
 
01:48:54.350 --> 01:48:54.360 align:start position:0%
book um saying The Possession limit and
 
01:48:56.070 --> 01:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
The Possession limit will be the three4
 
01:48:59.189 --> 01:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
of the ounce that that we have right now
 
01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
gotcha representative rhs thank you Mr
 
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:49:04.950 --> 01:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
question representative wheeler I'm I'm
 
01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
trying to read this very quickly and I
 
01:49:12.669 --> 01:49:12.679 align:start position:0%
apologize if I missed it um so it sounds
 
01:49:15.310 --> 01:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
to me that this is all on assumption
 
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
that this will become legal before the
 
01:49:22.189 --> 01:49:22.199 align:start position:0%
current governor leaves office so is
 
01:49:24.510 --> 01:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
this to say that if it does not become
 
01:49:27.070 --> 01:49:27.080 align:start position:0%
legal then this is this whole bill is a
 
01:49:29.390 --> 01:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
wash or is it your intention even if it
 
01:49:30.950 --> 01:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't become legal that this still
 
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
goes into
 
01:49:34.270 --> 01:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
effect I don't think that the bill would
 
01:49:36.390 --> 01:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
be a wash if it doesn't become legal um
 
01:49:39.550 --> 01:49:39.560 align:start position:0%
I I would say that even if 1633 doesn't
 
01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
pass on the floor tomorrow that this
 
01:49:42.990 --> 01:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
bill would still be a good thing based
 
01:49:46.669 --> 01:49:46.679 align:start position:0%
on the fact that there are indications
 
01:49:48.030 --> 01:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
politically and you know obviously we
 
01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
can't um
 
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
there are serious indications that
 
01:49:54.990 --> 01:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
legalization could pass this year or in
 
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
the next bium so I think this bill is
 
01:49:59.950 --> 01:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
good but aside from whether or not
 
01:50:02.830 --> 01:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
legalizations passes this bill is good
 
01:50:05.790 --> 01:50:05.800 align:start position:0%
because having it be no more than The
 
01:50:07.790 --> 01:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
Possession limit rather than 34s of an
 
01:50:10.189 --> 01:50:10.199 align:start position:0%
ounce I think fits where we're at here
 
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire Better given the fact
 
01:50:14.669 --> 01:50:14.679 align:start position:0%
that the 34s of an ounce could change so
 
01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:17.320 align:start position:0%
drastically or whether it goes down or
 
01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
goes up you know if we make it a quarter
 
01:50:22.709 --> 01:50:22.719 align:start position:0%
of an ounce then The Possession limit
 
01:50:24.229 --> 01:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
based on this bill would be a quarter of
 
01:50:25.589 --> 01:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
an ounce and you could only anull your
 
01:50:27.790 --> 01:50:27.800 align:start position:0%
crime if it was a quarter of an ounce so
 
01:50:30.109 --> 01:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
I I think it would be good to have even
 
01:50:33.149 --> 01:50:33.159 align:start position:0%
if uh whatever legalization bill doesn't
 
01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
pass in uh in this
 
01:50:40.109 --> 01:50:40.119 align:start position:0%
bium representative sik thank you and
 
01:50:43.390 --> 01:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um so
 
01:50:46.910 --> 01:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that I understand um
 
01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
in this bill so if there are PE for the
 
01:50:51.390 --> 01:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
people who are currently inar ated for
 
01:50:54.589 --> 01:50:54.599 align:start position:0%
um marijuana specific related offenses
 
01:50:56.990 --> 01:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
can you just clarify for me the process
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
by which they would be released I can um
 
01:51:04.750 --> 01:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
let me find just I can give you the uh
 
01:51:06.350 --> 01:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
the piece of the bill that does do that
 
01:51:12.109 --> 01:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:15.930 --> 01:51:15.940 align:start position:0%
um I believe it is on page
 
01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:17.149 align:start position:0%
um I believe it is on page
[Music]

01:51:17.149 --> 01:51:17.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:51:21.950 --> 01:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
three page four thank you
 
01:51:25.589 --> 01:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
um page four line four thank you m Madam
 
01:51:27.990 --> 01:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
Vice chair um the offense is not
 
01:51:30.109 --> 01:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
eligible for resentencing under this
 
01:51:34.750 --> 01:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:38.109 --> 01:51:38.119 align:start position:0%
resentencing okay well um I think it
 
01:51:42.629 --> 01:51:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
um I was seeing it on page three because
 
01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
I I I believe that it has to do with the
 
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
resentencing um I'm I'm I because I I
 
01:51:52.669 --> 01:51:52.679 align:start position:0%
think you were skipping to the to the
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
middle of it I think I was right when I
 
01:51:57.470 --> 01:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
said it was page three um and the
 
01:52:01.950 --> 01:52:01.960 align:start position:0%
resentencing piece comes in it starts
 
01:52:07.629 --> 01:52:07.639 align:start position:0%
here on line 16 page three 651 colon 5-d
 
01:52:10.270 --> 01:52:10.280 align:start position:0%
resentencing for cannabis offenses and
 
01:52:12.069 --> 01:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
as outlined in the bill you know without
 
01:52:14.830 --> 01:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
reading it directly here um essentially
 
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
if somebody is currently in prison they
 
01:52:20.830 --> 01:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
can petition the court based on solely a
 
01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis charge uh the court that they
 
01:52:27.030 --> 01:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
were convicted on um to have that
 
01:52:30.189 --> 01:52:30.199 align:start position:0%
sentence recent and and it starts here
 
01:52:34.030 --> 01:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
on line 16 and that uh chapter goes
 
01:52:39.109 --> 01:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:42.350 --> 01:52:42.360 align:start position:0%
four in a second I just that I have a
 
01:52:45.069 --> 01:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
question to clarify that so if a person
 
01:52:47.910 --> 01:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
is arrested and sentenced to
 
01:52:51.870 --> 01:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
jail and it was on a cannabis charge but
 
01:52:55.310 --> 01:52:55.320 align:start position:0%
it was also a Firearms charge and maybe
 
01:52:56.669 --> 01:52:56.679 align:start position:0%
a couple other things thrown in there
 
01:52:58.270 --> 01:52:58.280 align:start position:0%
would that not require the court to have
 
01:53:00.069 --> 01:53:00.079 align:start position:0%
a whole new sentencing hearing where
 
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
they decided what the sentence should be
 
01:53:03.870 --> 01:53:03.880 align:start position:0%
based on the other
 
01:53:07.870 --> 01:53:07.880 align:start position:0%
charges I believe Mr chairman that um it
 
01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
would have to be solely a cannabis
 
01:53:12.149 --> 01:53:12.159 align:start position:0%
offense so if somebody was arrested for
 
01:53:14.189 --> 01:53:14.199 align:start position:0%
a Firearms charge as well then they
 
01:53:15.750 --> 01:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
would not be eligible for annulments
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
under this bill um and that also
 
01:53:20.189 --> 01:53:20.199 align:start position:0%
includes people who and I did that in my
 
01:53:21.709 --> 01:53:21.719 align:start position:0%
notes for the initial testimony I forgot
 
01:53:24.629 --> 01:53:24.639 align:start position:0%
to say that um that includes people who
 
01:53:27.069 --> 01:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
took a plea deal so if you were going to
 
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
be convicted for something took a plea
 
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
deal and then it was just a cannabis
 
01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
charge that would not count for an
 
01:53:34.830 --> 01:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
helment it would have to be you were
 
01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
convicted for solely a cannabis charge
 
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
and then or paraphernalia charge based
 
01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
on cannabis and then you would be
 
01:53:42.910 --> 01:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
eligible for analment but anyone who was
 
01:53:45.629 --> 01:53:45.639 align:start position:0%
arrested and there's so so much text
 
01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
here it's hard to while you're at the
 
01:53:49.149 --> 01:53:49.159 align:start position:0%
dis find exactly what I'm looking at but
 
01:53:50.589 --> 01:53:50.599 align:start position:0%
I know I can find afterwards because I
 
01:53:53.950 --> 01:53:53.960 align:start position:0%
know it's here anyone who is arrested
 
01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
for anything other than a marijuana
 
01:53:57.390 --> 01:53:57.400 align:start position:0%
charge would not be eligible for this
 
01:53:59.310 --> 01:53:59.320 align:start position:0%
representive s your
 
01:54:01.669 --> 01:54:01.679 align:start position:0%
followup thank you and I apologize
 
01:54:03.109 --> 01:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
because my brain is trying to make sense
 
01:54:06.030 --> 01:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
of all of it um
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
so if someone were
 
01:54:13.950 --> 01:54:13.960 align:start position:0%
serving three years for um a marijuana
 
01:54:16.629 --> 01:54:16.639 align:start position:0%
specific charge without any other
 
01:54:19.830 --> 01:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
charges they by by through this bill
 
01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
they would appeal to a judge to be
 
01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
resentenced is that what I'm
 
01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
understanding yes and and with the hopes
 
01:54:29.149 --> 01:54:29.159 align:start position:0%
that the judge would then release them
 
01:54:32.350 --> 01:54:32.360 align:start position:0%
yes um well anyone who applies for
 
01:54:34.030 --> 01:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
resentencing I suppose hopes that the
 
01:54:36.750 --> 01:54:36.760 align:start position:0%
person that they get released but
 
01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to find the exact piece in
 
01:54:42.830 --> 01:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
which it outlines what the court does
 
01:54:48.149 --> 01:54:48.159 align:start position:0%
here so apologize um I believe that it
 
01:54:49.390 --> 01:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
the answer to your question would be
 
01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
found on page four line 26 which says
 
01:54:54.030 --> 01:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
that the court may find that
 
01:54:55.950 --> 01:54:55.960 align:start position:0%
resentencing is the interest is in the
 
01:54:58.510 --> 01:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
interest of Justice uh but that a
 
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
complete reduction oh I'm sorry that's
 
01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
not that isn't it but that is around the
 
01:55:06.390 --> 01:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
same place where it essentially says
 
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
that the court has the discretion to
 
01:55:11.550 --> 01:55:11.560 align:start position:0%
look at what the sentence would be and
 
01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
if it's not in the it does outline uh in
 
01:55:16.910 --> 01:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
this whole page four whether or not if
 
01:55:19.990 --> 01:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
it is in the interest of Justice or not
 
01:55:23.390 --> 01:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
um then that petition will be uh granted
 
01:55:27.270 --> 01:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
Balden thanks for taking my question I
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
know that you um enjoy learning history
 
01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering if you know of um
 
01:55:40.350 --> 01:55:40.360 align:start position:0%
folks who received
 
01:55:43.990 --> 01:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
any um annulments or pardons after the
 
01:55:46.069 --> 01:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
end of alcohol prohibition I know that
 
01:55:48.350 --> 01:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
FDR gave some but I don't know if maybe
 
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
there were some at State levels as
 
01:55:52.470 --> 01:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
well oh it's a great question
 
01:55:54.629 --> 01:55:54.639 align:start position:0%
representative Balden actually I don't I
 
01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
don't know my prohibition history as
 
01:55:58.950 --> 01:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
much as someone who who supports
 
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
prohibition should I suppose but I do
 
01:56:02.510 --> 01:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
know that there were some annulments
 
01:56:04.270 --> 01:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
given out I don't think that there was a
 
01:56:07.189 --> 01:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
a federal bill passed in the
 
01:56:10.830 --> 01:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
1930s that uh opened up the door for
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
annulments at large but I know that
 
01:56:13.990 --> 01:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
there is a process by which someone
 
01:56:16.109 --> 01:56:16.119 align:start position:0%
could anull I don't know when that uh
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
process came into effect though yeah
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:26.589 align:start position:0%
 
represent

01:56:26.589 --> 01:56:26.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:29.669 --> 01:56:29.679 align:start position:0%
Muse your
 
01:56:32.390 --> 01:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
mic I did have a question about the uh
 
01:56:34.669 --> 01:56:34.679 align:start position:0%
at the top at the top of your bill um it
 
01:56:36.270 --> 01:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
says The Possession limit means
 
01:56:38.790 --> 01:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
whichever of the following quantities is
 
01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
greater uh 2 ounces of cannabis and 5
 
01:56:44.510 --> 01:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
gram of hashes or an amount of cannabis
 
01:56:46.030 --> 01:56:46.040 align:start position:0%
that's legal under the new hampsh Under
 
01:56:48.149 --> 01:56:48.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law for adults 21 and over
 
01:56:50.830 --> 01:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
to possess
 
01:56:53.870 --> 01:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't this bill basically Raise The
 
01:56:55.950 --> 01:56:55.960 align:start position:0%
Possession limit by itself by making
 
01:56:55.960 --> 01:56:59.589 align:start position:0%
Possession limit by itself by making
that

01:56:59.589 --> 01:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
change I mean I think that the without
 
01:57:05.069 --> 01:57:05.079 align:start position:0%
giving you a direct answer because I I I
 
01:57:06.430 --> 01:57:06.440 align:start position:0%
don't know that direct answer off the
 
01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
top of my head I think you might be
 
01:57:09.870 --> 01:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
right uh that might be an oversight that
 
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:18.629 --> 01:57:18.639 align:start position:0%
you representative Stone thank you thank
 
01:57:20.189 --> 01:57:20.199 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question do you have
 
01:57:22.149 --> 01:57:22.159 align:start position:0%
any numbers for currently incarcerated
 
01:57:25.030 --> 01:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
individuals who are either detained in
 
01:57:26.629 --> 01:57:26.639 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire state prison or in

question um actually a representative

01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
further did you actually talk to anyone

dolc about the conversation about the
 
01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
bill or about how many people um they
 
01:58:13.709 --> 01:58:13.719 align:start position:0%
have they believe would be effective by
 
01:58:15.589 --> 01:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
no okay thank you representative new
 
01:58:21.750 --> 01:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks for taking
 
01:58:24.149 --> 01:58:24.159 align:start position:0%
my question um I wanted to highlight
 
01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about um representative
 
01:58:28.109 --> 01:58:28.119 align:start position:0%
celik was talking about you know the
 
01:58:30.350 --> 01:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
process of of review or or how that
 
01:58:33.510 --> 01:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
would go about so on page three um line
 
01:58:38.270 --> 01:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
TW lines 24 to 29 um no later than 90
 
01:58:39.870 --> 01:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
days after the effective date of this
 
01:58:41.310 --> 01:58:41.320 align:start position:0%
section the Department of Corrections
 
01:58:42.950 --> 01:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
and the superintendent of each house of
 
01:58:44.950 --> 01:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
correction shall conduct a search to
 
01:58:47.310 --> 01:58:47.320 align:start position:0%
determine all uh individuals so that's
 
01:58:49.350 --> 01:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
kind of that uh lays out the proc
 
01:58:51.830 --> 01:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
process as far as I'm concerned um my
 
01:58:53.910 --> 01:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
question was I did receive a call um
 
01:58:56.589 --> 01:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
from someone who was uh concerned about
 
01:58:59.669 --> 01:58:59.679 align:start position:0%
the idea of um a related charge that
 
01:59:01.830 --> 01:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't necessarily for cannabis but it
 
01:59:04.189 --> 01:59:04.199 align:start position:0%
was uh part of that process and I I
 
01:59:06.069 --> 01:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
believe what he had said was that he uh
 
01:59:09.629 --> 01:59:09.639 align:start position:0%
tried to flush it so it was um uh
 
01:59:11.350 --> 01:59:11.360 align:start position:0%
interfering with evidence or or
 
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
something yeah there you go destruction
 
01:59:15.510 --> 01:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
of evidence would um would this piece of
 
01:59:17.870 --> 01:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
legislation address something like that
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
that charge
 
01:59:23.270 --> 01:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
are you saying would that person be
 
01:59:25.149 --> 01:59:25.159 align:start position:0%
eligible for an nment based on an
 
01:59:27.069 --> 01:59:27.079 align:start position:0%
obstruction of justice charge yeah would
 
01:59:28.990 --> 01:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
they would the obstruction of of Justice
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
would that be part of the I think
 
01:59:32.910 --> 01:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that the circumstances in
 
01:59:34.750 --> 01:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
that case would prevent him from from
 
01:59:38.310 --> 01:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
being aned under this bill um because of
 
01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
uh what he was charged with and I I just
 
01:59:43.750 --> 01:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
don't know if there would be a way to
 
01:59:45.750 --> 01:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
allow for an nments of obstruction of
 
01:59:48.310 --> 01:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
justice without getting into much Haier
 
01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
territory than we already are with um
 
01:59:52.589 --> 01:59:52.599 align:start position:0%
the canvas charges gotcha thank you
 
01:59:52.599 --> 01:59:54.229 align:start position:0%
the canvas charges gotcha thank you
appreciate

01:59:54.229 --> 01:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
it representative Manion thank you Mr
 
01:59:58.550 --> 01:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:00:00.069 --> 02:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
question right in the sun I know you've
 
02:00:01.750 --> 02:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
been waiting for it so I just began
 
02:00:03.910 --> 02:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
slithering through this bill so bear
 
02:00:05.709 --> 02:00:05.719 align:start position:0%
with me
 
02:00:08.030 --> 02:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
um there was a bet to get that word in
 
02:00:10.950 --> 02:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
there so we're talking about from what I
 
02:00:13.950 --> 02:00:13.960 align:start position:0%
looked like 34 of an ounce 2 ounces
 
02:00:17.229 --> 02:00:17.239 align:start position:0%
small amounts uh for possession however
 
02:00:18.149 --> 02:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
we're also talking about people
 
02:00:19.669 --> 02:00:19.679 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for 3 years
 
02:00:20.750 --> 02:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
are there a lot of people that are
 
02:00:23.589 --> 02:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for State Prison sentences
 
02:00:26.149 --> 02:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
that have small possession charges or
 
02:00:28.069 --> 02:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
are we going back to the people who are
 
02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
trafficking the five pounds the 50
 
02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
pounds are those the people that are in
 
02:00:33.790 --> 02:00:33.800 align:start position:0%
state prison and does this actually
 
02:00:37.390 --> 02:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
apply to them now well this applies to
 
02:00:39.030 --> 02:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
anyone who gets a charge so I don't
 
02:00:41.390 --> 02:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
think that there would be any specific
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh application to uh state prisons I
 
02:00:46.350 --> 02:00:46.360 align:start position:0%
mean if you have a if you have a charge
 
02:00:47.790 --> 02:00:47.800 align:start position:0%
from anywhere if you happen to have been
 
02:00:49.069 --> 02:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
in the state prison because of a c
 
02:00:50.790 --> 02:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
Canabis charge then you would be able
 
02:00:52.470 --> 02:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
and eligible for this bill if you're in
 
02:00:55.950 --> 02:00:55.960 align:start position:0%
a state prison because of uh sale of 50
 
02:00:58.390 --> 02:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
lbs of cannabis and somehow you had 50
 
02:00:59.390 --> 02:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
pounds of cannabis and you weren't
 
02:01:00.790 --> 02:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
selling anything else it was solely a
 
02:01:03.310 --> 02:01:03.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis charge you're not eligible for
 
02:01:06.069 --> 02:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
this uh bill because you were uh
 
02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
trafficking in uh significantly high
 
02:01:11.310 --> 02:01:11.320 align:start position:0%
quality of of cannabis and you were you
 
02:01:16.709 --> 02:01:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:20.750 --> 02:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
exactly and uh that would be that would
 
02:01:27.310 --> 02:01:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:31.149 --> 02:01:31.159 align:start position:0%
yeah seeing no further from Mr PR Mr
 
02:01:32.750 --> 02:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
told me he was gonna get me um
 
02:01:34.350 --> 02:01:34.360 align:start position:0%
representative Murray would you like to
 
02:01:36.270 --> 02:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
um provide some clarity to committee on
 
02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
The Possession limits currently as we
 
02:01:41.149 --> 02:01:41.159 align:start position:0%
discussed sure Mr chair um I was just
 
02:01:42.790 --> 02:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
going to say I wonder if maybe the two
 
02:01:45.270 --> 02:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
ounces came from the fact that two anas
 
02:01:46.910 --> 02:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
is The Possession for if you have a
 
02:01:50.629 --> 02:01:50.639 align:start position:0%
medical card currently um and then it's
 
02:01:52.510 --> 02:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
I believe 3/4 if you don't have a
 
02:01:55.589 --> 02:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
medical card um but well I hate to look
 
02:01:58.069 --> 02:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
stupid on the dis but for representative
 
02:01:59.870 --> 02:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
Murray I'd be happy to do that um I
 
02:02:01.790 --> 02:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
guess that's what we're looking at here
 
02:02:04.709 --> 02:02:04.719 align:start position:0%
representative Muse is the medical uh
 
02:02:07.109 --> 02:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
limit there so I wouldn't support an
 
02:02:08.830 --> 02:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
amendment for that then yeah well
 
02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
actually so what you'd be right now it's
 
02:02:16.229 --> 02:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
a uh violation if you have more than the
 
02:02:19.229 --> 02:02:19.239 align:start position:0%
the 3/4 of no up to 3/4 of anounces of
 
02:02:22.270 --> 02:02:22.280 align:start position:0%
ation above that I believe is a
 
02:02:25.950 --> 02:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
crime so what this bill would do would
 
02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
make it legal to have up to two ounces
 
02:02:34.550 --> 02:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's a big jump from from a violation
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
at three
 
02:02:37.629 --> 02:02:37.639 align:start position:0%
quarters do you see what I mean I I see
 
02:02:39.910 --> 02:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
what you mean that's a if the two o if
 
02:02:42.669 --> 02:02:42.679 align:start position:0%
the 2 ounces is Medical Only yeah we
 
02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
could amend it to say that I mean if
 
02:02:46.310 --> 02:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
that's if that yeah I think the
 
02:02:48.669 --> 02:02:48.679 align:start position:0%
amendment would be that the the part
 
02:02:51.270 --> 02:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
that isn't Criminal would be the part
 
02:02:54.669 --> 02:02:54.679 align:start position:0%
that whatever is legal for for people
 
02:02:56.310 --> 02:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
without a medical card leaving the
 
02:02:58.470 --> 02:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
medical part out of this whole bill
 
02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
basically yes because they're already
 
02:03:03.629 --> 02:03:03.639 align:start position:0%
exempt yes correct okay
 
02:03:07.350 --> 02:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
so all right representative
 
02:03:09.189 --> 02:03:09.199 align:start position:0%
Stone after looking at your bill and
 
02:03:10.589 --> 02:03:10.599 align:start position:0%
listening to your testimony and some of
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
the things have come up today uh I guess
 
02:03:14.069 --> 02:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
this more kind of a statement but if
 
02:03:15.990 --> 02:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to be doing any uh
 
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
amendments I'd be more inclined to
 
02:03:20.550 --> 02:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
support misdemeanor level offenses
 
02:03:22.030 --> 02:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
versus any felony drug trafficking
 
02:03:24.390 --> 02:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
offenses such as you know intend to
 
02:03:27.030 --> 02:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
distribute non-narcotics under
 
02:03:29.470 --> 02:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
318b so if you're looking at crafting a
 
02:03:31.589 --> 02:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
bill I would urge you to take a look at
 
02:03:34.189 --> 02:03:34.199 align:start position:0%
your levels of offenses for analment
 
02:03:36.589 --> 02:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
represent Stone um I had the same
 
02:03:38.950 --> 02:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
concern but it maybe you'll find it in
 
02:03:40.669 --> 02:03:40.679 align:start position:0%
the bill but I believe what he's
 
02:03:43.390 --> 02:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
represented to us is that that wouldn't
 
02:03:45.870 --> 02:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
qualify for the analment those level of
 
02:03:47.790 --> 02:03:47.800 align:start position:0%
charges it only would qualify for
 
02:03:49.830 --> 02:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor below yeah for people with
 
02:03:51.870 --> 02:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
and i would support that yeah anything
 
02:03:53.669 --> 02:03:53.679 align:start position:0%
just to clarify if I may Mr chairman
 
02:03:58.709 --> 02:03:58.719 align:start position:0%
yeah sure um anything that is where the
 
02:04:00.430 --> 02:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
possession limit is at so right now The
 
02:04:02.030 --> 02:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
Possession limit is three4 of an ounce
 
02:04:04.270 --> 02:04:04.280 align:start position:0%
if you have anything over that it
 
02:04:05.910 --> 02:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't apply so followup is how can
 
02:04:07.830 --> 02:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
anybody in the state prison for those
 
02:04:09.870 --> 02:04:09.880 align:start position:0%
amounts yeah that's well I'm interested
 
02:04:11.589 --> 02:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
to see what numbers are too and he's
 
02:04:13.030 --> 02:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
going to get those for us believe thank
 
02:04:16.750 --> 02:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
you um I would encourage everybody to uh
 
02:04:18.629 --> 02:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
to read this bill thoroughly between now
 
02:04:21.350 --> 02:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
and Friday um because obviously none of
 
02:04:24.549 --> 02:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
us have so um it is four pages long but
 
02:04:27.030 --> 02:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
we need to dig into it further questions
 
02:04:29.669 --> 02:04:29.679 align:start position:0%
for representative
 
02:04:32.990 --> 02:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
Newman yeah I'm I'm I'm just curious as
 
02:04:36.109 --> 02:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
on page uh two at the top of the page
 
02:04:37.910 --> 02:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
where all of the all of
 
02:04:41.069 --> 02:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
these um directions on what what shall
 
02:04:42.830 --> 02:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
be an offense and related offense and
 
02:04:44.109 --> 02:04:44.119 align:start position:0%
what they have to prove and go through
 
02:04:48.549 --> 02:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
all of that um I'm I'm just wondering if
 
02:04:51.149 --> 02:04:51.159 align:start position:0%
if that needs to be that detailed in the
 
02:04:53.470 --> 02:04:53.480 align:start position:0%
bill or is there some way you could do
 
02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:54.430 align:start position:0%
bill or is there some way you could do
it

02:04:54.430 --> 02:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:04:57.870 --> 02:04:57.880 align:start position:0%
without quite all of that
 
02:04:59.910 --> 02:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
information I'll talk to you offline
 
02:05:02.030 --> 02:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
yeah if you could clarify that question
 
02:05:03.629 --> 02:05:03.639 align:start position:0%
talk to you offline
 
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:06.719 align:start position:0%
um yeah although any simplifications
 
02:05:09.069 --> 02:05:09.079 align:start position:0%
would be appreciated um see you no
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you thank you
 
02:05:13.030 --> 02:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
what we
 
02:05:16.069 --> 02:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
got chair calls Dr Hannah The Honorable
 
02:05:16.079 --> 02:05:17.669 align:start position:0%
got chair calls Dr Hannah The Honorable
Dr

02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%
Dr
 
02:05:17.679 --> 02:05:23.189 align:start position:0%
Dr
Hannon

02:05:23.189 --> 02:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:24.510 --> 02:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair and members of
 
02:05:26.709 --> 02:05:26.719 align:start position:0%
the committee uh my name is Joe Hannon
 
02:05:28.270 --> 02:05:28.280 align:start position:0%
uh a little bit of quick background I
 
02:05:30.310 --> 02:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
was on the uh first study commission to
 
02:05:31.669 --> 02:05:31.679 align:start position:0%
study legalization and taxation of
 
02:05:33.589 --> 02:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
marijuana and back in I think it was
 
02:05:36.270 --> 02:05:36.280 align:start position:0%
2018 um and I was also involved in
 
02:05:37.870 --> 02:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
writing legislation for the last several
 
02:05:39.189 --> 02:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
helping with the legislation for the
 
02:05:40.589 --> 02:05:40.599 align:start position:0%
last several years for
 
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
legalization um a lot of what I wanted
 
02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
to say was already said which is great
 
02:05:45.669 --> 02:05:45.679 align:start position:0%
because it'll cut my time down so that's
 
02:05:47.030 --> 02:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
why I did a little longer introduction
 
02:05:50.669 --> 02:05:50.679 align:start position:0%
sorry um you know jobs housing another
 
02:05:51.950 --> 02:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
thing that was left out was student
 
02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
loans people and I have a senior in high
 
02:05:54.950 --> 02:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
school right now if someone is a
 
02:05:56.549 --> 02:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
conviction they can't even get student
 
02:05:58.830 --> 02:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
loans uh for felony convictions on their
 
02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
record it's very difficult uh housing uh
 
02:06:03.950 --> 02:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
all kinds of stuff so we hear about the
 
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
harms that drugs can cause and that's
 
02:06:07.990 --> 02:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
why we have locked people up for so long
 
02:06:09.870 --> 02:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
and that's our rationale but we never
 
02:06:11.270 --> 02:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
look at the other side of it which is
 
02:06:13.589 --> 02:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
how much harm we've caused because of
 
02:06:15.149 --> 02:06:15.159 align:start position:0%
locking people up taking away their
 
02:06:16.589 --> 02:06:16.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have a job to have a
 
02:06:19.189 --> 02:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
college education to have a home these
 
02:06:21.189 --> 02:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
are things that are even more important
 
02:06:22.830 --> 02:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
and I I don't want to debate whether
 
02:06:24.830 --> 02:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
it's uh worth putting someone in prison
 
02:06:26.709 --> 02:06:26.719 align:start position:0%
or not releasing clearing their record
 
02:06:28.350 --> 02:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
because you know they were under 3/4 of
 
02:06:31.910 --> 02:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
an ounce or they had 3/4 plus 001 ounces
 
02:06:33.229 --> 02:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
that would put them over the limit now
 
02:06:34.430 --> 02:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
they have to live with this for the rest
 
02:06:36.229 --> 02:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
of their lives I think it's silly that
 
02:06:38.310 --> 02:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to potentially profit as a
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
state like we heard and that we're still
 
02:06:41.709 --> 02:06:41.719 align:start position:0%
going to keep people held accountable
 
02:06:43.189 --> 02:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
for things that now the state is
 
02:06:45.310 --> 02:06:45.320 align:start position:0%
currently making money off of I think
 
02:06:47.270 --> 02:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
it's egregious and it's and this bill
 
02:06:48.910 --> 02:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
says I think the words are actually in
 
02:06:48.920 --> 02:06:50.390 align:start position:0%
says I think the words are actually in
here

02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:06:53.470 --> 02:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
um you know the uh there should be a
 
02:06:55.149 --> 02:06:55.159 align:start position:0%
presumption that the granting the
 
02:06:56.430 --> 02:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
position would be in the interest of
 
02:06:58.069 --> 02:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
Justice due to the decriminalization or
 
02:07:00.189 --> 02:07:00.199 align:start position:0%
legalization of cannabis for adults and
 
02:07:02.910 --> 02:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
the unequal enforcement of cannabis laws
 
02:07:05.790 --> 02:07:05.800 align:start position:0%
that that sounds uh uh we've heard
 
02:07:07.549 --> 02:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
people ask we've heard people ask uh how
 
02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
many people are still in jail for these
 
02:07:10.350 --> 02:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
offenses we have to look at the
 
02:07:12.270 --> 02:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
percentage of people U of either
 
02:07:14.830 --> 02:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
minorities people of color who have been
 
02:07:16.910 --> 02:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
incarcerated disproportionately the
 
02:07:18.589 --> 02:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
numbers of people that actually use most
 
02:07:20.270 --> 02:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
drugs and alcohol is pretty much the
 
02:07:23.189 --> 02:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
same um you know you might have differ
 
02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
slight differences in specifics about
 
02:07:27.069 --> 02:07:27.079 align:start position:0%
what drugs are used and when but really
 
02:07:28.669 --> 02:07:28.679 align:start position:0%
uh the the use the the rates for
 
02:07:30.669 --> 02:07:30.679 align:start position:0%
addiction are not that different across
 
02:07:34.270 --> 02:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
racial and uh economic uh lines so
 
02:07:35.549 --> 02:07:35.559 align:start position:0%
because it's been disproportionately
 
02:07:37.069 --> 02:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
enforced even in New Hampshire I believe
 
02:07:38.910 --> 02:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
the numbers were I think one out of four
 
02:07:41.030 --> 02:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
times more likely or four or five times
 
02:07:43.229 --> 02:07:43.239 align:start position:0%
more likely to be incarcerated um I
 
02:07:46.149 --> 02:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
think it's an egregious um wrong that
 
02:07:48.510 --> 02:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be writed and also our own
 
02:07:50.030 --> 02:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
state constitution says the crime must
 
02:07:52.229 --> 02:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
fit the punishment so someone who has
 
02:07:54.350 --> 02:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
34s of an ounce should be able to get
 
02:07:55.750 --> 02:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
their records an olded I definitely
 
02:07:57.189 --> 02:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
agree with that but should someone with
 
02:08:00.189 --> 02:08:00.199 align:start position:0%
three quarters and plus 0.001 because
 
02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
that's all you need to do to go over the
 
02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
limit in something the difference
 
02:08:04.470 --> 02:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
between a drug dealer and someone who
 
02:08:06.830 --> 02:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
just has it for possession for cocaine
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
fentanyl is one gram if you're 1.001
 
02:08:11.990 --> 02:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
over you're now a dealer whether it was
 
02:08:14.109 --> 02:08:14.119 align:start position:0%
yours or not there's no you know they
 
02:08:15.589 --> 02:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
didn't have to photograph you selling it
 
02:08:16.990 --> 02:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
to a child necessarily to convince
 
02:08:18.109 --> 02:08:18.119 align:start position:0%
people that you were dealing it's the
 
02:08:18.119 --> 02:08:19.310 align:start position:0%
people that you were dealing it's the
number

02:08:19.310 --> 02:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:08:20.910 --> 02:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
and I think that's uh it's a very
 
02:08:22.750 --> 02:08:22.760 align:start position:0%
arbitrary and I think ultimately
 
02:08:25.149 --> 02:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
capricious act that uh we've had in our
 
02:08:27.229 --> 02:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
laws for a long time that I need I think
 
02:08:30.030 --> 02:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely must be overcome and also uh
 
02:08:31.950 --> 02:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that it was this bill it might
 
02:08:34.069 --> 02:08:34.079 align:start position:0%
have a higher limit for The Possession
 
02:08:35.629 --> 02:08:35.639 align:start position:0%
it's not changing the possession limit
 
02:08:37.229 --> 02:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily it's changing the it's
 
02:08:38.790 --> 02:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
allowing people to have their records
 
02:08:40.709 --> 02:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
aned for that limit so someone who may
 
02:08:42.870 --> 02:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
have had an ounce and got arrested years
 
02:08:44.990 --> 02:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
ago now they may be a medical card
 
02:08:46.750 --> 02:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
patient and they now can have 2 ounces
 
02:08:48.030 --> 02:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
but that person wouldn't be eligible
 
02:08:49.549 --> 02:08:49.559 align:start position:0%
unless we can raise that number to what
 
02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
they can currently hold so uh we don't
 
02:08:53.390 --> 02:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
do this for alcohol there's no
 
02:08:55.189 --> 02:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
possession limits for alcohol I it's a
 
02:08:57.229 --> 02:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
totally different discussion but I think
 
02:08:58.470 --> 02:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
if we're going to put numbers on it we
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
should put the most uh you know uh
 
02:09:02.669 --> 02:09:02.679 align:start position:0%
accommodating number we can to help the
 
02:09:05.109 --> 02:09:05.119 align:start position:0%
most number of people to pursue jobs
 
02:09:08.870 --> 02:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
pursue Advanced uh education and um to
 
02:09:10.669 --> 02:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
change their lives and write some of the
 
02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
wrongs that have happened due to our
 
02:09:14.830 --> 02:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
past laws I'd be happy to take any
 
02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:19.069 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
um

02:09:19.069 --> 02:09:19.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:22.709 --> 02:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
I would say baby steps um but you make
 
02:09:26.149 --> 02:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
sense my question though is regarding
 
02:09:28.549 --> 02:09:28.559 align:start position:0%
well I would suggest that if if we pass
 
02:09:30.950 --> 02:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
this with the small limits and then we
 
02:09:32.430 --> 02:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
passed that then it's a different
 
02:09:35.390 --> 02:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
argument right now it's still illegal so
 
02:09:37.549 --> 02:09:37.559 align:start position:0%
um regarding
 
02:09:37.559 --> 02:09:39.149 align:start position:0%
um regarding
Firearms

02:09:39.149 --> 02:09:39.159 align:start position:0%
Firearms
 
02:09:42.830 --> 02:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
annulments are are not the same as a
 
02:09:45.310 --> 02:09:45.320 align:start position:0%
pardon in my understanding right so
 
02:09:46.870 --> 02:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
someone will still have a Nicks record
 
02:09:49.109 --> 02:09:49.119 align:start position:0%
and still be prohibited even if we anull
 
02:09:50.950 --> 02:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
their records is that that your
 
02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:54.149 align:start position:0%
their records is that that your
understanding

02:09:54.149 --> 02:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:56.109 --> 02:09:56.119 align:start position:0%
um I'm not really sure I'm not an
 
02:09:58.109 --> 02:09:58.119 align:start position:0%
attorney so I don't want to testify on
 
02:09:59.549 --> 02:09:59.559 align:start position:0%
the record for that um I wish you would
 
02:10:01.069 --> 02:10:01.079 align:start position:0%
tell that to representative whole but go
 
02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:10.390 --> 02:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
I um sorry yeah
 
02:10:13.790 --> 02:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
um I I it does say that uh they don't
 
02:10:15.870 --> 02:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
have to anull you know for reasons of
 
02:10:18.549 --> 02:10:18.559 align:start position:0%
Justice you know um in the interest
 
02:10:19.709 --> 02:10:19.719 align:start position:0%
annulments will not be in the interest
 
02:10:20.910 --> 02:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
of justice so that can be proven it
 
02:10:22.430 --> 02:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't even matter what the charge is
 
02:10:24.390 --> 02:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh they asked about selling specifically
 
02:10:26.310 --> 02:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
this bill does not allow for annulment
 
02:10:27.629 --> 02:10:27.639 align:start position:0%
in the instances where someone was
 
02:10:30.350 --> 02:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
selling to a to a minor or to a child uh
 
02:10:31.629 --> 02:10:31.639 align:start position:0%
that is in the bill I believe it's on
 
02:10:34.750 --> 02:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
page two uh line 30 an adult
 
02:10:35.950 --> 02:10:35.960 align:start position:0%
Distributing cannabis to a minor or
 
02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
using a minor to sell cannabis or uh for
 
02:10:41.069 --> 02:10:41.079 align:start position:0%
for negligently storing marijana infused
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
products causing a minor to access them
 
02:10:45.549 --> 02:10:45.559 align:start position:0%
so even if your kid got into your supply
 
02:10:47.310 --> 02:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
or got into your medicine that would be
 
02:10:48.790 --> 02:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
something that would not not be allowed
 
02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:51.119 align:start position:0%
to be aned under this bill and anytime
 
02:10:52.589 --> 02:10:52.599 align:start position:0%
not just selling it but having
 
02:10:54.390 --> 02:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
convincing another child to minor to
 
02:10:56.310 --> 02:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
sell it would also be not an nullable uh
 
02:10:58.830 --> 02:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
behavior and um I think this is a good
 
02:11:00.350 --> 02:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
bill for adults it still protects
 
02:11:02.510 --> 02:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
children to a very strong degree and as
 
02:11:04.709 --> 02:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
far as secondary crimes if someone uh
 
02:11:10.109 --> 02:11:10.119 align:start position:0%
has if someone never had um a if someone
 
02:11:11.990 --> 02:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
got possession and say when they were 18
 
02:11:15.030 --> 02:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
years old and they got arrested for that
 
02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
um it's a felony conviction it's on the
 
02:11:18.910 --> 02:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
Nicks system they can't have a fire
 
02:11:21.270 --> 02:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
I I I'm curious to know what that would
 
02:11:22.910 --> 02:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
mean like you like you were asking what
 
02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
it will mean uh federally but if
 
02:11:26.990 --> 02:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
something's an olded it's you'd think
 
02:11:28.629 --> 02:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
that it would never have happened but I
 
02:11:30.109 --> 02:11:30.119 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's the case for Nicks
 
02:11:31.390 --> 02:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
and also even if it was how do you get
 
02:11:33.189 --> 02:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
off the Nick system which is a totally
 
02:11:35.229 --> 02:11:35.239 align:start position:0%
separate debate technically I would
 
02:11:36.990 --> 02:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
believe that the agency that submitted
 
02:11:38.270 --> 02:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
the record would have to withdraw the
 
02:11:41.589 --> 02:11:41.599 align:start position:0%
record but annulment doesn't isn't the
 
02:11:44.990 --> 02:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
same as a pardon it only makes it public
 
02:11:47.030 --> 02:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
facing I believe that it doesn't exist
 
02:11:49.390 --> 02:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
so for your points with regard to um
 
02:11:51.709 --> 02:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
housing Etc but I believe for law
 
02:11:53.270 --> 02:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement the record's still there and
 
02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
it still exists but I I could be wrong
 
02:11:56.549 --> 02:11:56.559 align:start position:0%
myself that's why I was curious to know
 
02:11:59.709 --> 02:11:59.719 align:start position:0%
if you um put on your Firearms hat if if
 
02:12:01.470 --> 02:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
that was the case well if you became
 
02:12:03.189 --> 02:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
Governor you could pardon everybody I
 
02:12:06.549 --> 02:12:06.559 align:start position:0%
could but I won't be doing that so um
 
02:12:09.470 --> 02:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
worth a shot yeah represent Manion thank
 
02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
question yes I'm still confused because
 
02:12:14.950 --> 02:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing conflicting conflicting
 
02:12:17.350 --> 02:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
testimony you you mentioned felony level
 
02:12:20.109 --> 02:12:20.119 align:start position:0%
conviction so would this also apply to
 
02:12:22.549 --> 02:12:22.559 align:start position:0%
not only the person who had a misam
 
02:12:24.430 --> 02:12:24.440 align:start position:0%
possession charge but also a felony
 
02:12:27.030 --> 02:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
dealing charge as well uh it would have
 
02:12:30.629 --> 02:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
to be under the limit um
 
02:12:30.639 --> 02:12:33.549 align:start position:0%
to be under the limit um
because

02:12:33.549 --> 02:12:33.559 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:12:36.030 --> 02:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
so drug dealing does not necessarily
 
02:12:37.910 --> 02:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
mean someone was a drug dealer it's you
 
02:12:39.510 --> 02:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's often times B I mean if someone has
 
02:12:42.310 --> 02:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
a film of you if they if they record you
 
02:12:44.069 --> 02:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
and you can ask the police the if anyone
 
02:12:45.149 --> 02:12:45.159 align:start position:0%
officers are going to testify they'll
 
02:12:46.790 --> 02:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
probably know even better than I am but
 
02:12:49.510 --> 02:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
if someone is uh in the act of you know
 
02:12:50.589 --> 02:12:50.599 align:start position:0%
caught in the act of selling they can
 
02:12:53.790 --> 02:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
say someone's been been dealing but it's
 
02:12:55.830 --> 02:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
often based on the amount if you look at
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
the the the rsas for the for the
 
02:12:59.589 --> 02:12:59.599 align:start position:0%
penalties intent to distribute the
 
02:13:01.950 --> 02:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
intent to distribute right so intent to
 
02:13:04.830 --> 02:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
distribute would be something um purely
 
02:13:08.549 --> 02:13:08.559 align:start position:0%
based on weight or amount um if you're
 
02:13:11.189 --> 02:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
raising The Possession limits then you
 
02:13:13.069 --> 02:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
would have to change that even for for
 
02:13:14.629 --> 02:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
felony offenses if it's a small amount
 
02:13:16.109 --> 02:13:16.119 align:start position:0%
now this would not cover someone who had
 
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
50 pounds or even a a pound that would
 
02:13:21.149 --> 02:13:21.159 align:start position:0%
be out of the purview of this unless for
 
02:13:22.390 --> 02:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
some reason they changed the possession
 
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
limits to be equal U to be the same as
 
02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
the alcohol laws which we have which you
 
02:13:27.950 --> 02:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
can get a whole truckload of Hennessy
 
02:13:29.830 --> 02:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
and drive it wherever you
 
02:13:32.390 --> 02:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
want I think thef would disagree with
 
02:13:34.669 --> 02:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
that um I do want follow up on that so
 
02:13:37.629 --> 02:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
you were talking about three qus 225
 
02:13:39.790 --> 02:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
right they would be considered felony
 
02:13:42.350 --> 02:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
intend to distribute possibly I I have
 
02:13:44.229 --> 02:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
to check all right so my question would
 
02:13:45.910 --> 02:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
be is where do we draw the line there so
 
02:13:47.629 --> 02:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
how do we know the person in jail for
 
02:13:47.639 --> 02:13:48.669 align:start position:0%
how do we know the person in jail for
intent

02:13:48.669 --> 02:13:48.679 align:start position:0%
intent
 
02:13:50.470 --> 02:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
was dealing 50 pounds
 
02:13:53.430 --> 02:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
or you know 1 ounce we wouldn't know
 
02:13:54.750 --> 02:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
that so they would all be eligible for
 
02:13:57.790 --> 02:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
annulments according to this bill uh I
 
02:13:59.109 --> 02:13:59.119 align:start position:0%
guess it would I imagine it would depend
 
02:14:00.189 --> 02:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
on what they were convicted of if they
 
02:14:02.069 --> 02:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
were convicted of a certain amount they
 
02:14:03.350 --> 02:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
that would be in the court record I mean
 
02:14:04.470 --> 02:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
they would have to have the number if
 
02:14:06.709 --> 02:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
they don't have an amount to even put in
 
02:14:08.430 --> 02:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
the record then they don't have enough
 
02:14:10.430 --> 02:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
evidence to commit to to prosecute
 
02:14:13.589 --> 02:14:13.599 align:start position:0%
someone I would guess so all guess I'm
 
02:14:14.990 --> 02:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
not like I said I think we need to read
 
02:14:16.830 --> 02:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
through the bill real closely because
 
02:14:19.149 --> 02:14:19.159 align:start position:0%
yeah my understanding BAS the testimony
 
02:14:20.709 --> 02:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
is that there would be a court hearing
 
02:14:22.310 --> 02:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
where they would have to introduce
 
02:14:24.069 --> 02:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
evidence and part of that would have to
 
02:14:26.109 --> 02:14:26.119 align:start position:0%
say well look I only had this much
 
02:14:28.750 --> 02:14:28.760 align:start position:0%
versus someone trying to say well it's
 
02:14:30.910 --> 02:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
something and I think it it's tied to
 
02:14:33.390 --> 02:14:33.400 align:start position:0%
the amount that we legalize so if unless
 
02:14:35.470 --> 02:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
we legalize that amount so that's why
 
02:14:38.069 --> 02:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
I'm curious about the felony people
 
02:14:40.870 --> 02:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
incarcerated how can that be if this
 
02:14:42.470 --> 02:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
would only apply to people that have a
 
02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
certain amount so we're going to have to
 
02:14:43.679 --> 02:14:45.149 align:start position:0%
certain amount so we're going to have to
sort

02:14:45.149 --> 02:14:45.159 align:start position:0%
sort
 
02:14:47.870 --> 02:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
that on page three line four all
 
02:14:49.589 --> 02:14:49.599 align:start position:0%
convictions and arrests for misdemeanor
 
02:14:51.069 --> 02:14:51.079 align:start position:0%
or violation level offenses for
 
02:14:52.229 --> 02:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
possession of cannabis shall be
 
02:14:54.430 --> 02:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
automatically an olded within 6 months
 
02:14:55.430 --> 02:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
the effectivity of the section of
 
02:14:56.589 --> 02:14:56.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety shall remove any
 
02:14:57.790 --> 02:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
such qualified convictions from its
 
02:14:59.189 --> 02:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
records and notify the court from which
 
02:15:00.790 --> 02:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
the case originated which shall place an
 
02:15:02.350 --> 02:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
order of analment in the court file and
 
02:15:04.069 --> 02:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
thereafter process the file in the same
 
02:15:06.430 --> 02:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
manner as any other anold case so for
 
02:15:08.990 --> 02:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
just the violations of misdemeanors it's
 
02:15:11.030 --> 02:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
automatic they they have to do it now
 
02:15:12.669 --> 02:15:12.679 align:start position:0%
you can petition the you can go to the
 
02:15:14.069 --> 02:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
court and say or the department of
 
02:15:15.709 --> 02:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
safety and say hey check my record is it
 
02:15:17.390 --> 02:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
clear if not you can still petition to
 
02:15:19.069 --> 02:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
go to court and have it fixed this is
 
02:15:21.430 --> 02:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
for any violations or not violations
 
02:15:24.229 --> 02:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
sorry bad word for crimes beyond the
 
02:15:25.629 --> 02:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and violation level that
 
02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
would have to be uh heard in court and
 
02:15:30.069 --> 02:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
potentially for
 
02:15:33.390 --> 02:15:33.400 align:start position:0%
resentencing thank you does that help
 
02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:36.149 align:start position:0%
resentencing thank you does that help

16 um thank you for allowing me to bring
 
02:35:28.950 --> 02:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1270 involving a small but
 
02:35:31.429 --> 02:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
extremely important fix for our County
 
02:35:34.230 --> 02:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
jails that this bill will provide I am
 
02:35:36.910 --> 02:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
doing this on behalf of superintendent
 
02:35:39.030 --> 02:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
Doug yzw of the cheser county department
 
02:35:41.349 --> 02:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
of corrections as well as the other
 
02:35:43.790 --> 02:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
County jails around the
 
02:35:47.550 --> 02:35:47.560 align:start position:0%
state um prior to giving giving you the
 
02:35:49.389 --> 02:35:49.399 align:start position:0%
specifics of this bill let me just say
 
02:35:51.630 --> 02:35:51.640 align:start position:0%
that my request today involves no
 
02:35:53.710 --> 02:35:53.720 align:start position:0%
judgment whatsoever on the corrections
 
02:35:56.309 --> 02:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
practices at the chesa county jail
 
02:35:58.349 --> 02:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
having practiced as a social worker in
 
02:36:01.309 --> 02:36:01.319 align:start position:0%
that Community for um decades I've had
 
02:36:03.349 --> 02:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
many opportunities to interact with
 
02:36:05.910 --> 02:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
staff and incarcerated people at the
 
02:36:09.309 --> 02:36:09.319 align:start position:0%
jail and um while the jail is far from
 
02:36:12.349 --> 02:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
the best place to provide services for
 
02:36:14.150 --> 02:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
mental health and substance misuse
 
02:36:16.429 --> 02:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
issues I can attest to the the fact that
 
02:36:19.070 --> 02:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
going way back in time our County County
 
02:36:21.590 --> 02:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
Jail has been a leader in attending to
 
02:36:23.790 --> 02:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
the mental health and substance misuse
 
02:36:26.230 --> 02:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
issues that are so prevalent among those
 
02:36:29.510 --> 02:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
incarcerated there
 
02:36:32.389 --> 02:36:32.399 align:start position:0%
um the issue addressed in House Bill
 
02:36:34.910 --> 02:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
1270 is a requirement that has been in
 
02:36:38.429 --> 02:36:38.439 align:start position:0%
statue at least since the late 1980s and
 
02:36:42.870 --> 02:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
I want to refer you to um chapter RSA
 
02:36:47.510 --> 02:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
chapter 172b that I gave out and um
 
02:36:49.710 --> 02:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
Point your attention specifically to
 
02:36:56.750 --> 02:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:59.550 --> 02:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
3 it says that intoxicated or
 
02:37:01.550 --> 02:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
incapacitated individuals were brought
 
02:37:04.630 --> 02:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
to the jail for a maximum 24-hour stay
 
02:37:06.990 --> 02:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
for protective custody so these are
 
02:37:08.750 --> 02:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
people who are picked up someplace by
 
02:37:10.710 --> 02:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
law enforcement um they haven't
 
02:37:13.910 --> 02:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
committed a crime but they are um so
 
02:37:17.389 --> 02:37:17.399 align:start position:0%
intoxicated that they are unable to um
 
02:37:20.750 --> 02:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
be safe or maybe might create a safety
 
02:37:23.030 --> 02:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
concern for somebody else that the
 
02:37:26.630 --> 02:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
current practice is that they are um
 
02:37:28.550 --> 02:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
they can be taken to a county jail and
 
02:37:31.630 --> 02:37:31.640 align:start position:0%
the county jail has to um admit them for
 
02:37:35.190 --> 02:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:38.590 --> 02:37:38.600 align:start position:0%
hours so if you look at this RSA you
 
02:37:41.070 --> 02:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
will see that
 
02:37:42.790 --> 02:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:37:46.469 --> 02:37:46.479 align:start position:0%
jail is um immed immediately upon
 
02:37:48.750 --> 02:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
lodging said person in protective
 
02:37:48.760 --> 02:37:51.550 align:start position:0%
lodging said person in protective
custody

02:37:51.550 --> 02:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
custody
 
02:37:55.230 --> 02:37:55.240 align:start position:0%
um the Corrections Officers must contact
 
02:37:57.870 --> 02:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
an alcohol counselor a clinical staff
 
02:38:00.389 --> 02:38:00.399 align:start position:0%
person An approved alcohol treatment
 
02:38:04.110 --> 02:38:04.120 align:start position:0%
person a nurse etc etc basically it says
 
02:38:06.030 --> 02:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
that anybody who is admitted for
 
02:38:07.710 --> 02:38:07.720 align:start position:0%
protective custody must have an
 
02:38:10.670 --> 02:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
immediate assessment in terms of their
 
02:38:16.950 --> 02:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
medical and um substance misuse needs
 
02:38:19.750 --> 02:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
so this is far beyond what is required
 
02:38:22.429 --> 02:38:22.439 align:start position:0%
for somebody who is brought to the jail
 
02:38:25.269 --> 02:38:25.279 align:start position:0%
by law enforcement because they are
 
02:38:28.910 --> 02:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
charged with a crime um and many of the
 
02:38:32.309 --> 02:38:32.319 align:start position:0%
jails um um superintendent y yawe just
 
02:38:35.590 --> 02:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
told me that um more than half of the
 
02:38:39.230 --> 02:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
jails do not have um nursing or other
 
02:38:42.070 --> 02:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
medical staff or substance misuse
 
02:38:46.590 --> 02:38:46.600 align:start position:0%
professionals um that are on staff 247
 
02:38:50.030 --> 02:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
seven so essentially this has been a
 
02:38:52.710 --> 02:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
requirement that has not been complied
 
02:38:55.120 --> 02:38:55.130 align:start position:0%
with for decades which
 
02:38:55.130 --> 02:38:56.750 align:start position:0%
with for decades which
[Music]

02:38:56.750 --> 02:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:38:58.870 --> 02:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
um is not really fair to the
 
02:39:02.750 --> 02:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
incarcerated people um but it is also
 
02:39:06.269 --> 02:39:06.279 align:start position:0%
creates uh tremendous liability for the
 
02:39:09.309 --> 02:39:09.319 align:start position:0%
counties and the um and the corrections
 
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:16.830 align:start position:0%
 
counties

02:39:16.830 --> 02:39:16.840 align:start position:0%
counties
 
02:39:20.349 --> 02:39:20.359 align:start position:0%
it also it also is not it it it's not
 
02:39:22.750 --> 02:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
parody with people who are arrested for
 
02:39:27.670 --> 02:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
a crime so really the the um focus of
 
02:39:37.590 --> 02:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:39.670 --> 02:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
requirement while we do not want the
 
02:39:41.230 --> 02:39:41.240 align:start position:0%
County Corrections departments to be
 
02:39:43.030 --> 02:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
saddled with an impossible to comply
 
02:39:45.110 --> 02:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
with requirement we want to make sure
 
02:39:47.349 --> 02:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
that this change in no way compromises
 
02:39:49.990 --> 02:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
the safety of those who are housed for
 
02:39:52.269 --> 02:39:52.279 align:start position:0%
protective custody therefore we have
 
02:39:54.469 --> 02:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
added a stipulation that if in the
 
02:39:56.750 --> 02:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
Judgment of law enforcement or the
 
02:39:58.870 --> 02:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
corrections admitting staff there's a
 
02:39:58.880 --> 02:40:00.110 align:start position:0%
corrections admitting staff there's a
potential

02:40:00.110 --> 02:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
potential
 
02:40:02.990 --> 02:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
life-threatening um emergency then there
 
02:40:05.269 --> 02:40:05.279 align:start position:0%
will be a request that the delivering
 
02:40:07.670 --> 02:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
police agency have the incapacitated or
 
02:40:10.030 --> 02:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
impaired person cleared by a hospital
 
02:40:13.190 --> 02:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
emergency room this is not my area of
 
02:40:16.670 --> 02:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
expertise but I am told that um
 
02:40:19.030 --> 02:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
cooperatively these decisions are made
 
02:40:21.309 --> 02:40:21.319 align:start position:0%
all the time only in the case when
 
02:40:23.110 --> 02:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
there's a life-threatening emergency and
 
02:40:25.590 --> 02:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
this is standard practice I mean there
 
02:40:27.190 --> 02:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
might be people who testify who say
 
02:40:28.429 --> 02:40:28.439 align:start position:0%
that's the case and there might be
 
02:40:30.070 --> 02:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
people who testify say that's not the
 
02:40:33.950 --> 02:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
case but that is my understanding
 
02:40:38.389 --> 02:40:38.399 align:start position:0%
um our our ini our initial initial um
 
02:40:41.870 --> 02:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
idea was to have everyone who was coming
 
02:40:43.830 --> 02:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
for protective custody be cleared by an
 
02:40:47.230 --> 02:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
emergency room and
 
02:40:49.870 --> 02:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
um in retrospect that was not a good
 
02:40:52.190 --> 02:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
idea I mean the emergency rooms are
 
02:40:57.110 --> 02:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
already um overwhelmed um these people
 
02:40:58.510 --> 02:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
would be more prone to being
 
02:41:00.990 --> 02:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
uncooperative than other people um and
 
02:41:03.710 --> 02:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
not everyone who is drunk or
 
02:41:07.429 --> 02:41:07.439 align:start position:0%
incapacitated by um drugs is really
 
02:41:10.070 --> 02:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
having a life-threatening
 
02:41:12.110 --> 02:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
emergency so thank you for giving
 
02:41:14.990 --> 02:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
consideration to House Bill 1270 while
 
02:41:17.349 --> 02:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not wed to all of the specific
 
02:41:19.790 --> 02:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
language um and there's some additional
 
02:41:23.269 --> 02:41:23.279 align:start position:0%
language that kind of um codifies The
 
02:41:25.910 --> 02:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
process by which law enforcement ends up
 
02:41:27.790 --> 02:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
bringing someone to the jail like that
 
02:41:31.469 --> 02:41:31.479 align:start position:0%
they might um check with family first or
 
02:41:34.389 --> 02:41:34.399 align:start position:0%
um see if there's a friend who can take
 
02:41:38.110 --> 02:41:38.120 align:start position:0%
um that P responsibility for that person
 
02:41:41.429 --> 02:41:41.439 align:start position:0%
um if any of the other language um that
 
02:41:47.230 --> 02:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
we've um tweaked is um a problem I hope
 
02:41:49.150 --> 02:41:49.160 align:start position:0%
that once this committee has the bill
 
02:41:53.150 --> 02:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
that they will focus on Roman num 3 of
 
02:41:53.160 --> 02:41:54.630 align:start position:0%
that they will focus on Roman num 3 of
section

02:41:54.630 --> 02:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:41:59.190 --> 02:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
172b colon 3 which is um a
 
02:42:03.190 --> 02:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
longstanding problem for um for our
 
02:42:05.510 --> 02:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
Corrections agencies to not be complying
 
02:42:06.670 --> 02:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
with our own
 
02:42:08.870 --> 02:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
laws thank you and I'm willing to take
 
02:42:10.750 --> 02:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
questions although I know superintendent
 
02:42:13.030 --> 02:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
Yaz from the chesher Department of
 
02:42:14.990 --> 02:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
Corrections is here and he might be able
 
02:42:17.389 --> 02:42:17.399 align:start position:0%
to answer answer technical questions
 
02:42:20.790 --> 02:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
better than I thank you um in reading
 
02:42:20.800 --> 02:42:21.670 align:start position:0%
better than I thank you um in reading
the

02:42:21.670 --> 02:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:42:23.910 --> 02:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
statute I I maybe have a different take
 
02:42:27.790 --> 02:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
on it um your law or proposed law um
 
02:42:29.710 --> 02:42:29.720 align:start position:0%
deals more with you know covering
 
02:42:31.150 --> 02:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
whether it there's a medical emergency
 
02:42:33.429 --> 02:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
or a problem with the person my reading
 
02:42:35.750 --> 02:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
of the current statute is it's it was
 
02:42:39.190 --> 02:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
more of a um a a civil rights issue
 
02:42:41.469 --> 02:42:41.479 align:start position:0%
where the person would have to be in
 
02:42:43.110 --> 02:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
other words so that the police couldn't
 
02:42:44.590 --> 02:42:44.600 align:start position:0%
just say I'm taking you for protective
 
02:42:46.830 --> 02:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
custody cuz I think you're intoxicated
 
02:42:49.150 --> 02:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
and the person would be sober and say
 
02:42:50.269 --> 02:42:50.279 align:start position:0%
wait a minute you're just doing this to
 
02:42:54.230 --> 02:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
harass me this says here because it says
 
02:42:56.429 --> 02:42:56.439 align:start position:0%
they will determine whether said person
 
02:42:59.190 --> 02:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
is indeed capacitated so in other words
 
02:43:00.870 --> 02:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
it looked like a check on whether or not
 
02:43:02.790 --> 02:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
someone needed protective custody versus
 
02:43:05.110 --> 02:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
whether or not they needed medical help
 
02:43:05.120 --> 02:43:06.630 align:start position:0%
whether or not they needed medical help
um

02:43:06.630 --> 02:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:09.710 --> 02:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
so I guess my question is is if we
 
02:43:12.830 --> 02:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
remove that language is there any check
 
02:43:16.030 --> 02:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
on ensuring that someone put into
 
02:43:17.309 --> 02:43:17.319 align:start position:0%
protective custody because they're
 
02:43:18.870 --> 02:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
intoxicated actually needs the
 
02:43:21.710 --> 02:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
protective custody versus just someone
 
02:43:24.070 --> 02:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
doing that to them um and I have to read
 
02:43:26.150 --> 02:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
the protective custody Statute in full
 
02:43:29.110 --> 02:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me other states um offer
 
02:43:31.070 --> 02:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
breathalyzer or something of that nature
 
02:43:32.710 --> 02:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
to proove intoxication but I think we
 
02:43:35.150 --> 02:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
can discuss that with law enforcement um
 
02:43:39.269 --> 02:43:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:41.750 --> 02:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
that that is very good
 
02:43:44.550 --> 02:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
question Mike that is a very good
 
02:43:46.030 --> 02:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
question and I've never thought about it
 
02:43:48.710 --> 02:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
from that angle and that in part is
 
02:43:50.670 --> 02:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
because it was brought to me yeah um
 
02:43:53.030 --> 02:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
with a with a different interpretation
 
02:43:54.710 --> 02:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
um and so I would have to really think
 
02:43:56.950 --> 02:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
about that and look at that more myself
 
02:43:58.590 --> 02:43:58.600 align:start position:0%
we certainly wouldn't want
 
02:44:02.630 --> 02:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
people you know to be um sent to the
 
02:44:05.309 --> 02:44:05.319 align:start position:0%
county jail as some kind of punishment
 
02:44:06.590 --> 02:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
because they weren't getting along with
 
02:44:08.950 --> 02:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
a particular police officer
 
02:44:12.309 --> 02:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
right thank you um questions represent
 
02:44:15.269 --> 02:44:15.279 align:start position:0%
Newman yeah just a question about I used
 
02:44:17.790 --> 02:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
saying that intoxicated or incapacitated
 
02:44:20.309 --> 02:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
is removed by the bill and I'm not sure
 
02:44:23.630 --> 02:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
that I see that no I think that the the
 
02:44:25.990 --> 02:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
um having a medical professional
 
02:44:27.870 --> 02:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
determine that is what's removed isn't
 
02:44:30.550 --> 02:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
it it's still in there but it has thank
 
02:44:30.560 --> 02:44:38.870 align:start position:0%
it it's still in there but it has thank
you

02:44:38.870 --> 02:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:41.469 --> 02:44:41.479 align:start position:0%
yeah Sheriff call uh the chair calls
 
02:44:44.150 --> 02:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:44.160 --> 02:44:49.389 align:start position:0%
 
Wright

02:44:49.389 --> 02:44:49.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:50.590 --> 02:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman Roy and the
 
02:44:52.950 --> 02:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
members of this committee I'm belnap
 
02:44:55.389 --> 02:44:55.399 align:start position:0%
County Sheriff Bill Wright I am
 
02:44:56.750 --> 02:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
currently the secretary of the New
 
02:44:58.230 --> 02:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Sheriff's Association I'm
 
02:44:59.670 --> 02:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
representing uh the sheriff's
 
02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:01.269 align:start position:0%
representing uh the sheriff's
Association

02:45:01.269 --> 02:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
Association
 
02:45:04.630 --> 02:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
today I'm testifying in opposition to
 
02:45:07.550 --> 02:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
houseal Bill 1270 as it's written
 
02:45:12.030 --> 02:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:14.870 --> 02:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
statue a few things that I look at in
 
02:45:16.670 --> 02:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
that we looked at with uh House Bill
 
02:45:19.150 --> 02:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
1270 as introduced it draws some
 
02:45:22.070 --> 02:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
questions as it relates to local jails
 
02:45:25.950 --> 02:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
being removed uh from the first
 
02:45:28.630 --> 02:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
section in talking about allowing County
 
02:45:32.630 --> 02:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
correctional facilities as to lodging so
 
02:45:34.550 --> 02:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
places like nashor and Manchester where
 
02:45:35.950 --> 02:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
they actually have holding cells that
 
02:45:39.429 --> 02:45:39.439 align:start position:0%
they could um be considered jails uh
 
02:45:41.550 --> 02:45:41.560 align:start position:0%
that that part would be removed which we
 
02:45:43.550 --> 02:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
don't think is
 
02:45:46.870 --> 02:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate the bill is absent
 
02:45:48.550 --> 02:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
definitions of what potentially
 
02:45:50.590 --> 02:45:50.600 align:start position:0%
life-threatening medical emergencies
 
02:45:54.630 --> 02:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
means is that the amount of BAC is it
 
02:45:57.349 --> 02:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
the intoxication of drugs or a specific
 
02:46:00.110 --> 02:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
kind of drug is it high blood pressure
 
02:46:02.830 --> 02:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
abscess tooth skin infections these are
 
02:46:04.830 --> 02:46:04.840 align:start position:0%
all things that we uh when we bring
 
02:46:06.389 --> 02:46:06.399 align:start position:0%
people into the jail we get turned away
 
02:46:09.230 --> 02:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
for and asked to get medically cleared
 
02:46:09.240 --> 02:46:09.990 align:start position:0%
for and asked to get medically cleared
for

02:46:09.990 --> 02:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:46:12.190 --> 02:46:12.200 align:start position:0%
incarceration so during a protective
 
02:46:15.150 --> 02:46:15.160 align:start position:0%
custody hold which is no more than 24
 
02:46:18.670 --> 02:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
hours in in typically uh no less than 4
 
02:46:21.670 --> 02:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
hours uh this would not be a good use
 
02:46:24.150 --> 02:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
alarm enforcement to be doing medically
 
02:46:27.150 --> 02:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
cleared for every incident that may uh
 
02:46:29.389 --> 02:46:29.399 align:start position:0%
arise high blood pressure I bet if you
 
02:46:30.550 --> 02:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
check my blood pressure now it's
 
02:46:32.790 --> 02:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
probably up so you know again I don't
 
02:46:34.309 --> 02:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
need to be cleared for you know
 
02:46:36.389 --> 02:46:36.399 align:start position:0%
medically cleared for that uh there's a
 
02:46:39.790 --> 02:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
removal of section five which allows the
 
02:46:42.950 --> 02:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
refusal of the jail and Correctional
 
02:46:44.670 --> 02:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
Facilities to accept intoxicated and
 
02:46:47.630 --> 02:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
incap capacitated uh persons right now
 
02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
when we make the request as a law
 
02:46:50.990 --> 02:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement official to hold this person
 
02:46:52.870 --> 02:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
for uh that
 
02:46:54.790 --> 02:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
intoxication or
 
02:46:56.790 --> 02:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
incapacitation traditionally that's
 
02:46:59.030 --> 02:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
their they're accepted um this would
 
02:47:00.990 --> 02:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
remove that that right that they it
 
02:47:03.790 --> 02:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
could be arbitrarily
 
02:47:06.269 --> 02:47:06.279 align:start position:0%
refused Section 8 was removed which
 
02:47:10.870 --> 02:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
dissolves any type of uh immunity if you
 
02:47:13.950 --> 02:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
will as it relates to this this
 
02:47:15.910 --> 02:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
particular bill uh and it takes it out
 
02:47:17.950 --> 02:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
of the uh basically it puts the civil
 
02:47:20.269 --> 02:47:20.279 align:start position:0%
and criminal liability uh in the hands
 
02:47:23.510 --> 02:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
of the uh the jail and the officers so I
 
02:47:25.710 --> 02:47:25.720 align:start position:0%
don't know why that that would be
 
02:47:28.030 --> 02:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
removed another thing that we looked at
 
02:47:30.790 --> 02:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
was the usage of emergency department so
 
02:47:33.990 --> 02:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
the Ed or ERS uh officers and deputies
 
02:47:35.309 --> 02:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
when they're turned away at the jail or
 
02:47:37.389 --> 02:47:37.399 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facility uh to get somebody
 
02:47:39.349 --> 02:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
cleared medically cleared for
 
02:47:41.030 --> 02:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
incarceration again some of that could
 
02:47:43.630 --> 02:47:43.640 align:start position:0%
be a preist pre-existing issue uh
 
02:47:45.510 --> 02:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
different infections and things
 
02:47:48.150 --> 02:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
that they have on their skin we end up
 
02:47:50.349 --> 02:47:50.359 align:start position:0%
spending uh a lot of time up the
 
02:47:53.469 --> 02:47:53.479 align:start position:0%
hospitals trying to deal with um getting
 
02:47:55.510 --> 02:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
them medically cleared now remember if
 
02:47:58.550 --> 02:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
it's a skin infection or some uh form of
 
02:48:01.230 --> 02:48:01.240 align:start position:0%
uh issue that's medical uh like a
 
02:48:04.110 --> 02:48:04.120 align:start position:0%
abscess tooth or something we could be
 
02:48:06.870 --> 02:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
we we get put at the end of the the list
 
02:48:08.429 --> 02:48:08.439 align:start position:0%
as real emergencies come into the
 
02:48:10.230 --> 02:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
emergency department so that's a concern
 
02:48:10.240 --> 02:48:11.190 align:start position:0%
emergency department so that's a concern
for

02:48:11.190 --> 02:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:48:13.670 --> 02:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
us not to mention that we have
 
02:48:15.269 --> 02:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
departments across the state that are
 
02:48:17.950 --> 02:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
rural when they travel 20 30 minutes to
 
02:48:20.349 --> 02:48:20.359 align:start position:0%
the local jail or in cases like plumouth
 
02:48:22.550 --> 02:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
um where they actually have to drive to
 
02:48:25.510 --> 02:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
Graf County which is well over an hour
 
02:48:28.950 --> 02:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
when they arrive at the jail uh for this
 
02:48:28.960 --> 02:48:30.429 align:start position:0%
when they arrive at the jail uh for this
um

02:48:30.429 --> 02:48:30.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:32.790 --> 02:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
INX they get turned away and told hey
 
02:48:35.110 --> 02:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
you need to go and uh get medical
 
02:48:37.030 --> 02:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
clearance Our concern is that it's a
 
02:48:38.870 --> 02:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
security risk to continue to have these
 
02:48:40.950 --> 02:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
people out and about it's a it's a risk
 
02:48:43.670 --> 02:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
to the public it's a risk to the uh
 
02:48:48.230 --> 02:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:50.070 --> 02:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement we also take into
 
02:48:51.469 --> 02:48:51.479 align:start position:0%
consideration how much time our law
 
02:48:53.190 --> 02:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement is actually off the streets
 
02:48:55.230 --> 02:48:55.240 align:start position:0%
dealing with uh some of these issues we
 
02:48:57.630 --> 02:48:57.640 align:start position:0%
have local jails that are designed to to
 
02:49:00.870 --> 02:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
hold people custody and control um your
 
02:49:02.349 --> 02:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement officer out on the
 
02:49:04.230 --> 02:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
streets that's that's not really their
 
02:49:06.630 --> 02:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
function uh to to maintain these people
 
02:49:08.389 --> 02:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
in custody and control for lengths of
 
02:49:11.510 --> 02:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
time the PDS are not designed for that
 
02:49:13.110 --> 02:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
nor nor are the police cruisers so on
 
02:49:17.349 --> 02:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
and so forth I did want to read uh the
 
02:49:19.309 --> 02:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
definition under
 
02:49:22.309 --> 02:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
chapter 172
 
02:49:22.319 --> 02:49:26.630 align:start position:0%
chapter 172
B1

02:49:26.630 --> 02:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:29.389 --> 02:49:29.399 align:start position:0%
specifically intoxicated means a
 
02:49:30.750 --> 02:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
condition in which the mental or
 
02:49:33.349 --> 02:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
physical functioning of an individual is
 
02:49:35.550 --> 02:49:35.560 align:start position:0%
substantially impaired as a result of
 
02:49:37.750 --> 02:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
the presence of alcohol in their
 
02:49:41.710 --> 02:49:41.720 align:start position:0%
system incapacitated means that a person
 
02:49:44.790 --> 02:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
as a result of his use of alcohol is in
 
02:49:46.830 --> 02:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
a state of intoxication or mental
 
02:49:49.630 --> 02:49:49.640 align:start position:0%
confusion resulting from withdrawal such
 
02:49:52.309 --> 02:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
that he appears to need medical care or
 
02:49:54.469 --> 02:49:54.479 align:start position:0%
supervision by approved alcohol
 
02:49:56.790 --> 02:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
treatment personnel as defined in this
 
02:50:00.229 --> 02:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
section to assure his safety or he
 
02:50:03.070 --> 02:50:03.080 align:start position:0%
appears to present a direct active or
 
02:50:05.590 --> 02:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
passive threat to the safety of
 
02:50:07.630 --> 02:50:07.640 align:start position:0%
others now we have a lot of public
 
02:50:10.990 --> 02:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
events that happen um across the state
 
02:50:12.990 --> 02:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
different venues uh where alcohol is
 
02:50:15.150 --> 02:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
either served or consumed sometimes in
 
02:50:18.030 --> 02:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
large quantities and and law enforcement
 
02:50:20.429 --> 02:50:20.439 align:start position:0%
is forced to uh deal with some of these
 
02:50:23.190 --> 02:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
people uh we have learned that uh you
 
02:50:25.110 --> 02:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
cannot reason with somebody who's in
 
02:50:27.910 --> 02:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
intoxicated or incapacitated uh so we
 
02:50:29.510 --> 02:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
try to do everything that we can in our
 
02:50:31.630 --> 02:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
powers to find them a suitable person to
 
02:50:34.070 --> 02:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
take custody of them uh normally it's an
 
02:50:37.550 --> 02:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
adult over the age of 21 um when that
 
02:50:39.590 --> 02:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
when we're not able to do that or able
 
02:50:41.190 --> 02:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
to find somebody in a short period of
 
02:50:42.550 --> 02:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
time again we're not going to wait for
 
02:50:44.429 --> 02:50:44.439 align:start position:0%
somebody to come from Massachusetts to
 
02:50:46.190 --> 02:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
go to Plymouth State University to pick
 
02:50:47.990 --> 02:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
these people up so we bring them to our
 
02:50:49.990 --> 02:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
local jails for that that
 
02:50:52.349 --> 02:50:52.359 align:start position:0%
duration we need to we need to be able
 
02:50:55.349 --> 02:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
to do that and we need not to be uh tied
 
02:50:56.750 --> 02:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
up with bringing these people to the
 
02:50:58.670 --> 02:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
hospital to check what their bac's are
 
02:51:00.150 --> 02:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
and all that it can be easily done at
 
02:51:02.349 --> 02:51:02.359 align:start position:0%
the uh at the
 
02:51:05.309 --> 02:51:05.319 align:start position:0%
jail that'll conclude that I'll take
 
02:51:08.429 --> 02:51:08.439 align:start position:0%
questions what is the um I mean is there
 
02:51:10.990 --> 02:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
is there a cost to the county for these
 
02:51:12.590 --> 02:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
medical exam I mean if these folks don't
 
02:51:14.630 --> 02:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
have medical insurance who who pays the
 
02:51:15.990 --> 02:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
bill when you bring them in there to for
 
02:51:17.150 --> 02:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
all these
 
02:51:19.349 --> 02:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
clearances I can't say that we've ever
 
02:51:21.429 --> 02:51:21.439 align:start position:0%
received a bill at the county level so I
 
02:51:23.190 --> 02:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
can I can only say that either they do
 
02:51:25.790 --> 02:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
private insurance if they have it or
 
02:51:28.030 --> 02:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
through Medicare Medicaid whatever they
 
02:51:30.349 --> 02:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
normally have okay because we've heard
 
02:51:32.469 --> 02:51:32.479 align:start position:0%
from other sheriffs that have had people
 
02:51:34.309 --> 02:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
that not PCS but people that are
 
02:51:37.630 --> 02:51:37.640 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for you know a year or more
 
02:51:38.910 --> 02:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
and they're responsible for their
 
02:51:40.229 --> 02:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
medical bills while they're in there so
 
02:51:42.309 --> 02:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
I wondered if that applied here as well
 
02:51:43.510 --> 02:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
I don't believe so because these people
 
02:51:45.110 --> 02:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
are not technically committed
 
02:51:47.030 --> 02:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay so there there's no court order
 
02:51:49.550 --> 02:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
ordering these people and by definition
 
02:51:54.510 --> 02:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
it's not uh intoxication uh PC is not so
 
02:51:56.030 --> 02:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
protective custody is not considered an
 
02:51:58.349 --> 02:51:58.359 align:start position:0%
arrest as it relates to criminal charges
 
02:51:59.389 --> 02:51:59.399 align:start position:0%
and things so I don't believe that the
 
02:52:00.950 --> 02:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
county would be on the hook for that so
 
02:52:02.550 --> 02:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
the person then would be on the hook for
 
02:52:05.750 --> 02:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
The Med emergency room visit um that you
 
02:52:07.870 --> 02:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
guys brought him to for whatever test
 
02:52:09.229 --> 02:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
they decide to do they would end up
 
02:52:11.910 --> 02:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
getting a bill for that yes
 
02:52:15.550 --> 02:52:15.560 align:start position:0%
um can you speak to what the chesher
 
02:52:18.190 --> 02:52:18.200 align:start position:0%
county uh Sheriff I assume that you
 
02:52:20.150 --> 02:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
folks talk that they seem to be having
 
02:52:22.110 --> 02:52:22.120 align:start position:0%
an issue that they asked for this
 
02:52:25.030 --> 02:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
bill so I I have not personally spoken
 
02:52:27.910 --> 02:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
to the chesar sheriff about this okay I
 
02:52:29.630 --> 02:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
just thought as the the sheriff's
 
02:52:31.269 --> 02:52:31.279 align:start position:0%
Association might you might know the
 
02:52:32.710 --> 02:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
majority of the sheriff's Association
 
02:52:34.510 --> 02:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
are the ones that that discussed it and
 
02:52:35.550 --> 02:52:35.560 align:start position:0%
determined that this would be
 
02:52:38.830 --> 02:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate thank you um representative
 
02:52:41.150 --> 02:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
n thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:52:44.229 --> 02:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm wondering you
 
02:52:45.389 --> 02:52:45.399 align:start position:0%
know I'm sure that there are some
 
02:52:48.389 --> 02:52:48.399 align:start position:0%
differences between um counties and and
 
02:52:50.590 --> 02:52:50.600 align:start position:0%
facilities in different areas and I'm
 
02:52:52.710 --> 02:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
wondering if
 
02:52:56.830 --> 02:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
um is it that that um that the facility
 
02:52:58.750 --> 02:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
that you run has the capacity to be able
 
02:53:01.309 --> 02:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
to do this and maybe it's not um that's
 
02:53:05.110 --> 02:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
not a possibility uh in in all
 
02:53:07.269 --> 02:53:07.279 align:start position:0%
cases well I can't speak for what they
 
02:53:09.309 --> 02:53:09.319 align:start position:0%
have for housing at different counties
 
02:53:11.990 --> 02:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh I know that when we're bringing
 
02:53:14.910 --> 02:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
people to a jail a County Jail
 
02:53:17.750 --> 02:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
um if that jail was full let's just say
 
02:53:19.150 --> 02:53:19.160 align:start position:0%
uh that the superintendent has the
 
02:53:22.469 --> 02:53:22.479 align:start position:0%
ability to uh ask for the person to be
 
02:53:24.950 --> 02:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
transported to another jail facility so
 
02:53:26.590 --> 02:53:26.600 align:start position:0%
we do this and and we do this here in uh
 
02:53:28.990 --> 02:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
belnap County because of bike week so
 
02:53:31.309 --> 02:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
motorcycle week uh we basically emptied
 
02:53:33.750 --> 02:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
our jail and and um you know have it
 
02:53:35.349 --> 02:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
available for what for our event that's
 
02:53:39.110 --> 02:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
going on can I follow up real quick so
 
02:53:41.550 --> 02:53:41.560 align:start position:0%
um the I mean specifically what I think
 
02:53:43.429 --> 02:53:43.439 align:start position:0%
um is trying to be addressed here is
 
02:53:45.630 --> 02:53:45.640 align:start position:0%
medical clearance right right um and so
 
02:53:48.150 --> 02:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if uh you know it it would
 
02:53:50.469 --> 02:53:50.479 align:start position:0%
seem that that would in order to be able
 
02:53:51.990 --> 02:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
to have that in your facility in each
 
02:53:53.510 --> 02:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
facility which is something that you
 
02:53:55.429 --> 02:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
would think is a a time sensitive thing
 
02:53:56.309 --> 02:53:56.319 align:start position:0%
right you want to make sure that
 
02:53:59.550 --> 02:53:59.560 align:start position:0%
somebody is okay to be um you know um in
 
02:54:02.830 --> 02:54:02.840 align:start position:0%
custody right um is there the capacity
 
02:54:05.110 --> 02:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
across the board in in all of these
 
02:54:06.950 --> 02:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
facilities where there is someone who is
 
02:54:08.790 --> 02:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
available at all times to be able to do
 
02:54:10.630 --> 02:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
that a medical professional to be able
 
02:54:12.510 --> 02:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
to do the assessment I don't know what
 
02:54:15.070 --> 02:54:15.080 align:start position:0%
other jails have for uh medical staff or
 
02:54:17.830 --> 02:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
what their capabilities or competency is
 
02:54:20.429 --> 02:54:20.439 align:start position:0%
I I cannot legitimately answer that okay
 
02:54:20.439 --> 02:54:21.670 align:start position:0%
I I cannot legitimately answer that okay
thank

02:54:21.670 --> 02:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:54:24.150 --> 02:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
you Sheriff if you would for the benefit
 
02:54:26.550 --> 02:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
of the of the committee take us through
 
02:54:30.790 --> 02:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
a a typical PC from your end so what
 
02:54:32.349 --> 02:54:32.359 align:start position:0%
you're notified by a law enforcement
 
02:54:34.190 --> 02:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
department hey we're coming in with one
 
02:54:36.990 --> 02:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
protective custody what happens Well
 
02:54:39.429 --> 02:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
normally it starts um I'll I'll use uh
 
02:54:40.790 --> 02:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
the loud and racetrack because we work
 
02:54:43.950 --> 02:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
down there on occasion and um you know
 
02:54:45.670 --> 02:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
we'll will end up getting either a call
 
02:54:48.830 --> 02:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
to identify somebody who's being
 
02:54:51.190 --> 02:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
disruptive um once we make that
 
02:54:54.150 --> 02:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
identification of them we talk to them
 
02:54:55.510 --> 02:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
and we determine whether or not they're
 
02:54:58.190 --> 02:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
intoxicated or impaired to some degree
 
02:54:59.590 --> 02:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh most of the time they're they're
 
02:55:02.229 --> 02:55:02.239 align:start position:0%
impaired to the point of intoxication or
 
02:55:04.910 --> 02:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
incapacitation and at that point uh we
 
02:55:07.469 --> 02:55:07.479 align:start position:0%
try to get them somebody to take custody
 
02:55:09.030 --> 02:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
of them at that point and get them back
 
02:55:11.830 --> 02:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
to where they need to go when that fails
 
02:55:13.030 --> 02:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
we end up having to take them into
 
02:55:15.309 --> 02:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
physical custody and then we transport
 
02:55:17.950 --> 02:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
that person to the local jail and fill
 
02:55:20.830 --> 02:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
out the detainer request for a hold for
 
02:55:21.950 --> 02:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
you know for
 
02:55:23.870 --> 02:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
INXS while at the jail they
 
02:55:26.630 --> 02:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
traditionally will do a a breath test a
 
02:55:27.950 --> 02:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
preliminary breath test and it'll come
 
02:55:30.269 --> 02:55:30.279 align:start position:0%
up with some form of result to show that
 
02:55:32.510 --> 02:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
they're not having a medical issue as it
 
02:55:34.229 --> 02:55:34.239 align:start position:0%
relates to like diabetes or something
 
02:55:37.510 --> 02:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
that presents like an intoxication or
 
02:55:39.750 --> 02:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
incapacitation as long as that shows
 
02:55:43.190 --> 02:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
that they're uh you know over uh the
 
02:55:48.469 --> 02:55:48.479 align:start position:0%
normal 08 legal DWI intoxication
 
02:55:53.349 --> 02:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
impaired um BAC they'll accept them in
 
02:55:56.790 --> 02:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
and um and and then normally that's they
 
02:55:59.429 --> 02:55:59.439 align:start position:0%
get held for four hours or more
 
02:56:01.429 --> 02:56:01.439 align:start position:0%
depending on their intoxication level uh
 
02:56:02.990 --> 02:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
nothing prohibits the jail from
 
02:56:05.309 --> 02:56:05.319 align:start position:0%
continuing to make phone calls or allow
 
02:56:06.990 --> 02:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
uh the person to be released again we've
 
02:56:08.830 --> 02:56:08.840 align:start position:0%
had times where we've had people that
 
02:56:12.070 --> 02:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
were completely in inated and that um
 
02:56:13.590 --> 02:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know we brought them to the jail and
 
02:56:14.910 --> 02:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
they called somebody from another state
 
02:56:16.750 --> 02:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
like Massachusetts and the family member
 
02:56:19.389 --> 02:56:19.399 align:start position:0%
came up and and uh took custody of them
 
02:56:22.590 --> 02:56:22.600 align:start position:0%
so that's that's been a pro the normal
 
02:56:26.269 --> 02:56:26.279 align:start position:0%
process is what about medical screening
 
02:56:27.870 --> 02:56:27.880 align:start position:0%
so the jail does their own medical
 
02:56:29.670 --> 02:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
screening uh those of us who work in the
 
02:56:31.510 --> 02:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
streets we don't traditionally do any
 
02:56:33.469 --> 02:56:33.479 align:start position:0%
form of medical screening unless there's
 
02:56:36.349 --> 02:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
obvious illness or injuries uh something
 
02:56:38.670 --> 02:56:38.680 align:start position:0%
that needs either uh immediate attention
 
02:56:40.830 --> 02:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
you know on occasion we do take people
 
02:56:42.790 --> 02:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
into custody that are intoxicated they
 
02:56:44.469 --> 02:56:44.479 align:start position:0%
they don't want to go to the jail uh
 
02:56:45.469 --> 02:56:45.479 align:start position:0%
they start hitting their head off the
 
02:56:47.030 --> 02:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
cage of our car and end up splitting
 
02:56:48.990 --> 02:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
their uh you know end up splitting their
 
02:56:50.950 --> 02:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
their forehead open uh and then we need
 
02:56:53.750 --> 02:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
to divert to the to the uh ER in order
 
02:56:56.670 --> 02:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
for them to get uh bandaged up so that
 
02:56:59.309 --> 02:56:59.319 align:start position:0%
does happen on
 
02:57:01.229 --> 02:57:01.239 align:start position:0%
occasion thank
 
02:57:04.070 --> 02:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
you representative Stone thank you and
 
02:57:05.550 --> 02:57:05.560 align:start position:0%
thank you sherff for taking my question
 
02:57:07.590 --> 02:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
you mentioned uh you cover Lowden and
 
02:57:09.990 --> 02:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
you also have Bike Week how problematic
 
02:57:11.750 --> 02:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
would this bill be for your department
 
02:57:14.110 --> 02:57:14.120 align:start position:0%
operationally if it was to go forward
 
02:57:15.630 --> 02:57:15.640 align:start position:0%
with your course of doing business
 
02:57:18.150 --> 02:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
during those high volume times well I
 
02:57:20.950 --> 02:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
think it would be um very problematic it
 
02:57:23.309 --> 02:57:23.319 align:start position:0%
would take deputies off the off the
 
02:57:24.870 --> 02:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
deputies and officers off the road for
 
02:57:27.309 --> 02:57:27.319 align:start position:0%
extended periods of time uh to get uh
 
02:57:29.710 --> 02:57:29.720 align:start position:0%
Hospital clearance uh for people who are
 
02:57:32.469 --> 02:57:32.479 align:start position:0%
in toxicated or incapacitated uh to some
 
02:57:35.150 --> 02:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
degree that ultimately um when we get to
 
02:57:37.070 --> 02:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
the hospital we utilize these resources
 
02:57:38.830 --> 02:57:38.840 align:start position:0%
and we get told the same thing uh every
 
02:57:40.070 --> 02:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
time that there's nothing really you can
 
02:57:41.910 --> 02:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
do you got to let them Silber up it's
 
02:57:43.670 --> 02:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
all about uh monitoring the person and
 
02:57:46.070 --> 02:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
making Ure that um you know they're not
 
02:57:48.750 --> 02:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
vomiting vomiting and and aspirating on
 
02:57:50.550 --> 02:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
it or uh you know that that they're
 
02:57:53.309 --> 02:57:53.319 align:start position:0%
being monitored so and that's what again
 
02:57:56.150 --> 02:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
jails are designed to be a constant
 
02:57:58.309 --> 02:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
monitoring and they they have a lodging
 
02:58:00.590 --> 02:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
they're a lodging facility
 
02:58:03.990 --> 02:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
followup in the course of a motorcycle
 
02:58:07.269 --> 02:58:07.279 align:start position:0%
week what's the volume that you're
 
02:58:09.309 --> 02:58:09.319 align:start position:0%
familiar with being taken to the jail in
 
02:58:10.950 --> 02:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
regards to either protective custody or
 
02:58:13.269 --> 02:58:13.279 align:start position:0%
intoxicated individuals well I've been
 
02:58:14.950 --> 02:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
at the sheriff's office at Bel County
 
02:58:19.030 --> 02:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
now for uh just over 18 years and uh and
 
02:58:20.790 --> 02:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
I can tell you at one point uh we had
 
02:58:23.429 --> 02:58:23.439 align:start position:0%
150 people that cycled through the jail
 
02:58:25.910 --> 02:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
within a week and other times we've had
 
02:58:29.110 --> 02:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
20 it it all depends on the event and
 
02:58:31.429 --> 02:58:31.439 align:start position:0%
the weather and all that uh now I
 
02:58:33.910 --> 02:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh bike week and I mentioned
 
02:58:36.190 --> 02:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
NASCAR I I know that uh we have a
 
02:58:37.670 --> 02:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
captain here from Guilford that will
 
02:58:39.870 --> 02:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
probably testify to mebrook uh which
 
02:58:41.110 --> 02:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
brings you know can bring in a
 
02:58:43.910 --> 02:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
significant amount of people um we do
 
02:58:46.469 --> 02:58:46.479 align:start position:0%
PSU for their spring flings and things
 
02:58:48.349 --> 02:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
uh we've been out to uh we had Pumpkin
 
02:58:51.150 --> 02:58:51.160 align:start position:0%
Fest out in uh Keen that we participated
 
02:58:53.150 --> 02:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
in so we we've traveled all around to
 
02:58:55.429 --> 02:58:55.439 align:start position:0%
help support local La enforcement and uh
 
02:58:57.070 --> 02:58:57.080 align:start position:0%
so we're not just centralized to one
 
02:58:59.630 --> 02:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
specific area or one specific event uh
 
02:59:02.910 --> 02:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
but again these uh we do encounter uh
 
02:59:06.190 --> 02:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
people when they're in these Mass um
 
02:59:08.229 --> 02:59:08.239 align:start position:0%
groups and they're you know they there
 
02:59:10.990 --> 02:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
to have a good time and sometimes uh uh
 
02:59:13.150 --> 02:59:13.160 align:start position:0%
as they continue to indulge in in uh
 
02:59:15.389 --> 02:59:15.399 align:start position:0%
alcohol they their ability to make good
 
02:59:17.870 --> 02:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
choices sometimes goes bad and uh we
 
02:59:19.349 --> 02:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
take them into custody again for Public
 
02:59:20.990 --> 02:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
Safety and and to make sure that there's
 
02:59:25.429 --> 02:59:25.439 align:start position:0%
no disruptions thank you um Sheriff
 
02:59:30.590 --> 02:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
isn't it isn't it in a way um better
 
02:59:34.070 --> 02:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
for an intoxicated person I mean in a
 
02:59:35.710 --> 02:59:35.720 align:start position:0%
lot of these cases couldn't you also
 
02:59:37.429 --> 02:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
charge them with disorderly conduct and
 
02:59:39.590 --> 02:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
instead of doing that you you you kind
 
02:59:40.910 --> 02:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
of cut him a break and put them in
 
02:59:42.990 --> 02:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
protective custody so if this were to
 
02:59:44.670 --> 02:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
pass you may end up having to charge
 
02:59:46.990 --> 02:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
more people with disorderly just to not
 
02:59:48.550 --> 02:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
have to deal with all that is that true
 
02:59:50.790 --> 02:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
or no yes that's true we we could charge
 
02:59:52.510 --> 02:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
people with disorderly conduct we could
 
02:59:54.070 --> 02:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh charge them with inciting Riot we
 
02:59:55.710 --> 02:59:55.720 align:start position:0%
could there's other charges that we
 
02:59:58.070 --> 02:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
could most certainly uh go with
 
03:00:00.070 --> 03:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have uh people who are not
 
03:00:01.710 --> 03:00:01.720 align:start position:0%
so cooperative and being taken into
 
03:00:03.070 --> 03:00:03.080 align:start position:0%
custody that we could probably charge
 
03:00:04.990 --> 03:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
with resisting arrest but we really try
 
03:00:08.190 --> 03:00:08.200 align:start position:0%
to reserve those for for people who uh
 
03:00:10.389 --> 03:00:10.399 align:start position:0%
really need to be charged with that and
 
03:00:13.030 --> 03:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
and to to be heard on that so uh we try
 
03:00:15.190 --> 03:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
not to do uh extreme indifference with
 
03:00:16.750 --> 03:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
these people we we try to first thing
 
03:00:18.510 --> 03:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
that we do is we try to get them a a a
 
03:00:19.990 --> 03:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
sober person to come take custody of
 
03:00:21.469 --> 03:00:21.479 align:start position:0%
them we most certainly don't want to go
 
03:00:22.750 --> 03:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
through the paperwork of dealing with
 
03:00:24.349 --> 03:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
the you know at the jail we don't want
 
03:00:26.790 --> 03:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
to go through medical uh clearance we we
 
03:00:28.429 --> 03:00:28.439 align:start position:0%
would prefer to to release them to a
 
03:00:31.309 --> 03:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
sober uh reasonable responsible adult
 
03:00:33.070 --> 03:00:33.080 align:start position:0%
and uh and have them go sleep it off
 
03:00:34.830 --> 03:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
wherever they're going to end up where
 
03:00:37.870 --> 03:00:37.880 align:start position:0%
it comes into a problem is when they uh
 
03:00:39.269 --> 03:00:39.279 align:start position:0%
when they have a you know again this
 
03:00:40.990 --> 03:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
bill talks about releasing them to a
 
03:00:43.309 --> 03:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
reasonable person well what is the
 
03:00:45.110 --> 03:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
definition of a reasonable person is it
 
03:00:47.349 --> 03:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
the 18-year-old uh child that is
 
03:00:49.309 --> 03:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
required to pick the the parent up
 
03:00:50.429 --> 03:00:50.439 align:start position:0%
because they know what's going to happen
 
03:00:52.790 --> 03:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
if they don't and uh when they get home
 
03:00:54.389 --> 03:00:54.399 align:start position:0%
is there going to be additional uh
 
03:00:56.870 --> 03:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
problems and and normally the officer
 
03:00:58.309 --> 03:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
who takes these people into custody when
 
03:01:00.550 --> 03:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
we get to the jail uh we normally tell
 
03:01:02.389 --> 03:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
the the uh the people at the jail the
 
03:01:04.150 --> 03:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers that this person
 
03:01:06.309 --> 03:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
really needs to be held for a period of
 
03:01:08.190 --> 03:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
time and some of that's as a coof period
 
03:01:10.349 --> 03:01:10.359 align:start position:0%
too depending on the event that that may
 
03:01:12.590 --> 03:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
have got us to to draw our attention
 
03:01:15.429 --> 03:01:15.439 align:start position:0%
there uh again we don't just uh just
 
03:01:17.269 --> 03:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
come into contact with people when it
 
03:01:18.630 --> 03:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
comes to intoxication normally it's
 
03:01:20.070 --> 03:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
because we've been called there for some
 
03:01:22.269 --> 03:01:22.279 align:start position:0%
form of a problem or we've identify that
 
03:01:24.150 --> 03:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
there's something going
 
03:01:27.070 --> 03:01:27.080 align:start position:0%
on in your opinion if this were to pass
 
03:01:28.630 --> 03:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
though could it result in more people
 
03:01:30.910 --> 03:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
being charged with disorderly and things
 
03:01:32.990 --> 03:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
of that nature instead of just getting
 
03:01:36.150 --> 03:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
the the the PC it very well could be
 
03:01:37.389 --> 03:01:37.399 align:start position:0%
thank you and and the prerogatives could
 
03:01:38.750 --> 03:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
end up turning into well if we're going
 
03:01:40.150 --> 03:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
to get stuck at the hospital for four
 
03:01:41.670 --> 03:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
hours then it's going to be making it
 
03:01:43.670 --> 03:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
worth its while and people could end up
 
03:01:45.630 --> 03:01:45.640 align:start position:0%
getting charged uh accordingly I'm not
 
03:01:47.229 --> 03:01:47.239 align:start position:0%
saying it's right but it very well could
 
03:01:48.990 --> 03:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
be um it could
 
03:01:51.510 --> 03:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
happen um representative
 
03:01:53.510 --> 03:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:01:55.950 --> 03:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I might just be a
 
03:01:58.710 --> 03:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
little confused but from my
 
03:02:00.910 --> 03:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
understanding I thought that it's
 
03:02:03.990 --> 03:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
already a requirement that the person
 
03:02:05.630 --> 03:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
like the individual being taken into
 
03:02:08.070 --> 03:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
protective custody is evaluated and
 
03:02:09.910 --> 03:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's like the issue that's trying to
 
03:02:12.790 --> 03:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
be addressed because there isn't um
 
03:02:15.750 --> 03:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
capacity for that evaluation to happen
 
03:02:18.550 --> 03:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
in these um County jails not all of them
 
03:02:20.229 --> 03:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
I guess um I don't know I'm just
 
03:02:23.070 --> 03:02:23.080 align:start position:0%
confused about like is this actually
 
03:02:25.750 --> 03:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
requiring uh additional work or is it
 
03:02:30.469 --> 03:02:30.479 align:start position:0%
just providing other Pathways Beyond a
 
03:02:33.590 --> 03:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
um uh that taking place in the jail you
 
03:02:36.030 --> 03:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
know within that 24 hours so the jail is
 
03:02:38.070 --> 03:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing these evaluations
 
03:02:40.030 --> 03:02:40.040 align:start position:0%
within within the walls of the jail so
 
03:02:41.750 --> 03:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
the Corrections Officers the the people
 
03:02:43.670 --> 03:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
who are housed in that that that
 
03:02:45.269 --> 03:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
location that facility are the ones that
 
03:02:46.750 --> 03:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
are supposed to be causing that to
 
03:02:48.630 --> 03:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
happen the law enforcement officers that
 
03:02:50.229 --> 03:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
are out on the street that are policing
 
03:02:51.750 --> 03:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
the streets right now are the ones that
 
03:02:54.710 --> 03:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
were this bill as introduced will cause
 
03:02:57.190 --> 03:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
them local police officers to
 
03:02:59.750 --> 03:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
potentially end up spending more time uh
 
03:03:01.269 --> 03:03:01.279 align:start position:0%
at in a hospital setting with these
 
03:03:02.990 --> 03:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
people who are were intoxicated or
 
03:03:04.950 --> 03:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
incapacitated just to get them into the
 
03:03:08.590 --> 03:03:08.600 align:start position:0%
jail to be held so the question would be
 
03:03:10.830 --> 03:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
is even if they were being evaluated who
 
03:03:12.950 --> 03:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
do you want to do the evaluation the
 
03:03:15.870 --> 03:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
people that are uh that are in the
 
03:03:18.110 --> 03:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
position to do custody and control
 
03:03:20.110 --> 03:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
because that's their primary job or the
 
03:03:21.590 --> 03:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
officers that are the law enforcement
 
03:03:23.309 --> 03:03:23.319 align:start position:0%
officers that are on the street that are
 
03:03:26.910 --> 03:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:29.830 --> 03:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
laws um okay that that helps me
 
03:03:30.830 --> 03:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
understand it a little bit better I
 
03:03:34.070 --> 03:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
guess my um concern would be it feels
 
03:03:35.750 --> 03:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
like something needs to change though
 
03:03:37.950 --> 03:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
because the jails are saying that they
 
03:03:40.229 --> 03:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
don't have or not all of them have the
 
03:03:43.030 --> 03:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
capacity to do those evaluations within
 
03:03:45.550 --> 03:03:45.560 align:start position:0%
24 hours in the in the jail cell once
 
03:03:48.790 --> 03:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
someone's held so I guess is your main
 
03:03:50.950 --> 03:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
concern kind of like the transfer
 
03:03:53.510 --> 03:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility being to the officers and
 
03:03:55.349 --> 03:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
that it should still be housed within
 
03:03:57.510 --> 03:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
the jail system somehow even if the
 
03:04:00.710 --> 03:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
process changes a little yes so I
 
03:04:01.950 --> 03:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
believe that there's a separation
 
03:04:03.870 --> 03:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
between the corrections personnel and
 
03:04:05.110 --> 03:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement Personnel on the
 
03:04:07.630 --> 03:04:07.640 align:start position:0%
streets and unfortunately it feels like
 
03:04:10.309 --> 03:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
based on this bill that the uh that it
 
03:04:11.550 --> 03:04:11.560 align:start position:0%
would be pushed on to the law
 
03:04:12.910 --> 03:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers who should be out
 
03:04:14.229 --> 03:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
on the street
 
03:04:17.630 --> 03:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:20.590 --> 03:04:20.600 align:start position:0%
occurring is it true that in in some
 
03:04:22.269 --> 03:04:22.279 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions there may only be one
 
03:04:25.590 --> 03:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
officer on during a given
 
03:04:29.150 --> 03:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
shift yes and in in a lot of cases now
 
03:04:31.349 --> 03:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
especially in uh like I can speak
 
03:04:32.950 --> 03:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
specifically for belnap County we have a
 
03:04:34.630 --> 03:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
lot of departments that have now gone to
 
03:04:36.710 --> 03:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
on call status so they're not even
 
03:04:39.510 --> 03:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
readily available uh when you call them
 
03:04:41.750 --> 03:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
so if that one person is tied up with
 
03:04:43.389 --> 03:04:43.399 align:start position:0%
the medical nobody's covering the town
 
03:04:43.399 --> 03:04:45.349 align:start position:0%
the medical nobody's covering the town
now

03:04:45.349 --> 03:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:04:49.070 --> 03:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
yes thank you further
 
03:04:51.309 --> 03:04:51.319 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:04:53.750 --> 03:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
Newman could you just comment further on
 
03:04:56.190 --> 03:04:56.200 align:start position:0%
your objection to the local jail being
 
03:04:58.990 --> 03:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
taken out I mean I I'm just yes so
 
03:05:00.870 --> 03:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
there's a section that's currently in in
 
03:05:04.070 --> 03:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
the legislation that talks about um that
 
03:05:06.110 --> 03:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh lodged the person and what struck
 
03:05:08.349 --> 03:05:08.359 align:start position:0%
struck out is in a local jail or County
 
03:05:10.790 --> 03:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
Correction Facility which is a key
 
03:05:13.990 --> 03:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
component to to section c in that
 
03:05:17.349 --> 03:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh now it speaks to local jail later on
 
03:05:22.429 --> 03:05:22.439 align:start position:0%
in the in the um the bill but with that
 
03:05:24.750 --> 03:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
strikeout it it makes it sound like that
 
03:05:26.190 --> 03:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
that we're going to actually the way
 
03:05:29.349 --> 03:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
that reads is um Lodge the person for
 
03:05:31.870 --> 03:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
said person's protection for up to 24
 
03:05:33.510 --> 03:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
hours in the County Correctional
 
03:05:35.870 --> 03:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
Facility or until the keeper of said
 
03:05:38.550 --> 03:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
facility judges the person no longer be
 
03:05:40.309 --> 03:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
intoxicated and then it goes on from
 
03:05:42.990 --> 03:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
there um but I I want to make sure that
 
03:05:45.950 --> 03:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
the the uh police departments that have
 
03:05:49.229 --> 03:05:49.239 align:start position:0%
the ability to provide their own jail
 
03:05:52.030 --> 03:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
and I list and I know that nashwa in
 
03:05:53.790 --> 03:05:53.800 align:start position:0%
Manchester have their own holding
 
03:05:55.469 --> 03:05:55.479 align:start position:0%
facility they have their own booking
 
03:05:56.990 --> 03:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
officers people who are actually
 
03:05:59.510 --> 03:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
assigned to that location that can hous
 
03:06:02.229 --> 03:06:02.239 align:start position:0%
these people for that short duration of
 
03:06:04.750 --> 03:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
time uh so under 24 hours before they
 
03:06:04.760 --> 03:06:06.830 align:start position:0%
time uh so under 24 hours before they
get

03:06:06.830 --> 03:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
get
 
03:06:11.030 --> 03:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:13.950 --> 03:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
answer follow up
 
03:06:16.429 --> 03:06:16.439 align:start position:0%
uh and there's one place where where
 
03:06:19.229 --> 03:06:19.239 align:start position:0%
jail is not lined out so but but those
 
03:06:20.870 --> 03:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
places have the capacity to keep people
 
03:06:24.110 --> 03:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
for 254 hours is that correct okay yes
 
03:06:26.389 --> 03:06:26.399 align:start position:0%
yeah thank
 
03:06:28.550 --> 03:06:28.560 align:start position:0%

Bill

03:07:11.389 --> 03:07:11.399 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:07:13.710 --> 03:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
1270 in fact we
 
03:07:16.309 --> 03:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
are the group that initiated the process
 
03:07:17.950 --> 03:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
of seeking
 
03:07:22.630 --> 03:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
changes um over a year ago we identified
 
03:07:25.550 --> 03:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
an issue of significant concern with the
 
03:07:28.670 --> 03:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
language representative Shiro spoke to
 
03:07:31.630 --> 03:07:31.640 align:start position:0%
this uh primary
 
03:07:34.950 --> 03:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
concern I'll address that in more detail
 
03:07:37.750 --> 03:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
momentarily but the real concern is that
 
03:07:40.349 --> 03:07:40.359 align:start position:0%
the current language in the statute
 
03:07:43.469 --> 03:07:43.479 align:start position:0%
requires us to provide a response and
 
03:07:46.790 --> 03:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
services for persons held for protective
 
03:07:50.349 --> 03:07:50.359 align:start position:0%
custody that are largely unavailable
 
03:07:52.590 --> 03:07:52.600 align:start position:0%
within the current resources of our
 
03:07:56.349 --> 03:07:56.359 align:start position:0%
jails as well as the local
 
03:07:59.910 --> 03:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
communities given this we propose as a
 
03:08:03.630 --> 03:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
priority change within the amended Bill
 
03:08:07.910 --> 03:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
the elimination of language in B colon 3
 
03:08:11.590 --> 03:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 2 through 4 that most
 
03:08:14.389 --> 03:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
notably includes the requirements that
 
03:08:17.830 --> 03:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
jails immediately upon lodging the
 
03:08:21.229 --> 03:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
individual contact a designated alcohol
 
03:08:23.950 --> 03:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
counselor clinical staff person of an
 
03:08:26.710 --> 03:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
approved alcohol treatment program with
 
03:08:29.429 --> 03:08:29.439 align:start position:0%
detoxification capabilities or a
 
03:08:31.670 --> 03:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
professional medical staff person at a
 
03:08:34.590 --> 03:08:34.600 align:start position:0%
licensed General Hospital emergency room
 
03:08:34.600 --> 03:08:36.070 align:start position:0%
licensed General Hospital emergency room
for

03:08:36.070 --> 03:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:08:39.190 --> 03:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
screening well these resources don't
 
03:08:43.190 --> 03:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
exist uh none of them not even nursing
 
03:08:46.670 --> 03:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
exists in six out of the 10 jails on a
 
03:08:51.070 --> 03:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
247 basis that language implies bringing
 
03:08:54.550 --> 03:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
someone out to see a a counselor
 
03:08:56.990 --> 03:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
clinicians in mental health or substance
 
03:09:00.790 --> 03:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
abuse counselors are not staffed 247 in
 
03:09:04.429 --> 03:09:04.439 align:start position:0%
our jails nor were they ever that I know
 
03:09:06.950 --> 03:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
of and at the time of the the language
 
03:09:08.990 --> 03:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
in this
 
03:09:14.990 --> 03:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:17.670 --> 03:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
um the
 
03:09:21.590 --> 03:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
um seeking the resources outside should
 
03:09:25.510 --> 03:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
we try to do it is neither practical nor
 
03:09:28.469 --> 03:09:28.479 align:start position:0%
affordable especially given that the law
 
03:09:31.030 --> 03:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
as you've heard allows us to hold the
 
03:09:35.469 --> 03:09:35.479 align:start position:0%
person for only up to 24 hours and often
 
03:09:37.870 --> 03:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
that period of detainment as you have
 
03:09:41.510 --> 03:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
heard is significantly less just as the
 
03:09:43.710 --> 03:09:43.720 align:start position:0%
officer on the street has has an
 
03:09:46.870 --> 03:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to find a responsible adult
 
03:09:50.190 --> 03:09:50.200 align:start position:0%
to take care of that person we have that
 
03:09:52.590 --> 03:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity beginning as soon as we do
 
03:09:55.429 --> 03:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
take custody and sometimes we'll release
 
03:09:58.469 --> 03:09:58.479 align:start position:0%
a person within a matter of a few hours
 
03:10:02.229 --> 03:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
to a responsible adult so the idea of
 
03:10:04.950 --> 03:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
bringing them out to the community to
 
03:10:06.349 --> 03:10:06.359 align:start position:0%
get those
 
03:10:08.830 --> 03:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
resources given this is a protective
 
03:10:11.229 --> 03:10:11.239 align:start position:0%
custody hold especially and the time
 
03:10:15.790 --> 03:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
frames involved May makes no sense to
 
03:10:18.070 --> 03:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
us now
 
03:10:18.080 --> 03:10:19.950 align:start position:0%
us now
additionally

03:10:19.950 --> 03:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
03:10:24.670 --> 03:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
um under Section uh Roman numeral 1 C
 
03:10:27.630 --> 03:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
the the proposed amended language now
 
03:10:30.150 --> 03:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
States if in the Judgment of the peace
 
03:10:32.150 --> 03:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
officer or the County correctional
 
03:10:35.110 --> 03:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
superintendent or their design the
 
03:10:37.510 --> 03:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
person is experiencing a potentially
 
03:10:39.469 --> 03:10:39.479 align:start position:0%
life-threatening medical
 
03:10:41.950 --> 03:10:41.960 align:start position:0%
emergency they may require the police
 
03:10:45.030 --> 03:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
agency to have the person cleared by the
 
03:10:47.389 --> 03:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
emergency room of a licensed General
 
03:10:50.510 --> 03:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
Hospital prior to receiving the said
 
03:10:53.150 --> 03:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
person it still does include the
 
03:10:56.229 --> 03:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
requirement after medical clearance that
 
03:10:59.150 --> 03:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
we shall not refuse to admit the
 
03:11:02.349 --> 03:11:02.359 align:start position:0%
person now I'm going to say we are not
 
03:11:05.550 --> 03:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
trying to use the emergency room to
 
03:11:08.830 --> 03:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
replace our lack of resources this was
 
03:11:13.550 --> 03:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
really um a minor change
 
03:11:17.670 --> 03:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
to something that's really um to make
 
03:11:20.630 --> 03:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
something more explicit that's already
 
03:11:23.389 --> 03:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
happening uh rarely but
 
03:11:25.590 --> 03:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
occasionally both with protective
 
03:11:28.510 --> 03:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
custody holds or charges it really does
 
03:11:32.030 --> 03:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
not matter we often make a collective
 
03:11:34.950 --> 03:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
decision with our law enforcement police
 
03:11:39.190 --> 03:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
Partners about seeking Medical Care our
 
03:11:43.469 --> 03:11:43.479 align:start position:0%
recent data from 2023 among all jail
 
03:11:47.790 --> 03:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
uh we we pulled the data about 1 half of
 
03:11:53.269 --> 03:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
1% of the time are we quote refusing or
 
03:11:56.750 --> 03:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
by agreement in many cases redirecting
 
03:11:59.830 --> 03:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
that person to get medical
 
03:12:02.429 --> 03:12:02.439 align:start position:0%
attention as to the definition of
 
03:12:05.190 --> 03:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
lifethreatening and and the the debate
 
03:12:08.790 --> 03:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
about that um that is a judgment call
 
03:12:11.750 --> 03:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
being made by law enforcement because
 
03:12:14.070 --> 03:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
most of the time
 
03:12:16.469 --> 03:12:16.479 align:start position:0%
neither the officer on the street or in
 
03:12:18.630 --> 03:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
the jail is going to have anyone
 
03:12:21.590 --> 03:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
medically trained to help make that
 
03:12:24.750 --> 03:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
call although we've added that language
 
03:12:28.269 --> 03:12:28.279 align:start position:0%
into this proposed bill it is really not
 
03:12:31.389 --> 03:12:31.399 align:start position:0%
changing anything that's been happening
 
03:12:33.750 --> 03:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
and I can't speak with certainty to
 
03:12:37.190 --> 03:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
every County but for the majority of
 
03:12:39.790 --> 03:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
counties I think we partner together and
 
03:12:42.990 --> 03:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
make that decision responsibly and often
 
03:12:46.870 --> 03:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
we agree as to when a person needs to go
 
03:12:51.110 --> 03:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:54.429 --> 03:12:54.439 align:start position:0%
clearance the last change that's in here
 
03:12:58.030 --> 03:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
um and I again emphasize it's really a
 
03:13:01.910 --> 03:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
standardization of existing policies and
 
03:13:04.670 --> 03:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
practices there's some minor language
 
03:13:07.590 --> 03:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
change and that amended language now
 
03:13:11.510 --> 03:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
does State quote where possible contact
 
03:13:15.590 --> 03:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
a family member or responsible adult and
 
03:13:18.550 --> 03:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
release the person to this individual
 
03:13:21.110 --> 03:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
who's willing to assume responsibility
 
03:13:23.389 --> 03:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
for the intoxicated or incap
 
03:13:26.990 --> 03:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
incapacitated person the changes to this
 
03:13:30.870 --> 03:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
subsection are again relatively minor
 
03:13:34.150 --> 03:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
simply suggesting where possible the
 
03:13:36.630 --> 03:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
police make an attempt to call or
 
03:13:39.349 --> 03:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
otherwise contact a responsible third
 
03:13:43.389 --> 03:13:43.399 align:start position:0%
party before resorting to option
 
03:13:46.110 --> 03:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
C that would be transporting the person
 
03:13:49.630 --> 03:13:49.640 align:start position:0%
to the jail as you heard the sheriff say
 
03:13:52.229 --> 03:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
that often happens
 
03:13:55.349 --> 03:13:55.359 align:start position:0%
anyway uh it doesn't always happen it's
 
03:13:58.030 --> 03:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
at the discretion of the
 
03:14:01.030 --> 03:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
officer nothing ultimately in the
 
03:14:03.910 --> 03:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
language of this bill removes that
 
03:14:07.750 --> 03:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
discretion or compels any different
 
03:14:10.070 --> 03:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
action or behavior on the part of the
 
03:14:14.229 --> 03:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
police before bringing a person to us
 
03:14:17.269 --> 03:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
there was some concern among the
 
03:14:21.030 --> 03:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
municipal Association that it wouldn't
 
03:14:22.590 --> 03:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
interfere with their
 
03:14:25.790 --> 03:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
discretion would create more time making
 
03:14:28.790 --> 03:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
an assessment about a probability of
 
03:14:31.870 --> 03:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
harm and that could increase expenses
 
03:14:35.469 --> 03:14:35.479 align:start position:0%
again if you look at the language it's
 
03:14:40.309 --> 03:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
not compelled in any any way shape or
 
03:14:45.110 --> 03:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
form um in summary our primary concern
 
03:14:47.030 --> 03:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
was to remove that language that
 
03:14:50.710 --> 03:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
promises or requires care and services
 
03:14:54.309 --> 03:14:54.319 align:start position:0%
that cannot be provided uh in our jails
 
03:14:57.309 --> 03:14:57.319 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:14:59.990 --> 03:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I would say this that if the
 
03:15:04.229 --> 03:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
committee were to see the the other uh
 
03:15:06.950 --> 03:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
language as a significant obstacle we
 
03:15:09.510 --> 03:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
would be willing to forgo those changes
 
03:15:14.990 --> 03:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
as long as um RSA 17 2 B colon 3 2
 
03:15:18.309 --> 03:15:18.319 align:start position:0%
through 4 was
 
03:15:21.630 --> 03:15:21.640 align:start position:0%
repealed lastly I'll just touch on a
 
03:15:24.030 --> 03:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
couple things that came up in discussion
 
03:15:27.830 --> 03:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
if I could um anticipating maybe I could
 
03:15:31.510 --> 03:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
help answer a question that there Rose
 
03:15:31.520 --> 03:15:33.790 align:start position:0%
help answer a question that there Rose
earlier

03:15:33.790 --> 03:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
03:15:37.429 --> 03:15:37.439 align:start position:0%
um there's no intention on our part to
 
03:15:40.389 --> 03:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
remove a local police department that
 
03:15:43.070 --> 03:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
has the capacity to jail or confine
 
03:15:45.070 --> 03:15:45.080 align:start position:0%
somebody there certainly was no
 
03:15:47.630 --> 03:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
intention to remove that option or
 
03:15:51.189 --> 03:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
resource if that occurred in the editing
 
03:15:55.150 --> 03:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
of the bill that that was a a
 
03:15:57.990 --> 03:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
mistake and the question uh I think
 
03:16:00.030 --> 03:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
representative Roy asked could this
 
03:16:02.510 --> 03:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
result in an increase in
 
03:16:04.910 --> 03:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
charges I'm not really sure how that
 
03:16:08.389 --> 03:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
would possibly happen
 
03:16:11.110 --> 03:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
um what I said is true about a
 
03:16:13.630 --> 03:16:13.640 align:start position:0%
protective custody old or somebody
 
03:16:16.070 --> 03:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
that's presenting with charges if
 
03:16:18.429 --> 03:16:18.439 align:start position:0%
there's a life-threatening medical
 
03:16:20.670 --> 03:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
emergency we are not going to take
 
03:16:23.710 --> 03:16:23.720 align:start position:0%
custody of them every one of our our
 
03:16:27.229 --> 03:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
booking supervisor staff at the jails
 
03:16:29.990 --> 03:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
are instructed in their judgment to not
 
03:16:33.269 --> 03:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
take somebody if in their judgment that
 
03:16:36.229 --> 03:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
person is potentially going to expire on
 
03:16:39.550 --> 03:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
on our watch it's not in the current
 
03:16:42.990 --> 03:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
statute for protective custodies
 
03:16:46.670 --> 03:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
but it is in fact what happens on
 
03:16:49.630 --> 03:16:49.640 align:start position:0%
occasion and as I said from that data
 
03:16:49.640 --> 03:16:51.150 align:start position:0%
occasion and as I said from that data
very

03:16:51.150 --> 03:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
very
 
03:16:54.229 --> 03:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
rarely I would admit there may be times
 
03:16:56.309 --> 03:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
where there's not an agreement between
 
03:16:59.590 --> 03:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
the police and the and the correctional
 
03:17:02.630 --> 03:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
staff about when should somebody go up
 
03:17:04.670 --> 03:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
the sheriff mentioned somebody who
 
03:17:06.870 --> 03:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
smashed their head off the cage while
 
03:17:06.880 --> 03:17:07.830 align:start position:0%
smashed their head off the cage while
they're

03:17:07.830 --> 03:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
they're
 
03:17:11.309 --> 03:17:11.319 align:start position:0%
intoxicated they're bleeding out they
 
03:17:12.910 --> 03:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
need stitches
 
03:17:15.429 --> 03:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
we don't have anyone in the facility to
 
03:17:17.590 --> 03:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
give them stitches that's not
 
03:17:20.710 --> 03:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
lifethreatening but honestly that's a
 
03:17:22.710 --> 03:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
situation where we probably are going to
 
03:17:25.830 --> 03:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
agree with the police and the correction
 
03:17:28.229 --> 03:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
supervisor that person needs to get
 
03:17:31.870 --> 03:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
stitched up come back to us and then we
 
03:17:34.830 --> 03:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
will admit them whether they're under
 
03:17:37.309 --> 03:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
facing criminal charges or protective
 
03:17:39.790 --> 03:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
custody that disposition and that
 
03:17:42.429 --> 03:17:42.439 align:start position:0%
screening process would look very very
 
03:17:44.990 --> 03:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:49.150 --> 03:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
same I'm happy to take any questions you
 
03:17:51.070 --> 03:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
might have thank
 
03:17:54.710 --> 03:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
you so looking at the the part the first
 
03:17:57.469 --> 03:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
part that you you um your main intention
 
03:18:00.510 --> 03:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
of the bill with regards to Roman
 
03:18:03.309 --> 03:18:03.319 align:start position:0%
3 as I said originally my reading of
 
03:18:05.950 --> 03:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
that seems to be that all these things
 
03:18:08.750 --> 03:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
here are provided or mandated so that
 
03:18:10.830 --> 03:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
the person can be proved to be
 
03:18:12.750 --> 03:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
definitely um
 
03:18:14.670 --> 03:18:14.680 align:start position:0%
incapacitated in other words they won't
 
03:18:17.750 --> 03:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
be held without actually proof of that
 
03:18:19.670 --> 03:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
um I was looking at other states I
 
03:18:21.790 --> 03:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
looked to at the state to our South in
 
03:18:24.349 --> 03:18:24.359 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts has no mention of any
 
03:18:26.550 --> 03:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
of these things there's this very quick
 
03:18:29.150 --> 03:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
simple it it would resemble ours if we
 
03:18:32.750 --> 03:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
took that out for so do you let's just
 
03:18:35.389 --> 03:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
speak to that to ensure that someone is
 
03:18:37.349 --> 03:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
screened for intoxication in the first
 
03:18:39.670 --> 03:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
place do you perform or do your
 
03:18:41.670 --> 03:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
facilities perform any kind of sobriety
 
03:18:43.429 --> 03:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
check when when an officer brings
 
03:18:45.110 --> 03:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
someone for protective custody do you
 
03:18:47.910 --> 03:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
have breathalyzers there to check their
 
03:18:49.189 --> 03:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
we do have
 
03:18:52.429 --> 03:18:52.439 align:start position:0%
breathalyzers but to be honest we do not
 
03:18:54.150 --> 03:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
always use the
 
03:18:56.910 --> 03:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
breathalyzers we're really going off of
 
03:19:00.269 --> 03:19:00.279 align:start position:0%
the the officer on the streets judgment
 
03:19:02.070 --> 03:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
their description of what's happened and
 
03:19:05.389 --> 03:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
our own observations of that person's
 
03:19:08.429 --> 03:19:08.439 align:start position:0%
behavior and a significant change from
 
03:19:11.550 --> 03:19:11.560 align:start position:0%
1989 when I think the last edit happened
 
03:19:14.189 --> 03:19:14.199 align:start position:0%
to this language we are not talking
 
03:19:17.349 --> 03:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
about alcohol all the time or nearly as
 
03:19:20.469 --> 03:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
often and we don't have we we do have
 
03:19:23.590 --> 03:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
impairment and intoxication and
 
03:19:26.630 --> 03:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
incapacitation based on drugs and a
 
03:19:29.309 --> 03:19:29.319 align:start position:0%
significant change in the landscape of
 
03:19:33.110 --> 03:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
of what's being used out there so a
 
03:19:35.550 --> 03:19:35.560 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of the time it's not
 
03:19:37.910 --> 03:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
about alcohol
 
03:19:40.189 --> 03:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
anyway which raises an interesting
 
03:19:41.830 --> 03:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
question so when someone comes in and
 
03:19:43.750 --> 03:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
they appear to be perhaps under the
 
03:19:45.910 --> 03:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
influence of opioids fentanyl whatever
 
03:19:49.189 --> 03:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
what have you what is the procedure when
 
03:19:51.630 --> 03:19:51.640 align:start position:0%
someone presents like that um for
 
03:19:55.070 --> 03:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
protective custody um what do you do do
 
03:19:57.070 --> 03:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
you just hold them and watch them do you
 
03:20:00.030 --> 03:20:00.040 align:start position:0%
um do you administer an Naran what
 
03:20:04.429 --> 03:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
happens if they're need of Naran and and
 
03:20:07.229 --> 03:20:07.239 align:start position:0%
at risk of you know severe withdrawal
 
03:20:09.309 --> 03:20:09.319 align:start position:0%
then we have an Ouran and we would
 
03:20:13.510 --> 03:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
administer it um but we we observe them
 
03:20:16.110 --> 03:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
directly and we do have a better
 
03:20:18.750 --> 03:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
capacity than the officer on the street
 
03:20:20.429 --> 03:20:20.439 align:start position:0%
for those basic
 
03:20:23.229 --> 03:20:23.239 align:start position:0%
observations for use of a holding cell
 
03:20:25.389 --> 03:20:25.399 align:start position:0%
for someone who's
 
03:20:25.399 --> 03:20:26.950 align:start position:0%
for someone who's
uncooperative

03:20:26.950 --> 03:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
uncooperative
 
03:20:29.870 --> 03:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
um we don't have a better capacity in
 
03:20:33.590 --> 03:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
many cases for medical screening though
 
03:20:35.670 --> 03:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
but we will hold them and we can hold
 
03:20:39.910 --> 03:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
them up to 24 hours but if we can find a
 
03:20:43.710 --> 03:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
responsible adult the person's agreeable
 
03:20:45.990 --> 03:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
to leave with them and that responsible
 
03:20:49.070 --> 03:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
third party will take care of them
 
03:20:50.790 --> 03:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
they're not charged
 
03:20:54.150 --> 03:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
criminally they'll leave the facility at
 
03:20:57.309 --> 03:20:57.319 align:start position:0%
that point again barring any sense of a
 
03:21:03.630 --> 03:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:07.670 --> 03:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
on representative um selig and then Muse
 
03:21:09.189 --> 03:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thank you for
 
03:21:13.030 --> 03:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
03:21:14.510 --> 03:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
everything that I'm reading in this is
 
03:21:16.710 --> 03:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
about releasing someone to the custody
 
03:21:20.229 --> 03:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
of a competent adult and I I guess where
 
03:21:22.910 --> 03:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
I'm maybe and this is maybe my own lack
 
03:21:25.750 --> 03:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
of understanding of things but if the
 
03:21:28.870 --> 03:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
person sobers up do they get released to
 
03:21:31.590 --> 03:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
their own custody I mean like do
 
03:21:33.710 --> 03:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
they what happens when the person you
 
03:21:35.550 --> 03:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
know maybe is no longer Under the
 
03:21:39.070 --> 03:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
Influence or uh whatever issue was
 
03:21:41.550 --> 03:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
causing them to be incompetent has been
 
03:21:41.560 --> 03:21:42.389 align:start position:0%
causing them to be incompetent has been
um

03:21:42.389 --> 03:21:42.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:46.030 --> 03:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
cleared up that's a good question um in
 
03:21:49.790 --> 03:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
some percentage of cases uh we can't
 
03:21:52.630 --> 03:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
find a sober responsible adult can't
 
03:21:54.790 --> 03:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
reach them or they're not willing to
 
03:21:58.070 --> 03:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
come that's a situation where we're more
 
03:22:01.269 --> 03:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
likely to take some more time to ensure
 
03:22:03.990 --> 03:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
that they're not no longer intoxicated
 
03:22:07.229 --> 03:22:07.239 align:start position:0%
or incapacitated at a level that's
 
03:22:09.990 --> 03:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
unsafe and in that case we will
 
03:22:14.510 --> 03:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
transport them out of the facility to a
 
03:22:19.150 --> 03:22:19.160 align:start position:0%
a safe location or to to home so it is
 
03:22:24.150 --> 03:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
not necessary uh to always have a third
 
03:22:27.550 --> 03:22:27.560 align:start position:0%
party come and pick them
 
03:22:34.590 --> 03:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:37.469 --> 03:22:37.479 align:start position:0%
Muse I wanted to focus a little bit on
 
03:22:39.910 --> 03:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
the uh kind of back on the on the on the
 
03:22:41.910 --> 03:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
bill itself so one of the things that we
 
03:22:43.110 --> 03:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
heard is there are
 
03:22:47.910 --> 03:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
concerns um that um the bill might be
 
03:22:50.790 --> 03:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
perceived as a mandate uh for police
 
03:22:53.550 --> 03:22:53.560 align:start position:0%
officers uh to use their judgment to
 
03:22:56.349 --> 03:22:56.359 align:start position:0%
transport people to a medical facility
 
03:22:57.550 --> 03:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
in the event in the event of a
 
03:23:01.269 --> 03:23:01.279 align:start position:0%
life-threatening situation um
 
03:23:03.630 --> 03:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
if it would seem that in the event of a
 
03:23:05.830 --> 03:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
real lifethreatening situation most
 
03:23:08.429 --> 03:23:08.439 align:start position:0%
police officers would transport somebody
 
03:23:11.830 --> 03:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
directly or call for an ambulance um I
 
03:23:13.870 --> 03:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
mean is as I read the statute and and
 
03:23:16.510 --> 03:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
tell me if I'm wrong what it looks like
 
03:23:19.229 --> 03:23:19.239 align:start position:0%
the bill does is it actually gives
 
03:23:22.750 --> 03:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
police officer discretion um to either
 
03:23:25.950 --> 03:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
take people directly to an ER uh or to
 
03:23:28.710 --> 03:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
take people uh to the county jail but it
 
03:23:31.389 --> 03:23:31.399 align:start position:0%
also looks like you have the discretion
 
03:23:34.469 --> 03:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
um to make the same decision so so for
 
03:23:37.150 --> 03:23:37.160 align:start position:0%
instance if in your judgment you believe
 
03:23:39.070 --> 03:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
that the uh that the person is in a
 
03:23:41.510 --> 03:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
life-threatening situation you can be
 
03:23:44.550 --> 03:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
they you can transport them now I guess
 
03:23:47.269 --> 03:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
my question is um in the event that
 
03:23:49.269 --> 03:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
happens uh and the police officer has
 
03:23:52.189 --> 03:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
left I'm assuming that the county would
 
03:23:55.110 --> 03:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
then uh be responsible for the transport
 
03:23:57.030 --> 03:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
or or would just simply call an
 
03:23:58.910 --> 03:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
ambulance for the
 
03:24:02.389 --> 03:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
person it if it was lifethreatening in
 
03:24:04.030 --> 03:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
the way that we're describing in the
 
03:24:06.429 --> 03:24:06.439 align:start position:0%
language of the bill we would be calling
 
03:24:06.439 --> 03:24:07.429 align:start position:0%
language of the bill we would be calling
an

03:24:07.429 --> 03:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
an
 
03:24:07.439 --> 03:24:09.110 align:start position:0%
an
ambulance

03:24:09.110 --> 03:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
ambulance
 
03:24:12.429 --> 03:24:12.439 align:start position:0%
um but it but nothing changes the
 
03:24:14.790 --> 03:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
discretion of the officer on the street
 
03:24:17.550 --> 03:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
to to bring the person to a hospital or
 
03:24:20.590 --> 03:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
call an ambulance and I'm sure in many
 
03:24:23.229 --> 03:24:23.239 align:start position:0%
cases that is what
 
03:24:26.070 --> 03:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
happens sometimes at the point between
 
03:24:28.870 --> 03:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
putting the person in a cruiser and
 
03:24:31.389 --> 03:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
getting to the jail their condition can
 
03:24:33.750 --> 03:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
change especially with drugs and Drug
 
03:24:36.469 --> 03:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
overdoses there have been some
 
03:24:39.590 --> 03:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
instances where I think appropriately in
 
03:24:42.950 --> 03:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
the uh officer's discre on the street
 
03:24:46.830 --> 03:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
person was not at risk but arrives at
 
03:24:49.349 --> 03:24:49.359 align:start position:0%
the facility and their their health
 
03:24:51.990 --> 03:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
their status has changed perhaps an
 
03:24:53.710 --> 03:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
example an
 
03:24:58.830 --> 03:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
overdose um again it's half a perc of
 
03:25:01.469 --> 03:25:01.479 align:start position:0%
our total bookings that we divert
 
03:25:04.710 --> 03:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
somebody to a hospital it's not very
 
03:25:07.910 --> 03:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
common and nothing in Our intention of
 
03:25:11.189 --> 03:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
the language is to take away anybody's
 
03:25:13.870 --> 03:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
judge judement neither the the police
 
03:25:17.070 --> 03:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
officer's judgment about how to
 
03:25:20.389 --> 03:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
dispose the best disposition of of that
 
03:25:23.870 --> 03:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
detainee or at our receiving
 
03:25:27.670 --> 03:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
end and I again will tell you that all
 
03:25:30.870 --> 03:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
of our booking commanders are instructed
 
03:25:33.710 --> 03:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
to never accept somebody into our
 
03:25:36.110 --> 03:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
custody if you believe they are in a
 
03:25:37.950 --> 03:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
truly lifethreatening
 
03:25:40.469 --> 03:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
situation I would rather take the
 
03:25:44.950 --> 03:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
liability of refusing somebody a in an
 
03:25:47.229 --> 03:25:47.239 align:start position:0%
argument and and again I don't think in
 
03:25:50.590 --> 03:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
those cases we are in an argument with
 
03:25:52.389 --> 03:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
the the police in a life
 
03:25:52.399 --> 03:25:53.910 align:start position:0%
the the police in a life
life-threatening

03:25:53.910 --> 03:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
life-threatening
 
03:25:59.070 --> 03:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
situation but that's what happens now
 
03:26:03.750 --> 03:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
it's just not been in statute and we
 
03:26:06.309 --> 03:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
wanted it in there
 
03:26:08.670 --> 03:26:08.680 align:start position:0%
but thank
 
03:26:11.950 --> 03:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
you for hold on for clarification a
 
03:26:13.510 --> 03:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
though so
 
03:26:17.150 --> 03:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
if if someone arrives let's say they um
 
03:26:20.429 --> 03:26:20.439 align:start position:0%
it was for what you said for fentel and
 
03:26:24.070 --> 03:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
while in transport they go into OD and
 
03:26:24.080 --> 03:26:24.870 align:start position:0%
while in transport they go into OD and
they're

03:26:24.870 --> 03:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
they're
 
03:26:28.030 --> 03:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
out it's not it's not like um the
 
03:26:29.469 --> 03:26:29.479 align:start position:0%
corrections in law enforcement are
 
03:26:31.429 --> 03:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
playing hot potato with the per
 
03:26:32.710 --> 03:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
somebody's calling ambulance at that
 
03:26:34.590 --> 03:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
point because the cruiser is not um
 
03:26:36.510 --> 03:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
equipped to transport medically uh
 
03:26:38.030 --> 03:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
people either so at that point
 
03:26:40.790 --> 03:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
everything stops and and ambulance is
 
03:26:42.150 --> 03:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
called is that correct correct that
 
03:26:45.550 --> 03:26:45.560 align:start position:0%
would be correct okay thank you um
 
03:26:48.309 --> 03:26:48.319 align:start position:0%
representative Stone thank you and thank
 
03:26:49.510 --> 03:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
03:26:52.990 --> 03:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
question under the current system and
 
03:26:55.269 --> 03:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
quite conceivably as a practical matter
 
03:26:56.710 --> 03:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
isn't the Department of Corrections on
 
03:26:58.670 --> 03:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
the county level the best place to get
 
03:27:00.510 --> 03:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
an individual since we've heard there
 
03:27:02.269 --> 03:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
have been instances of being highly
 
03:27:03.910 --> 03:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
combative uh it could be a mix of
 
03:27:06.670 --> 03:27:06.680 align:start position:0%
alcohol and or drugs on board or I'm
 
03:27:07.790 --> 03:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
sure you dealt with some people that
 
03:27:09.710 --> 03:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
have outright refused to cooperate all
 
03:27:12.550 --> 03:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
overall isn't that the safest for the
 
03:27:14.670 --> 03:27:14.680 align:start position:0%
public as well as the officers involved
 
03:27:16.389 --> 03:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
to get the individual to a place that's
 
03:27:19.110 --> 03:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
secure with care custody and control
 
03:27:21.590 --> 03:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely and nothing in this bill
 
03:27:24.870 --> 03:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
would change that from happening thank
 
03:27:27.510 --> 03:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:27:29.710 --> 03:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:27:31.389 --> 03:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question and I apologize if
 
03:27:32.830 --> 03:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
you may have commented on this but I'm
 
03:27:37.229 --> 03:27:37.239 align:start position:0%
curious as to in the current uh SE law
 
03:27:39.870 --> 03:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
uh the removal of section four and
 
03:27:41.830 --> 03:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
that's the part that says the jail or
 
03:27:43.790 --> 03:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
County shall not refuse to admit
 
03:27:46.710 --> 03:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
intoxicated person
 
03:27:51.910 --> 03:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
Etc it still remains in there uh after
 
03:27:56.590 --> 03:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
medical clearance um so it includes that
 
03:27:59.830 --> 03:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
condition now that a a having a
 
03:28:02.790 --> 03:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
life-threatening medical emergency
 
03:28:06.269 --> 03:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
cleared at the hospital and then the
 
03:28:08.990 --> 03:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
language that still exists immediately
 
03:28:15.150 --> 03:28:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:18.950 --> 03:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
states that the I don't have it in front
 
03:28:21.429 --> 03:28:21.439 align:start position:0%
of me but the jail will um it says they
 
03:28:23.590 --> 03:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
can't refuse after they will then admit
 
03:28:26.229 --> 03:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
the local jail or County Correctional
 
03:28:29.630 --> 03:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
Facility shall then admit the
 
03:28:31.910 --> 03:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
person thank you I just had a hard time
 
03:28:36.189 --> 03:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
finding that thank you very represent
 
03:28:38.590 --> 03:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
Pro um perhaps I can add a little
 
03:28:41.790 --> 03:28:41.800 align:start position:0%
clarification as being a town that lives
 
03:28:46.150 --> 03:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh that is next to the Rockingham County
 
03:28:48.630 --> 03:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
facility uh I have on a number of
 
03:28:50.950 --> 03:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
occasions met up with a cruiser to take
 
03:28:53.710 --> 03:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
a patient who went South on them while
 
03:28:56.670 --> 03:28:56.680 align:start position:0%
transporting to the jail and also have
 
03:28:58.990 --> 03:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
ended up at the booking office of the
 
03:29:01.910 --> 03:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
jail to get patients who were determined
 
03:29:03.389 --> 03:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be in there at the moment
 
03:29:05.870 --> 03:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
needed to go to the hospital so that
 
03:29:08.189 --> 03:29:08.199 align:start position:0%
practice does happen somebody calls an
 
03:29:10.229 --> 03:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
ambulance for these people and we take
 
03:29:12.710 --> 03:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
them to get they're screening and get
 
03:29:12.720 --> 03:29:20.990 align:start position:0%
them to get they're screening and get
medically

03:29:20.990 --> 03:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:24.349 --> 03:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
cleared any further questions seeing
 
03:29:26.510 --> 03:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
none thank you for your testimony thank
 
03:29:28.830 --> 03:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
you the chair
 
03:29:40.110 --> 03:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:40.120 --> 03:29:54.990 align:start position:0%
 
parent

03:29:54.990 --> 03:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:57.750 --> 03:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
my name is dtin parent been a full-time
 
03:30:00.670 --> 03:30:00.680 align:start position:0%
police officer for 21 years uh hold the
 
03:30:03.110 --> 03:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
rank of Captain at Guilford PD been
 
03:30:05.429 --> 03:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
there my entire career I'm here today to
 
03:30:07.349 --> 03:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of Chief Kelly and the
 
03:30:09.990 --> 03:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Chiefs of police uh I was
 
03:30:12.510 --> 03:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
going to speak on basically everything
 
03:30:14.510 --> 03:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
that sheriff Wright discussed I don't
 
03:30:16.349 --> 03:30:16.359 align:start position:0%
think that my redundancy is going to do
 
03:30:19.590 --> 03:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
the the committee any justice and I'll
 
03:30:23.309 --> 03:30:23.319 align:start position:0%
save you that I suppose so uh I I am in
 
03:30:26.830 --> 03:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill 1270 dfn I will
 
03:30:29.469 --> 03:30:29.479 align:start position:0%
just speak what I can more personally
 
03:30:32.750 --> 03:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
and intelligently on which would be uh
 
03:30:32.760 --> 03:30:34.070 align:start position:0%
and intelligently on which would be uh
the

03:30:34.070 --> 03:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:30:36.389 --> 03:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
section speaking
 
03:30:38.469 --> 03:30:38.479 align:start position:0%
about potentially life-threatening
 
03:30:40.389 --> 03:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
medical emergencies which seems to be
 
03:30:42.790 --> 03:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
where we just left off anyway uh and I
 
03:30:45.309 --> 03:30:45.319 align:start position:0%
and I agree with representative PR uh
 
03:30:47.950 --> 03:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
that that does happen the ambulance does
 
03:30:50.309 --> 03:30:50.319 align:start position:0%
need to be called at times I think that
 
03:30:52.710 --> 03:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
confusing a police cruiser and a police
 
03:30:54.830 --> 03:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
officer with with trained medical
 
03:30:58.550 --> 03:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
personnel is is definitely a mistake so
 
03:31:01.630 --> 03:31:01.640 align:start position:0%
we have the venue of Bank in Hampshire
 
03:31:05.269 --> 03:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
Pavilion in Guilford uh we're lucky we
 
03:31:08.349 --> 03:31:08.359 align:start position:0%
we'll say we have approximately 400
 
03:31:10.070 --> 03:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
protective custody cases a year that
 
03:31:11.990 --> 03:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
come out of there so I don't know what
 
03:31:15.229 --> 03:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
other agencies statistics are but I will
 
03:31:17.389 --> 03:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
confidently Venture a guess that we if
 
03:31:19.269 --> 03:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
not at the top of the state are very
 
03:31:20.790 --> 03:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
close to that so we have a lot of
 
03:31:24.030 --> 03:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
experience with this and we are having
 
03:31:27.070 --> 03:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
some issues with regard to uh getting
 
03:31:30.950 --> 03:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
turned away at the jail so we we like to
 
03:31:33.950 --> 03:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
hold our training accountable that we're
 
03:31:36.349 --> 03:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
able to determine if a person in fact
 
03:31:38.110 --> 03:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
does have a life-threatening medical
 
03:31:40.269 --> 03:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
emergency that we would not be bringing
 
03:31:42.550 --> 03:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
them up to the jail jail to begin with
 
03:31:44.429 --> 03:31:44.439 align:start position:0%
and should they bring them up to the
 
03:31:45.950 --> 03:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
jail then we would have a different
 
03:31:47.150 --> 03:31:47.160 align:start position:0%
problem at our hands which would be
 
03:31:49.269 --> 03:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
training and morals and ethics of that
 
03:31:52.150 --> 03:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
particular officer at hand so uh that is
 
03:31:53.750 --> 03:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
that is certainly not something that we
 
03:31:56.550 --> 03:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
foresee being an issue but allowing that
 
03:31:59.429 --> 03:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
to be again redundant to say the police
 
03:32:01.910 --> 03:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
officer is going to determine whether or
 
03:32:03.110 --> 03:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
not this individual has a
 
03:32:05.429 --> 03:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
life-threatening Med medical emergency
 
03:32:08.070 --> 03:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
and then another person I.E the Jailer
 
03:32:10.030 --> 03:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
at the correctional facility then
 
03:32:12.550 --> 03:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
confirming or not confirming whatever
 
03:32:14.990 --> 03:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
that person's opinion might be is is
 
03:32:16.550 --> 03:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
where we're going to run into our issues
 
03:32:20.550 --> 03:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
so we we have staffing issues like
 
03:32:23.150 --> 03:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
anyone else does we have to have
 
03:32:26.349 --> 03:32:26.359 align:start position:0%
approximately anywhere from 16 to 20
 
03:32:29.030 --> 03:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
officers per show and I speak solely on
 
03:32:30.630 --> 03:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
on Meadowbrook or Bank in the Hampshire
 
03:32:32.469 --> 03:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
Pavilion but understand we have bike
 
03:32:35.389 --> 03:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
week and we have the gun stock ski area
 
03:32:37.189 --> 03:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
we have the hill climbs that are in our
 
03:32:38.910 --> 03:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
in our town so there's a lot of
 
03:32:40.590 --> 03:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
different events it's just that the bank
 
03:32:42.510 --> 03:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
and the Hampshire Pavilion carries the
 
03:32:44.870 --> 03:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
most amount of work in quantity of these
 
03:32:46.710 --> 03:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
types of cases so I'll refer to that
 
03:32:49.950 --> 03:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
throughout uh so our issue being if
 
03:32:53.790 --> 03:32:53.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to uh continue to rely on
 
03:32:56.469 --> 03:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
the redundancy of the jailers to turn us
 
03:32:59.150 --> 03:32:59.160 align:start position:0%
away it incurs a a significant cost to
 
03:33:00.950 --> 03:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
us as well and we're not able to get our
 
03:33:04.030 --> 03:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
people back at the venue and and to keep
 
03:33:06.189 --> 03:33:06.199 align:start position:0%
in mind these people have already been
 
03:33:09.070 --> 03:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
evaluated should they show any signs of
 
03:33:11.309 --> 03:33:11.319 align:start position:0%
needing medical attention whatsoever
 
03:33:14.550 --> 03:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
there's paramedics 24 hours in our town
 
03:33:16.590 --> 03:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
in most towns that surround us I can't
 
03:33:18.389 --> 03:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
speak to the rest of the State uh but
 
03:33:20.309 --> 03:33:20.319 align:start position:0%
certainly at the venue there's
 
03:33:22.790 --> 03:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
paramedics on scene they're detailed to
 
03:33:24.550 --> 03:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
that particular venue so they've already
 
03:33:28.469 --> 03:33:28.479 align:start position:0%
been cleared and if they speak anything
 
03:33:30.750 --> 03:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
about having done drugs or ingested
 
03:33:32.349 --> 03:33:32.359 align:start position:0%
drugs at any point in time during the
 
03:33:34.269 --> 03:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
day we're getting told to get medical
 
03:33:36.790 --> 03:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
clearance even though there's no sign of
 
03:33:39.469 --> 03:33:39.479 align:start position:0%
uh life-threatening medical emergency um
 
03:33:41.710 --> 03:33:41.720 align:start position:0%
I did hear you representative Roy ask
 
03:33:44.790 --> 03:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
what what type of um protocol do you go
 
03:33:46.309 --> 03:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
through with regard to determining if
 
03:33:48.870 --> 03:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
somebody is impaired so everything that
 
03:33:50.670 --> 03:33:50.680 align:start position:0%
we do at the Guilford Police Department
 
03:33:52.550 --> 03:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
is on body warn cameras those also
 
03:33:54.710 --> 03:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
closed circuit uh monitoring throughout
 
03:33:57.229 --> 03:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
the whole venue so uh we have policies
 
03:33:59.189 --> 03:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
in place that we do standardized field
 
03:34:01.469 --> 03:34:01.479 align:start position:0%
sobriety testing we offer preliminary
 
03:34:03.630 --> 03:34:03.640 align:start position:0%
breath tests to these people and that's
 
03:34:06.229 --> 03:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
after observations such as physical
 
03:34:08.269 --> 03:34:08.279 align:start position:0%
observations are are had of the person
 
03:34:10.389 --> 03:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
to determine if they're impaired odor
 
03:34:13.389 --> 03:34:13.399 align:start position:0%
things like that comprise and then lead
 
03:34:15.110 --> 03:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
us to the direction of this person's
 
03:34:16.870 --> 03:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
impaired due to alcohol drugs whatever
 
03:34:18.950 --> 03:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
it might be and that decision is then
 
03:34:22.030 --> 03:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
made we do our due diligence as does I I
 
03:34:23.469 --> 03:34:23.479 align:start position:0%
speak confidently that all law
 
03:34:26.309 --> 03:34:26.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement does their due diligence to
 
03:34:28.670 --> 03:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
find a sober party for this person
 
03:34:30.469 --> 03:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
because we don't want to drive them to
 
03:34:32.229 --> 03:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
the jail we don't want to end up there
 
03:34:34.910 --> 03:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
and take that person off the road um I
 
03:34:36.189 --> 03:34:36.199 align:start position:0%
know I alluded to the bank in the
 
03:34:37.950 --> 03:34:37.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Pavilion we have several
 
03:34:40.349 --> 03:34:40.359 align:start position:0%
officers which still isn't enough I I
 
03:34:42.429 --> 03:34:42.439 align:start position:0%
hope you you can trust me in that but
 
03:34:43.750 --> 03:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
the people on the road working a
 
03:34:45.710 --> 03:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
midnight shift might have one or two
 
03:34:47.870 --> 03:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
officers on duty and then taking them
 
03:34:50.590 --> 03:34:50.600 align:start position:0%
off the road can also pose a problem for
 
03:34:52.269 --> 03:34:52.279 align:start position:0%
Community safety having them sitting in
 
03:34:52.279 --> 03:34:53.590 align:start position:0%
Community safety having them sitting in
a

03:34:53.590 --> 03:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:34:58.229 --> 03:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
hospital so as I said I my main concern
 
03:34:59.790 --> 03:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
yes I think all of it carries the same
 
03:35:01.269 --> 03:35:01.279 align:start position:0%
amount of weight that sheriff Wright
 
03:35:03.590 --> 03:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
spoke on I just wanted to speak more
 
03:35:06.150 --> 03:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
pointedly to this this particular
 
03:35:08.070 --> 03:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
section as I think I have some
 
03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
experience in that
 
03:35:13.110 --> 03:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
area thank you with regards so let's
 
03:35:14.990 --> 03:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
let's stick with your example um you
 
03:35:16.790 --> 03:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
you've got an event going on at Pavilion
 
03:35:19.950 --> 03:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
a concert you have a lot of intoxicated
 
03:35:19.960 --> 03:35:21.469 align:start position:0%
a concert you have a lot of intoxicated
people

03:35:21.469 --> 03:35:21.479 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:35:24.229 --> 03:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
so the officers you have there are on
 
03:35:26.070 --> 03:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
detail right so they don't have Cruisers
 
03:35:28.469 --> 03:35:28.479 align:start position:0%
they can't transport it's up to the is
 
03:35:31.710 --> 03:35:31.720 align:start position:0%
it up to the the on Duty Officers to
 
03:35:33.590 --> 03:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
handle the transports or how does it how
 
03:35:35.710 --> 03:35:35.720 align:start position:0%
does that work as far as tying people up
 
03:35:37.750 --> 03:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a good question so we they
 
03:35:41.150 --> 03:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
are on detail um and just to kind of
 
03:35:43.990 --> 03:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
just a quick synopsis so regular Patrol
 
03:35:46.389 --> 03:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
as opposed to being on detail means that
 
03:35:48.349 --> 03:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
the the venue themselves Bank in the
 
03:35:50.269 --> 03:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Pavilion hires the police
 
03:35:52.110 --> 03:35:52.120 align:start position:0%
officers the police department to be
 
03:35:53.830 --> 03:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
there so they're not responsible for
 
03:35:55.429 --> 03:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
handling calls throughout the community
 
03:35:59.030 --> 03:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
during that time so part of that detail
 
03:36:01.349 --> 03:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
is that there's a transport van or two
 
03:36:04.070 --> 03:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
or three at the venue and then the
 
03:36:06.309 --> 03:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
officers that are there for the detail
 
03:36:08.590 --> 03:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
would be designated by the supervisor to
 
03:36:11.150 --> 03:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
then take them to the jail should it be
 
03:36:13.469 --> 03:36:13.479 align:start position:0%
should it be time if you will so we have
 
03:36:17.150 --> 03:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
a probably three or four people could be
 
03:36:19.870 --> 03:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
held on it's not made to hold people
 
03:36:21.590 --> 03:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
obviously for long periods of time but
 
03:36:24.030 --> 03:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
we have about a facility that'll hold
 
03:36:25.550 --> 03:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
three or four people per cell and
 
03:36:28.389 --> 03:36:28.399 align:start position:0%
there's two cells that are there pending
 
03:36:31.229 --> 03:36:31.239 align:start position:0%
that they're not combative or male
 
03:36:33.070 --> 03:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
female juvenile obviously there's
 
03:36:34.950 --> 03:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
there's laws that that prohib us from
 
03:36:37.389 --> 03:36:37.399 align:start position:0%
doing that so uh the short to your
 
03:36:39.469 --> 03:36:39.479 align:start position:0%
answer is those people get transported
 
03:36:42.830 --> 03:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
by the detail that are at that venue so
 
03:36:45.349 --> 03:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
as a followup I if they get turned away
 
03:36:48.910 --> 03:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
or any number of them get turned away um
 
03:36:51.269 --> 03:36:51.279 align:start position:0%
who gets to go take them to the hospital
 
03:36:53.389 --> 03:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
then is it the detail officer still are
 
03:36:55.110 --> 03:36:55.120 align:start position:0%
they getting paid detail rates does the
 
03:36:56.910 --> 03:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
Bank of New Hampshire agree with paying
 
03:36:58.950 --> 03:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me the New Hampshire Pavilion pay
 
03:37:01.389 --> 03:37:01.399 align:start position:0%
for all those hours yeah so in the
 
03:37:04.429 --> 03:37:04.439 align:start position:0%
example of being turned away at during a
 
03:37:06.389 --> 03:37:06.399 align:start position:0%
concert by one of the detail officers
 
03:37:08.309 --> 03:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
that was doing the transporting they
 
03:37:10.950 --> 03:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
would it would be them we can't
 
03:37:12.990 --> 03:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be tying up our Patrol units
 
03:37:15.070 --> 03:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
we're just too busy for that so the
 
03:37:16.750 --> 03:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
detail officer would then have to go to
 
03:37:18.550 --> 03:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
the hospital at which point in time we
 
03:37:20.830 --> 03:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
lose our transport van and then we lose
 
03:37:23.870 --> 03:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
that officer that uh that we we really
 
03:37:26.750 --> 03:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
can't afford to lose to begin with so
 
03:37:29.229 --> 03:37:29.239 align:start position:0%
we're not asking the jail to do
 
03:37:31.189 --> 03:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
something or take on a
 
03:37:32.950 --> 03:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility that that isn't
 
03:37:35.510 --> 03:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
unreasonable we're we're simply saying
 
03:37:37.830 --> 03:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
to trust us in our ability to evaluate
 
03:37:39.309 --> 03:37:39.319 align:start position:0%
the person and the paramedics that are
 
03:37:41.030 --> 03:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
on scene to evaluate the the person to
 
03:37:43.150 --> 03:37:43.160 align:start position:0%
determine if it is in fact a
 
03:37:45.990 --> 03:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
life-threatening issue or emergency that
 
03:37:47.030 --> 03:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
we would have brought him to the
 
03:37:49.070 --> 03:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
hospital to begin with OR allowed the on
 
03:37:51.469 --> 03:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
duty ambulance to transport them and not
 
03:37:53.550 --> 03:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
tie up our officers that already
 
03:37:56.830 --> 03:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
determined that they were fine to go to
 
03:37:59.990 --> 03:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
jail are you familiar with um
 
03:38:03.950 --> 03:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
172b col 3 the protective custody
 
03:38:06.550 --> 03:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
statute I don't have that in front of me
 
03:38:08.630 --> 03:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
but okay try me uh well I was going to
 
03:38:11.189 --> 03:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
ask with regard to uh with regard to
 
03:38:13.590 --> 03:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
Roman 3 that says no person shall be
 
03:38:15.030 --> 03:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
lodged in a jiler County Correction
 
03:38:16.750 --> 03:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
Facility under paragraph two unless the
 
03:38:19.189 --> 03:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
person charges immediately upon lodging
 
03:38:21.590 --> 03:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
said person protective custody contacts
 
03:38:23.830 --> 03:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
a designated alcohol counselor clinical
 
03:38:25.870 --> 03:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
staff person approved alcohol treatment
 
03:38:29.469 --> 03:38:29.479 align:start position:0%
program detox case it goes on and on and
 
03:38:34.150 --> 03:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
it culminates in the point of that um
 
03:38:35.910 --> 03:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
that all those people are to determine
 
03:38:38.389 --> 03:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
whether or not said person is indeed
 
03:38:40.389 --> 03:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
incapacitated and then it says if an
 
03:38:42.269 --> 03:38:42.279 align:start position:0%
only if none of the forgoing are
 
03:38:43.950 --> 03:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
available such medical clinician
 
03:38:46.229 --> 03:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
determined shall be made by a registered
 
03:38:48.070 --> 03:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
nurse apparently they don't have those
 
03:38:50.229 --> 03:38:50.239 align:start position:0%
either so is it your would you agree
 
03:38:51.990 --> 03:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
with my interpretation that this was put
 
03:38:54.150 --> 03:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
in there as a as some type of protection
 
03:38:56.510 --> 03:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
for a citizen to prove that they are
 
03:38:56.520 --> 03:38:57.510 align:start position:0%
for a citizen to prove that they are
indeed

03:38:57.510 --> 03:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
indeed
 
03:38:57.520 --> 03:38:59.189 align:start position:0%
indeed
intoxicated

03:38:59.189 --> 03:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
intoxicated
 
03:39:01.750 --> 03:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
it I can't speak to
 
03:39:05.309 --> 03:39:05.319 align:start position:0%
the how what the intent was but I will I
 
03:39:06.910 --> 03:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
will agree with you that that's it makes
 
03:39:09.790 --> 03:39:09.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of Hoops and what is your opinion
 
03:39:12.389 --> 03:39:12.399 align:start position:0%
if we would just to strike that
 
03:39:15.510 --> 03:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph I I think that the manner in
 
03:39:18.710 --> 03:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
which we've been doing business
 
03:39:21.189 --> 03:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
by taking care of the
 
03:39:23.469 --> 03:39:23.479 align:start position:0%
public making sure that we're not doing
 
03:39:25.110 --> 03:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
anything out of malice which I have
 
03:39:28.229 --> 03:39:28.239 align:start position:0%
never witnessed fortunately that I think
 
03:39:29.710 --> 03:39:29.720 align:start position:0%
that we were we were doing things
 
03:39:31.990 --> 03:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
properly to begin with well you're
 
03:39:33.790 --> 03:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
already given field sobriety tests and
 
03:39:35.429 --> 03:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
you are from a preliminary breath test
 
03:39:38.950 --> 03:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
is that's right that's correct um and it
 
03:39:40.990 --> 03:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
no one's barred from um bringing a cause
 
03:39:42.269 --> 03:39:42.279 align:start position:0%
of action against the police department
 
03:39:43.790 --> 03:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
for false arrest if they can prove they
 
03:39:45.950 --> 03:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
weren intoxicated if they have friends
 
03:39:47.150 --> 03:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
or Witnesses I mean they're free to
 
03:39:48.950 --> 03:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
bring that is that true that that is
 
03:39:52.070 --> 03:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
true and I have been on the other end of
 
03:39:54.710 --> 03:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
those complaints multiple times and I
 
03:39:56.910 --> 03:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
alluded to uh earlier when I was
 
03:39:59.790 --> 03:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
testifying that our body worn cameras
 
03:40:03.550 --> 03:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
our J our U booking facility is all
 
03:40:05.750 --> 03:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
videotaped so those types of things are
 
03:40:08.150 --> 03:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
what we fall back on to ensure that our
 
03:40:09.830 --> 03:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
policies are followed with regard to
 
03:40:11.550 --> 03:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
offer ing standardized field sobriety
 
03:40:14.110 --> 03:40:14.120 align:start position:0%
tests and preliminary breath tests thank
 
03:40:17.510 --> 03:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
you representative Newman it's just just
 
03:40:20.309 --> 03:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
a question of the chair that that
 
03:40:22.830 --> 03:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
section that you read section three and
 
03:40:22.840 --> 03:40:24.269 align:start position:0%
section that you read section three and
72

03:40:24.269 --> 03:40:24.279 align:start position:0%
72
 
03:40:27.750 --> 03:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
B3 isn't that repealed by the by the
 
03:40:30.389 --> 03:40:30.399 align:start position:0%
language on the L on line on page one
 
03:40:33.950 --> 03:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
line 23 it is but the bill also adds a
 
03:40:35.269 --> 03:40:35.279 align:start position:0%
bunch of other things that aren't
 
03:40:38.630 --> 03:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
Germain and the um the the
 
03:40:40.469 --> 03:40:40.479 align:start position:0%
superintendent said that this is the
 
03:40:41.950 --> 03:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
thing that were most important so I was
 
03:40:43.349 --> 03:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
curious as to the effect of law
 
03:40:45.110 --> 03:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement but I just wanted to make
 
03:40:48.229 --> 03:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
sure that that this takes that out okay
 
03:40:50.269 --> 03:40:50.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Manion thank
 
03:40:51.790 --> 03:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair this is not really a
 
03:40:55.030 --> 03:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
question for the uh for the officer but
 
03:40:56.229 --> 03:40:56.239 align:start position:0%
you made a statement earlier about the
 
03:40:58.269 --> 03:40:58.279 align:start position:0%
detail and who would be
 
03:41:00.269 --> 03:41:00.279 align:start position:0%
responsible every agency is different I
 
03:41:02.030 --> 03:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
know the agencies that I've worked for
 
03:41:04.550 --> 03:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
the detail officer stays at the detail a
 
03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
patrol officer would come and handle the
 
03:41:09.309 --> 03:41:09.319 align:start position:0%
call and transport the person um and I
 
03:41:10.550 --> 03:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
guess the thing is a people are paying
 
03:41:12.630 --> 03:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
for detail if all three of them are gone
 
03:41:14.030 --> 03:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
now nobody's covering that facility for
 
03:41:16.389 --> 03:41:16.399 align:start position:0%
the night so we have some times where
 
03:41:18.349 --> 03:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
there's one officer on the detail and he
 
03:41:20.630 --> 03:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
can't leave well I I'm I'm aware that
 
03:41:23.710 --> 03:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
detail pay is is is higher than a normal
 
03:41:26.309 --> 03:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
salary and if an officer's on detail for
 
03:41:28.149 --> 03:41:28.159 align:start position:0%
you and then they're tied up at a
 
03:41:30.510 --> 03:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
hospital for 14 hours in an emergency
 
03:41:33.110 --> 03:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
room who pays for that the person might
 
03:41:34.349 --> 03:41:34.359 align:start position:0%
say I'm not paying that that's not what
 
03:41:36.309 --> 03:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
I hire you to do representative
 
03:41:39.110 --> 03:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
s thank you and thank you for taking my
 
03:41:41.389 --> 03:41:41.399 align:start position:0%
question um
 
03:41:45.269 --> 03:41:45.279 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious if there's um just in
 
03:41:46.990 --> 03:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
your experiences in Guilford with the
 
03:41:49.309 --> 03:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
concerts and the various events in that
 
03:41:53.309 --> 03:41:53.319 align:start position:0%
area um whether there's impact of um
 
03:41:55.030 --> 03:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
people who are under the influence of
 
03:41:56.950 --> 03:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
hallucinogenics that need to go into
 
03:42:00.030 --> 03:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
protective custody for their own safety
 
03:42:01.950 --> 03:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
to some degree as well or if there's an
 
03:42:06.189 --> 03:42:06.199 align:start position:0%
impact from that so you're asking do we
 
03:42:07.750 --> 03:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
do we come across people that are
 
03:42:11.469 --> 03:42:11.479 align:start position:0%
impaired from narcotics not just alcoh
 
03:42:12.870 --> 03:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
I I'm sure you come across people who
 
03:42:15.550 --> 03:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
are impaired from narcotics but we last
 
03:42:17.189 --> 03:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
year heard a lot of testimony about
 
03:42:19.110 --> 03:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
people wanting us to decriminalize
 
03:42:21.710 --> 03:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
various forms of hallucinogenics and
 
03:42:23.910 --> 03:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
having um I I don't remember the term
 
03:42:25.870 --> 03:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
they use but basically sessions where
 
03:42:28.229 --> 03:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
they bring people in to give lots I
 
03:42:30.550 --> 03:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
don't remember the name of the anyway
 
03:42:33.950 --> 03:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
drugs that are similar to LSD except
 
03:42:36.990 --> 03:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
maybe created differently and so I I
 
03:42:39.070 --> 03:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure whether you have been seeing
 
03:42:40.870 --> 03:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
impact of people
 
03:42:42.830 --> 03:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
under the influence of things like that
 
03:42:46.590 --> 03:42:46.600 align:start position:0%
um absolutely in a noticeable way have
 
03:42:48.469 --> 03:42:48.479 align:start position:0%
you picked up a lot of people on shrooms
 
03:42:52.790 --> 03:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
we we we yes and they and to be honest
 
03:42:56.070 --> 03:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
with you a lot of people probably what
 
03:42:58.510 --> 03:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
you would think is to the opposite is
 
03:43:00.510 --> 03:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
they admit it to us they a lot of these
 
03:43:02.309 --> 03:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
people tell us because they're scared
 
03:43:04.189 --> 03:43:04.199 align:start position:0%
when this starts to happen to them to
 
03:43:06.750 --> 03:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
their body and they and they tell us and
 
03:43:08.870 --> 03:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
they're given medical treatment at that
 
03:43:10.550 --> 03:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
time we like I said we have paramedics
 
03:43:12.510 --> 03:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
on scene and then Andor if they need to
 
03:43:14.750 --> 03:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
be transported to the
 
03:43:17.910 --> 03:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
hospital is your agency accredited we
 
03:43:20.790 --> 03:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
are not accredited okay do in your
 
03:43:22.510 --> 03:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
understanding are many of the
 
03:43:24.149 --> 03:43:24.159 align:start position:0%
Departments are accredited across the
 
03:43:27.030 --> 03:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
state do do the accreditation standards
 
03:43:29.149 --> 03:43:29.159 align:start position:0%
or even your department policies speak
 
03:43:31.389 --> 03:43:31.399 align:start position:0%
to what you do if you encounter someone
 
03:43:33.950 --> 03:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
regardless of it's a PC or an arrest and
 
03:43:37.149 --> 03:43:37.159 align:start position:0%
they have a visible injury um it does
 
03:43:38.670 --> 03:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
what's the first thing that's to be done
 
03:43:41.469 --> 03:43:41.479 align:start position:0%
with them I'm actually
 
03:43:43.309 --> 03:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
ironically I am the one that is handling
 
03:43:45.309 --> 03:43:45.319 align:start position:0%
our accreditation process through the
 
03:43:47.389 --> 03:43:47.399 align:start position:0%
state the state is as you probably know
 
03:43:50.110 --> 03:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
is going to be offering that so yes we
 
03:43:52.710 --> 03:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
do have a policy that speaks to that and
 
03:43:54.269 --> 03:43:54.279 align:start position:0%
they immediately are offered and
 
03:43:56.710 --> 03:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
afforded medical attention and that's
 
03:43:58.309 --> 03:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
prior to bringing them to their
 
03:44:00.469 --> 03:44:00.479 align:start position:0%
destination be it to a friend's house or
 
03:44:02.830 --> 03:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
to jail yes they're they're afforded
 
03:44:04.870 --> 03:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
medical attention prior to going to the
 
03:44:06.590 --> 03:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
jail should they need it thank you
 
03:44:08.790 --> 03:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative Manion thank you Mr chair
 
03:44:10.469 --> 03:44:10.479 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh for taking question
 
03:44:12.469 --> 03:44:12.479 align:start position:0%
actually it's more for clarification
 
03:44:14.269 --> 03:44:14.279 align:start position:0%
this law currently as it stands in the
 
03:44:16.670 --> 03:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
bill only apply to alcohol intoxication
 
03:44:19.429 --> 03:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
correct not drugs correct I so
 
03:44:21.309 --> 03:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
everyone's on the same page with it
 
03:44:24.710 --> 03:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you I I did have one
 
03:44:26.630 --> 03:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
more point that I had heard throughout
 
03:44:29.309 --> 03:44:29.319 align:start position:0%
the testimony here today and uh it was
 
03:44:32.030 --> 03:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
with regard to the condition
 
03:44:35.189 --> 03:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
worsening um prior contact to with the
 
03:44:38.030 --> 03:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
officer having evaluated that person the
 
03:44:40.030 --> 03:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
officer evaluates decides this person is
 
03:44:42.510 --> 03:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately going to be uh getting PCD
 
03:44:43.990 --> 03:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
and then the condition worsens in the
 
03:44:46.189 --> 03:44:46.199 align:start position:0%
cruiser and that's the ability to turn
 
03:44:49.149 --> 03:44:49.159 align:start position:0%
them away I I speak on behalf of the
 
03:44:51.030 --> 03:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
Guilford Police Department that we do
 
03:44:53.030 --> 03:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
the exact protocol that representative
 
03:44:56.110 --> 03:44:56.120 align:start position:0%
PR alluded to we would not then be
 
03:44:57.990 --> 03:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
turned away and transport them we would
 
03:44:59.710 --> 03:44:59.720 align:start position:0%
be saying well we need to call an
 
03:45:02.950 --> 03:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
ambulance at this time so should that
 
03:45:05.830 --> 03:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
that um situation worsen and then
 
03:45:07.590 --> 03:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
becomes potential overdose or
 
03:45:09.110 --> 03:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
life-threatening injury or something
 
03:45:11.030 --> 03:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
like that we we wouldn't then be
 
03:45:13.710 --> 03:45:13.720 align:start position:0%
transporting we would be going with an
 
03:45:15.870 --> 03:45:15.880 align:start position:0%
ambulance so the the language doesn't
 
03:45:18.590 --> 03:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
really support what our actions would
 
03:45:21.309 --> 03:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
be if in the middle of Transport you
 
03:45:23.990 --> 03:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
look in the rear view mirror and your
 
03:45:28.149 --> 03:45:28.159 align:start position:0%
transport's killed over do you divert to
 
03:45:29.670 --> 03:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
an emergency room or do you pull over
 
03:45:30.950 --> 03:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
and administer first aid and call an
 
03:45:34.189 --> 03:45:34.199 align:start position:0%
ambulance that b thank
 
03:45:37.790 --> 03:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
you represent n thank you and thank you
 
03:45:40.030 --> 03:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question yes um you
 
03:45:43.189 --> 03:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there has been concern or
 
03:45:45.389 --> 03:45:45.399 align:start position:0%
there have been instances where uh
 
03:45:47.630 --> 03:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
people are being turned away um from
 
03:45:50.510 --> 03:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facilities right and so uh
 
03:45:51.990 --> 03:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
you know another thing that you
 
03:45:53.630 --> 03:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned was you know to trust your
 
03:45:55.870 --> 03:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
judgment right what this seems to do in
 
03:45:58.510 --> 03:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
my mind is is it says either um the
 
03:46:02.030 --> 03:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
superintendent or uh the peace officer
 
03:46:03.630 --> 03:46:03.640 align:start position:0%
um it would be either one of their
 
03:46:05.229 --> 03:46:05.239 align:start position:0%
judgment right and so what I'm wondering
 
03:46:07.670 --> 03:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
is when they're being turned away as
 
03:46:10.870 --> 03:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
you've seen recently is it a difference
 
03:46:13.550 --> 03:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
between um their judgment you know what
 
03:46:15.870 --> 03:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
I mean is is it um is the feeling that
 
03:46:18.149 --> 03:46:18.159 align:start position:0%
they're unnecessarily being turned away
 
03:46:20.870 --> 03:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a good question and I I I
 
03:46:24.389 --> 03:46:24.399 align:start position:0%
believe I know predominantly there are
 
03:46:26.630 --> 03:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
going to be various other instances
 
03:46:28.510 --> 03:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
where the Turning Away could have taken
 
03:46:32.510 --> 03:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
place however it's a lot of it is airing
 
03:46:34.309 --> 03:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
on the side of caution when the person
 
03:46:36.590 --> 03:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
says that they've ingested some type of
 
03:46:39.070 --> 03:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
narcotic at some point during the day
 
03:46:41.950 --> 03:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
then that that person the the jailers
 
03:46:44.110 --> 03:46:44.120 align:start position:0%
are airing on the side of caution okay
 
03:46:46.670 --> 03:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
get them medically cleared even though
 
03:46:48.710 --> 03:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
there aren't any signs of needing an
 
03:46:50.550 --> 03:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
life or having a life-threatening
 
03:46:53.149 --> 03:46:53.159 align:start position:0%
medical emergency can I follow up really
 
03:46:56.990 --> 03:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
quickly um thank you um an um I'm I'm
 
03:46:59.670 --> 03:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
curious about the idea of uh someone
 
03:47:01.710 --> 03:47:01.720 align:start position:0%
coming in who is intoxicated in one way
 
03:47:03.429 --> 03:47:03.439 align:start position:0%
or another um whether it's alcohol or
 
03:47:05.950 --> 03:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
drugs or something like that um and the
 
03:47:09.030 --> 03:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
ability um of having someone in the in
 
03:47:10.070 --> 03:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
the facility
 
03:47:13.590 --> 03:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
versus in in a an emergency room um of
 
03:47:16.149 --> 03:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
the ability of that person to be able to
 
03:47:18.830 --> 03:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
um receive you know medication assisted
 
03:47:20.590 --> 03:47:20.600 align:start position:0%
treatment or you know something like
 
03:47:24.790 --> 03:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
that that would help them um to um that
 
03:47:28.229 --> 03:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
would improve their chances of of um
 
03:47:31.030 --> 03:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
recovery or something like that do you
 
03:47:32.710 --> 03:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
think that there's you know better odds
 
03:47:34.630 --> 03:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
of that being available at an emergency
 
03:47:38.110 --> 03:47:38.120 align:start position:0%
room or in a correctional facility I I
 
03:47:39.950 --> 03:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
can only speak to the county in which I
 
03:47:43.750 --> 03:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
work so when asked with a a conversation
 
03:47:45.950 --> 03:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
with staff superintendent in the county
 
03:47:48.630 --> 03:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
in which I work the Staffing was a
 
03:47:51.830 --> 03:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
problem so having the nurse on on duty
 
03:47:54.389 --> 03:47:54.399 align:start position:0%
24 hours a day wasn't feasible for them
 
03:47:55.990 --> 03:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
so that's why they were unable to do
 
03:47:57.950 --> 03:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
their own evals whereas if it happened
 
03:48:00.149 --> 03:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
during business hours we'll say and that
 
03:48:03.070 --> 03:48:03.080 align:start position:0%
nurse was there then it was portrayed to
 
03:48:05.269 --> 03:48:05.279 align:start position:0%
us that that evaluation would then take
 
03:48:08.710 --> 03:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
place at that time and if not then the
 
03:48:10.510 --> 03:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
police will be deemed with that
 
03:48:12.870 --> 03:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility to uh take them to the
 
03:48:15.189 --> 03:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
hospital and be turned away ultimately
 
03:48:15.199 --> 03:48:19.349 align:start position:0%
hospital and be turned away ultimately
thank

03:48:19.349 --> 03:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:22.469 --> 03:48:22.479 align:start position:0%
you no further question represent Stone
 
03:48:23.910 --> 03:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and real quickly thank you for
 
03:48:26.710 --> 03:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh in the case of you
 
03:48:29.229 --> 03:48:29.239 align:start position:0%
you Lodge somebody as a PC at say belnap
 
03:48:31.870 --> 03:48:31.880 align:start position:0%
County and uh within an hour an
 
03:48:33.630 --> 03:48:33.640 align:start position:0%
ambulance is dispatched who ends up
 
03:48:35.070 --> 03:48:35.080 align:start position:0%
providing the security coverage for that
 
03:48:37.950 --> 03:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
individual when they are sent to the
 
03:48:41.790 --> 03:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
hospital I'm going to say I don't know
 
03:48:44.429 --> 03:48:44.439 align:start position:0%
with that said I'm confident that it's
 
03:48:45.670 --> 03:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
going to be the Laconia Police
 
03:48:46.790 --> 03:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
Department because that's the
 
03:48:50.349 --> 03:48:50.359 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction in which that the jail uh
 
03:48:54.309 --> 03:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
is located but I say that only based on
 
03:48:56.750 --> 03:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
I guess using my my common sense to it
 
03:48:58.990 --> 03:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
because the jail isn't isn't trained to
 
03:49:02.429 --> 03:49:02.439 align:start position:0%
do that um to more answer to answer that
 
03:49:04.110 --> 03:49:04.120 align:start position:0%
more directly on behalf of the Guilford
 
03:49:06.269 --> 03:49:06.279 align:start position:0%
Police we have never been called to go
 
03:49:08.070 --> 03:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
back and provide that security for the
 
03:49:11.630 --> 03:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
ambulance only leaving lonia PD to be
 
03:49:14.429 --> 03:49:14.439 align:start position:0%
the ones to do so thank
 
03:49:16.830 --> 03:49:16.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony thank
 
03:49:17.990 --> 03:49:18.000 align:start position:0%

03:49:20.269 --> 03:49:20.279 align:start position:0%

03:49:38.309 --> 03:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
