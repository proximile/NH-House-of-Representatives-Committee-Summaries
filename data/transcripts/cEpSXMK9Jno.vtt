00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.829 align:start position:0%
practices um for redeveloping these into
recreational

00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
recreational
 
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
in um dealing with these problems
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
identifying and dealing with problems so
 
00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
that the trails are safe for people who
 
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:28.360 align:start position:0%
walk ride their bikes use ohvs run push
 
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
baby stroll
 
00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:33.519 align:start position:0%
Etc and the committee as it is designed
 
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
to be set up is a legislative committee
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
with four members uh it's a lot easier
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
to find four members than it is to find
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
20 members and these legislators could
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
easily ask for uh assistance and advice
 
00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:53.959 align:start position:0%
and expert testimony from people who are
 
00:09:56.069 --> 00:09:56.079 align:start position:0%
more knowledgeable than we legislators
 
00:09:59.710 --> 00:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
on these issues so the one of the main
 
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
uh groups of people that they would
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
get uh information from are the state
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
agencies Department of transportations
 
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:11.240 align:start position:0%
with Transportation which handles uh
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
railroad corridors Department of Natural
 
00:10:16.269 --> 00:10:16.279 align:start position:0%
and cultural resources Bureau of trails
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
which deal with recreational trails in
 
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
the state and um also yeah and that
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
would be and the Department of
 
00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services as to the hazards
 
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
that could be present on these abandon
 
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
and rail beds there's also a list in the
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
Bill of things of other experts what
 
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
expert information uh the committee
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
would be looking for people who are
 
00:10:43.069 --> 00:10:43.079 align:start position:0%
familiar with establishing bmps or best
 
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
management practices uh identifying
 
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
areas of contamination concern residual
 
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
contamination from railroad operations
 
00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:54.519 align:start position:0%
and then the impact of motorized
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles on rail Trails pedestrian
 
00:10:58.750 --> 00:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
impact on trails and the impact on a
 
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
butter along these recreational Trails
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh the the uh committee would be in
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
effect from now until the end of this
 
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
session which would be November of
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
2022 and hopefully uh would come up with
 
00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
a uh list a best management practices
 
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:20.680 align:start position:0%
for the development or the maintenance
 
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
of rail Trails recreational rail trails
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
in the state and so I ask for you to
 
00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:29.240 align:start position:0%
listen to the testimony and vote Yes to
 
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
support the bill I will say that uh
 
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
representatives from uh Department of
 
00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
Natural and cultural resources division
 
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
of parks is here and also uh from the
 
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
Department of uh Transportation so if
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
the committee later has questions for
 
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
those folks um they are willing to
 
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
answer questions they have told me thank
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
you and I will take questions if you
 
00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
ask there any
 
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
questions represent and Mr chairman a
 
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
question for representative
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
Smith um this is commendable I use the
 
00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
trails all the time and and I'm from a
 
00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
railroad family so I understand uh
 
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:13.720 align:start position:0%
having grown up on the main line of the
 
00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:17.079 align:start position:0%
prr who my family did uh the question
 
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
I've got though is with all these great
 
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
state organizations already working on
 
00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:24.839 align:start position:0%
it and having responsibility for that is
 
00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:26.959 align:start position:0%
there not already such a set of
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines and and why do you need an
 
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
IAL committee if you've already got
 
00:12:34.189 --> 00:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
State agencies that are responsible um
 
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
for these
 
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
activities well um thank you for your
 
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
question the last year we had a bill
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
requiring that the
 
00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:48.430 align:start position:0%
requiring that the
state

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
remediate toxins contaminants hazardous
 
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
things that are on rail trails and
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
proposed rail trails and that was a very
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
cost would be a very cost costly
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
Endeavor and one of the suggestions made
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
to me by the former director of Bureau
 
00:13:06.189 --> 00:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
of trails was putting together best
 
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
management practices which would be
 
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
educational and also help to determine
 
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
what would be the best steps to take and
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
so that is uh why this bill was
 
00:13:19.629 --> 00:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
introduced there is there are no best
 
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
management practices in place in New
 
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for the development of rail
 
00:13:26.509 --> 00:13:26.519 align:start position:0%
Trails although Massachusetts does have
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
them and one of the first things they
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
stay on their lengthy uh pamphlet on it
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
is that we have to assume there are
 
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
beds okay thank you
 
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
sure any other
 
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
one do you foresee uh that any
 
00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
additional legislation coming uh out of
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh this from this committee or from from
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
the from this committee that uh this
 
00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.350 align:start position:0%
the from this committee that uh this
Phill

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
Phill
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
requests I'm not sure how best
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
management practices if they are put
 
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
into statute I don't believe they are
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
because best management practices are
 
00:14:18.189 --> 00:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
not law they don't us as far as I know I
 
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
mean someone might know a better better
 
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
than I but I know that when I look at uh
 
00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:23.990 align:start position:0%
than I but I know that when I look at uh
Timber

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
Timber
 
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
harvesting um there are best management
 
00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
practices uh which go into a lot more
 
00:14:34.829 --> 00:14:34.839 align:start position:0%
depth than um the statute does and they
 
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
are not administrative rules to the best
 
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
of my knowledge so therefore they do not
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
have the authority of
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
law thank you and I would welcome
 
00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:50.519 align:start position:0%
correction if I'm wrong thank you uh any
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh any other
 
00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
questions um representative Smith does
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
this would this committee work with um
 
00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:03.759 align:start position:0%
law enforcement at all uh to mitigate
 
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
activities like crime in urban areas
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
along Urban sections
 
00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:11.839 align:start position:0%
of that would be up to the I mean the
 
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
whatever is deemed important the
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
committee could call on people to help
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
them put together the best management
 
00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
practices but since the bmps would be
 
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
for the development and the maintenance
 
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.430 align:start position:0%
for the development and the maintenance
of

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
Trails um I don't know if that would fit
 
00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
in but that would be up to the committee
 
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
and uh the input They will receive from
 
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
the people that they are reaching out
 
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:40.600 align:start position:0%

00:17:09.789 --> 00:17:09.799 align:start position:0%
to help the people who abut the rail
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
trails that are used for o ohrv traffic
 
00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
I came across a document from
 
00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and realized that we have
 
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
no such standardized procedure manual
 
00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
for New
 
00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:23.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in working with the do and
 
00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
train experts we heard of Health
 
00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
threatening fugitive dust which is dust
 
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:31.160 align:start position:0%
that literally escapes from where it it
 
00:17:32.669 --> 00:17:32.679 align:start position:0%
from where it's
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
from but in talking to e to the experts
 
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
we also heard that there are other
 
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
health concerns regarding these
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
abandoned train tracks the brakes used
 
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
asbestos the trains had spills fuel
 
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:47.720 align:start position:0%
leaked there is also a concern of pasas
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
in the soil we heard about some areas of
 
00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
the rail trail where no vegetation grows
 
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
that's a concern the rail trails are
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
some of the jewels in New Hampshire's
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
crown we need to both protect them and
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
to protect the people who use them this
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
bill sets up a committee to establish
 
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
best practices for rail trail Management
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and it is based on what
 
00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has already done it would
 
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
look at ways to protect the land whether
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
that be testing and removal of
 
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
contaminated soil or planting vegetation
 
00:18:25.149 --> 00:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
to curtail fugitive dust this bill would
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
help establish a state standardized
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
approach of Protec our rail trails and
 
00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
the people who use them in New Hampshire
 
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
I urge you all to vote ought to pass on
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:41.960 align:start position:0%

bill with that I will close the
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
hearing and I would like to open up an
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%

executive session on this here on this
so

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
discussion I uh personally uh I I'll get
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
I'll start to where I where I
 
00:21:50.269 --> 00:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
am the there are a lot of rail
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
trails in the in the
 
00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.230 align:start position:0%
trails in the in the
state

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
and they're they're basically railro
 
00:21:58.159 --> 00:21:59.230 align:start position:0%
and they're they're basically railro
railroad

00:21:59.230 --> 00:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
railroad
 
00:22:06.029 --> 00:22:06.039 align:start position:0%
beds and what happens is a lot of them
 
00:22:06.039 --> 00:22:08.350 align:start position:0%
beds and what happens is a lot of them
are

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
transfer and they just uh and that's
 
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
just it they just transferred as far as
 
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
I my understanding well we really don't
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
know what we're giving
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
them and it ought to be
 
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
encumbered on state so before they give
 
00:22:29.269 --> 00:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
stuff to folks
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
Ts that they are that there should be at
 
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:33.640 align:start position:0%
least we should at least look at what
 
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:37.400 align:start position:0%
we're giving and that is what this
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
committee that this bill proposes
 
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
establishes would establish a committee
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
to look at the best practices that
 
00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:46.919 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
done uh
 
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
when when we allow when we pass these
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
things over to the or put these into the
 
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
into the into public use and there are
 
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
best practices we we just don't know
 
00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:08.039 align:start position:0%
what they are and this this committee
 
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
will look into it if you look at the at
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
the bill it
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
says the committee shall submit an
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
interim report of its findings and any
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
recommendations for proposed legislation
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
to the speaker and the House of
 
00:23:24.149 --> 00:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
Representatives president and Senate Etc
 
00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:28.919 align:start position:0%
in other words uh it's just it's just
 
00:23:30.029 --> 00:23:30.039 align:start position:0%
doing due
 
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
diligence and it's it is something
 
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:42.159 align:start position:0%

without question something that uh
 
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
should be strongly considered it's long
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
over do there's a lot of rail Trails not
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
a lot ofsight as to what's actually in
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%

the bicycling committee I mean Community
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
are interested in this bill and uh they
 
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
seem to be in favor of it and the rail
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:55.640 align:start position:0%

good morning and thank you for taking my
 
00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
question um is there a chance that this
 
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
committee May dissolve once its use is
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
done and over with once the best
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
practices are established or is this an
 
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
end I can answer that um representative
 
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
it it is uh it will end automatically in
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
November of
 
00:25:26.679 --> 00:25:30.830 align:start position:0%
November of
2022

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
okay times uh when committees are passed
 
00:25:37.389 --> 00:25:37.399 align:start position:0%
into law you know to develop a committee
 
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
it takes months before they actually get
 
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
started so what we vote on now uh may
 
00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:45.919 align:start position:0%
not get to the house floor and then the

representative pear this is
 
00:59:11.589 --> 00:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
representative Mark Pearson from
 
00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
Hamstead I represent the ferial d uh
 
00:59:17.029 --> 00:59:17.039 align:start position:0%

house and I wish to introduce house
 
00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
buillt 235 relative to community small
 
00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:30.349 align:start position:0%
buillt 235 relative to community small
groundwater

00:59:30.349 --> 00:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
groundwater
 
00:59:34.029 --> 00:59:34.039 align:start position:0%
withdrawal I'll try to be brief this
 
00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
bill is in response to a problem that
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
arose in Hamstead a year and a half ago
 
00:59:45.870 --> 00:59:45.880 align:start position:0%
a family discovered their well went dry
 
00:59:49.029 --> 00:59:49.039 align:start position:0%
neighbors discovered that their Wells
 
00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
were either going dry or the water
 
00:59:57.710 --> 00:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
coloration had turned bad they hired Mr
 
01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
Leonard sarus he's known as Lee sist who
 
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
is a hydro
 
01:00:05.829 --> 01:00:05.839 align:start position:0%
geologist he procured maps of the
 
01:00:08.109 --> 01:00:08.119 align:start position:0%
streams flowing underground a lot of
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
research was
 
01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:13.640 align:start position:0%
done they came to the conclusion that
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
possibly the problem stemmed from the
 
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
Hamstead area water company drilling
 
01:00:22.589 --> 01:00:22.599 align:start position:0%
Wells nearby and pumping large
 
01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:25.960 align:start position:0%
quantities of water per day
 
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
the group of people in Hamstead did two
 
01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:31.480 align:start position:0%
things first they filed a
 
01:00:35.789 --> 01:00:35.799 align:start position:0%
lawsuit and Monday's Union Leader
 
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
newspaper uh related how an injunction
 
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
against Haw for overpumping is in force
 
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
pending the outcome of the trial the
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
second thing they did was to ask area
 
01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
legislators to intervene not in a
 
01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:55.640 align:start position:0%
retrospective way about their problem
 
01:00:58.349 --> 01:00:58.359 align:start position:0%
but in a prospective way that similar
 
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
problems stemming from overpumping might
 
01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:02.630 align:start position:0%
problems stemming from overpumping might
be

01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
prevented Southeastern and South Central
 
01:01:09.069 --> 01:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are growing more water is
 
01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
needed that's okay but it cannot be at
 
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
the expense of the wells that were
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
already drilled and are in use I
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
convened a meeting with all of the
 
01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:25.039 align:start position:0%
legislators representing Hamstead I
 
01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
invited three people from the Department
 
01:01:32.029 --> 01:01:32.039 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services to come I
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
invited Lee arpus the hydro
 
01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:37.640 align:start position:0%
geologist and I also invited
 
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
representatives of Hamstead area water
 
01:01:44.109 --> 01:01:44.119 align:start position:0%
company uh we are not interested in
 
01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
putting anybody out of business and I
 
01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:49.640 align:start position:0%
might say somewhat humorously all the
 
01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
people who represent Hamstead are
 
01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:55.400 align:start position:0%
Republicans we are not anti-business
 
01:01:57.390 --> 01:01:57.400 align:start position:0%
but neither are we
 
01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:01.640 align:start position:0%
anti- families losing their water
 
01:02:04.589 --> 01:02:04.599 align:start position:0%
because of overpumping
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
we met several times we crafted the
 
01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:13.720 align:start position:0%
language of Two Bills one passed
 
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
unanimously out of this committee last
 
01:02:19.829 --> 01:02:19.839 align:start position:0%
year when on consent went to the Senate
 
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
got attached to an Omnibus Bill and is
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
in law a second Bill also came to this
 
01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
committee passed unanimously went on
 
01:02:33.269 --> 01:02:33.279 align:start position:0%
consent and went to the Senate and died
 
01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:35.720 align:start position:0%
along with a number of other bills
 
01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:36.839 align:start position:0%
because of
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
covid in the testimony that I gave but
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
more importantly Lee sarus he's the
 
01:02:49.549 --> 01:02:49.559 align:start position:0%
scientist I mentioned that this bill was
 
01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:51.640 align:start position:0%
the product of Department of
 
01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services as well as the
 
01:02:59.190 --> 01:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
legislators as well as our local
 
01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:01.799 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologist there was however a
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
testimony given by someone from Dees
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
that was less than enthusiastic let's
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
put it that way I asked then chair
 
01:03:16.589 --> 01:03:16.599 align:start position:0%
Suzanne Smith if I could have a chance
 
01:03:19.269 --> 01:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
to speak to that and graciously she said
 
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
yes and let me read just a small portion
 
01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:26.079 align:start position:0%
of what Rob Scott the commissioner of
 
01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
Dees said in his letter currently New
 
01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees does not have the
 
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
authority to require that a small
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
community water supply well applicant or
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
owner mitigate potential adverse impacts
 
01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:41.720 align:start position:0%
to private water supply in the event
 
01:03:44.589 --> 01:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
that impacts occur although there are
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
neither widespread reports nor a long
 
01:03:50.029 --> 01:03:50.039 align:start position:0%
record of small community well impacts
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
to private Wells the increasing density
 
01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:55.400 align:start position:0%
of development within the the state and
 
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
the use of small community water supply
 
01:04:00.829 --> 01:04:00.839 align:start position:0%
systems at subdivisions to increase Land
 
01:04:00.839 --> 01:04:02.549 align:start position:0%
systems at subdivisions to increase Land
Development

01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
Development
 
01:04:05.870 --> 01:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
increases the likelihood for these
 
01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
impacts in the
 
01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
future um so it goes on to say that he
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh believes that the bills that uh we
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
brought would provide the dees authority
 
01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
to require a mitigation plan be
 
01:04:24.269 --> 01:04:24.279 align:start position:0%
developed and so on and that is signed
 
01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
Robert Scott commissioner so whatever an
 
01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
individual from Dees may
 
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
say the
 
01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner thanked us for giving him
 
01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
the authority to deal with a problem
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
which he
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
recognized now the bill before you today
 
01:04:48.190 --> 01:04:48.200 align:start position:0%
is a variant of that second bill that
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
died in the Senate it's tweaking here
 
01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:53.799 align:start position:0%
and there and frankly if anything and I
 
01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
do not mean a pun here we watered it
 
01:04:58.829 --> 01:04:58.839 align:start position:0%
down a little bit from last time well I
 
01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:01.839 align:start position:0%
think you can tell uh I am not a
 
01:05:04.829 --> 01:05:04.839 align:start position:0%
scientist but Lee arpus who I hope is on
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
this meeting is I'll be happy to answer
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
any questions but the technical
 
01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
scientific things I think should be uh
 
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
answered by him if he's on the
 
01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
meeting yes he representative
 
01:05:24.789 --> 01:05:24.799 align:start position:0%
Pon yes sir uh he is
 
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:26.960 align:start position:0%

01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:31.640 align:start position:0%
meeting and uh he does look to testify
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh so you're saying that he is that he
 
01:05:38.349 --> 01:05:38.359 align:start position:0%
would be best any technical questions
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:48.269 --> 01:05:48.279 align:start position:0%

that you had a couple changes that you
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
made to the previous bill would you mind
 
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
outlining what those changes were for
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%

up with 56,600 gallons please well I do
 
01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
recall that that number was important it
 
01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:51.559 align:start position:0%
was brought forth at our group meetings
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
once again if there is a scientific
 
01:06:56.789 --> 01:06:56.799 align:start position:0%
reason behind that Mr sarus would know
 
01:06:58.269 --> 01:06:58.279 align:start position:0%
that not
 
01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:00.680 align:start position:0%

there are no other committee committee
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%

01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
by way of background let me introduce

industry in instances where conditions
 
01:11:27.070 --> 01:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
warrant I have also represented the
 
01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
Public House Bill
 
01:11:32.669 --> 01:11:32.679 align:start position:0%
235 addresses gaps and our current
 
01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
regulations for new community Wells that
 
01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
will pump up to
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
57,600 gallons per day in summary here
 
01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
is what the bill will provide and
 
01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
similar to uh representative Pearson I'd
 
01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
like to start with reading from a letter
 
01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
that commissioner Scott prepared in
 
01:11:56.709 --> 01:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
support of a very similar Bill we
 
01:11:59.629 --> 01:11:59.639 align:start position:0%
brought forward to this committee last
 
01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
year the letter
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
States this bill would authorize the New
 
01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
Services to establish criteria within
 
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules for new small
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
community water supply Wells to ensure
 
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
that if these Wells cause an adverse
 
01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
impact to nearby private water supply
 
01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:26.070 align:start position:0%
impact to nearby private water supply
Wells

01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
Wells
 
01:12:29.709 --> 01:12:29.719 align:start position:0%
nhdes can require the owner to perform
 
01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
an investigation and
 
01:12:35.149 --> 01:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
mitigation why is this important the
 
01:12:37.390 --> 01:12:37.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner goes on to say and this is
 
01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
from his letter small community water
 
01:12:43.229 --> 01:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
supply Wells are not subject to
 
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
requirements to demonstrate that before
 
01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
using the well no adverse impacts to
 
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
surrounding water users or resources
 
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
will occur currently nhdes does not have
 
01:12:59.709 --> 01:12:59.719 align:start position:0%
authority to require that a small
 
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
community water supply well applicant
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
owner mitigate potential adverse impacts
 
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
to private water supply wells in the
 
01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
event that such impacts
 
01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
occur this bill will address that
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
Gap to add some perspective New
 
01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:22.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's groundwater protection act
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
prohibits 11
 
01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
specific adverse impacts from a new
 
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
community well pumping 40 gallons per
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
minute it provides none for a well
 
01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.070 align:start position:0%
minute it provides none for a well
pumping

01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
pumping
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
39 this bill will provide some
 
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
protection the second aspect this bill
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
addresses is one involving Community
 
01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
notification when a new small community
 
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
well is being
 
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
proposed it will require that the party
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
pursuing a new well provide the same
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
documents being provided to the dees to
 
01:14:02.629 --> 01:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
the affected communities to be clear
 
01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
these will be the same documents already
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
being provided to the
 
01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
dees nothing
 
01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:13.159 align:start position:0%
more one might ask do the people of New
 
01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire need this protection in
 
01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
thinking through this question please
 
01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
consider the following first New
 
01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population is inre inreasing
 
01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
and with it water demand causing greater
 
01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
stress on our
 
01:14:32.629 --> 01:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
aquifers in September 20120 the
 
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
conquered monitor published an article
 
01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
quoting Dees stating that over 4,000 new
 
01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:41.080 align:start position:0%
wells are being installed in New
 
01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire each
 
01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
year second water use Trends are
 
01:14:48.669 --> 01:14:48.679 align:start position:0%
increasing for example from lawn
 
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
irrigation causing greater stress on our
 
01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
aquifers that same conquered
 
01:14:59.870 --> 01:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
monitor article also discusses this
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
aspect now I'd like to read again from
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott's letter I believe
 
01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
it's similar to what uh representative
 
01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
Pearson had
 
01:15:10.669 --> 01:15:10.679 align:start position:0%
shared the increasing density of
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
development within the state and the use
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
of small community water supply systems
 
01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
at subdivisions to increase Land
 
01:15:21.870 --> 01:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
Development increases the likelihood for
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
these impacts what he's speaking to
 
01:15:28.110 --> 01:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
there is these adverse
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
impacts third New Hampshire is
 
01:15:34.110 --> 01:15:34.120 align:start position:0%
experiencing more severe drought which
 
01:15:36.669 --> 01:15:36.679 align:start position:0%
brings another type of significant
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
aquafers last year's drought impacts
 
01:15:47.229 --> 01:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
demonstrated how severe this can
 
01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
be taken together this legislation makes
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
sense to allow Contin development of our
 
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
groundwater resources in a responsible
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
manner while protecting residents with
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
their own
 
01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
Wells thank you and I'd be pleased now
 
01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
to answer questions already posed and
 
01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:15.390 --> 01:16:15.400 align:start position:0%

01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
says an alternative alternative more
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
streamlined approach for addressing
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
potential impacts to other water users
 
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
was considered in HB 1347 of the 2020
 
01:16:59.870 --> 01:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
legislative session how does this
 
01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
particular Bill HB 235 we have in front
 
01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:13.229 align:start position:0%
 
1347

01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:13.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:16.149 --> 01:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
anybody thank you for asking that
 
01:17:19.629 --> 01:17:19.639 align:start position:0%
question one thing that we changed with
 
01:17:23.070 --> 01:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is that the uh the bill
 
01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
offered last year uh was focused on
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
causing adverse impacts solely to
 
01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
private individual Wells um this bill um
 
01:17:36.629 --> 01:17:36.639 align:start position:0%
was expanded to include similar adverse
 
01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
impacts to public water supply Wells
 
01:17:42.149 --> 01:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
that is providing water to communities
 
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
and um providing or posing similar
 
01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
adverse impacts to multiple unit Wells
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
that might be a a small uh duplex or
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
apartment building so I think in essence
 
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
what we said is safely providing water
 
01:17:59.709 --> 01:17:59.719 align:start position:0%
to the residents in New Hampshire should
 
01:18:01.629 --> 01:18:01.639 align:start position:0%
not be differentiated from a private
 
01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:04.360 align:start position:0%
well uh to any other resident by adding
 
01:18:06.669 --> 01:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
these other two categories and these by
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
the way come um directly out of the
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
existing statute the groundwater
 
01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:15.709 align:start position:0%
existing statute the groundwater
protection

01:18:15.709 --> 01:18:15.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
act so just a further explanation or or
 
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
clarification so we've increased uh the
 
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
coverage is basically what you're saying
 
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:18:29.550 --> 01:18:29.560 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct we included um
 
01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
additional Wells providing water to our
 
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
residents okay thank you any uh other
 
01:18:40.229 --> 01:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
questions MERS members here members
 
01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:41.920 align:start position:0%

01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:48.800 align:start position:0%

thank you very much Mr chairman um I was
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
the chair of the large groundwater uh
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
study commission uh in
 
01:21:21.629 --> 01:21:21.639 align:start position:0%
1998 and uh it actually lasted for six
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
years so it was a very very
 
01:21:26.189 --> 01:21:26.199 align:start position:0%
comprehensive study commission and well
 
01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
represented um of various interests uh
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
we did an incredible amount of work that
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
actually came up with a large
 
01:21:37.470 --> 01:21:37.480 align:start position:0%
groundwater withdrawal uh rules that now
 
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
stand in our statutes um we are under
 
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
great pressure from um from the USA
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
Springs development uh to do some what
 
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
seemed like highly
 
01:21:54.189 --> 01:21:54.199 align:start position:0%
controversial uh regulations
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
at the end of the the commission we
 
01:21:59.590 --> 01:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
decided that uh we had gone as far as we
 
01:22:03.070 --> 01:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
could in terms of uh regulating the
 
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
large groundwater com um perm uh permits
 
01:22:10.990 --> 01:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
but that there was out outstanding
 
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
problem and potentially a very large
 
01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
problem with the cumulative impact of
 
01:22:18.910 --> 01:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
the smaller
 
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
groundwater uh
 
01:22:23.790 --> 01:22:23.800 align:start position:0%
withdrawals and as uh the the
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Dees says these can be
 
01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
substantial um if you have say a
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
subdivision or a proliferation of
 
01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
subdivisions it can really add up and we
 
01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:40.280 align:start position:0%
we were um sad that we did not have the
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address this as well um I
 
01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
am I'm also saddened that we keep
 
01:22:53.189 --> 01:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
bringing forward um very
 
01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
critical measures that need to be
 
01:23:00.030 --> 01:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
undertaken to protect the uh the public
 
01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
and the environment and Dees has to
 
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
repeatedly say yes it's really good it's
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
really important but we don't have the
 
01:23:12.270 --> 01:23:12.280 align:start position:0%
resources to do it um so I think that in
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
this instance we have a clear uh example
 
01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
of what we expect will be happening
 
01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
increasingly and which was for seen by
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
our our large groundwater commission uh
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
in 98 and now it is beginning to come to
 
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
pass and it it with our increasing
 
01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
droughts it's becoming even more
 
01:23:38.510 --> 01:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
critical um I think that we should pass
 
01:23:43.709 --> 01:23:43.719 align:start position:0%
this bill and um and ask Dees to tighten
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
their belts and do what they can to get
 
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:51.950 --> 01:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
done thank you is there any questions
 
01:23:53.950 --> 01:23:53.960 align:start position:0%

um and review applications for new
 
01:25:58.229 --> 01:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
sources of water for Community water
 
01:26:00.149 --> 01:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
systems and there's a two-tiered
 
01:26:01.629 --> 01:26:01.639 align:start position:0%
approach right now we have what we call
 
01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
the large groundwater withdrawals which
 
01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
exceeds that volume you heard earlier
 
01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
57,600 57,600 gallons a day or 40
 
01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
gallons a minute if you pump all day
 
01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
long and those are typically large
 
01:26:15.109 --> 01:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
withdrawals for municipalities um to
 
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
support their water system and there's a
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
lot of work that goes on with those
 
01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
large withdrawals lots of testing it by
 
01:26:23.189 --> 01:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
Statute it almost takes at least two
 
01:26:25.950 --> 01:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
years to complete and it can be a couple
 
01:26:28.990 --> 01:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
hundred, in some settings to for an
 
01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:30.280 align:start position:0%
applicant to get through that permitting
 
01:26:31.950 --> 01:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
process and I would invite you to reach
 
01:26:33.390 --> 01:26:33.400 align:start position:0%
out to some of the large municipalities
 
01:26:35.709 --> 01:26:35.719 align:start position:0%
to ask about their
 
01:26:38.229 --> 01:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
experience um that work also has to be
 
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
done under the oversight of licensed
 
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
professionals um geologists or Engineers
 
01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
with the right
 
01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
qualifications the other tier is small
 
01:26:46.030 --> 01:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
groundwater withdrawals which is what
 
01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
we're talking about today and that's
 
01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
less than 5
 
01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
57,600 gallons a day and often but not
 
01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:54.280 align:start position:0%
always those are for really small
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
subdivisions like Standalone housing
 
01:26:58.590 --> 01:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
developments and and so they have to
 
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
develop a water system and they don't
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
need a lot of water so they do a small
 
01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:04.639 align:start position:0%
withdrawal um the work can be completed
 
01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
right now by water system operators well
 
01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:07.750 align:start position:0%
right now by water system operators well
well

01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
drillers water well contractors and also
 
01:27:13.950 --> 01:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
liced professionals if people want to do
 
01:27:18.310 --> 01:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
that um House Bill 235 would
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
substantially change that small
 
01:27:21.310 --> 01:27:21.320 align:start position:0%
community well sighting process which is
 
01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
pretty streamlined right now and we
 
01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
require substantial testing compared to
 
01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
what you do now which is just a couple
 
01:27:29.550 --> 01:27:29.560 align:start position:0%
days of testing in the field you have to
 
01:27:31.629 --> 01:27:31.639 align:start position:0%
do several weeks if you were to go
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
forward with requirements of
 
01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
235 um it also requires that there be a
 
01:27:37.870 --> 01:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
couple public notification periods and
 
01:27:40.189 --> 01:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
that Dees staff respond in writing to
 
01:27:40.199 --> 01:27:41.109 align:start position:0%
that Dees staff respond in writing to
public

01:27:41.109 --> 01:27:41.119 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
comments um we expose we opposed Bill
 
01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
primarily because it's just not
 
01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
necessary based on our experience and we
 
01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
haven't seen these small withdrawals
 
01:27:51.149 --> 01:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
cause impacts the impacts you heard
 
01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
about earlier had to do with the
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
replacement well for large withdrawals
 
01:27:56.629 --> 01:27:56.639 align:start position:0%
which was addressed last session through
 
01:27:59.550 --> 01:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
a bill that passed house bill um 1252
 
01:28:01.709 --> 01:28:01.719 align:start position:0%
which now requires more public
 
01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
involvement and impact assessment for
 
01:28:05.109 --> 01:28:05.119 align:start position:0%
larg placement
 
01:28:07.830 --> 01:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
Wells um last session we supported the
 
01:28:10.270 --> 01:28:10.280 align:start position:0%
concept of a of a bill that had a
 
01:28:11.790 --> 01:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
similar intent but it was quite a bit
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
different actually um house bill um
 
01:28:18.109 --> 01:28:18.119 align:start position:0%
1347 that bill just said Dees could
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
develop rules to ensure small
 
01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:21.639 align:start position:0%
withdrawals don't cause impacts to
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
essentially other residential Wells um
 
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
out out in the environment this bill is
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
quite a bit different where in addition
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
to the public comment periods we also um
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
would have to assess the replenishment
 
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
rate of an aquafer which is something
 
01:28:36.910 --> 01:28:36.920 align:start position:0%
that requires a lot more work um you
 
01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
would have to have licensed
 
01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
professionals um this bill's this bill
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
is very explicit on the level of work
 
01:28:44.430 --> 01:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
that has to be done and so while we
 
01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
supported the concept of the bill last
 
01:28:48.109 --> 01:28:48.119 align:start position:0%
session admitting last session just like
 
01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
this session we can't show the need for
 
01:28:51.790 --> 01:28:51.800 align:start position:0%
it at this time this bill just goes a
 
01:28:54.070 --> 01:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
lot further than the previous Bill did
 
01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
and if you compare the two bills you'll
 
01:28:58.390 --> 01:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
see the citations and statutes at the
 
01:29:01.310 --> 01:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
level of work um that that is required
 
01:29:03.109 --> 01:29:03.119 align:start position:0%
by this bill that may not be necessary
 
01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
in many settings where these Wells are
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
being sided where there aren't a lot of
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
competing water
 
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
users um if it is um decided that we're
 
01:29:11.950 --> 01:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
going to move forward with this bill I
 
01:29:13.709 --> 01:29:13.719 align:start position:0%
would just recommend we put a fiscal
 
01:29:16.109 --> 01:29:16.119 align:start position:0%
note together um to assess the cost the
 
01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
dees staff for administering the
 
01:29:19.990 --> 01:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
requirements the communities and the
 
01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
customers of Water Systems to of the
 
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
requirements in this bill and thank you
 
01:29:29.950 --> 01:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
questions I chair has one question maybe
 
01:29:34.679 --> 01:29:36.350 align:start position:0%
questions I chair has one question maybe
it's

01:29:36.350 --> 01:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh what what is the difference for for
 
01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
large groundwater withdrawals
 
01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:44.709 align:start position:0%
large groundwater withdrawals
57,000

01:29:44.709 --> 01:29:44.719 align:start position:0%
57,000
 
01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
Etc uh what's the difference of for
 
01:29:55.229 --> 01:29:55.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:59.149 --> 01:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
uh Wells of say 50,000 each and getting
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
100,000 out of them and not having to
 
01:30:03.070 --> 01:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
bother going through LGE
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
groundw is that
 
01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
allowable is that a
 
01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:11.189 align:start position:0%
allowable is that a
reasonable

01:30:11.189 --> 01:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
refence thank you for the question um is
 
01:30:15.390 --> 01:30:15.400 align:start position:0%
that actually issue was addressed by the
 
01:30:16.510 --> 01:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
groundwater commission that
 
01:30:18.669 --> 01:30:18.679 align:start position:0%
representative Spang spoke of earlier
 
01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
and that people were trying to do that
 
01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
originally citing Wells at 39 gallons a
 
01:30:24.990 --> 01:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
minute to get around this big permitting
 
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
process we have and so RSA 45C was
 
01:30:31.390 --> 01:30:31.400 align:start position:0%
amended many years ago to block that and
 
01:30:35.070 --> 01:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
basically um has a language well or well
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
cited out a property or place of
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
business so you now add up the multiple
 
01:30:40.750 --> 01:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
Wells to determine what threshold you
 
01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
are large or small withdrawals so that
 
01:30:45.390 --> 01:30:45.400 align:start position:0%
that cannot occur anymore but it was an
 
01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:47.310 align:start position:0%
that cannot occur anymore but it was an
issue

01:30:47.310 --> 01:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
initially thank you are there any
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
questions have representative Smith uh
 
01:30:59.189 --> 01:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
question is she she's on mute s you're
 
01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:06.790 --> 01:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
representative representative Smith
 
01:31:09.470 --> 01:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:13.550 --> 01:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
mute okay I'm here um thank you Mr Karan
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um the bill last
 
01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
year which Dees was not opposed to um is
 
01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
as you say quite a bit different than
 
01:31:28.990 --> 01:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
the bill we now have before us and um
 
01:31:32.109 --> 01:31:32.119 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson the prime sponsor
 
01:31:34.910 --> 01:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh cited uh an example of why he
 
01:31:38.109 --> 01:31:38.119 align:start position:0%
introduced the bills a person um people
 
01:31:42.270 --> 01:31:42.280 align:start position:0%
in Hamstead who lost power or lost water
 
01:31:46.390 --> 01:31:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh because a a uh a larger well was put
 
01:31:48.990 --> 01:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
in nearby
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
will will the bill 23 5 as I before us
 
01:31:58.189 --> 01:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
now help them any more than the one
 
01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:06.719 align:start position:0%
1347 I would say it's a it's a different
 
01:32:08.669 --> 01:32:08.679 align:start position:0%
issue that well that caused those
 
01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
impacts was a replacement large
 
01:32:13.390 --> 01:32:13.400 align:start position:0%
withdrawal which was addressed under
 
01:32:15.310 --> 01:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
legislation that did pass and is now in
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
law last year it was House Bill 1252
 
01:32:21.390 --> 01:32:21.400 align:start position:0%
which stipulates how that type of well
 
01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
would be replaced in the future to
 
01:32:25.229 --> 01:32:25.239 align:start position:0%
assess impacts so that that well was not
 
01:32:27.070 --> 01:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
a new small community well which is
 
01:32:29.470 --> 01:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
being discussed today so in a lot of
 
01:32:31.709 --> 01:32:31.719 align:start position:0%
ways that Hamstead scenario that one
 
01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
specific scenario which was very rare um
 
01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
has been addressed and is not it would
 
01:32:40.590 --> 01:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
not be affected by this bill in that
 
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
type of scenario followup Mr chair or a
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
followup yes
 
01:32:50.990 --> 01:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
um so who would this help if it was
 
01:32:54.390 --> 01:32:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:57.550 --> 01:32:57.560 align:start position:0%
work this spill would help help nearby
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
residential well owners um that could
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
potentially be be impacted by new small
 
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
community well that there would have to
 
01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
be a a proactive assessment and maybe an
 
01:33:09.629 --> 01:33:09.639 align:start position:0%
ongoing assessment to ensure they're not
 
01:33:11.950 --> 01:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
being dewatered by a new small community
 
01:33:14.189 --> 01:33:14.199 align:start position:0%
water supply well so that's who could
 
01:33:16.030 --> 01:33:16.040 align:start position:0%
potentially help that being said we
 
01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
can't come up with a lot of examples
 
01:33:21.629 --> 01:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
where we have had adverse impacts and
 
01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
needed this authority to address them so
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the missing piece here
 
01:33:28.189 --> 01:33:28.199 align:start position:0%
while the concept is good we can't show
 
01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
the need and then there's costs
 
01:33:31.229 --> 01:33:31.239 align:start position:0%
associated with this work as well that
 
01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
01:33:36.270 --> 01:33:36.280 align:start position:0%
addressed thank
 
01:33:38.550 --> 01:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
you answer your
 
01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you representative
 
01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
Grassi representative
 
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:49.400 align:start position:0%
Grassi yes yes Mr chairman thank you um
 
01:33:52.229 --> 01:33:52.239 align:start position:0%
Mr turnon um I'm concerned about housing
 
01:33:54.430 --> 01:33:54.440 align:start position:0%
cost and one of the things that I'm
 
01:33:56.270 --> 01:33:56.280 align:start position:0%
looking at here is that a lot of times
 
01:33:58.510 --> 01:33:58.520 align:start position:0%
we're able to reduce housing cost by
 
01:34:00.750 --> 01:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
reduc the consumption of land instead of
 
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
having two acre lots you do a
 
01:34:03.669 --> 01:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
conservation subdivision where you make
 
01:34:05.229 --> 01:34:05.239 align:start position:0%
cluster of the lots and have a single
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
Community well is this going to
 
01:34:11.870 --> 01:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
basically discourage people from trying
 
01:34:14.109 --> 01:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
to lower housing costs by using
 
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
conservation subdivisions or cluster
 
01:34:18.310 --> 01:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and basically drive people
 
01:34:20.229 --> 01:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
back to the two-acre lot with their
 
01:34:23.470 --> 01:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
everybody having their own well
 
01:34:25.229 --> 01:34:25.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I mean in the
 
01:34:26.709 --> 01:34:26.719 align:start position:0%
20 years of at the department I'm
 
01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
certainly aware of instances where
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
people looked at our permitting
 
01:34:32.430 --> 01:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
requirements for large groundwater
 
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
withdrawals and decided to put in a
 
01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
bunch of residential Wells instead of
 
01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
develop a public water system and so yes
 
01:34:41.709 --> 01:34:41.719 align:start position:0%
they had the larger Lots I can't say
 
01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the norm but I'm
 
01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
certainly aware that that's happened and
 
01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
one of the downsides to that is that the
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
residential Wells aren't I'm not saying
 
01:34:52.189 --> 01:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
they should be regulated but they're not
 
01:34:53.629 --> 01:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
necessarily required to be tested and
 
01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
meet standards and so you're also moving
 
01:34:58.750 --> 01:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
people away from regulated Community
 
01:35:00.629 --> 01:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
water systems that have water quality
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
that meets
 
01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:05.679 align:start position:0%
standards thank you and representative
 
01:35:08.830 --> 01:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
Kelly sir representative Kelly for a
 
01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman uh Mr
 
01:35:12.750 --> 01:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
kernin thank you for being here um my
 
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
question is could you just give a quick
 
01:35:16.629 --> 01:35:16.639 align:start position:0%
definition of what a large withdrawal
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
replacement well is just so I can
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
understand the
 
01:35:23.790 --> 01:35:23.800 align:start position:0%
difference sure it's when the statute
 
01:35:25.149 --> 01:35:25.159 align:start position:0%
was passed for large groundwater
 
01:35:28.510 --> 01:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
withdrawals in 1998 it was only for new
 
01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
withdrawals going forward um
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
but the it was important though that and
 
01:35:36.109 --> 01:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
the legislature included this that they
 
01:35:38.910 --> 01:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
initially Exempted um replacement Wells
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
um for those Wells that were constructed
 
01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
before 1998 because you want systems to
 
01:35:45.709 --> 01:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
invest in their infrastructure and and
 
01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
not be um not discouraged from replacing
 
01:35:51.149 --> 01:35:51.159 align:start position:0%
an inefficient well with a new one and
 
01:35:54.629 --> 01:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
so so they they did exempt them but as I
 
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
talked about new requirements put into
 
01:35:58.870 --> 01:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
place that when they are constructed
 
01:36:01.109 --> 01:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
that we do more testing include public
 
01:36:04.189 --> 01:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
involvement to ensure those pre-1998
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
withdrawals that are being replace now
 
01:36:08.470 --> 01:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
look at impacts um when we're appr when
 
01:36:10.109 --> 01:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
we're approving them and that the public
 
01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
or municipalities be notified of the
 
01:36:13.870 --> 01:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
replacement well so if there are
 
01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
concerns they can reconcile hey that's a
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
new activity and this is a new
 
01:36:22.870 --> 01:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
complaint thank you
 
01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
K just is this
 
01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
CH uh
 
01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
we large Wells and small Wells is really
 
01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:35.679 align:start position:0%
an issue of the amount of that there's
 
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
that magic number of
 
01:36:42.270 --> 01:36:42.280 align:start position:0%
57,000 whatever gallons
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
per gallons per hour I think it is Gall
 
01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
per day isn't there's a isn't that the
 
01:36:52.430 --> 01:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
differentiation between a large
 
01:36:54.910 --> 01:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
well of a small
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
well it it is and that number is sort of
 
01:37:00.669 --> 01:37:00.679 align:start position:0%
a relic from the early 90s when
 
01:37:02.910 --> 01:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
Community Wells first were had
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
regulations in New Hampshire for how
 
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
they would be developed um again for the
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
smaller Wells there were a more
 
01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
streamlined approach for proving them to
 
01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
make mainly just looking at water
 
01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
quality in the well sighting um from
 
01:37:17.470 --> 01:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
those Wells and the larger Wells really
 
01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
looking at the aquifer as a whole
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
because a larger well would have more
 
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
impacts on a regional water resources
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
than a a small withdrawal and so the
 
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
rules are broken out at that threshold
 
01:37:29.950 --> 01:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
just because typically unus pic
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
Portsmith or Rochester wouldn't develop
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
a well less than 40 gallons a minute or
 
01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
57,600 gallons a day and so it was kind
 
01:37:39.550 --> 01:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
of a consensus number back in the early
 
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
90s that was carried forward in the late
 
01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
90s when large groundwater withdrawal
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
legislation was passed and while it's
 
01:37:48.990 --> 01:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
not a magical number that impacts can or
 
01:37:50.229 --> 01:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
can't occur on either side of that
 
01:37:52.189 --> 01:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
number it has worked really well based
 
01:37:54.910 --> 01:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
on you know our experience since 1998 it
 
01:37:57.550 --> 01:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
seems to be a reasonable number and that
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
number was something the groundwater
 
01:38:01.149 --> 01:38:01.159 align:start position:0%
commission certainly kicked around
 
01:38:03.070 --> 01:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
plenty and I think we had consensus to
 
01:38:04.910 --> 01:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
leave it as is by the time the
 
01:38:09.189 --> 01:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
work chairman one question yes um Mr
 
01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
Kernan the uh the last speaker mentioned
 
01:38:18.189 --> 01:38:18.199 align:start position:0%
that you know the new hampster is
 
01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
getting additional 4,000 Wells a year
 
01:38:23.189 --> 01:38:23.199 align:start position:0%
that the use of water on an individual
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
commercial level was increased at the
 
01:38:28.709 --> 01:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
same time that you have more drought and
 
01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
that the the community density is
 
01:38:34.589 --> 01:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
increasing uh he cited those all as
 
01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
reasons for this bill um just to confirm
 
01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
that you believe that that those all
 
01:38:44.510 --> 01:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
those reasons are not uh strong enough
 
01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
to to Merit the bill and the cost of uh
 
01:38:54.109 --> 01:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
over well it's certainly true that more
 
01:38:59.550 --> 01:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
Wells are being installed Statewide um
 
01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
but there's also other things happening
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
in Southern New Hampshire where some of
 
01:39:04.589 --> 01:39:04.599 align:start position:0%
these small Wells are going offline
 
01:39:06.350 --> 01:39:06.360 align:start position:0%
because marac river water from
 
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester is being extended down there
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
and so while there is increased stress
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
on groundw in some places there's been
 
01:39:14.589 --> 01:39:14.599 align:start position:0%
decreased in other places certainly as
 
01:39:18.270 --> 01:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
time goes on and development occurs and
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
new wells are put near other Wells you
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
could see more interference and impacts
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
um but what I'm saying is right now we
 
01:39:27.790 --> 01:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
can't show that that's a problem that
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed and if it's
 
01:39:32.350 --> 01:39:32.360 align:start position:0%
something we want to get ahead of in
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
case it might happen somewhere well then
 
01:39:36.790 --> 01:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
this legislation should pass but then we
 
01:39:39.669 --> 01:39:39.679 align:start position:0%
need be funded to do the work as well um
 
01:39:42.030 --> 01:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
you know and also the cost to applicants
 
01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
and the customers of water systems at
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
least should be
 
01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
discussed yeah you know probably a
 
01:39:49.510 --> 01:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
better way of going about it other than
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
sort of peace mealing requirements and
 
01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
legislation is for watersheds aquifers
 
01:39:58.990 --> 01:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
communities to invest in assessing water
 
01:40:00.990 --> 01:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
their water supply conditions and having
 
01:40:03.070 --> 01:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
plans on how water supplies develop in
 
01:40:05.589 --> 01:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
their towns opposed to sort of this
 
01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
peace meal One impact out of time
 
01:40:09.550 --> 01:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
assessment because you know the new
 
01:40:11.950 --> 01:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
water users and land owners that have
 
01:40:14.030 --> 01:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
undeveloped property have a right to
 
01:40:15.390 --> 01:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
reasonably use the water on their
 
01:40:17.790 --> 01:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
property so it's not the case that even
 
01:40:21.149 --> 01:40:21.159 align:start position:0%
if laws are passed requiring permits and
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
for them to obtain that they might not
 
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
be able to develop their water supply
 
01:40:25.750 --> 01:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
they they they would have their legal
 
01:40:27.390 --> 01:40:27.400 align:start position:0%
rights through common law also to seek
 
01:40:29.109 --> 01:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
access to their water so we got have to
 
01:40:31.589 --> 01:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
think about property rights and people's
 
01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
rights reasonable use of water on their
 
01:40:35.070 --> 01:40:35.080 align:start position:0%
land even though there's existing users
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
nearby their their rights are kind of
 
01:40:40.669 --> 01:40:40.679 align:start position:0%
equal under the reasonable use
 
01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
Doctrine thanks
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
sir any any other questions no one has
 
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
their hand raised there are no hands
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
raised there are no hands raised uh
 
01:41:03.310 --> 01:41:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:08.310 --> 01:41:08.320 align:start position:0%

01:58:50.950 --> 01:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
much I will try to speak slowly although
 
01:58:54.910 --> 01:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
that is not normally the pace at which I
 
01:58:59.109 --> 01:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
speak uh I'm Norman silur uh I represent
 
01:59:02.109 --> 01:59:02.119 align:start position:0%
belnap District 2 which are the towns of
 
01:59:05.950 --> 01:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
Guilford and Meredith and I live in
 
01:59:08.910 --> 01:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
Guilford uh people who know me and my
 
01:59:11.950 --> 01:59:11.960 align:start position:0%
political philosophy know that I am
 
01:59:16.030 --> 01:59:16.040 align:start position:0%
generally opposed to increased
 
01:59:18.669 --> 01:59:18.679 align:start position:0%
regulation but a constituent brought to
 
01:59:20.189 --> 01:59:20.199 align:start position:0%
my attention
 
01:59:22.669 --> 01:59:22.679 align:start position:0%
a problem that is Tred to address in
 
01:59:26.830 --> 01:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
this bill and actions and activities
 
01:59:28.030 --> 01:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
that were so
 
01:59:31.149 --> 01:59:31.159 align:start position:0%
egregious that I felt I had no
 
01:59:34.470 --> 01:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
alternative but to propose this bill and
 
01:59:36.510 --> 01:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
I've been joined with a number of
 
01:59:39.470 --> 01:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors mostly reps from the
 
01:59:42.069 --> 01:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
Southshore of Lake Winn
 
01:59:46.750 --> 01:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
pasak this deals with a problem with
 
01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
cabling in Lake winnipauk
 
01:59:52.990 --> 01:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
but it's probably applicable to cabling
 
01:59:55.910 --> 01:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
that might happen in other lakes in New
 
01:59:58.550 --> 01:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the issue is
 
02:00:02.030 --> 02:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
this when you person someone lives on an
 
02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
island and they need electric service
 
02:00:07.470 --> 02:00:07.480 align:start position:0%
telephone service internet any kind of
 
02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:08.990 align:start position:0%
telephone service internet any kind of
telecommunication

02:00:08.990 --> 02:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
telecommunication
 
02:00:11.830 --> 02:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
service they obtain or they have a
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
company obtained for them a water
 
02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
crossing permit to allow the laying of a
 
02:00:19.629 --> 02:00:19.639 align:start position:0%
cable on the lake bottom from the
 
02:00:23.669 --> 02:00:23.679 align:start position:0%
mainland to the island or perhaps from
 
02:00:26.069 --> 02:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
an adjacent Island where they can tap in
 
02:00:29.109 --> 02:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
to their Island and that's fine they get
 
02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
a you know they get a permit and they do
 
02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
that the problems happen when a cable
 
02:00:41.470 --> 02:00:41.480 align:start position:0%
goes bad when they call for repairs and
 
02:00:43.870 --> 02:00:43.880 align:start position:0%
the cable whoever is servicing the
 
02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
cables comes out and determines that the
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
cable is
 
02:00:51.669 --> 02:00:51.679 align:start position:0%
defective rather than trying to pull up
 
02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
the cable and find where it's bad and
 
02:00:57.709 --> 02:00:57.719 align:start position:0%
repairing it the practice appears to be
 
02:01:01.069 --> 02:01:01.079 align:start position:0%
that they simply lay a new cable in its
 
02:01:04.069 --> 02:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
place and cut off both ends of the old
 
02:01:06.430 --> 02:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
cable and just let it leave right there
 
02:01:08.109 --> 02:01:08.119 align:start position:0%
on the bottom of the
 
02:01:12.030 --> 02:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
lake so these are abandoned cables and
 
02:01:15.030 --> 02:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
they the problems that they create are
 
02:01:18.669 --> 02:01:18.679 align:start position:0%
really in two major areas number one is
 
02:01:18.679 --> 02:01:19.589 align:start position:0%
really in two major areas number one is
cont

02:01:19.589 --> 02:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
cont
 
02:01:22.709 --> 02:01:22.719 align:start position:0%
ination because the cables in many
 
02:01:26.870 --> 02:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
instances contain substances that may or
 
02:01:29.750 --> 02:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
may not leech into the water supply
 
02:01:31.629 --> 02:01:31.639 align:start position:0%
there may be heavy metals there may be
 
02:01:33.390 --> 02:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
connectors that have heavy metals in
 
02:01:35.629 --> 02:01:35.639 align:start position:0%
them and things of that sort I'm told I
 
02:01:38.270 --> 02:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
am not an an expert a scientist in that
 
02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
regard the other aspect is the
 
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
interference with boating caused by
 
02:01:46.030 --> 02:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
these abandoned cables because what
 
02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:47.069 align:start position:0%
these abandoned cables because what
happens

02:01:47.069 --> 02:01:47.079 align:start position:0%
happens
 
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
is over the years
 
02:01:53.470 --> 02:01:53.480 align:start position:0%
cables are abandoned and it creates a
 
02:01:56.189 --> 02:01:56.199 align:start position:0%
spaghetti effect on the lake bottom of
 
02:01:59.189 --> 02:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
all these abandoned cables so when a
 
02:02:01.109 --> 02:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
boater and they're not marked of course
 
02:02:02.550 --> 02:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
there's no marking on the surface to
 
02:02:05.310 --> 02:02:05.320 align:start position:0%
show you where these are so when a
 
02:02:07.870 --> 02:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
boater goes to an area where there may
 
02:02:09.550 --> 02:02:09.560 align:start position:0%
be this spaghetti on the floor of the
 
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
lake and they try to Anchor they throw
 
02:02:16.510 --> 02:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
their anchor over and the anchor cannot
 
02:02:19.350 --> 02:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
bite into the lake Bottom because it
 
02:02:22.830 --> 02:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
gets Tangled Up in all of these this
 
02:02:26.149 --> 02:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
spaghetti now we step back for a moment
 
02:02:28.390 --> 02:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
and assume that you are doing some
 
02:02:31.149 --> 02:02:31.159 align:start position:0%
renovation in your home and you're
 
02:02:33.709 --> 02:02:33.719 align:start position:0%
replacing some wiring and you're taking
 
02:02:34.990 --> 02:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
out some
 
02:02:38.229 --> 02:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
cables and would anyone think it would
 
02:02:41.069 --> 02:02:41.079 align:start position:0%
be permissible Behavior to take the old
 
02:02:43.830 --> 02:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
cables and take them over to the lake
 
02:02:46.350 --> 02:02:46.360 align:start position:0%
and just dump them into the lake well
 
02:02:48.669 --> 02:02:48.679 align:start position:0%
that would be ridiculous that's you know
 
02:02:52.109 --> 02:02:52.119 align:start position:0%
the lake Lakes are not our dumps we rely
 
02:02:54.629 --> 02:02:54.639 align:start position:0%
on the lakes for recreation and in some
 
02:02:59.109 --> 02:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
instances for water and so this is just
 
02:03:02.669 --> 02:03:02.679 align:start position:0%
terrible behavior and what this B and I
 
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
talked to Dees about this and I said
 
02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
well can't you do something about this
 
02:03:09.910 --> 02:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
and they said well we give these water
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
crossing permits but we really don't
 
02:03:15.430 --> 02:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
have any enforcement mechanism for these
 
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
abandoned cables it requires new
 
02:03:21.790 --> 02:03:21.800 align:start position:0%
legislation voila now you have the
 
02:03:24.109 --> 02:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
proposed HB
 
02:03:28.669 --> 02:03:28.679 align:start position:0%
269 and what it says is essentially if
 
02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
anyone is abandoning a cable because
 
02:03:33.629 --> 02:03:33.639 align:start position:0%
they're replacing it or for any reason
 
02:03:35.149 --> 02:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
they got to take it out they're not
 
02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
going to just drop it on the lake bottom
 
02:03:40.990 --> 02:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
and if they don't there are Financial
 
02:03:44.270 --> 02:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
penalties involved so there's no
 
02:03:45.990 --> 02:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
Financial note there's no Financial
 
02:03:49.030 --> 02:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
impact on the government on the local
 
02:03:51.030 --> 02:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
government or the state government the
 
02:03:52.750 --> 02:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
only financial impact is on the
 
02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
companies that are doing this or the
 
02:03:56.310 --> 02:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps the homeowners that are doing
 
02:03:59.910 --> 02:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
this that are basically dumping stuff
 
02:04:02.430 --> 02:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
into our Lake Bottom so we're trying
 
02:04:04.229 --> 02:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
this is as I said brought to my
 
02:04:08.030 --> 02:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
attention by a constituent who is a
 
02:04:11.430 --> 02:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
major factor in the marine industries in
 
02:04:14.109 --> 02:04:14.119 align:start position:0%
the south shore of Lake winaki but uh
 
02:04:16.149 --> 02:04:16.159 align:start position:0%
you know this is not confined as I said
 
02:04:18.310 --> 02:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
to Simply Lake winaki although it's the
 
02:04:20.709 --> 02:04:20.719 align:start position:0%
biggest lake with the most islands and
 
02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
the most cabling involved and the most
 
02:04:25.870 --> 02:04:25.880 align:start position:0%
spaghetti on the lake bottom so we're
 
02:04:30.350 --> 02:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
not seeking to have anybody go back and
 
02:04:32.669 --> 02:04:32.679 align:start position:0%
you know do a big cleanup that's that's
 
02:04:34.669 --> 02:04:34.679 align:start position:0%
a great project for some volunteer
 
02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
organization all we're saying is going
 
02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
forward when you abandon a cable in the
 
02:04:42.310 --> 02:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
future because you're replacing it you
 
02:04:43.950 --> 02:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
got to take it out you don't just dump
 
02:04:46.270 --> 02:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
it on the lake bottom and that's
 
02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
basically it and I'll be happy to take
 
02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:51.549 align:start position:0%
basically it and I'll be happy to take
any

02:04:51.549 --> 02:04:51.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
questions any questions
 
02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
by have one up stand
 
02:05:01.910 --> 02:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
by uh representative Connor sir uh
 
02:05:04.390 --> 02:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
representative Connor for a
 
02:05:06.830 --> 02:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:05:08.709 --> 02:05:08.719 align:start position:0%
representative my question is justo
 
02:05:11.069 --> 02:05:11.079 align:start position:0%
simple when someone puts a cable in or
 
02:05:12.790 --> 02:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
has it put in is there any
 
02:05:14.709 --> 02:05:14.719 align:start position:0%
identification on it so would there be a
 
02:05:17.189 --> 02:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
way to know whose CA um abandoned cables
 
02:05:20.709 --> 02:05:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:23.069 --> 02:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
that is way above my pay grade but I
 
02:05:25.709 --> 02:05:25.719 align:start position:0%
simply don't know I I do not
 
02:05:29.589 --> 02:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
know I I would assume that well I I
 
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
can't I really can't assume I don't I
 
02:05:32.470 --> 02:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
don't the answer is I don't know I'm
 
02:05:34.709 --> 02:05:34.719 align:start position:0%
sorry okay thank
 
02:05:37.470 --> 02:05:37.480 align:start position:0%
you representative post sir
 
02:05:39.990 --> 02:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative post for a
 
02:05:42.589 --> 02:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:05:45.390 --> 02:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
you representative um I wondered where's
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
the enforcement on this I mean how are
 
02:05:49.589 --> 02:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
people going to be aware that uh
 
02:05:52.950 --> 02:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
homeowners um say they you know just
 
02:05:55.709 --> 02:05:55.719 align:start position:0%
move in and um they go to lay a cable
 
02:05:57.390 --> 02:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
how are they going to really know about
 
02:06:00.870 --> 02:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
this this bill and how is it going to be
 
02:06:03.830 --> 02:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
enforced I think the enforcement is
 
02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
through the companies that are licensed
 
02:06:10.830 --> 02:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
to do these installations and the one
 
02:06:12.830 --> 02:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
and and through the application process
 
02:06:15.069 --> 02:06:15.079 align:start position:0%
where they apply for water crossing
 
02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
permits from Dees they would then
 
02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
presumably get an information sheet that
 
02:06:22.510 --> 02:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
says hey if you abandon a cable you got
 
02:06:25.830 --> 02:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:28.549 --> 02:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
out thank
 
02:06:31.669 --> 02:06:31.679 align:start position:0%
you there any other representative Cohen
 
02:06:34.470 --> 02:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
sir representative Cohen for a
 
02:06:36.870 --> 02:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you for taking my
 
02:06:39.790 --> 02:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
question would you know are the typical
 
02:06:43.270 --> 02:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
cost of laying cable and how much more
 
02:06:45.669 --> 02:06:45.679 align:start position:0%
it adds to that cost of removing and
 
02:06:45.679 --> 02:06:47.589 align:start position:0%
it adds to that cost of removing and
abandoned

02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
abandoned
 
02:06:50.310 --> 02:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
cable I do not know that answer I don't
 
02:06:52.470 --> 02:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that question it's a
 
02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
good question it seems to me
 
02:06:58.310 --> 02:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
that I'm you know I'm not a I'm not a
 
02:07:01.709 --> 02:07:01.719 align:start position:0%
scientist and I'm not a cable person but
 
02:07:03.669 --> 02:07:03.679 align:start position:0%
when they lay a cable it looks like they
 
02:07:06.990 --> 02:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
start from the mainland and they have a
 
02:07:11.990 --> 02:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
boat or a a u uh you know some sort of
 
02:07:14.669 --> 02:07:14.679 align:start position:0%
uh floating apparatus that then rolls
 
02:07:18.149 --> 02:07:18.159 align:start position:0%
out the cable from the mainland to the
 
02:07:21.629 --> 02:07:21.639 align:start position:0%
um to the island and when they have the
 
02:07:23.350 --> 02:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
they at at the island end when they're
 
02:07:25.030 --> 02:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
doing their hookup and they're doing
 
02:07:26.950 --> 02:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
their cutting and they cut the cable to
 
02:07:29.350 --> 02:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
be abandoned they just grab it and
 
02:07:31.030 --> 02:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
should be able to just roll it back up
 
02:07:33.109 --> 02:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
as they move back to the mainland which
 
02:07:36.390 --> 02:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
seemed to me as a lay person to be a
 
02:07:38.390 --> 02:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
fairly simple process of course there's
 
02:07:40.229 --> 02:07:40.239 align:start position:0%
a cost involved at least the time
 
02:07:42.669 --> 02:07:42.679 align:start position:0%
involved by the Personnel to do
 
02:07:46.830 --> 02:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
it just uh just for the representative
 
02:07:49.069 --> 02:07:49.079 align:start position:0%
edif okay we do have
 
02:07:53.430 --> 02:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
someone who from the uh New England
 
02:07:56.430 --> 02:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
cable and Telecommunications Association
 
02:07:59.669 --> 02:07:59.679 align:start position:0%
following to testify in opposition to
 
02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
the bill so that that person may be able
 
02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:08.950 align:start position:0%
 
question

02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:12.629 --> 02:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:16.669 --> 02:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
other no one no other hands
 
02:08:19.350 --> 02:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
raiser I'm sorry represent Smith
 
02:08:22.870 --> 02:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:26.229 --> 02:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
question thank you uh this thank you for
 
02:08:29.390 --> 02:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative um
 
02:08:31.549 --> 02:08:31.559 align:start position:0%
this may not
 
02:08:34.510 --> 02:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
be under the purview of this bill but I
 
02:08:37.669 --> 02:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
have been hearing stories
 
02:08:41.709 --> 02:08:41.719 align:start position:0%
of something causing people to get
 
02:08:43.950 --> 02:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
shocks when they touch their dock when
 
02:08:47.030 --> 02:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
they're in the water so when you refer
 
02:08:50.030 --> 02:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
to these as un aband abandoned cables
 
02:08:52.510 --> 02:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
are they pretty much unhooked from
 
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
everything unplugged so that they
 
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be producing any electric
 
02:08:59.109 --> 02:08:59.119 align:start position:0%
current do you know that my
 
02:09:00.830 --> 02:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
understanding is that when they abandon
 
02:09:03.310 --> 02:09:03.320 align:start position:0%
a cable they cut it from both ends the
 
02:09:06.910 --> 02:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
mainland end and the island end so it
 
02:09:10.430 --> 02:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
would be unlikely that they would leave
 
02:09:14.350 --> 02:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
an energized cable they connected to in
 
02:09:16.870 --> 02:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
some way to give a shock on a dock but
 
02:09:19.149 --> 02:09:19.159 align:start position:0%
you know I guess any
 
02:09:22.470 --> 02:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
possible okay thank
 
02:09:24.770 --> 02:09:24.780 align:start position:0%

Mora Weston I appreciate the opportunity
 
02:10:54.229 --> 02:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
to be heard this morning I'm speaking to
 
02:10:56.069 --> 02:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
you today on behalf of the New England
 
02:10:59.629 --> 02:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
cable and Telecommunications Association
 
02:11:01.870 --> 02:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
our members include Atlantic Broadband
 
02:11:04.430 --> 02:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
Charter and Comcast which are some of
 
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's leading Broadband
 
02:11:08.830 --> 02:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
providers we collectively serve over
 
02:11:13.069 --> 02:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
450,000 customers in more than4
 
02:11:15.030 --> 02:11:15.040 align:start position:0%

02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:16.549 align:start position:0%
communities in New

02:11:16.549 --> 02:11:16.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
um not to supports measures to protect
 
02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
the natural world around us and
 
02:11:24.750 --> 02:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
certainly have a desire to conserve
 
02:11:26.750 --> 02:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
precious natural resources especially
 
02:11:29.709 --> 02:11:29.719 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire um to that end our
 
02:11:32.990 --> 02:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
members do take steps uh to conserve
 
02:11:36.430 --> 02:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
resources and um to support a green
 
02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
environment and we've done so with a lot
 
02:11:41.910 --> 02:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
of private sector and not for-profit
 
02:11:44.830 --> 02:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
initiatives however I am here to speak
 
02:11:48.830 --> 02:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
today in opposition to house build 26 9
 
02:11:52.390 --> 02:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
as written um and urge you to consider
 
02:11:55.030 --> 02:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
this inexpedient to late inexpedient to
 
02:11:57.030 --> 02:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
legislate for a few
 
02:11:59.390 --> 02:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
reasons um first and foremost it it
 
02:12:02.589 --> 02:12:02.599 align:start position:0%
seems overly Broad and a bit unclear and
 
02:12:02.599 --> 02:12:04.750 align:start position:0%
seems overly Broad and a bit unclear and
ambiguous

02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
ambiguous
 
02:12:10.430 --> 02:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
um for example um a cable may be
 
02:12:14.510 --> 02:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
inoperative for a wide variety of
 
02:12:17.310 --> 02:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
reasons uh of particular concern would
 
02:12:20.589 --> 02:12:20.599 align:start position:0%
be when a cas C is within its useful
 
02:12:23.669 --> 02:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
life but a NEC member is no longer
 
02:12:26.709 --> 02:12:26.719 align:start position:0%
providing a signal on that cable because
 
02:12:29.830 --> 02:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
the receiving sub subscriber doesn't
 
02:12:33.709 --> 02:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
currently wish to receive our memb
 
02:12:37.669 --> 02:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
services um uh think for example of an
 
02:12:40.629 --> 02:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
instance where one owns a home on an
 
02:12:44.189 --> 02:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
island they have cable television
 
02:12:45.910 --> 02:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
internet service they sell their home
 
02:12:48.030 --> 02:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
someone says no I don't want that
 
02:12:50.149 --> 02:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
service I'll take my service through
 
02:12:53.669 --> 02:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
satellite that cable is that cable
 
02:12:56.910 --> 02:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
considered abandoned um it could very
 
02:12:59.109 --> 02:12:59.119 align:start position:0%
well be the situation where the next
 
02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
homeowner or perhaps they decide that
 
02:13:02.510 --> 02:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
they' prefer to switch back from
 
02:13:06.830 --> 02:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
satellite to Cable um is that cable
 
02:13:10.030 --> 02:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
abandoned or not in a day in which
 
02:13:12.149 --> 02:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
Broadband access and internet access is
 
02:13:16.709 --> 02:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
so important to us all um it would be
 
02:13:19.549 --> 02:13:19.559 align:start position:0%
unfortunate for our members to incur
 
02:13:23.910 --> 02:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
tremendous cost to remove cable that
 
02:13:26.549 --> 02:13:26.559 align:start position:0%
still is within its useful life um when
 
02:13:29.229 --> 02:13:29.239 align:start position:0%
it could be used uh again for those
 
02:13:31.669 --> 02:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
valuable services at some point in the
 
02:13:34.830 --> 02:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
not too distant future so we raise sort
 
02:13:37.510 --> 02:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
of the the breadth and ambiguity of this
 
02:13:39.470 --> 02:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
for your
 
02:13:43.149 --> 02:13:43.159 align:start position:0%
consideration I am I'm afraid I cannot
 
02:13:45.709 --> 02:13:45.719 align:start position:0%
address the specific issue of cost in
 
02:13:47.390 --> 02:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
answer to the representative's question
 
02:13:49.390 --> 02:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
but I am happy to follow up with my
 
02:13:53.310 --> 02:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
clients to um address that issue for you
 
02:13:55.470 --> 02:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
and provide more
 
02:13:57.629 --> 02:13:57.639 align:start position:0%
information uh we also believe that
 
02:13:59.750 --> 02:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
there could be some unintended
 
02:14:02.109 --> 02:14:02.119 align:start position:0%
consequences in terms of environmental
 
02:14:03.950 --> 02:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
impacts and I understand the sponsor's
 
02:14:06.790 --> 02:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
goal but with some of these cables that
 
02:14:09.030 --> 02:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
have been there for quite some time
 
02:14:11.549 --> 02:14:11.559 align:start position:0%
Earth and debris have settled around it
 
02:14:15.910 --> 02:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
um you know it is it is uh sediment and
 
02:14:18.069 --> 02:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
debris have accumulated on or around
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
cabling unearthing that may have
 
02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences and actually
 
02:14:25.549 --> 02:14:25.559 align:start position:0%
frustrate the purpose of the
 
02:14:25.559 --> 02:14:27.310 align:start position:0%
frustrate the purpose of the
bill

02:14:27.310 --> 02:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:14:33.310 --> 02:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
lastly um the the um Provisions seem
 
02:14:37.149 --> 02:14:37.159 align:start position:0%
punitive overly punitive to us
 
02:14:40.229 --> 02:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
specifically for the reason that some of
 
02:14:44.350 --> 02:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
our members actually may not know if
 
02:14:47.430 --> 02:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
there are abandoned cables um on the
 
02:14:51.229 --> 02:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
lake floor this is the result of um
 
02:14:55.589 --> 02:14:55.599 align:start position:0%
decades worth of Acquisitions within our
 
02:14:58.950 --> 02:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
industry and um you know if somebody
 
02:15:01.510 --> 02:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
receives the permit well they may well
 
02:15:04.430 --> 02:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
know but there is also the the situation
 
02:15:06.950 --> 02:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
where you know through acquisition we
 
02:15:10.430 --> 02:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
may not know what is there and would
 
02:15:12.990 --> 02:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
think that um the provisions would be
 
02:15:15.790 --> 02:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
overly punitive in that case so with
 
02:15:17.390 --> 02:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
that I'll close my remarks we are
 
02:15:20.390 --> 02:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
willing to to work uh with the sponsor
 
02:15:22.549 --> 02:15:22.559 align:start position:0%
and the committee going forward and we
 
02:15:24.549 --> 02:15:24.559 align:start position:0%
really do appreciate your attention to
 
02:15:30.069 --> 02:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:30.079 --> 02:15:31.669 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:15:31.669 --> 02:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:15:34.390 --> 02:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
questions representative poster
 
02:15:36.910 --> 02:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
representative post for
 
02:15:39.870 --> 02:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um I have a
 
02:15:45.109 --> 02:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
question um a two-part question one is
 
02:15:45.119 --> 02:15:46.790 align:start position:0%
question um a two-part question one is
um

02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:48.470 align:start position:0%
um
uh

02:15:48.470 --> 02:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:15:48.480 --> 02:15:50.149 align:start position:0%
uh
tomorrow

02:15:50.149 --> 02:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
02:15:53.350 --> 02:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh do you have any instances where you
 
02:15:57.750 --> 02:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
already go in there and take out uh old
 
02:16:01.229 --> 02:16:01.239 align:start position:0%
cables I am not aware to tell you the
 
02:16:03.950 --> 02:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
truth in my conversations with our
 
02:16:08.790 --> 02:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
clients um we have one member who serves
 
02:16:12.030 --> 02:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
one small island in Lake
 
02:16:15.510 --> 02:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
winaki um so I I don't know the answer
 
02:16:18.149 --> 02:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
to your question but in term terms of
 
02:16:21.069 --> 02:16:21.079 align:start position:0%
the the breadth of application of this
 
02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
it is um I'm not going to say it's a
 
02:16:25.149 --> 02:16:25.159 align:start position:0%
small impact but I'm going to say it's
 
02:16:27.549 --> 02:16:27.559 align:start position:0%
limited circumstances in terms of our
 
02:16:29.910 --> 02:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
membership but I'm happy to ask that
 
02:16:33.030 --> 02:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
question of that uh particular member as
 
02:16:35.910 --> 02:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
to if they've ever removed um an
 
02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:37.549 align:start position:0%
to if they've ever removed um an
underwater

02:16:37.549 --> 02:16:37.559 align:start position:0%
underwater
 
02:16:40.469 --> 02:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
cable Mr chair may I do a
 
02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
followup follow yes so my other question
 
02:16:48.150 --> 02:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
to that is um would pulling these cables
 
02:16:52.270 --> 02:16:52.280 align:start position:0%
um have to be coordinated with um fish
 
02:16:54.709 --> 02:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
spawning schedules and things like that
 
02:16:56.429 --> 02:16:56.439 align:start position:0%
because if you pull that out it's going
 
02:16:59.990 --> 02:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
to disrupt the the floor
 
02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
um it's our it's our belief that that
 
02:17:06.309 --> 02:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
really is part of the unintended
 
02:17:10.349 --> 02:17:10.359 align:start position:0%
consequences of the bill um there could
 
02:17:13.549 --> 02:17:13.559 align:start position:0%
be tremendous environmental impact by
 
02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
actually digging these up and and
 
02:17:18.549 --> 02:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
removing them I can imagine
 
02:17:20.110 --> 02:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
that would have to be done in
 
02:17:22.429 --> 02:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
coordination you know with the with the
 
02:17:24.750 --> 02:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
state um I don't know the specifics of
 
02:17:27.190 --> 02:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
the laws around removal but we are
 
02:17:30.629 --> 02:17:30.639 align:start position:0%
concerned about those unintended
 
02:17:34.509 --> 02:17:34.519 align:start position:0%
consequences thank you thank you
 
02:17:36.990 --> 02:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly sir representative
 
02:17:38.750 --> 02:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
Kelly for a
 
02:17:40.910 --> 02:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:17:42.950 --> 02:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
M Weston for being here today um so I
 
02:17:44.990 --> 02:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
just have some questions about uh the
 
02:17:47.589 --> 02:17:47.599 align:start position:0%
logistics of this when a member uh on an
 
02:17:50.750 --> 02:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
Island wants to add a service from one
 
02:17:53.389 --> 02:17:53.399 align:start position:0%
of your members do they uh is that
 
02:17:55.309 --> 02:17:55.319 align:start position:0%
installation cost passed along directly
 
02:18:00.150 --> 02:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
to that homeowner or is it um does is it
 
02:18:03.190 --> 02:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:06.429 --> 02:18:06.439 align:start position:0%
member um let me see if I can answer
 
02:18:07.990 --> 02:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
your question this way and you can tell
 
02:18:10.429 --> 02:18:10.439 align:start position:0%
me if I need to follow up with more
 
02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
specifics um generally speaking when our
 
02:18:17.629 --> 02:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
members build out an area to provide
 
02:18:20.270 --> 02:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
cable television and Internet service
 
02:18:22.669 --> 02:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
it's a decision that our member company
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
has made that they want to invest in
 
02:18:28.589 --> 02:18:28.599 align:start position:0%
that area and they bear the cost of that
 
02:18:31.429 --> 02:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
and um it's a business
 
02:18:36.709 --> 02:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
decision if there is an instance however
 
02:18:40.389 --> 02:18:40.399 align:start position:0%
where we've only Built out to a certain
 
02:18:44.910 --> 02:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
point but then an individual say lives
 
02:18:48.150 --> 02:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
you know two and a half miles out out on
 
02:18:52.509 --> 02:18:52.519 align:start position:0%
a point say and this our service our
 
02:18:55.469 --> 02:18:55.479 align:start position:0%
buildout hasn't reached them then the
 
02:18:57.830 --> 02:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
cost could be borne by that person who's
 
02:19:00.110 --> 02:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
out on that two and a half mile you know
 
02:19:02.910 --> 02:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
long road or could be an investment that
 
02:19:05.150 --> 02:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
we choose to split with that individual
 
02:19:07.150 --> 02:19:07.160 align:start position:0%
but I think in terms of the island that
 
02:19:10.509 --> 02:19:10.519 align:start position:0%
I know we have built out I believe that
 
02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:17.190 --> 02:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
company does that help answer your
 
02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:18.230 align:start position:0%
company does that help answer your
question

02:19:18.230 --> 02:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:19:20.230 --> 02:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely um Mr chairman just a quick
 
02:19:23.589 --> 02:19:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:25.790 --> 02:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
could um
 
02:19:28.270 --> 02:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
so miss Wesson so my next question would
 
02:19:29.990 --> 02:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
be do you does your do your members
 
02:19:32.629 --> 02:19:32.639 align:start position:0%
charge customers for fees associated
 
02:19:34.190 --> 02:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
with the cancellation of service
 
02:19:35.990 --> 02:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
currently do they like if a member
 
02:19:38.030 --> 02:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
cancels service do they have to incur
 
02:19:40.030 --> 02:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
certain fees associated with closing
 
02:19:46.429 --> 02:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:46.439 --> 02:19:48.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:50.230 --> 02:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
that answer your question yeah thank you
 
02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
Miss Weston thank
 
02:19:55.230 --> 02:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
you anyone else for a
 
02:19:58.349 --> 02:19:58.359 align:start position:0%
question uh representative Mayville sir
 
02:20:01.110 --> 02:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
representative Mayville for a question
 
02:20:02.910 --> 02:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to ask the
 
02:20:06.389 --> 02:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
question um so I'm you're alluding to
 
02:20:08.790 --> 02:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
something that I want to clear up do
 
02:20:10.910 --> 02:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
your member electric companies do your
 
02:20:13.870 --> 02:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
member telecommunication companies each
 
02:20:17.590 --> 02:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
use a different type or a kind of cable
 
02:20:20.190 --> 02:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
for their particular company so that if
 
02:20:23.349 --> 02:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps a resident went from Verizon to
 
02:20:25.630 --> 02:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
Comcast and then back to Verizon that
 
02:20:27.910 --> 02:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
they would need two separate cables to
 
02:20:31.550 --> 02:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
use Verizon versus Comcast because that
 
02:20:32.790 --> 02:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
to me seems like that would be
 
02:20:34.830 --> 02:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
inhibiting competition if that is indeed
 
02:20:37.469 --> 02:20:37.479 align:start position:0%
the case and that it could you know we
 
02:20:38.389 --> 02:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
be talking about something a little
 
02:20:38.399 --> 02:20:39.190 align:start position:0%
be talking about something a little
different

02:20:39.190 --> 02:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
here sure I'm happy to try to respond to
 
02:20:45.910 --> 02:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
that so our member companies are cable
 
02:20:49.510 --> 02:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
companies that provide video and
 
02:20:52.910 --> 02:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
internet services um home security
 
02:20:56.990 --> 02:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
systems over those Fiber Optic
 
02:21:00.389 --> 02:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
Cables um it that is a different
 
02:21:04.910 --> 02:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure than say uh an electrical
 
02:21:07.790 --> 02:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
provider I could not speak to their
 
02:21:11.510 --> 02:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure or even um you know I
 
02:21:13.630 --> 02:21:13.640 align:start position:0%
don't Consolidated Communications for
 
02:21:16.030 --> 02:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
example which may or may not provide a
 
02:21:18.830 --> 02:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
landline service to to the particular
 
02:21:20.950 --> 02:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
islands that I'm referencing I I don't
 
02:21:24.030 --> 02:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
know who the other providers are as per
 
02:21:27.630 --> 02:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
Verizon um they are a wireless provider
 
02:21:29.590 --> 02:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
and so that is an entirely different
 
02:21:33.710 --> 02:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
type of um infrastructure you know
 
02:21:36.550 --> 02:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
Wireless Towers um cellular access I
 
02:21:39.389 --> 02:21:39.399 align:start position:0%
mean I don't so to to answer your
 
02:21:41.990 --> 02:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
question I mean I'm just speaking to my
 
02:21:44.590 --> 02:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
client uh position and the
 
02:21:48.710 --> 02:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that they deploy and
 
02:21:52.910 --> 02:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
um we we have our own cables and our own
 
02:21:55.870 --> 02:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and it is not shared
 
02:21:58.469 --> 02:21:58.479 align:start position:0%
among a variety of providers for example
 
02:22:00.510 --> 02:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
you can't provide electricity and
 
02:22:02.670 --> 02:22:02.680 align:start position:0%
wireless Services over that fiber optic
 
02:22:06.710 --> 02:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
cable that we would deploy does that
 
02:22:09.230 --> 02:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
help um yeah but Verizon does have fiber
 
02:22:10.590 --> 02:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
optic cables and they do provide
 
02:22:12.870 --> 02:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
Broadband services to you know maybe
 
02:22:14.990 --> 02:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
different states here yes they do they
 
02:22:17.550 --> 02:22:17.560 align:start position:0%
do in they do in many states uh I'm not
 
02:22:19.270 --> 02:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
aware of what services they provide on
 
02:22:22.870 --> 02:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
the islands in winaki thank you
 
02:22:26.990 --> 02:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:30.950 --> 02:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
questions so there are no no hands
 
02:22:34.030 --> 02:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
raised being no more questions thank you
 
02:22:37.070 --> 02:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
very much for your for your testimony
 
02:22:38.990 --> 02:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the
 
02:22:41.070 --> 02:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity is there
 
02:22:46.150 --> 02:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
anyone else in the audience wishes to
 
02:22:46.160 --> 02:22:47.870 align:start position:0%
anyone else in the audience wishes to
testify

02:22:47.870 --> 02:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
testify
 
02:22:57.030 --> 02:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:02.230 --> 02:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:05.070 --> 02:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
statement I'm rather
 
02:23:07.389 --> 02:23:07.399 align:start position:0%
concerned somewhat
 
02:23:11.870 --> 02:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
deted Mr chair yes I see Captain dun
 
02:23:14.510 --> 02:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
Le's in the a in the audience I don't

know it's the closest thing that I don't
see

02:23:25.150 --> 02:23:25.160 align:start position:0%

uh honorable members of the committee I
am

02:24:03.469 --> 02:24:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:05.710 --> 02:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
Tim how about
 
02:24:08.349 --> 02:24:08.359 align:start position:0%
now you're back thank you Mr chair
 
02:24:09.590 --> 02:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee my
 
02:24:11.750 --> 02:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
name is Tim Dunley and I am the captain
 
02:24:14.469 --> 02:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
of the State Police Marine Patrol unit
 
02:24:17.389 --> 02:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
um I uh I thought I had registered in
 
02:24:18.990 --> 02:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill this morning but
 
02:24:20.830 --> 02:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
I did lose internet connection myself
 
02:24:22.429 --> 02:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
and and therefore it may not have
 
02:24:24.389 --> 02:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
registered I'll briefly just speak to
 
02:24:27.230 --> 02:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
our concerns uh and that is specifically
 
02:24:29.269 --> 02:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
to the Penalty section of this proposed
 
02:24:31.550 --> 02:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
Bill where it is the division of State
 
02:24:33.190 --> 02:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
Police or local law enforcement who
 
02:24:34.790 --> 02:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
would assess the
 
02:24:38.190 --> 02:24:38.200 align:start position:0%
fines um from from that perspective we
 
02:24:41.510 --> 02:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
have concern as we are not familiar with
 
02:24:44.870 --> 02:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
those um utilities that may have
 
02:24:47.070 --> 02:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
received permits from other uh state
 
02:24:50.150 --> 02:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
agencies and therefore who we would hold
 
02:24:53.230 --> 02:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
responsible for us may be very difficult
 
02:24:55.230 --> 02:24:55.240 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is is many of our
 
02:24:57.790 --> 02:24:57.800 align:start position:0%
Islands when using Lake wiip pasak as an
 
02:25:00.870 --> 02:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
example run one trunk line to the island
 
02:25:02.389 --> 02:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
itself particularly if there's more than
 
02:25:04.790 --> 02:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
one residents on the island and then
 
02:25:07.510 --> 02:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
there are typical utility polls down the
 
02:25:09.309 --> 02:25:09.319 align:start position:0%
center of the island where where
 
02:25:11.269 --> 02:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
person's Camp May then be fed uh
 
02:25:13.269 --> 02:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
whatever service may exist on that
 
02:25:15.469 --> 02:25:15.479 align:start position:0%
island so to whom we would hold
 
02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
responsible other than the utility
 
02:25:21.150 --> 02:25:21.160 align:start position:0%
itself um we we would struggle from an
 
02:25:24.110 --> 02:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement perspective furthermore we
 
02:25:26.550 --> 02:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
would not have any knowledge not not
 
02:25:29.510 --> 02:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
having known who has received these
 
02:25:32.269 --> 02:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
permits typically our contact with any
 
02:25:34.990 --> 02:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
cabling uh is what uh representative
 
02:25:37.750 --> 02:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
Silber mentioned uh I can think on a
 
02:25:39.830 --> 02:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
very rare occasion maybe one every
 
02:25:41.429 --> 02:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
couple of years where we'll get a call
 
02:25:43.630 --> 02:25:43.640 align:start position:0%
for boat who has hooked its anchor on
 
02:25:45.950 --> 02:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
one of these cables uh we have no
 
02:25:48.469 --> 02:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
knowledge of what kind of cable it is uh
 
02:25:50.790 --> 02:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
we have no knowledge of of whether it's
 
02:25:55.469 --> 02:25:55.479 align:start position:0%
live or or not and so uh just from an
 
02:25:58.150 --> 02:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
ignorance as an agency with cabling and
 
02:26:00.389 --> 02:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing uh I would suggest
 
02:26:03.550 --> 02:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh an administrative enforcement
 
02:26:06.349 --> 02:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
of this statute uh should it be passed
 
02:26:08.870 --> 02:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
be considered uh from a criminal
 
02:26:10.950 --> 02:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
perspective uh it would be very
 
02:26:13.110 --> 02:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
difficult for our agency to enforce and
 
02:26:15.309 --> 02:26:15.319 align:start position:0%
and I would suspect any local law
 
02:26:17.429 --> 02:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency other than perhaps a
 
02:26:18.990 --> 02:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
code enforcement
 
02:26:21.710 --> 02:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
officer so uh I'm happy to answer any
 
02:26:23.429 --> 02:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
questions uh provide you with any
 
02:26:25.710 --> 02:26:25.720 align:start position:0%
information that I may know offhand
 
02:26:28.510 --> 02:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
regarding cabling on the lake uh and
 
02:26:31.550 --> 02:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
make myself available to
 
02:26:34.469 --> 02:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
those represent post has a question sir
 
02:26:37.070 --> 02:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative post for
 
02:26:40.910 --> 02:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and um uh
 
02:26:44.670 --> 02:26:44.680 align:start position:0%
Captain duny Could you um speak to um
 
02:26:46.550 --> 02:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
the freshwater habitat if you're pulling
 
02:26:48.990 --> 02:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
the these
 
02:26:51.750 --> 02:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
cables I I will do my best only as a as
 
02:26:53.870 --> 02:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
a sportsman representative uh I do know
 
02:26:56.070 --> 02:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
that in the springtime certainly the
 
02:26:58.630 --> 02:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
nesting of of particular bass species
 
02:27:01.710 --> 02:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
and so forth is a critical time uh for
 
02:27:04.110 --> 02:27:04.120 align:start position:0%
their nesting uh fishing game would be
 
02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
the agency and a biologist would be the
 
02:27:07.710 --> 02:27:07.720 align:start position:0%
agency to get that very accurate
 
02:27:10.269 --> 02:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
information but but I know that we see
 
02:27:13.469 --> 02:27:13.479 align:start position:0%
Seasons um for fishing uh around those
 
02:27:15.710 --> 02:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
nesting times and it is typically in the
 
02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:21.230 --> 02:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
02:27:24.910 --> 02:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
much any other questions by by the
 
02:27:27.349 --> 02:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
committee so representative Kelly
 
02:27:30.030 --> 02:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly for
 
02:27:32.070 --> 02:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:27:34.389 --> 02:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
you Captain Dunley being here today um
 
02:27:37.349 --> 02:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
just a question I've seen the number 274
 
02:27:39.150 --> 02:27:39.160 align:start position:0%
habitable Islands on wab basaki do we
 
02:27:41.469 --> 02:27:41.479 align:start position:0%
have any idea how many residences on
 
02:27:43.429 --> 02:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
those islands or how many actual
 
02:27:45.190 --> 02:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
residents live out
 
02:27:48.630 --> 02:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
there we do not have that number um but
 
02:27:52.710 --> 02:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
I will tell you that it is um you know
 
02:27:55.429 --> 02:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
probably in the low thousands uh we have
 
02:27:57.630 --> 02:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
several big islands that have several
 
02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
hundred residents on them and and
 
02:28:01.230 --> 02:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
there's an example of where the the
 
02:28:03.670 --> 02:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
whole island is serviced likely by one
 
02:28:06.309 --> 02:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
trunk line um to serve all those
 
02:28:08.349 --> 02:28:08.359 align:start position:0%
residents there are numerous islands
 
02:28:09.790 --> 02:28:09.800 align:start position:0%
where there's just one individual
 
02:28:12.110 --> 02:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
resident on there uh and certainly with
 
02:28:14.389 --> 02:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
the advancement of of Technology cell
 
02:28:16.990 --> 02:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
phone and and satellite uh perhaps a lot
 
02:28:18.910 --> 02:28:18.920 align:start position:0%
of those cables are now obsolete if they
 
02:28:21.309 --> 02:28:21.319 align:start position:0%
ever were installed uh a lot of these
 
02:28:24.830 --> 02:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
islands preserved the The Rustic nature
 
02:28:26.429 --> 02:28:26.439 align:start position:0%
and and so several of those islands
 
02:28:28.309 --> 02:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
never received those services to begin
 
02:28:33.150 --> 02:28:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:35.950 --> 02:28:35.960 align:start position:0%

02:31:38.830 --> 02:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
up uh which I'm trying to
 
02:31:42.670 --> 02:31:42.680 align:start position:0%
find uh which on
 
02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
line two of the
 
02:31:45.359 --> 02:31:46.910 align:start position:0%
line two of the
bill

02:31:46.910 --> 02:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:31:52.150 --> 02:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:55.190 --> 02:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
the bill reads no person shall
 
02:31:58.389 --> 02:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
negligently cut fell destroy injure
 
02:32:01.950 --> 02:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
carry away or cause to be cut fell
 
02:32:04.630 --> 02:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
destroyed injured or carried away and
 
02:32:06.790 --> 02:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
then in the second section uh the
 
02:32:10.710 --> 02:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
criminal penalty the same or is
 
02:32:14.309 --> 02:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
removed uh so that it does not confuse
 
02:32:19.510 --> 02:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:21.469 --> 02:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
uh actually I should probably let
 
02:32:23.870 --> 02:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
representative harb answer you know
 
02:32:25.510 --> 02:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
describe that because he was the one who
 
02:32:29.349 --> 02:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
was concerned that this was confusing um
 
02:32:32.750 --> 02:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
but anyway basically one ore was removed
 
02:32:37.030 --> 02:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
from the bill or two ores uh but in the
 
02:32:39.190 --> 02:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
same place in two different sections of
 
02:32:41.910 --> 02:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
the bill if that makes sense and so I
 
02:32:43.309 --> 02:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
would move
 
02:32:45.190 --> 02:32:45.200 align:start position:0%

02:37:06.030 --> 02:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
representative maville I'm sorry I had a
 
02:37:08.389 --> 02:37:08.399 align:start position:0%
comment I was keeping notes our last
 
02:37:11.630 --> 02:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
session and um perhaps I erroneously
 
02:37:14.190 --> 02:37:14.200 align:start position:0%
recollected or wrote the wrong thing but
 
02:37:16.389 --> 02:37:16.399 align:start position:0%
um regarding representativ harbs um
 
02:37:18.910 --> 02:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
addendums I believe he had said and this
 
02:37:21.150 --> 02:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
may be just word smithing that he had
 
02:37:24.990 --> 02:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
said to add the word negligently after
 
02:37:27.990 --> 02:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
or you know or before caused to be cut
 
02:37:29.309 --> 02:37:29.319 align:start position:0%
so that it was no person sell
 
02:37:31.950 --> 02:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
negligently cut blah blah blah or
 
02:37:34.030 --> 02:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
negligently caused to be cut and the
 
02:37:35.990 --> 02:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
same with the second that no person so
 
02:37:40.110 --> 02:37:40.120 align:start position:0%
recklessly cut LA or recklessly caused
 
02:37:41.870 --> 02:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
to be cut that that's what I had in my
 
02:37:44.790 --> 02:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
notes and perhaps I am not recollecting
 
02:37:44.800 --> 02:37:46.870 align:start position:0%
notes and perhaps I am not recollecting
correctly

02:37:46.870 --> 02:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
02:37:48.790 --> 02:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
representative harb could you answer
 
02:37:51.190 --> 02:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
that yes I can thank you if the chair
 
02:37:54.070 --> 02:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
would let me speak
 
02:37:57.950 --> 02:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you m Mr chair thank you um I
 
02:37:59.750 --> 02:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
had I had made that comment
 
02:38:01.870 --> 02:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
representative but that was if you
 
02:38:04.630 --> 02:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
didn't delete the or I am perfectly
 
02:38:06.510 --> 02:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the amendment and I
 
02:38:08.349 --> 02:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
thank representative Smith for bringing
 
02:38:10.870 --> 02:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
it Forward by deleting the or in
 
02:38:14.389 --> 02:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
paragraph one and subparagraph 21 and 1
 
02:38:17.309 --> 02:38:17.319 align:start position:0%
one um it then connects together with
 
02:38:19.590 --> 02:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
the negligently that appears in like the
 
02:38:22.670 --> 02:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
fourth word in each of the sentences so
 
02:38:25.269 --> 02:38:25.279 align:start position:0%
I am fine with it now as an attorney I
 
02:38:28.389 --> 02:38:28.399 align:start position:0%
have no difficulty in ascertaining that
 
02:38:31.429 --> 02:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
negligent applies to the whole Clause
 
02:38:33.870 --> 02:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
not just the first
 
02:38:38.870 --> 02:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:44.710 --> 02:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
yeah oh yeah any other questions on the
 
02:38:47.990 --> 02:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
amendment there are no questions no
 
02:38:49.469 --> 02:38:49.479 align:start position:0%

02:45:00.910 --> 02:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
to talk about House Bill
 
02:45:06.110 --> 02:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
99 thank you Mr chair um House Bill 99
 
02:45:08.510 --> 02:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh as you recall from the public
 
02:45:08.520 --> 02:45:10.870 align:start position:0%
uh as you recall from the public
hearing

02:45:10.870 --> 02:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh was the exact same bill that was
 
02:45:18.710 --> 02:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
introduced last year and in committee
 
02:45:21.950 --> 02:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
last year we determined that it needed
 
02:45:21.960 --> 02:45:23.110 align:start position:0%
last year we determined that it needed
some

02:45:23.110 --> 02:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:45:25.590 --> 02:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
amendments because
 
02:45:29.389 --> 02:45:29.399 align:start position:0%
it and so this amendment is pretty much
 
02:45:32.190 --> 02:45:32.200 align:start position:0%
a rewrite of the bill as it was passed
 
02:45:34.269 --> 02:45:34.279 align:start position:0%
out of resources and passed on the
 
02:45:37.830 --> 02:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
consent calendar of the house in 2020
 
02:45:41.830 --> 02:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
and the differences are that there is an
 
02:45:46.269 --> 02:45:46.279 align:start position:0%
exemption on this on the uh bottom of
 
02:45:48.230 --> 02:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
page one of the
 
02:45:51.269 --> 02:45:51.279 align:start position:0%
amendment uh that uh Captain Dunley
 
02:45:54.790 --> 02:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
spoke to us about about giving a an
 
02:45:58.309 --> 02:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
exemption to any local state or federal
 
02:46:01.309 --> 02:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
government agency or agency subra
 
02:46:04.349 --> 02:46:04.359 align:start position:0%
contractors that need to be doing um
 
02:46:06.550 --> 02:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
non-recreational execution of their
 
02:46:08.910 --> 02:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
duties such as work related to law
 
02:46:11.230 --> 02:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement bridge and road work
 
02:46:13.630 --> 02:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
Pollution Control the protection of Fish
 
02:46:16.830 --> 02:46:16.840 align:start position:0%
and Wildlife or environment studies so
 
02:46:19.750 --> 02:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
that was inserted in the bill and the
 
02:46:23.550 --> 02:46:23.560 align:start position:0%
other thing was it the original Bill
 
02:46:28.550 --> 02:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:31.590 --> 02:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
um let me find it
 
02:46:35.110 --> 02:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:38.790 --> 02:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
included any land that you could see and
 
02:46:41.349 --> 02:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
you know any land owner that could see
 
02:46:44.630 --> 02:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
the uh seasonal float could complain
 
02:46:48.590 --> 02:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
about it and I'm that's not really clear
 
02:46:51.150 --> 02:46:51.160 align:start position:0%
but that was kind of it so this means
 
02:46:53.590 --> 02:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
this bill pretty much now as amended
 
02:46:56.349 --> 02:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
says you cannot put a seasonal platform
 
02:46:59.349 --> 02:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
except in front of your
 
02:47:08.150 --> 02:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:10.590 --> 02:47:10.600 align:start position:0%
problem does that make
 
02:47:13.910 --> 02:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
sense anyone
 
02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:22.750 align:start position:0%
sense anyone
have

02:47:22.750 --> 02:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:26.349 --> 02:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
any uh any questions basically as I
 
02:47:29.510 --> 02:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
understand it your basically this
 
02:47:32.070 --> 02:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
amendment just
 
02:47:37.070 --> 02:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
makes the the bill the house bill
 
02:47:39.309 --> 02:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
99 uh makes
 
02:47:43.870 --> 02:47:43.880 align:start position:0%
it uh as it was passed by this committee
 
02:47:48.389 --> 02:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:51.269 --> 02:47:51.279 align:start position:0%
basically right is that correct
 
02:47:53.790 --> 02:47:53.800 align:start position:0%
representative yes and Mr chair I just
 
02:47:56.990 --> 02:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
found the uh wording in the bill as it
 
02:48:00.269 --> 02:48:00.279 align:start position:0%
was introduced to us last week uh at the
 
02:48:02.870 --> 02:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
bottom of page one of the original bill
 
02:48:05.670 --> 02:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 99 not the amendment it
 
02:48:08.070 --> 02:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
says any person installing an anchored
 
02:48:10.309 --> 02:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
seasonal platform shall demonstrate to
 
02:48:12.590 --> 02:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
the satisfaction of the director that
 
02:48:14.510 --> 02:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
the placement of such anchored seasonal
 
02:48:17.710 --> 02:48:17.720 align:start position:0%
plat form does not obstruct any
 
02:48:20.070 --> 02:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
shorefront properties's view of the body
 
02:48:22.510 --> 02:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
of water in which the anchored season
 
02:48:23.990 --> 02:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
platform is to be
 
02:48:27.309 --> 02:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
installed and so that was deleted out of
 
02:48:29.870 --> 02:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment because of the testimony
 
02:48:33.110 --> 02:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
we heard that if I had a seasonal
 
02:48:35.110 --> 02:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
platform that was one of those big ones
 
02:48:36.830 --> 02:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
with the slide someone could see it a
 
02:48:39.190 --> 02:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
half a mile away from their property and
 
02:48:41.349 --> 02:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
complained that they could see it and
 
02:48:43.870 --> 02:48:43.880 align:start position:0%
therefore it shouldn't be allowed so
 
02:48:46.309 --> 02:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
basically since water is in the public
 
02:48:48.269 --> 02:48:48.279 align:start position:0%
trust it was only it had to be put in
 
02:48:51.230 --> 02:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
front of your property and you couldn't
 
02:48:54.349 --> 02:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
uh complain if it was property Three
 
02:48:54.359 --> 02:48:58.300 align:start position:0%
uh complain if it was property Three

02:48:58.300 --> 02:48:58.310 align:start position:0%

03:59:50.590 --> 03:59:50.600 align:start position:0%
EPA perorin chemicals is a term that
 
03:59:52.830 --> 03:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
some scientists use to refer to the
 
03:59:55.030 --> 03:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
group of toxic chemicals that include
 
03:59:58.670 --> 03:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
pfoa and pfos and other per and
 
04:00:01.269 --> 04:00:01.279 align:start position:0%
polyfloral alkal substances
 
04:00:03.149 --> 04:00:03.159 align:start position:0%
organizations that have used the
 
04:00:06.870 --> 04:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
abbreviation pfcs referring to perorin
 
04:00:09.950 --> 04:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
chemicals include EP a US Centers for
 
04:00:12.349 --> 04:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
Disease Control and prevention and the
 
04:00:15.269 --> 04:00:15.279 align:start position:0%
UN Organization for economic cooperation
 
04:00:19.389 --> 04:00:19.399 align:start position:0%
and development EPA is now trying to use
 
04:00:22.950 --> 04:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
perr and polyfloral alkal substances
 
04:00:28.229 --> 04:00:28.239 align:start position:0%
pfas rather than perorin chemicals pfcs
 
04:00:31.030 --> 04:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
consistently to collectively describe
 
04:00:35.269 --> 04:00:35.279 align:start position:0%
pfoa pfos and other chemicals in this
 
04:00:38.590 --> 04:00:38.600 align:start position:0%
group so additionally on on the bill on
 
04:00:42.510 --> 04:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
page two line three language is removed
 
04:00:45.590 --> 04:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
that limits the definition of pasas to
 
04:00:50.070 --> 04:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
the 18 compounds listed in epa's method
 
04:00:54.349 --> 04:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
537 over 5,000 now exist and new pasas
 
04:00:57.349 --> 04:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
are invented constantly their definition
 
04:00:59.830 --> 04:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
should be based on the general molecular
 
04:01:02.710 --> 04:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
structure not which ones were used in an
 
04:01:05.189 --> 04:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
analytical method which could very well
 
04:01:07.309 --> 04:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
become obsolete with technological
 
04:01:07.319 --> 04:01:09.469 align:start position:0%
become obsolete with technological
advancements

04:01:09.469 --> 04:01:09.479 align:start position:0%
advancements
 
04:01:13.309 --> 04:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
but any PFC the hazard and the safety is
 
04:01:16.389 --> 04:01:16.399 align:start position:0%
determined by scientific studies that
 
04:01:19.590 --> 04:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
follow accepted uh procedures so you'll
 
04:01:22.550 --> 04:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
see in the bill in section six it's
 
04:01:26.030 --> 04:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
outlined what past may be qualified for
 
04:01:28.750 --> 04:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
regulation but just referring to them as
 
04:01:31.429 --> 04:01:31.439 align:start position:0%
past does not indicate any Hazard that
 
04:01:33.870 --> 04:01:33.880 align:start position:0%
has to be determined um through
 
04:01:36.030 --> 04:01:36.040 align:start position:0%
generally accepted scientifical
 
04:01:39.070 --> 04:01:39.080 align:start position:0%
scientific principles applied to study
 
04:01:40.550 --> 04:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
um I want to thank you very much for
 
04:01:42.229 --> 04:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
your attention I would be happy to take
 
04:01:44.630 --> 04:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
any of your
 
04:01:48.870 --> 04:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
questions is there any questions
 
04:01:48.880 --> 04:01:51.389 align:start position:0%
questions is there any questions
by

04:01:51.389 --> 04:01:51.399 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:01:57.550 --> 04:01:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:00.070 --> 04:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
committee questions by members of the
 
04:02:04.110 --> 04:02:04.120 align:start position:0%
committee behind the screen I see no
 
04:02:09.269 --> 04:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
questions uh I do have
 
04:02:12.349 --> 04:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
one question
 
04:02:15.469 --> 04:02:15.479 align:start position:0%
myself looking
 
04:02:15.479 --> 04:02:17.149 align:start position:0%
myself looking
at

04:02:17.149 --> 04:02:17.159 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:02:17.159 --> 04:02:20.790 align:start position:0%

as

04:02:23.429 --> 04:02:23.439 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:02:27.550 --> 04:02:27.560 align:start position:0%

versus 1537 which is its predecessor
Bill

04:02:29.510 --> 04:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:02:34.550 --> 04:02:34.560 align:start position:0%

several uh you have one two you have
 
04:02:41.830 --> 04:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
four for
 
04:02:45.550 --> 04:02:45.560 align:start position:0%
carbon mention and those are not
 
04:02:48.389 --> 04:02:48.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the
 
04:02:52.750 --> 04:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
uh in the the the prior
 
04:02:52.760 --> 04:02:55.070 align:start position:0%
uh in the the the prior
bill

04:02:55.070 --> 04:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:02:58.429 --> 04:02:58.439 align:start position:0%
they there a there just a a paragraph
 
04:02:58.439 --> 04:02:59.670 align:start position:0%
they there a there just a a paragraph
describing

04:02:59.670 --> 04:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
describing
 
04:03:02.269 --> 04:03:02.279 align:start position:0%
it uh could you
 
04:03:06.550 --> 04:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
just if you can speak to that appreciate
 
04:03:08.990 --> 04:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
that yes thank thank you for your
 
04:03:13.269 --> 04:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
question chairman Rulo um those four uh
 
04:03:18.790 --> 04:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
pfoa uh chemicals that are listed um in
 
04:03:22.229 --> 04:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
271 are already in statute when the
 
04:03:24.950 --> 04:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
original bill was filed those mcls had
 
04:03:28.990 --> 04:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
not been um passed so there was no need
 
04:03:32.149 --> 04:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
to include that language in the original
 
04:03:36.070 --> 04:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
in this bill because it uh there the uh
 
04:03:41.309 --> 04:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
485 colon 16 it already gone into
 
04:03:49.189 --> 04:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:53.349 --> 04:03:53.359 align:start position:0%

I just wanted to confirm that um we do
 
04:04:14.469 --> 04:04:14.479 align:start position:0%
have you did on on page two it does or
 
04:04:16.469 --> 04:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
page one it talks about the four that
 
04:04:19.630 --> 04:04:19.640 align:start position:0%
are now regulated are there any others
 
04:04:23.269 --> 04:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
regulated by Dees any other posos no not
 
04:04:28.229 --> 04:04:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:32.550 --> 04:04:32.560 align:start position:0%

start uh we okay where you're uh where
 
04:05:38.349 --> 04:05:38.359 align:start position:0%
you from your town you represent the
 
04:05:42.510 --> 04:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
town you live in uh who you
 
04:05:47.469 --> 04:05:47.479 align:start position:0%
represent and how much you know no long
 
04:05:53.030 --> 04:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
plan to speak and also just keep back
 
04:05:56.030 --> 04:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
from the microphone enough so that you
 
04:05:59.269 --> 04:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
come through reasonably well
 
04:06:06.790 --> 04:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:11.229 --> 04:06:11.239 align:start position:0%
video let me give that a try um thank
 
04:06:13.630 --> 04:06:13.640 align:start position:0%
you chairman Rulo uh members of the
 
04:06:17.429 --> 04:06:17.439 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Steve Rosado uh I
 
04:06:19.670 --> 04:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh representing the American chemistry
 
04:06:28.550 --> 04:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:32.389 --> 04:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
Virginia all right the the floor is the
 
04:06:35.790 --> 04:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:39.030 --> 04:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
yours are you there let me unmute there
 
04:06:41.349 --> 04:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
we are okay sorry about that all right
 
04:06:43.870 --> 04:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
so um thank you for the opportunity to
 
04:06:46.550 --> 04:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
provide comments on House Bill 271
 
04:06:49.149 --> 04:06:49.159 align:start position:0%
related to perr and poly floral alkal
 
04:06:53.110 --> 04:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
substances or pasas ACC takes a neutral
 
04:06:54.710 --> 04:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
position on the bill but would like to
 
04:06:56.870 --> 04:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
offer a couple of suggested amendments
 
04:06:59.389 --> 04:06:59.399 align:start position:0%
to better focus the state's attention
 
04:07:02.429 --> 04:07:02.439 align:start position:0%
and resources our comments concern the
 
04:07:04.950 --> 04:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
def expansive definition of pasas in
 
04:07:06.910 --> 04:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
section three of the bill and the
 
04:07:10.070 --> 04:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
criteria for determining which P may be
 
04:07:12.429 --> 04:07:12.439 align:start position:0%
of interest while the state has been
 
04:07:14.950 --> 04:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
conducting stack testing for some time
 
04:07:17.189 --> 04:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
it is important to recognize that that
 
04:07:19.670 --> 04:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
EPA has yet to develop a valid
 
04:07:22.550 --> 04:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
analytical technique for measuring p in
 
04:07:25.870 --> 04:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
air EPA has however developed validated
 
04:07:28.229 --> 04:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
methods for measuring a total of 29
 
04:07:31.630 --> 04:07:31.640 align:start position:0%
pasas in drinking water to ensure
 
04:07:34.429 --> 04:07:34.439 align:start position:0%
accuracy and reproducibility of the data
 
04:07:36.830 --> 04:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
collected we encourage the committee to
 
04:07:40.670 --> 04:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
limit the focus of hr5 271 to those
 
04:07:42.550 --> 04:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
substances for which analytical
 
04:07:45.269 --> 04:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
techniques have been validated we
 
04:07:46.990 --> 04:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
understand however that there is concern
 
04:07:48.790 --> 04:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
about limiting the department to a
 
04:07:51.149 --> 04:07:51.159 align:start position:0%
couple dozen substances as an
 
04:07:53.830 --> 04:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
alternative we suggest a definition for
 
04:07:56.870 --> 04:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
pasas that focuses on those substances
 
04:07:59.910 --> 04:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
likely to be found in water excluding
 
04:08:02.670 --> 04:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
refrigerant gases volatile liquids and
 
04:08:05.269 --> 04:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
polymers the definition is derived from
 
04:08:07.710 --> 04:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
materials developed by the interstate
 
04:08:09.990 --> 04:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
research and Technology Council of the
 
04:08:12.269 --> 04:08:12.279 align:start position:0%
environmental Council of the states in
 
04:08:14.710 --> 04:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
which the state is an active
 
04:08:17.070 --> 04:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
participant in addition we encourage the
 
04:08:19.070 --> 04:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
committee to revise the requirements in
 
04:08:21.550 --> 04:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph six of section three
 
04:08:23.910 --> 04:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
concerning which pasas to be considered
 
04:08:26.189 --> 04:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
under the section the bill currently
 
04:08:29.030 --> 04:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
sets the bar rather Low by allowing for
 
04:08:31.630 --> 04:08:31.640 align:start position:0%
consideration of pasas for which a
 
04:08:33.750 --> 04:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
single study is available suggesting
 
04:08:35.990 --> 04:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
potential health effects we recommend
 
04:08:38.070 --> 04:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
that the language be revised to require
 
04:08:40.070 --> 04:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
that any studies to be considered be
 
04:08:42.229 --> 04:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
published in a scientific journal that
 
04:08:45.149 --> 04:08:45.159 align:start position:0%
is subject to peer review the standard
 
04:08:48.229 --> 04:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
generally applied by USA and other
 
04:08:50.790 --> 04:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
authoritative bodies thank you I would
 
04:08:53.990 --> 04:08:54.000 align:start position:0%

04:09:14.109 --> 04:09:14.119 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair for taking
 
04:09:16.670 --> 04:09:16.680 align:start position:0%

submitted any testimony with um
 
04:09:20.910 --> 04:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
everything you spoke about in writing I
 
04:09:24.149 --> 04:09:24.159 align:start position:0%

inbox apologies I I we have not but I I
 
04:09:30.590 --> 04:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
know that we will be submitting it very
 
04:09:33.630 --> 04:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
shortly thank
 
04:09:36.349 --> 04:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
you representative Cohen sir uh
 
04:09:38.269 --> 04:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
representative Cohen through four
 
04:09:40.389 --> 04:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
question thank you for taking my
 
04:09:42.389 --> 04:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
question can you please tell me what
 
04:09:45.109 --> 04:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
your knowledge of your Association in a
 
04:09:48.109 --> 04:09:48.119 align:start position:0%
12 month period perhaps the last 12
 
04:09:51.590 --> 04:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
months or something close how many new
 
04:09:54.309 --> 04:09:54.319 align:start position:0%
derivatives of past have been released
 
04:09:56.830 --> 04:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
to the to the commercial industry
 
04:09:59.550 --> 04:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
whether it's a brand new compound or a
 
04:10:01.630 --> 04:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
modification of an existing something
 
04:10:03.429 --> 04:10:03.439 align:start position:0%
that's called P could you give me an
 
04:10:05.269 --> 04:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
idea to what the number is in a 12-
 
04:10:07.950 --> 04:10:07.960 align:start position:0%
month period please
 
04:10:09.870 --> 04:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
well thank you good good question
 
04:10:11.870 --> 04:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
representative Cohen and and I I can't
 
04:10:13.830 --> 04:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
give you a definitive answer I I can
 
04:10:16.469 --> 04:10:16.479 align:start position:0%
give you sort of a a general uh a
 
04:10:20.189 --> 04:10:20.199 align:start position:0%
general response um all new chemistries
 
04:10:23.189 --> 04:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
whether perorin or otherwise must be
 
04:10:27.349 --> 04:10:27.359 align:start position:0%
must go to Federal EPA for review uh
 
04:10:31.070 --> 04:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
prior to going on the market um I do not
 
04:10:33.389 --> 04:10:33.399 align:start position:0%
know I we can certainly check and get
 
04:10:35.750 --> 04:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
back to you with any products that have
 
04:10:38.670 --> 04:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
been submitted to EPA or that have been
 
04:10:40.830 --> 04:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
uh released to the market uh within the
 
04:10:45.710 --> 04:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
last year um the legislation passed uh
 
04:10:48.269 --> 04:10:48.279 align:start position:0%
by the US Congress at the end of last
 
04:10:51.070 --> 04:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
year put some restrictions on new
 
04:10:53.109 --> 04:10:53.119 align:start position:0%
chemistries so it may be that they're
 
04:10:55.269 --> 04:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
having been very many over the last few
 
04:10:57.790 --> 04:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
months uh but we can certainly check and
 
04:11:01.149 --> 04:11:01.159 align:start position:0%
and and get back to you all along Please
 
04:11:01.159 --> 04:11:02.229 align:start position:0%
and and get back to you all along Please
Mr

04:11:02.229 --> 04:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
04:11:06.630 --> 04:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
chairperson uh for a followup yes
 
04:11:08.349 --> 04:11:08.359 align:start position:0%
followup please
 
04:11:11.710 --> 04:11:11.720 align:start position:0%
yes follow yeah so Mr R based in your
 
04:11:14.389 --> 04:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
knowledge then uh you said there's no
 
04:11:16.429 --> 04:11:16.439 align:start position:0%
you know you can find out how many new
 
04:11:19.149 --> 04:11:19.159 align:start position:0%
pfest but what about an existing pfest
 
04:11:20.750 --> 04:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
that just changed a little bit so the
 
04:11:23.389 --> 04:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
it's derivative of pest you give me a
 
04:11:26.550 --> 04:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
ballpark in a year what that might
 
04:11:31.149 --> 04:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
be I any any change to the to the
 
04:11:33.830 --> 04:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
structure uh would trigger a new
 
04:11:37.389 --> 04:11:37.399 align:start position:0%
chemical uh requirement approval from EP
 
04:11:40.309 --> 04:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
PA I I it it's I don't think you can
 
04:11:42.469 --> 04:11:42.479 align:start position:0%
tweak you know slightly tweak the
 
04:11:44.830 --> 04:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
chemical structure and still consider it
 
04:11:47.950 --> 04:11:47.960 align:start position:0%
the same chemical um so I think it would
 
04:11:49.750 --> 04:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
be the same answer that it would it
 
04:11:52.790 --> 04:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
would have to go through EPA to uh for
 
04:11:55.070 --> 04:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
approval but let me double check that
 
04:11:57.070 --> 04:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
and and and we're C certainly can get
 
04:11:59.910 --> 04:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
back to you thank you for your question
 
04:12:01.469 --> 04:12:01.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
04:12:01.479 --> 04:12:04.030 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
answer

04:12:04.030 --> 04:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
answer
 
04:12:08.590 --> 04:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
Kelly representa PO is that satisfi is
 
04:12:10.149 --> 04:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
that is that your extent of your
 
04:12:11.870 --> 04:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
question that is the extent of my
 
04:12:13.590 --> 04:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
question thank you very
 
04:12:17.910 --> 04:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
much representative Kelly for a question
 
04:12:19.429 --> 04:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
04:12:22.030 --> 04:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
being here Mr rotto um I just uh Mr
 
04:12:23.990 --> 04:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
rotto could you maybe just give us a
 
04:12:26.149 --> 04:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
little uh overview of what the EPA is
 
04:12:28.309 --> 04:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
evaluating when a chemical is submitting
 
04:12:30.910 --> 04:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
um are they sub are they evaluating it's
 
04:12:32.710 --> 04:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
you know environmental impact only or
 
04:12:35.070 --> 04:12:35.080 align:start position:0%
are they looking at certain C just the
 
04:12:37.309 --> 04:12:37.319 align:start position:0%
water impact or impact in the water what
 
04:12:40.309 --> 04:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
goes through that process it it it and
 
04:12:42.790 --> 04:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question um it it
 
04:12:46.070 --> 04:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
runs the it can run the full gamut um it
 
04:12:49.149 --> 04:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
it is depends a bit on the particular
 
04:12:51.990 --> 04:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
chemistry um but you know EPA will look
 
04:12:54.910 --> 04:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
at health and environmental uh effects
 
04:12:57.990 --> 04:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
it'll also look at you know how uh how
 
04:12:59.870 --> 04:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
it would be used you know what the
 
04:13:03.510 --> 04:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
likelihood for exposure is to workers to
 
04:13:05.870 --> 04:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know to to the environment also
 
04:13:08.510 --> 04:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
what the potential for relief pces are
 
04:13:11.510 --> 04:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
from that use based on that it will then
 
04:13:14.109 --> 04:13:14.119 align:start position:0%
ask for data either you know data that's
 
04:13:17.030 --> 04:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
already been developed or and May in in
 
04:13:20.109 --> 04:13:20.119 align:start position:0%
and often uh request uh you know new
 
04:13:22.830 --> 04:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
studies to provide new data so it it
 
04:13:24.469 --> 04:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
depends a bit on the individual
 
04:13:26.510 --> 04:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
chemistry but it you know it does look
 
04:13:29.189 --> 04:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
at the full health and environmental
 
04:13:33.229 --> 04:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
impacts you know water air Etc or can
 
04:13:36.149 --> 04:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:36.159 --> 04:13:38.269 align:start position:0%
 
things

04:13:38.269 --> 04:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:13:40.830 --> 04:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question yes yes
 
04:13:43.309 --> 04:13:43.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr
 
04:13:46.269 --> 04:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
zto uh any other questions by members of
 
04:13:49.189 --> 04:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
the committee represent Moran had his
 
04:13:51.349 --> 04:13:51.359 align:start position:0%
hand up and it's down now so I don't
 
04:13:54.670 --> 04:13:54.680 align:start position:0%
know if he has question Mr chairman um
 
04:13:58.269 --> 04:13:58.279 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I I the the speaker um wh whom
 
04:14:03.149 --> 04:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:03.159 --> 04:14:06.070 align:start position:0%
 
represent

04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:14:09.309 --> 04:14:09.319 align:start position:0%
chry am chemistry Council all right uh
 
04:14:11.630 --> 04:14:11.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes I do have a question all
 
04:14:15.149 --> 04:14:15.159 align:start position:0%
right for a question yes uh thank you
 
04:14:16.950 --> 04:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
for being here can you tell me who you
 
04:14:20.510 --> 04:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
represent in uh the state of New
 
04:14:23.229 --> 04:14:23.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:14:26.590 --> 04:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
I do not have a list of our membership
 
04:14:29.389 --> 04:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
uh in the state apologies again uh we
 
04:14:31.590 --> 04:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
can track that down and get back to you
 
04:14:32.750 --> 04:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
yeah if you could send that to us that
 
04:14:33.630 --> 04:14:33.640 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:14:35.550 --> 04:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
appreciative Mr chairman can I have a
 
04:14:39.429 --> 04:14:39.439 align:start position:0%
follow-up question or follow yeah when
 
04:14:43.429 --> 04:14:43.439 align:start position:0%
you send uh if can you send uh your list
 
04:14:45.550 --> 04:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
of membership and and you can also
 
04:14:47.510 --> 04:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
identify if any of them are involved in
 
04:14:51.830 --> 04:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
any lawsuits uh regarding um uh uh the
 
04:14:55.189 --> 04:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
Water uh PFS pfas um that would be also
 
04:14:56.990 --> 04:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
very helpful if you know if any of your
 
04:14:59.750 --> 04:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
members are in litigation with the
 
04:15:02.590 --> 04:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
state yeah I we'll do our best I mean we
 
04:15:04.429 --> 04:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
don't you know we generally don't track
 
04:15:07.070 --> 04:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
the individual litigation that comp that
 
04:15:08.710 --> 04:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
our members are involved in but
 
04:15:11.309 --> 04:15:11.319 align:start position:0%
certainly we are aware of of litigation
 
04:15:13.510 --> 04:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and and can let you
 
04:15:15.870 --> 04:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
know if if we know of it um it but it
 
04:15:17.189 --> 04:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
may not be
 
04:15:20.910 --> 04:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
comprehensive thank you
 
04:15:26.550 --> 04:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:29.030 --> 04:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
other I see no other questions sir no
 
04:15:31.830 --> 04:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
other questions from committee thank you
 
04:15:34.349 --> 04:15:34.359 align:start position:0%
very much for your

04:16:48.550 --> 04:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
representative for Ryan Newcastle um a
 
04:16:50.229 --> 04:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
registered professional geologist in the
 
04:16:52.990 --> 04:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and uh am
 
04:16:54.590 --> 04:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
registering in support of this bill
 
04:16:56.910 --> 04:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
today thank you for hearing my testimony
 
04:16:59.030 --> 04:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh I was the author of the original bill
 
04:17:03.389 --> 04:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
that amended RSA 485116 e and at that
 
04:17:07.630 --> 04:17:07.640 align:start position:0%
time uh pfcs was a regular uh jar
 
04:17:09.469 --> 04:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
uh for referring to these class of
 
04:17:12.389 --> 04:17:12.399 align:start position:0%
chemicals and since then uh as rep
 
04:17:14.510 --> 04:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative Rong stated the EPA and
 
04:17:17.109 --> 04:17:17.119 align:start position:0%
other organizations have renamed this
 
04:17:19.950 --> 04:17:19.960 align:start position:0%
class of chemicals including atsdr which
 
04:17:22.149 --> 04:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
I'll send um in my testimony to you in
 
04:17:25.349 --> 04:17:25.359 align:start position:0%
written testimony after this um uh
 
04:17:28.910 --> 04:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
hearing uh atsdr has um clarified really
 
04:17:33.109 --> 04:17:33.119 align:start position:0%
clearly in their fact um pages that pfcs
 
04:17:35.229 --> 04:17:35.239 align:start position:0%
were renamed as pest because it was
 
04:17:38.109 --> 04:17:38.119 align:start position:0%
confusing to many people because past
 
04:17:42.309 --> 04:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
can also be pfcs can also be termed per
 
04:17:44.309 --> 04:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
fluorocarbons which are a set of
 
04:17:46.070 --> 04:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
different chemicals which are known to
 
04:17:49.510 --> 04:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
be very um powerful greenhouse gases so
 
04:17:52.429 --> 04:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
they kind of uh decided that past was a
 
04:17:54.670 --> 04:17:54.680 align:start position:0%
more relevant term to refer to these
 
04:17:57.229 --> 04:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
chemicals so I support the um
 
04:18:01.510 --> 04:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
modifications to RSA 16e uh in House
 
04:18:05.830 --> 04:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 271 I also wanted to um uh talk
 
04:18:08.870 --> 04:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
about Lin on page two lines 3 through
 
04:18:11.389 --> 04:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
seven the changes which were made which
 
04:18:13.910 --> 04:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
I also agree with um these refer to an
 
04:18:17.630 --> 04:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
old set of um analytical methods
 
04:18:19.389 --> 04:18:19.399 align:start position:0%
originally developed when these
 
04:18:22.189 --> 04:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
chemicals emerged as concerns and even
 
04:18:24.630 --> 04:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
on the epa's website uh they still talk
 
04:18:27.030 --> 04:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
about this reference to this method but
 
04:18:30.269 --> 04:18:30.279 align:start position:0%
it's only um referenced as a historical
 
04:18:32.590 --> 04:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
um reference for people to to work with
 
04:18:34.990 --> 04:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
but the they refer to the newer much
 
04:18:38.189 --> 04:18:38.199 align:start position:0%
updated methods um an EPA does update
 
04:18:41.030 --> 04:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
their methods from time to time in 2018
 
04:18:43.429 --> 04:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
this first modification was made 2020
 
04:18:45.469 --> 04:18:45.479 align:start position:0%
and actually just a few weeks ago three
 
04:18:48.630 --> 04:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
weeks ago EPA also issued some U
 
04:18:50.469 --> 04:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
modifications to these methods so I
 
04:18:52.229 --> 04:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
think it's entirely appropriate to
 
04:18:54.750 --> 04:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
remove these lines from the bill because
 
04:18:57.630 --> 04:18:57.640 align:start position:0%
we don't want to refer in our rules to
 
04:19:01.309 --> 04:19:01.319 align:start position:0%
Old um to Old references and I just
 
04:19:04.630 --> 04:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to also uh just clarify in
 
04:19:07.790 --> 04:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
section on page three line 11 in section
 
04:19:12.349 --> 04:19:12.359 align:start position:0%
six um the prior um person who testified
 
04:19:14.950 --> 04:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
talked about one study this section says
 
04:19:18.030 --> 04:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
at least one study that is peer-reviewed
 
04:19:20.429 --> 04:19:20.439 align:start position:0%
could be used by the state Dees to
 
04:19:23.269 --> 04:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
determine appropriate um levels in New
 
04:19:26.269 --> 04:19:26.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not just one so I think that's
 
04:19:28.750 --> 04:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate um at least one study used
 
04:19:30.870 --> 04:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
and it just sort of sets a lower bar for
 
04:19:33.590 --> 04:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
them uh to use the science to determine
 
04:19:35.590 --> 04:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
what chemicals are appropriate to set
 
04:19:38.469 --> 04:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
levels for um also there are there is an
 
04:19:40.590 --> 04:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
EPA website that talks about sort of
 
04:19:42.910 --> 04:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
summarizes all of the methods that are
 
04:19:45.510 --> 04:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
currently acceptable to EPA they do have
 
04:19:47.469 --> 04:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
one acceptable method for testing air
 
04:19:49.109 --> 04:19:49.119 align:start position:0%
emissions is OT
 
04:19:52.389 --> 04:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
m-45 which uh is an air emission meth a
 
04:19:54.149 --> 04:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
method to analyze air emissions for up
 
04:19:57.870 --> 04:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
to 50 pfast chemicals so just um in
 
04:19:59.830 --> 04:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
support of this bill it's just I view
 
04:20:02.550 --> 04:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
this as a sort of a house cleaning Bill
 
04:20:04.910 --> 04:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
to update our rules and sort of make
 
04:20:08.910 --> 04:20:08.920 align:start position:0%
them more um uh updatable for from now
 
04:20:11.429 --> 04:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
on so be happy to take any uh questions
 
04:20:11.439 --> 04:20:13.550 align:start position:0%
on so be happy to take any uh questions
from

04:20:13.550 --> 04:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:20:17.109 --> 04:20:17.119 align:start position:0%
anybody there any questions from members
 
04:20:20.030 --> 04:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:23.630 --> 04:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
committee that yeah Mr chairman I I have
 
04:20:26.309 --> 04:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
one question previous testimony
 
04:20:29.510 --> 04:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
suggested an amendment that would limit
 
04:20:32.349 --> 04:20:32.359 align:start position:0%
the testing to only water and not air
 
04:20:35.510 --> 04:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
what would your be opinion about that
 
04:20:35.520 --> 04:20:37.269 align:start position:0%
what would your be opinion about that
Amendment

04:20:37.269 --> 04:20:37.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:20:40.670 --> 04:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
well this section was added um I think
 
04:20:44.510 --> 04:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
it's lines e through e and on um because
 
04:20:46.750 --> 04:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
we do have um an issue here in the state
 
04:20:49.550 --> 04:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire with Airborne releases
 
04:20:52.630 --> 04:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
from uh an industry in marac so I I
 
04:20:54.790 --> 04:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
would not want to limit the ability of
 
04:20:58.870 --> 04:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
our state um agencies to uh determine
 
04:21:02.189 --> 04:21:02.199 align:start position:0%
what's appropriate and safe for exposure
 
04:21:04.710 --> 04:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
um we know that in the in the case of
 
04:21:07.750 --> 04:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
marac that the air emissions CA caused
 
04:21:10.349 --> 04:21:10.359 align:start position:0%
uh drinking water levels to exceed what
 
04:21:12.149 --> 04:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
we feel is safe and what the dees has
 
04:21:13.510 --> 04:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
determined to be safe in the state of
 
04:21:16.349 --> 04:21:16.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so I uh would trust them
 
04:21:18.030 --> 04:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to come up with appropriate
 
04:21:20.630 --> 04:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
standards in the future um so I would
 
04:21:23.309 --> 04:21:23.319 align:start position:0%
say I I disagree with that amendment to
 
04:21:25.429 --> 04:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:21:27.510 --> 04:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
bill okay thank
 
04:21:32.109 --> 04:21:32.119 align:start position:0%
you any other questions MERS of the
 
04:21:35.550 --> 04:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
committee sir ion no questions no
 
04:21:37.830 --> 04:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
04:21:42.830 --> 04:21:42.840 align:start position:0%

you are there any
 
04:21:49.229 --> 04:21:49.239 align:start position:0%
other requests to be heard I see none

but uh we have a remote
 
04:22:14.389 --> 04:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
testimony uh one is one is neutral two
 
04:22:20.070 --> 04:22:20.080 align:start position:0%

surfing
 
04:58:54.510 --> 04:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
and chair calls the prime sponsor of the
 
04:58:57.110 --> 04:58:57.120 align:start position:0%

Smith thank you Mr chair good afternoon
committee

04:59:02.030 --> 04:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:59:04.990 --> 04:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
members for the record I'm Suzanne Smith
 
04:59:07.350 --> 04:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
I represent the towns of Plymouth Hein
 
04:59:09.310 --> 04:59:09.320 align:start position:0%
and holderness in Grafton County
 
04:59:13.788 --> 04:59:13.798 align:start position:0%
District 8 and I am here uh as the prime
 
04:59:16.750 --> 04:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill I was also the chair
 
04:59:19.868 --> 04:59:19.878 align:start position:0%
of the commission to study wake boats
 
04:59:24.868 --> 04:59:24.878 align:start position:0%
which uh worked for a year or more uh
 
04:59:29.350 --> 04:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
to learn more about wake boats
 
04:59:33.430 --> 04:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
and everything about them and so this
 
04:59:35.350 --> 04:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
bill came out of that
 
04:59:38.750 --> 04:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
commission it was voted on by the
 
04:59:41.670 --> 04:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
commission uh the the language of the
 
04:59:43.590 --> 04:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
bill was voted on by the commission
 
04:59:44.910 --> 04:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
which was brought to us by the
 
04:59:47.390 --> 04:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
department of safety and all members
 
04:59:50.788 --> 04:59:50.798 align:start position:0%
agreed that this was a uh a bill that
 
04:59:53.910 --> 04:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
they could agree on the bill defines
 
04:59:53.920 --> 04:59:55.310 align:start position:0%
they could agree on the bill defines
wake

04:59:55.310 --> 04:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
wake
 
04:59:58.230 --> 04:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
surfing and it makes those that wake
 
05:00:00.310 --> 05:00:00.320 align:start position:0%
surf subject to the same safety
 
05:00:02.948 --> 05:00:02.958 align:start position:0%
standards as water skiers and wake
 
05:00:05.150 --> 05:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
borders who are towed behind
 
05:00:07.910 --> 05:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
boats that includes uh requiring wake
 
05:00:10.670 --> 05:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
surface to be wearing a PFD having a
 
05:00:13.788 --> 05:00:13.798 align:start position:0%
spotter on the boat in case they fall
 
05:00:17.110 --> 05:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
and uh a few other minor um
 
05:00:21.590 --> 05:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
things so it also specifies the type of
 
05:00:24.310 --> 05:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
boat that you may use if you are wake
 
05:00:26.948 --> 05:00:26.958 align:start position:0%
surfing the big difference between wake
 
05:00:29.110 --> 05:00:29.120 align:start position:0%
surfing and wake boarding or water
 
05:00:33.350 --> 05:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
skiing is that you only use a very short
 
05:00:35.948 --> 05:00:35.958 align:start position:0%
toe rope to get up and then once you are
 
05:00:39.868 --> 05:00:39.878 align:start position:0%
up you drop the rope and you are
 
05:00:42.830 --> 05:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
effectively surfing behind the boat
 
05:00:46.470 --> 05:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
within 5 to 15 feet of the back of the
 
05:00:50.990 --> 05:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
boat and so the reason that the the only
 
05:00:53.470 --> 05:00:53.480 align:start position:0%
boat that you may wake surf behind is a
 
05:00:57.390 --> 05:00:57.400 align:start position:0%
wake boat or a ballast boat um is
 
05:01:00.628 --> 05:01:00.638 align:start position:0%
because the engines of those boats are
 
05:01:04.310 --> 05:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
situated so that the energy of the motor
 
05:01:07.708 --> 05:01:07.718 align:start position:0%
goes down not out the back and there is
 
05:01:10.110 --> 05:01:10.120 align:start position:0%
no danger of the Wake surfer being
 
05:01:12.868 --> 05:01:12.878 align:start position:0%
caught in a prop as could happen with an
 
05:01:16.548 --> 05:01:16.558 align:start position:0%
inboard or an outboard motor I went to a
 
05:01:19.830 --> 05:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
website C uh that asked what boat can
 
05:01:22.708 --> 05:01:22.718 align:start position:0%
you wake surf behind and it basically
 
05:01:26.230 --> 05:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
said you couldn't wake surf behind
 
05:01:28.910 --> 05:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
inboard boats including direct drives
 
05:01:30.110 --> 05:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
and V
 
05:01:33.948 --> 05:01:33.958 align:start position:0%
drives No wait yeah it's said the only
 
05:01:36.070 --> 05:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
you couldn't do you couldn't wake surf
 
05:01:37.708 --> 05:01:37.718 align:start position:0%
behind just your basic outboard or
 
05:01:40.990 --> 05:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
inboard motor because you needed one
 
05:01:43.788 --> 05:01:43.798 align:start position:0%
where the engine and the Drive Unit are
 
05:01:45.910 --> 05:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
placed inside the boat and the propeller
 
05:01:48.788 --> 05:01:48.798 align:start position:0%
comes out under the hle and in front of
 
05:01:51.430 --> 05:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
the transom so I mean it's a bill that
 
05:01:53.990 --> 05:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
everyone agreed on it is all about
 
05:01:56.910 --> 05:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
safety and I know there is someone who
 
05:01:59.030 --> 05:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
is else who is going to speak on this
 
05:02:01.190 --> 05:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
who can tell you a lot more about them
 
05:02:03.310 --> 05:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
who was also on the commission but I
 
05:02:06.110 --> 05:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
urge you to uh support this bill and
 
05:02:07.910 --> 05:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
vote ought to pass and if you have any
 
05:02:11.350 --> 05:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:16.430 --> 05:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:19.510 --> 05:02:19.520 align:start position:0%

months looking at issues related to wake
 
05:05:58.270 --> 05:05:58.280 align:start position:0%
Sports and wake vots and I'm open to any

questions or the field any that you may
 
05:06:02.948 --> 05:06:02.958 align:start position:0%
have the suggestion of improving current
 
05:06:04.830 --> 05:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
laws relative to wake surfing was
 
05:06:07.310 --> 05:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
important it came from the Marine Patrol
 
05:06:10.510 --> 05:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
and was met with un unanimous support
 
05:06:13.670 --> 05:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
this is a common sense Bill we want
 
05:06:17.830 --> 05:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
folks to enjoy water sport safely hb15
 
05:06:20.510 --> 05:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
is another way to accomplish that and we
 
05:06:22.510 --> 05:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
ask for your
 
05:06:24.470 --> 05:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
support that's it for my opening
 
05:06:25.910 --> 05:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
statement if you have any questions I'd
 
05:06:29.548 --> 05:06:29.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:31.390 --> 05:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
feel any
 
05:06:31.400 --> 05:06:32.948 align:start position:0%
feel any
questions

05:06:32.948 --> 05:06:32.958 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:06:35.628 --> 05:06:35.638 align:start position:0%
I see no questions no questions you said
 
05:06:40.230 --> 05:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:44.190 --> 05:06:44.200 align:start position:0%
is this is your statement correct yes it
 
05:06:46.948 --> 05:06:46.958 align:start position:0%
is Sir and representative post does have
 
05:06:52.150 --> 05:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:54.150 --> 05:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
question thank you for taking my
 
05:06:57.708 --> 05:06:57.718 align:start position:0%
question and thank you um Mr mum for
 
05:07:00.548 --> 05:07:00.558 align:start position:0%
your testimony today um I have a couple
 
05:07:02.788 --> 05:07:02.798 align:start position:0%
questions and so there might be follow
 
05:07:06.830 --> 05:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
up um is there going to be a penalty for
 
05:07:09.830 --> 05:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
wake surfing behind Bo boats that uh are
 
05:07:14.948 --> 05:07:14.958 align:start position:0%
not a wake vat um or are we taking wake
 
05:07:20.510 --> 05:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:24.110 --> 05:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
entirely uh leg legislation was uh
 
05:07:26.470 --> 05:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
defined to be specific and to narrow the
 
05:07:28.430 --> 05:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
definition of the type of vessel that
 
05:07:32.270 --> 05:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
could be safely wake surfed behind uh so
 
05:07:35.750 --> 05:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
you'll find wake surfing in that uh in
 
05:07:35.760 --> 05:07:39.390 align:start position:0%
you'll find wake surfing in that uh in
that

05:07:39.390 --> 05:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:42.070 --> 05:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
script um chair could I do a followup to
 
05:07:44.230 --> 05:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
that follow
 
05:07:48.788 --> 05:07:48.798 align:start position:0%
up so if there are individuals um wake
 
05:07:51.310 --> 05:07:51.320 align:start position:0%
surfing off of the back of a regular
 
05:07:54.390 --> 05:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
boat um that is not defined for you to
 
05:07:58.628 --> 05:07:58.638 align:start position:0%
wake surf on would there be a
 
05:08:02.470 --> 05:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
penalty and who would enforce it and
 
05:08:04.390 --> 05:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
would there be a financial component to
 
05:08:04.400 --> 05:08:07.110 align:start position:0%
would there be a financial component to
do

05:08:07.110 --> 05:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:09.628 --> 05:08:09.638 align:start position:0%
that uh that's an excellent question one
 
05:08:11.190 --> 05:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
that would be geared towards New
 
05:08:13.788 --> 05:08:13.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Marine Patrol they they helped
 
05:08:17.430 --> 05:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
craft uh the language to help Define
 
05:08:21.590 --> 05:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
what would be allowed uh for example a a
 
05:08:23.750 --> 05:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
small outboard engine that would be
 
05:08:26.030 --> 05:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
operated via a tiller maybe a fishing
 
05:08:28.548 --> 05:08:28.558 align:start position:0%
style boat would be a great example of a
 
05:08:32.070 --> 05:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
type of vessel that would not be allowed
 
05:08:34.990 --> 05:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
uh by
 
05:08:37.150 --> 05:08:37.160 align:start position:0%
understanding and and the what the
 
05:08:40.150 --> 05:08:40.160 align:start position:0%
penalty phase would be I'm not 100% sure
 
05:08:42.190 --> 05:08:42.200 align:start position:0%
that's been defined whether it would be
 
05:08:45.070 --> 05:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
invi uh involved with any monetary
 
05:08:47.150 --> 05:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
penalty I don't I haven't been advised
 
05:08:49.708 --> 05:08:49.718 align:start position:0%
of that either but it's the it's it's
 
05:08:53.510 --> 05:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
speaks to the style of the hull that can
 
05:08:56.190 --> 05:08:56.200 align:start position:0%
work and it most certainly wouldn't be a
 
05:09:01.110 --> 05:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:01.120 --> 05:09:04.670 align:start position:0%

chair again I I uh I thought I had
 
05:12:38.830 --> 05:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
registered this morning but perhaps some
 
05:12:41.030 --> 05:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
connection problems uh didn't didn't
 
05:12:43.590 --> 05:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
reflect that my name is Tim dun leevy uh
 
05:12:46.150 --> 05:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
with the state police Marine Patrol unit
 
05:12:48.868 --> 05:12:48.878 align:start position:0%
uh I thank you uh honorable members of
 
05:12:51.190 --> 05:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
the resources committee for hearing my
 
05:12:53.350 --> 05:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
testimony today on behalf of the Marine
 
05:12:55.270 --> 05:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
Patrol and the department of safety we
 
05:12:58.190 --> 05:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
support this legislation We we played an
 
05:13:00.750 --> 05:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
active role at the commission level with
 
05:13:02.788 --> 05:13:02.798 align:start position:0%
these recommendations
 
05:13:05.470 --> 05:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
and uh briefly I will say that this
 
05:13:08.990 --> 05:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
simply closes the gap on several laws
 
05:13:11.190 --> 05:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
that are already in place for those
 
05:13:13.708 --> 05:13:13.718 align:start position:0%
engaged in towed water sports water
 
05:13:16.548 --> 05:13:16.558 align:start position:0%
skiing knee boarding and so forth it
 
05:13:18.990 --> 05:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
requires the wearing of a life jacket by
 
05:13:22.830 --> 05:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
that uh wake Surfer it requires uh the
 
05:13:25.230 --> 05:13:25.240 align:start position:0%
boat to have an observer on board in the
 
05:13:26.788 --> 05:13:26.798 align:start position:0%
event that there is a problem or a
 
05:13:28.350 --> 05:13:28.360 align:start position:0%
fallen W wake
 
05:13:31.868 --> 05:13:31.878 align:start position:0%
Surfer it prohibits this use uh this
 
05:13:34.150 --> 05:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
activity after Sunset and during the
 
05:13:37.030 --> 05:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
hours of Darkness like water skiing and
 
05:13:40.350 --> 05:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
it does go beyond just the safety issues
 
05:13:43.110 --> 05:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
as it as it already applies to water ski
 
05:13:45.310 --> 05:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
and that it does restrict the types of
 
05:13:48.030 --> 05:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
boats that you can use to engage in wake
 
05:13:50.708 --> 05:13:50.718 align:start position:0%
surfing you've heard the testimony by
 
05:13:52.948 --> 05:13:52.958 align:start position:0%
those before me as to the dangers of the
 
05:13:55.750 --> 05:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
types of propulsion uh that do exist and
 
05:13:57.548 --> 05:13:57.558 align:start position:0%
they're sometimes attempted to use for
 
05:14:00.150 --> 05:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
Wake serving I would be happy to answer
 
05:14:02.510 --> 05:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
any questions that any of you may have
 
05:14:06.990 --> 05:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:11.628 --> 05:14:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:17.190 --> 05:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:17.200 --> 05:14:18.750 align:start position:0%
 
questions

05:14:18.750 --> 05:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:14:18.760 --> 05:14:20.430 align:start position:0%
questions
post

05:14:20.430 --> 05:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
post
 
05:14:24.270 --> 05:14:24.280 align:start position:0%
Kelly representative Kelly for
 
05:14:26.470 --> 05:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
question this Captain dun Levy thank you
 
05:14:28.708 --> 05:14:28.718 align:start position:0%
for being here again um my my question
 
05:14:30.750 --> 05:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
I'm new could you just give me an idea
 
05:14:32.310 --> 05:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
of how many Marine Patrol officers the
 
05:14:35.948 --> 05:14:35.958 align:start position:0%
state has um and how many lakes we they
 
05:14:35.958 --> 05:14:36.708 align:start position:0%
state has um and how many lakes we they
they

05:14:36.708 --> 05:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:14:40.270 --> 05:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
Patrol we routinely Patrol about 200
 
05:14:44.390 --> 05:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
Lakes 200 to 275 on a regular basis not
 
05:14:46.750 --> 05:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
all of them see an officer every day
 
05:14:48.948 --> 05:14:48.958 align:start position:0%
certainly our larger lakes and our Coast
 
05:14:51.990 --> 05:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
sea officers every day uh including day
 
05:14:54.030 --> 05:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
and night shifts uh we have
 
05:14:56.430 --> 05:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
approximately 40 officers on our roster
 
05:14:59.990 --> 05:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
right now um made up primarily of
 
05:15:02.430 --> 05:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
seasonal uh officers
 
05:15:04.590 --> 05:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
uh there are there are eight
 
05:15:07.788 --> 05:15:07.798 align:start position:0%
full-time uh year- round positions uh
 
05:15:09.470 --> 05:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
three of whom are assigned to a Homeland
 
05:15:13.868 --> 05:15:13.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:16.868 --> 05:15:16.878 align:start position:0%
Coast I answer your question Y correct
 
05:15:18.430 --> 05:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
yep thank
 
05:15:23.030 --> 05:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
you post representative post yes so so
 
05:15:24.948 --> 05:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
this would be the same question I asked
 
05:15:28.910 --> 05:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
of the um last uh person to testify um
 
05:15:32.070 --> 05:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
what would the penalty be um how would
 
05:15:35.190 --> 05:15:35.200 align:start position:0%
it be enforced and uh what is the
 
05:15:37.670 --> 05:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
financial component of
 
05:15:41.190 --> 05:15:41.200 align:start position:0%
that uh the the penalty would fall This
 
05:15:43.350 --> 05:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
falls under the water skiing statutes
 
05:15:45.548 --> 05:15:45.558 align:start position:0%
and therefore the penalties are
 
05:15:49.190 --> 05:15:49.200 align:start position:0%
violation um the fine schedule set for
 
05:15:53.030 --> 05:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
this type of violation is $86 in change
 
05:15:54.750 --> 05:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
uh forgive me I don't know exactly the
 
05:15:57.548 --> 05:15:57.558 align:start position:0%
the the change um from an enforcement
 
05:16:00.548 --> 05:16:00.558 align:start position:0%
perspective this is a a routine type
 
05:16:02.548 --> 05:16:02.558 align:start position:0%
enforcement action that that an officer
 
05:16:04.310 --> 05:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
would take should they observe this type
 
05:16:04.320 --> 05:16:05.070 align:start position:0%
would take should they observe this type
of

05:16:05.070 --> 05:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:16:09.030 --> 05:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
violation um we we see these routinely
 
05:16:11.548 --> 05:16:11.558 align:start position:0%
uh it's part of our regular Patrol shift
 
05:16:14.830 --> 05:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
as a state trooper would enforce uh uh
 
05:16:17.110 --> 05:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
speed on the highway or or Lane
 
05:16:22.670 --> 05:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
violations this is a is a uh an OBS an a
 
05:16:23.868 --> 05:16:23.878 align:start position:0%
violation that would typically be
 
05:16:25.310 --> 05:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
observed by the officer and addressed
 
05:16:25.320 --> 05:16:26.670 align:start position:0%
observed by the officer and addressed
right

05:16:26.670 --> 05:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:16:28.788 --> 05:16:28.798 align:start position:0%
away there would be no Financial
 
05:16:32.830 --> 05:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
component um as far as uh a cost to the
 
05:16:35.070 --> 05:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
agency as it would be part of the the
 
05:16:37.510 --> 05:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
office's uh daily
 
05:16:42.190 --> 05:16:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:44.548 --> 05:16:44.558 align:start position:0%
certainly representative Dodge had his
 
05:16:47.190 --> 05:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
hand up but I don't know whether he
 
05:16:51.150 --> 05:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
representative Dodge hand up I I did but
 
05:16:53.150 --> 05:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
actually representative post covered my
 
05:16:55.548 --> 05:16:55.558 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
05:16:58.430 --> 05:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
Mayville representative Mayville for a
 
05:17:00.548 --> 05:17:00.558 align:start position:0%
question yes a question please captain
 
05:17:03.150 --> 05:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
and this is just a minor clarification
 
05:17:06.150 --> 05:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
from someone who was wake boarding about
 
05:17:10.150 --> 05:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
30 years ago so the difference between a
 
05:17:14.788 --> 05:17:14.798 align:start position:0%
wake Surfer and a wake border is that
 
05:17:16.590 --> 05:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
you may use the same type of a
 
05:17:20.230 --> 05:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
conveyance but a wake border is attached
 
05:17:23.590 --> 05:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
to a tow rope and a wake Surfer is not
 
05:17:24.948 --> 05:17:24.958 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:17:28.150 --> 05:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct your wake Surfer
 
05:17:30.510 --> 05:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
is is using a traditional toe line that
 
05:17:33.070 --> 05:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
a water skier would would use and is
 
05:17:37.190 --> 05:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
constantly uh being towed by the boat uh
 
05:17:40.628 --> 05:17:40.638 align:start position:0%
the Wake Surfer will start on a very
 
05:17:42.830 --> 05:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
short rope similar to like a barefoot
 
05:17:45.670 --> 05:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
water skier right behind the vessel once
 
05:17:48.708 --> 05:17:48.718 align:start position:0%
the boat achieves the uh preferred type
 
05:17:48.718 --> 05:17:49.430 align:start position:0%
the boat achieves the uh preferred type
of

05:17:49.430 --> 05:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:17:52.788 --> 05:17:52.798 align:start position:0%
wake the Wake Surfer lets go of that
 
05:17:55.150 --> 05:17:55.160 align:start position:0%
rope and is propelled by the motion of
 
05:17:55.160 --> 05:17:56.628 align:start position:0%
rope and is propelled by the motion of
the

05:17:56.628 --> 05:17:56.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:18:00.310 --> 05:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
Wake so there is no connection at that
 
05:18:00.320 --> 05:18:03.948 align:start position:0%
Wake so there is no connection at that
point

05:18:03.948 --> 05:18:03.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:05.910 --> 05:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
does that answer your
 
05:18:08.670 --> 05:18:08.680 align:start position:0%
question yes it just wasn't quite clear
 
05:18:10.190 --> 05:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
in the bill when it was talking about
 
05:18:12.070 --> 05:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
wake surfing and I would have preferred
 
05:18:14.110 --> 05:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
to see it like a it is you're not
 
05:18:15.750 --> 05:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
attached to the boat it just makes the
 
05:18:18.788 --> 05:18:18.798 align:start position:0%
whole piece clearer to me but thank
 
05:18:21.350 --> 05:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
you representative Kelly sir
 
05:18:23.430 --> 05:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly for a
 
05:18:25.548 --> 05:18:25.558 align:start position:0%
question yeah just another question
 
05:18:28.670 --> 05:18:28.680 align:start position:0%
about enforcement uh Captain dun do you
 
05:18:31.948 --> 05:18:31.958 align:start position:0%
does the public often submit evidence
 
05:18:34.310 --> 05:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
like let's say if someone uh was seen
 
05:18:36.470 --> 05:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
without a life jacket while water water
 
05:18:38.150 --> 05:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
skiing and they took a picture and sent
 
05:18:39.788 --> 05:18:39.798 align:start position:0%
it to your office would there be any
 
05:18:42.590 --> 05:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
followup on that or is it is it only
 
05:18:45.750 --> 05:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
when there it's enforced by a
 
05:18:48.270 --> 05:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
patrolman um that would be an extremely
 
05:18:50.750 --> 05:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
unusual circumstance there we do receive
 
05:18:52.910 --> 05:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
complaints from the public about water
 
05:18:54.910 --> 05:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
skiers with no observers or Towing too
 
05:18:57.590 --> 05:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
many and we will dispatch an officer if
 
05:18:59.670 --> 05:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
we have one on that body of water to
 
05:19:02.030 --> 05:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
that area to see if they observe the
 
05:19:04.830 --> 05:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
violation um to take enforcement action
 
05:19:07.390 --> 05:19:07.400 align:start position:0%
on on uh call from the member of the
 
05:19:10.150 --> 05:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
public for this type of activity
 
05:19:13.190 --> 05:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
and and ult have it ultimately result in
 
05:19:14.548 --> 05:19:14.558 align:start position:0%
enforcement action when the officer
 
05:19:16.990 --> 05:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
didn't observe it that doesn't
 
05:19:19.830 --> 05:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
happen if that if that's your question
 
05:19:22.708 --> 05:19:22.718 align:start position:0%
yes it is thank you okay representative
 
05:19:25.990 --> 05:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
post representative post for
 
05:19:27.910 --> 05:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you for taking my
 
05:19:32.030 --> 05:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
question um uh Mr D
 
05:19:36.190 --> 05:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
would there be uh the same uh standard
 
05:19:40.390 --> 05:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
for Barefoot skiing as the Wake Surfer
 
05:19:44.868 --> 05:19:44.878 align:start position:0%
since um it has to do about the boat and
 
05:19:49.390 --> 05:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:52.750 --> 05:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
from uh no because the barefoot water
 
05:19:55.830 --> 05:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
skiers are still attached and towed uh
 
05:19:58.628 --> 05:19:58.638 align:start position:0%
typically a barefoot water skier is is
 
05:19:58.638 --> 05:20:00.150 align:start position:0%
typically a barefoot water skier is is
um

05:20:00.150 --> 05:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:03.390 --> 05:20:03.400 align:start position:0%
the the accepted length of a tow rope
 
05:20:05.670 --> 05:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
for all these other water sports is
 
05:20:08.910 --> 05:20:08.920 align:start position:0%
approximately 75 ft some barefoot water
 
05:20:11.510 --> 05:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
skars will will be towed by a boom that
 
05:20:13.708 --> 05:20:13.718 align:start position:0%
sticks out from the side of the boat but
 
05:20:16.110 --> 05:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
not behind it so those safety concerns
 
05:20:18.868 --> 05:20:18.878 align:start position:0%
don't exist with with Barefoot
 
05:20:22.948 --> 05:20:22.958 align:start position:0%
activities May I do a followup followup
 
05:20:26.310 --> 05:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
can you explain the safety concern of a
 
05:20:30.270 --> 05:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
uh person wake surfing off a boat and
 
05:20:33.150 --> 05:20:33.160 align:start position:0%
and what the real real problem is
 
05:20:35.430 --> 05:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
there the safety
 
05:20:39.070 --> 05:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
problem well certainly um I think the
 
05:20:41.230 --> 05:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
the need for a life jacket speaks for
 
05:20:44.230 --> 05:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
itself and I don't I don't mean that uh
 
05:20:46.430 --> 05:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
sarcastically uh along with observers
 
05:20:48.628 --> 05:20:48.638 align:start position:0%
these are all common laws that have been
 
05:20:51.110 --> 05:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
on the books uh in our state for a long
 
05:20:55.910 --> 05:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
time and are are on Most states uh books
 
05:20:57.548 --> 05:20:57.558 align:start position:0%
if you will for these types of water
 
05:20:57.558 --> 05:20:58.470 align:start position:0%
if you will for these types of water
sport

05:20:58.470 --> 05:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
sport
 
05:21:01.628 --> 05:21:01.638 align:start position:0%
activities um and then obviously for the
 
05:21:03.830 --> 05:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
time after after Sunset if a person
 
05:21:05.548 --> 05:21:05.558 align:start position:0%
should fall after dark and they are
 
05:21:07.548 --> 05:21:07.558 align:start position:0%
separated from their towboat they're
 
05:21:09.070 --> 05:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
subject to the other boating traffic
 
05:21:11.910 --> 05:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
that would have no way of seeing them so
 
05:21:13.868 --> 05:21:13.878 align:start position:0%
these are these are routine accepted
 
05:21:16.548 --> 05:21:16.558 align:start position:0%
safety measures that protect the the
 
05:21:19.510 --> 05:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
skier or the Wake Surfer or the uh knee
 
05:21:22.548 --> 05:21:22.558 align:start position:0%
boarder uh from from becoming more
 
05:21:25.150 --> 05:21:25.160 align:start position:0%
seriously injured uh while engaged in
 
05:21:25.160 --> 05:21:26.470 align:start position:0%
seriously injured uh while engaged in
this

05:21:26.470 --> 05:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:21:30.708 --> 05:21:30.718 align:start position:0%
activity may I do a followup a follow up
 
05:21:32.990 --> 05:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
h but we were specifically talking about
 
05:21:36.230 --> 05:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
the Wake Surfer boat being able to only
 
05:21:38.470 --> 05:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
do that with a wake Surfer
 
05:21:41.430 --> 05:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
boat so I was asking about what is the
 
05:21:44.390 --> 05:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
safety concern that you could only use a
 
05:21:46.110 --> 05:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
wake Surfer
 
05:21:48.230 --> 05:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
boat there are there are several
 
05:21:50.868 --> 05:21:50.878 align:start position:0%
considerations first and foremost the
 
05:21:53.868 --> 05:21:53.878 align:start position:0%
propeller and the engine on uh the boats
 
05:21:55.708 --> 05:21:55.718 align:start position:0%
that would be prohibited from this
 
05:21:59.190 --> 05:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
activity subject the the surfer who is
 
05:22:01.110 --> 05:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
in very close proximity to the back of
 
05:22:03.708 --> 05:22:03.718 align:start position:0%
the boat from from making contact with
 
05:22:06.270 --> 05:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
that propeller a boat that is designed
 
05:22:08.990 --> 05:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
for wake surfing specifically has its
 
05:22:11.910 --> 05:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
Drive its prop beneath the boat and
 
05:22:13.670 --> 05:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
forward of the transom and the transom
 
05:22:15.470 --> 05:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
is just another term for the back of the
 
05:22:18.030 --> 05:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
boat so the the Wake Surfer would have
 
05:22:21.270 --> 05:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
to go underwater and forward underneath
 
05:22:23.030 --> 05:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
the back of the boat before it would
 
05:22:25.510 --> 05:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
ever be um able to make contact with
 
05:22:25.520 --> 05:22:26.230 align:start position:0%
ever be um able to make contact with
that

05:22:26.230 --> 05:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:22:30.190 --> 05:22:30.200 align:start position:0%
propeller traditional uh boats if you
 
05:22:32.788 --> 05:22:32.798 align:start position:0%
will not manufactured with this type of
 
05:22:35.470 --> 05:22:35.480 align:start position:0%
propulsion in mind have those propellers
 
05:22:37.070 --> 05:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
right at the back of the boat where
 
05:22:41.470 --> 05:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:45.190 --> 05:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
them may I have another followup
 
05:22:49.470 --> 05:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
follow um so there are some ski boats
 
05:22:53.270 --> 05:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
that do have their propellers forward so
 
05:22:56.708 --> 05:22:56.718 align:start position:0%
we're only defining it as a wake Surfer
 
05:23:00.070 --> 05:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
boat would a boat like that fall into
 
05:23:02.270 --> 05:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
being a w surer
 
05:23:05.628 --> 05:23:05.638 align:start position:0%
bo uh I I would defer to some of the the
 
05:23:07.590 --> 05:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
experts in in the manufacturing of them
 
05:23:10.070 --> 05:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
but it is my experience that your
 
05:23:13.750 --> 05:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
typical uh production skib boat only is
 
05:23:15.990 --> 05:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
probably not going to create the type of
 
05:23:17.470 --> 05:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
environment that the Wake surface are
 
05:23:19.030 --> 05:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
looking for for their
 
05:23:22.390 --> 05:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
activity um what they may do which is a
 
05:23:24.910 --> 05:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
concern and another reason uh that this
 
05:23:26.910 --> 05:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
legislation has brought forward is they
 
05:23:28.590 --> 05:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
do sell
 
05:23:31.590 --> 05:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
aftermarket uh bags they call them Bast
 
05:23:34.230 --> 05:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
bags where people will fill these bags
 
05:23:35.910 --> 05:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
with water when they're on board their
 
05:23:38.830 --> 05:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
boat creating more wake thus creating
 
05:23:41.110 --> 05:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
excuse me more weight thus creating a
 
05:23:43.948 --> 05:23:43.958 align:start position:0%
larger wake unfortunately what's not
 
05:23:46.948 --> 05:23:46.958 align:start position:0%
considered there is the capacity of that
 
05:23:49.510 --> 05:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
boat to handle that extra weight and
 
05:23:52.150 --> 05:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
that shifting cargo which is obviously
 
05:23:58.150 --> 05:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:02.430 --> 05:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
us thank you restive Dodge
 
05:24:05.670 --> 05:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
sir representative Dodge for a question
 
05:24:07.910 --> 05:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
yes I have a question thank you Mr chair
 
05:24:10.868 --> 05:24:10.878 align:start position:0%
um it's a quick one um about how many
 
05:24:12.990 --> 05:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
actual injuries related to these safety
 
05:24:15.110 --> 05:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
concerns do you see say per year or per
 
05:24:17.628 --> 05:24:17.638 align:start position:0%
season here in New
 
05:24:20.350 --> 05:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh it depends on specifically
 
05:24:22.390 --> 05:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
the activity wake surfing right now
 
05:24:24.230 --> 05:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
we're not seeing that many other than
 
05:24:26.230 --> 05:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
injuries that result from
 
05:24:31.590 --> 05:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
Falls um we have not thankfully had uh
 
05:24:34.590 --> 05:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
routine uh injuries as a result of
 
05:24:38.190 --> 05:24:38.200 align:start position:0%
propellers um we we do see uh you know
 
05:24:40.750 --> 05:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
near drownings and and those types of of
 
05:24:43.750 --> 05:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
activities by tow water sports often and
 
05:24:45.310 --> 05:24:45.320 align:start position:0%
it's those life jackets that that
 
05:24:47.390 --> 05:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
certainly make a difference with those
 
05:24:49.310 --> 05:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
uh but it's more personal injuries as a
 
05:24:51.830 --> 05:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
result of Falls where we see these these
 
05:24:53.868 --> 05:24:53.878 align:start position:0%
our accident numbers uh being related to
 
05:24:53.878 --> 05:24:54.750 align:start position:0%
our accident numbers uh being related to
Toad

05:24:54.750 --> 05:24:54.760 align:start position:0%

05:25:02.990 --> 05:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
you sir I see no further questions thank
 
05:25:08.150 --> 05:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
you uh there no further
 
05:25:11.030 --> 05:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
05:25:14.628 --> 05:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
and thank you thank
 
05:25:18.030 --> 05:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
you now there's no one

closed it I don't know if you wanna who

05:26:33.548 --> 05:26:33.558 align:start position:0%
testimony all right we opening the
 
05:26:36.670 --> 05:26:36.680 align:start position:0%
uh the executive
 
05:26:42.350 --> 05:26:42.360 align:start position:0%

05:26:45.548 --> 05:26:45.558 align:start position:0%
concerns comments by the uh by members

05:26:52.350 --> 05:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
committee yes so just one com I've been
 
05:26:54.548 --> 05:26:54.558 align:start position:0%
water skinned for 40 years and this just
 
05:26:58.030 --> 05:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
makes complete sense to me as a as a
 
05:26:59.510 --> 05:26:59.520 align:start position:0%

representative Smith sir representative
 
05:27:11.948 --> 05:27:11.958 align:start position:0%
Smith yeah Mr chair I was just going to
 
05:27:14.470 --> 05:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
um if if representative post still had
 
05:27:17.190 --> 05:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
questions about the type of boat and
 
05:27:20.270 --> 05:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
engine uh motor uh that Peter mcallum
 
05:27:23.670 --> 05:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
could answer that question that was um
 
05:27:25.310 --> 05:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
why I was trying to get you before you
 
05:27:27.548 --> 05:27:27.558 align:start position:0%
closed the hearing but I didn't make it
 
05:27:29.510 --> 05:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
in time
 
05:27:34.150 --> 05:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
thank answer a specific question I will
 
05:27:37.990 --> 05:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
allow Mr I will allow a question yeah
 
05:27:40.910 --> 05:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
unless unless representative post is all
 
05:27:44.110 --> 05:27:44.120 align:start position:0%
set no I I would appreciate
 
05:27:47.350 --> 05:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
that who's on Mr
 
05:27:49.910 --> 05:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
Mel yes I'd be I'd be happy to make an
 
05:27:51.670 --> 05:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
effort to provide some clarification
 
05:27:51.680 --> 05:27:53.830 align:start position:0%
effort to provide some clarification
about

05:27:53.830 --> 05:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:27:56.590 --> 05:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
propulsion uh representative post you
 
05:27:59.430 --> 05:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:59.440 --> 05:28:01.430 align:start position:0%
 
question

05:28:01.430 --> 05:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:28:04.270 --> 05:28:04.280 align:start position:0%
representative post sorry took me a
 
05:28:07.590 --> 05:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
second um yeah so I wanted to know the
 
05:28:11.030 --> 05:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
difference between the Wake Surfer boat
 
05:28:15.430 --> 05:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
and a uh ski boat that has their
 
05:28:19.110 --> 05:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
propellers underneath the boat because I
 
05:28:21.948 --> 05:28:21.958 align:start position:0%
I don't see the difference between the
 
05:28:25.830 --> 05:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
two in in making the legislation that
 
05:28:28.868 --> 05:28:28.878 align:start position:0%
apply to one rather than the
 
05:28:31.270 --> 05:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
other yeah most certainly it it's a
 
05:28:33.350 --> 05:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
confusing world that I I live in as a
 
05:28:35.708 --> 05:28:35.718 align:start position:0%
myriad of combustion choices and
 
05:28:38.070 --> 05:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
propulsion choices but in an effort to
 
05:28:43.990 --> 05:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
break it down um this this H Bill 115
 
05:28:46.868 --> 05:28:46.878 align:start position:0%
was purely put forward for Wake surer
 
05:28:50.230 --> 05:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
safety uh one element is is obviously
 
05:28:53.510 --> 05:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
the life jacket the PFD but the biggest
 
05:28:58.628 --> 05:28:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:01.990 --> 05:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
element you're testify now I would like
 
05:29:03.948 --> 05:29:03.958 align:start position:0%
you to answer the question what's the
 
05:29:06.948 --> 05:29:06.958 align:start position:0%
difference between wake bolt wake
 
05:29:11.190 --> 05:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
surf wake Sur in other words what answer
 
05:29:13.830 --> 05:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
the question so we can get back into
 
05:29:13.840 --> 05:29:15.990 align:start position:0%
the question so we can get back into
executive

05:29:15.990 --> 05:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
executive
 
05:29:18.830 --> 05:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
session so a boat propulsion type that
 
05:29:21.150 --> 05:29:21.160 align:start position:0%
could be appropriate for wake surfing is
 
05:29:25.150 --> 05:29:25.160 align:start position:0%
specifically an inboard boat a jet Boo
 
05:29:28.628 --> 05:29:28.638 align:start position:0%
or forward-facing Stern Drive propulsion
 
05:29:30.948 --> 05:29:30.958 align:start position:0%
system propulsion system systems that
 
05:29:33.708 --> 05:29:33.718 align:start position:0%
would potentially injure a wake Surfer
 
05:29:36.310 --> 05:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
would be specifically an outboard engine
 
05:29:38.750 --> 05:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
or a stern drive engine non forward
 
05:29:42.150 --> 05:29:42.160 align:start position:0%
facing that's my
 
05:29:44.628 --> 05:29:44.638 align:start position:0%
testimony does that answer your question
 
05:29:47.390 --> 05:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
representative post yes it does thank
 
05:29:49.430 --> 05:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
you very much and thank you um
 
05:29:52.670 --> 05:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you very
 
05:29:56.350 --> 05:29:56.360 align:start position:0%
much all right back to the
 
05:29:58.788 --> 05:29:58.798 align:start position:0%
uh back to the executive session
 
05:30:01.708 --> 05:30:01.718 align:start position:0%
representative Smith you
 
05:30:04.750 --> 05:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
question or
 
05:30:07.030 --> 05:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
concern for the
 
05:30:11.470 --> 05:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
committee okay is you're appearing on

to to
 
05:30:23.390 --> 05:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
comment about the bill before
 
05:30:26.750 --> 05:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
us so I see no other comments no no
 
05:30:29.628 --> 05:30:29.638 align:start position:0%
other comments I'm sorry stand by
 
05:30:32.990 --> 05:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative post representative post
 
05:30:36.070 --> 05:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:41.310 --> 05:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:45.990 --> 05:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
post sorry um I wondered if we could
 
05:30:48.150 --> 05:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
have an amendment to
 
05:30:52.830 --> 05:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
clarify the votes in here um how he
 
05:30:55.270 --> 05:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
talked about it being in board boat jet
 
05:30:57.390 --> 05:30:57.400 align:start position:0%
boat forward
 
05:31:02.350 --> 05:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:07.670 --> 05:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
that have to the executive session to
 
05:31:09.548 --> 05:31:09.558 align:start position:0%
have that Amendment brought in and hear
 
05:31:11.670 --> 05:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
it at aure
 
05:31:16.230 --> 05:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
time so all right uh so you would we ask
 
05:31:20.628 --> 05:31:20.638 align:start position:0%
I'll ask the rest of the uh committee if
 
05:31:26.510 --> 05:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:29.310 --> 05:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
to I just off a minutes I'm sorry Mr
 
05:31:31.548 --> 05:31:31.558 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah
 
05:31:34.110 --> 05:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
representative under item seven no
 
05:31:36.548 --> 05:31:36.558 align:start position:0%
person should operate a motor propelled
 
05:31:39.150 --> 05:31:39.160 align:start position:0%
by an outboard motor inboard outboard
 
05:31:41.830 --> 05:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
motor or water jet while a person is way
 
05:31:45.350 --> 05:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
serving that's I think pretty much what
 
05:31:45.360 --> 05:31:54.110 align:start position:0%
serving that's I think pretty much what
he

05:31:54.110 --> 05:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:56.708 --> 05:31:56.718 align:start position:0%
said we have a representative who wants
 
05:31:59.670 --> 05:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
to bring in will you bring in Amendment
 
05:31:59.680 --> 05:32:06.910 align:start position:0%
to bring in will you bring in Amendment
represent

05:32:06.910 --> 05:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:11.350 --> 05:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
post no I I'll withdraw it okay
 
05:32:13.510 --> 05:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative Smith sir representative
 
05:32:16.628 --> 05:32:16.638 align:start position:0%
Smith well I was just going to uh read
 
05:32:18.628 --> 05:32:18.638 align:start position:0%
what the former representative said
 
05:32:20.910 --> 05:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
about what the rules are about the boat
 
05:32:23.590 --> 05:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
I mean it you shall not operate by an
 
05:32:25.868 --> 05:32:25.878 align:start position:0%
outboard inboard outboard or water jet
 
05:32:27.788 --> 05:32:27.798 align:start position:0%
while a person is wake surfing or in the
 
05:32:30.190 --> 05:32:30.200 align:start position:0%
wake of such a motorboat unless the the
 
05:32:32.110 --> 05:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
propulsion system is specifically
 
05:32:35.110 --> 05:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
designed by the manufacturer for that
 
05:32:37.788 --> 05:32:37.798 align:start position:0%
activity and
 
05:32:40.868 --> 05:32:40.878 align:start position:0%
since and so I mean there is no boat
 
05:32:44.350 --> 05:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
called a wake surfing boat it is a wake
 
05:32:47.670 --> 05:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
boat or a ballast boat or a towboat that
 
05:32:50.350 --> 05:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
carries ballast and it can make the
 
05:32:53.350 --> 05:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
waves for wake surfing and so it I don't
 
05:32:55.030 --> 05:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
know what an amendment would say that's
 
05:32:56.390 --> 05:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
all I was going to say I think this

component in the pursuit of any

recreational activity establish a
 
06:00:00.390 --> 06:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
definition of a wake booat is the first
 
06:00:02.910 --> 06:00:02.920 align:start position:0%
step in an educationally directed
 
06:00:05.590 --> 06:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
program this bill will solidify a
 
06:00:07.868 --> 06:00:07.878 align:start position:0%
Statewide definition and enhance our
 
06:00:09.628 --> 06:00:09.638 align:start position:0%
abilities to educate and inform the
 
06:00:12.070 --> 06:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
general public without a clear and
 
06:00:14.110 --> 06:00:14.120 align:start position:0%
precise definition there could be a
 
06:00:15.910 --> 06:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
great deal of confusion with the voting
 
06:00:18.230 --> 06:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
public and the residents of our
 
06:00:21.110 --> 06:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
state lastly there may be testimony of
 
06:00:23.468 --> 06:00:23.478 align:start position:0%
this definition result in the Banning of
 
06:00:26.430 --> 06:00:26.440 align:start position:0%
or restrictions imposed on Wake boats
 
06:00:30.230 --> 06:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
under RSA 270 col 11 the commissioner of
 
06:00:31.910 --> 06:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
safety appears to be granted the
 
06:00:34.830 --> 06:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
authority to create rules I'm unsure
 
06:00:36.390 --> 06:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
without legal opinion from State
 
06:00:38.788 --> 06:00:38.798 align:start position:0%
authorities if such an authority would
 
06:00:41.430 --> 06:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
apply in this particular case in any
 
06:00:42.990 --> 06:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
event is my understanding that the
 
06:00:44.548 --> 06:00:44.558 align:start position:0%
creation of any rules requir the
 
06:00:46.548 --> 06:00:46.558 align:start position:0%
department of safety to hold public
 
06:00:49.830 --> 06:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
hearings to receive testimony from all
 
06:00:52.270 --> 06:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
concerned or interested parties thank
 
06:00:53.788 --> 06:00:53.798 align:start position:0%
you for your time and consideration
 
06:00:56.430 --> 06:00:56.440 align:start position:0%

06:00:59.788 --> 06:00:59.798 align:start position:0%

06:01:03.070 --> 06:01:03.080 align:start position:0%
questions of the representative from
 
06:01:06.548 --> 06:01:06.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:09.430 --> 06:01:09.440 align:start position:0%

06:01:11.868 --> 06:01:11.878 align:start position:0%
question representative mville
 
06:01:14.590 --> 06:01:14.600 align:start position:0%
representative mville for question thank
 
06:01:16.390 --> 06:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair for the question
 
06:01:18.708 --> 06:01:18.718 align:start position:0%
representative can you please tell me
 
06:01:21.948 --> 06:01:21.958 align:start position:0%
how many types of watercraft are defined
 
06:01:25.868 --> 06:01:25.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:29.750 --> 06:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
RSA to mind again uh possibly Captain
 
06:01:31.750 --> 06:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
Dunley could be better answer that
 
06:01:35.548 --> 06:01:35.558 align:start position:0%
question but I believe uh skcraft have
 
06:01:37.548 --> 06:01:37.558 align:start position:0%
their own little particular section
 
06:01:39.628 --> 06:01:39.638 align:start position:0%
under a uh definition of particular
 
06:01:41.548 --> 06:01:41.558 align:start position:0%
design for those particular type of
 
06:01:43.830 --> 06:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
vessels or
 
06:01:45.910 --> 06:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
crafts thank
 
06:01:48.230 --> 06:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
you there any other questions from
 
06:01:53.310 --> 06:01:53.320 align:start position:0%

chairman representative Suzanne
 
06:02:11.670 --> 06:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair um I'm Suzanne
 
06:02:14.750 --> 06:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
Smith I represent the towns of Plymouth
 
06:02:16.990 --> 06:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
Hein and holderness Newfound Lake and
 
06:02:21.070 --> 06:02:21.080 align:start position:0%
Squam Lake included in those towns and I
 
06:02:23.948 --> 06:02:23.958 align:start position:0%
am the former chair of the commission to
 
06:02:25.628 --> 06:02:25.638 align:start position:0%
study wake
 
06:02:29.670 --> 06:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
boats and I am supporting House Bill
 
06:02:33.150 --> 06:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
229 it is one of the things that we
 
06:02:35.830 --> 06:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
discussed during the commission and to
 
06:02:39.070 --> 06:02:39.080 align:start position:0%
me defining what a wake booat is seemed
 
06:02:41.788 --> 06:02:41.798 align:start position:0%
like a reasonable solution unfortunately
 
06:02:44.070 --> 06:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
all the commission members could not
 
06:02:46.868 --> 06:02:46.878 align:start position:0%
agree on that and so it was not put in
 
06:02:49.548 --> 06:02:49.558 align:start position:0%
as a recommendation of the
 
06:02:51.830 --> 06:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
committee however during the course of
 
06:02:53.430 --> 06:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
the commission I heard them called
 
06:02:56.110 --> 06:02:56.120 align:start position:0%
towboats although wak Surfers do not use
 
06:02:59.150 --> 06:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
a toe rope to enjoy their sport ballast
 
06:03:01.110 --> 06:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
boats because they take on ballast to
 
06:03:03.750 --> 06:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
create the large wakes or should they
 
06:03:06.150 --> 06:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
just be referred to as wake boats and
 
06:03:08.430 --> 06:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
the committee members even vacillated
 
06:03:11.628 --> 06:03:11.638 align:start position:0%
between those three names so I'm asking
 
06:03:16.110 --> 06:03:16.120 align:start position:0%
you to listen to the testimony today and
 
06:03:20.070 --> 06:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
vote hopefully to pass this bill I will
 
06:03:22.510 --> 06:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
say that I have received a lot of emails
 
06:03:25.788 --> 06:03:25.798 align:start position:0%
as you all have and many of
 
06:03:28.030 --> 06:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
them are treated treating this
 
06:03:31.468 --> 06:03:31.478 align:start position:0%
definition bill as a ban on Wake boats a
 
06:03:34.270 --> 06:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
ban on wake surfing and that is
 
06:03:36.150 --> 06:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
certainly not the case and I'll just
 
06:03:38.510 --> 06:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
quote I just received or we just
 
06:03:40.510 --> 06:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
received a letter from the Squam Lakes
 
06:03:42.510 --> 06:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
Association and they're supporting the
 
06:03:45.030 --> 06:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
bill and they see it as an effort to
 
06:03:46.990 --> 06:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
clearly Define wake boats and this
 
06:03:48.910 --> 06:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
improved definition will allow
 
06:03:51.230 --> 06:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to have a more refined
 
06:03:53.708 --> 06:03:53.718 align:start position:0%
conversation about the use regulation
 
06:03:55.468 --> 06:03:55.478 align:start position:0%
and management of wake boats in New
 
06:03:57.390 --> 06:03:57.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I couldn't have said
 
06:03:59.830 --> 06:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
better and I thank you I will not see
 
06:04:03.270 --> 06:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:07.150 --> 06:04:07.160 align:start position:0%
time any questions from members of the
 
06:04:10.990 --> 06:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
committee I have one question stand
 
06:04:14.030 --> 06:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
by representative Connors representative
 
06:04:16.868 --> 06:04:16.878 align:start position:0%
Connors for a question thank you Mr
 
06:04:18.990 --> 06:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
chairman representative Smith I received
 
06:04:21.510 --> 06:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of emails as well and if you could
 
06:04:24.030 --> 06:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
just clarify for me is a typical
 
06:04:26.070 --> 06:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
motorboat with an outboard engine that
 
06:04:28.510 --> 06:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
pulls water skar is that considered a
 
06:04:30.190 --> 06:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
wake booat under this
 
06:04:32.510 --> 06:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
definition no thank you for your
 
06:04:34.830 --> 06:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
question and no that is not the case
 
06:04:37.590 --> 06:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
although during the course of my years
 
06:04:39.830 --> 06:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
as a legislator where people call and
 
06:04:42.030 --> 06:04:42.040 align:start position:0%
complain about problems I've heard from
 
06:04:44.868 --> 06:04:44.878 align:start position:0%
a lot of people about waves on their
 
06:04:47.190 --> 06:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
lakes and I have no idea if they're
 
06:04:49.948 --> 06:04:49.958 align:start position:0%
talking about a wake booat or just a
 
06:04:53.030 --> 06:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
boat that's doing uh pulling a tuber
 
06:04:55.670 --> 06:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
around in their neighborhood so I think
 
06:04:57.830 --> 06:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
for that's one reason to Define this so
 
06:05:00.948 --> 06:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
I can people can learn the
 
06:05:03.510 --> 06:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
difference thank you very much and
 
06:05:06.628 --> 06:05:06.638 align:start position:0%
representative gold representa go for a
 
06:05:08.990 --> 06:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you for taking my
 
06:05:13.628 --> 06:05:13.638 align:start position:0%
question um what was the uh ratio of
 
06:05:17.548 --> 06:05:17.558 align:start position:0%
people in favor of this uh explanation
 
06:05:20.868 --> 06:05:20.878 align:start position:0%
on the commission versus i' say it was
 
06:05:24.190 --> 06:05:24.200 align:start position:0%
5050 okay thank you it was a very evenly
 
06:05:24.200 --> 06:05:25.548 align:start position:0%
5050 okay thank you it was a very evenly

06:05:30.190 --> 06:05:30.200 align:start position:0%

06:05:44.628 --> 06:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
definition to be
 
06:05:49.190 --> 06:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
ambiguous um or ambiguous sorry
 
06:05:54.350 --> 06:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
um that last bill we did 229 which had
 
06:05:57.548 --> 06:05:57.558 align:start position:0%
um the definition at the bottom if I can
 
06:06:00.350 --> 06:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
find it I stuck it somewhere
 
06:06:02.468 --> 06:06:02.478 align:start position:0%
um no that was
 
06:06:05.430 --> 06:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
115 where um it
 
06:06:07.628 --> 06:06:07.638 align:start position:0%
indicated um motorboat propelled by an
 
06:06:09.708 --> 06:06:09.718 align:start position:0%
outboard motor INB because there are
 
06:06:14.030 --> 06:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
these boats that skiers um ski on where
 
06:06:16.468 --> 06:06:16.478 align:start position:0%
like professional skiers people who ski
 
06:06:20.788 --> 06:06:20.798 align:start position:0%
a lot um in competition where that um
 
06:06:24.390 --> 06:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
propeller is underneath and I believe
 
06:06:28.430 --> 06:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
that would fall into the same Cate atory
 
06:06:30.910 --> 06:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
as and and I think we talked about that
 
06:06:33.948 --> 06:06:33.958 align:start position:0%
before so I would like to see the
 
06:06:36.910 --> 06:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
definition include so people can
 
06:06:39.548 --> 06:06:39.558 align:start position:0%
understand because I think this is very
 
06:06:44.628 --> 06:06:44.638 align:start position:0%
vague um that we add number seven
 
06:06:49.708 --> 06:06:49.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:49.718 --> 06:06:51.628 align:start position:0%
 
this

06:06:51.628 --> 06:06:51.638 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:06:55.910 --> 06:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank question comment um I did not
 
06:06:58.350 --> 06:06:58.360 align:start position:0%
write this bill I am a co-sponsor I was
 
06:07:01.270 --> 06:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
not the prime mover and Shaker behind it
 
06:07:04.190 --> 06:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
but the definition the you could have
 
06:07:06.510 --> 06:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
you could ski behind a wake booat but if
 
06:07:08.750 --> 06:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
you were skiing behind a wake booat you
 
06:07:11.350 --> 06:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
would not be putting ballast in the bags
 
06:07:13.110 --> 06:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
you would leave them empty because with
 
06:07:15.430 --> 06:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
your water skiing you do not want to
 
06:07:18.830 --> 06:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
have a lot of weight so you know so
 
06:07:22.110 --> 06:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
that's why they specify here that it is
 
06:07:24.390 --> 06:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
a boat equipped with ballast tanks bags
 
06:07:26.430 --> 06:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
compartments containers designed to
 
06:07:29.110 --> 06:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
alter the the Wake so if you were water
 
06:07:30.990 --> 06:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
skiing I mean a water ski boat water
 
06:07:33.030 --> 06:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
skiers do not want to have wake so
 
06:07:35.750 --> 06:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
regardless of what type of boat it is
 
06:07:38.030 --> 06:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
it's it they don't use ballast bags on
 
06:07:40.350 --> 06:07:40.360 align:start position:0%
ski boats although you could take a wake
 
06:07:43.430 --> 06:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
booat and use it for water skiing by not
 
06:07:46.150 --> 06:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
filling the ballast bags but it wouldn't
 
06:07:49.350 --> 06:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
affect what kind of a motor it had and
 
06:07:51.670 --> 06:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
there may be people can address that
 
06:07:55.070 --> 06:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
more clearly but that's when I am
 
06:08:01.070 --> 06:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:04.830 --> 06:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
goal repr May Bill
 
06:08:07.350 --> 06:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
sir representative Mayville for a
 
06:08:09.510 --> 06:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair to
 
06:08:11.868 --> 06:08:11.878 align:start position:0%
representative Smith did the commission
 
06:08:15.830 --> 06:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
discuss the um for lack of a better word
 
06:08:18.230 --> 06:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
the surf bums forums and their
 
06:08:22.070 --> 06:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
modification of inboard boats to adjust
 
06:08:25.468 --> 06:08:25.478 align:start position:0%
with um uh modified lead weights and
 
06:08:27.708 --> 06:08:27.718 align:start position:0%
increased people on the boat to throw
 
06:08:30.868 --> 06:08:30.878 align:start position:0%
the exact same wave as a ballast
 
06:08:34.070 --> 06:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
boat we thank you for your question we
 
06:08:37.230 --> 06:08:37.240 align:start position:0%
did have some discussion of that and
 
06:08:39.070 --> 06:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
there was discussion about how to
 
06:08:44.548 --> 06:08:44.558 align:start position:0%
address it in legislation and mostly
 
06:08:46.830 --> 06:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
because of having to miss meetings
 
06:08:48.350 --> 06:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
because of covid and hitting our
 
06:08:51.548 --> 06:08:51.558 align:start position:0%
deadline of June 30th we did not pursue
 
06:08:53.910 --> 06:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
that but also we couldn't come to a
 
06:08:53.920 --> 06:08:55.548 align:start position:0%
that but also we couldn't come to a
clear

06:08:55.548 --> 06:08:55.558 align:start position:0%
clear
 
06:08:58.510 --> 06:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
solution but we were we there was talk
 
06:08:58.520 --> 06:08:59.510 align:start position:0%
solution but we were we there was talk
of

06:08:59.510 --> 06:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:09:03.270 --> 06:09:03.280 align:start position:0%
banning or you know of of I don't want
 
06:09:05.830 --> 06:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
to say Banning but regulating um
 
06:09:09.830 --> 06:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
aftermarket ballast bags or five gallon
 
06:09:11.708 --> 06:09:11.718 align:start position:0%
buckets filled with water that can roll
 
06:09:13.390 --> 06:09:13.400 align:start position:0%
around and hurt people in the back of
 
06:09:15.350 --> 06:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
the boat there was we did have
 
06:09:17.270 --> 06:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
discussions on
 
06:09:19.948 --> 06:09:19.958 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
06:09:24.110 --> 06:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
you question chair I do have a
 
06:09:24.120 --> 06:09:25.708 align:start position:0%
you question chair I do have a
question

06:09:25.708 --> 06:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:09:28.750 --> 06:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you for clarifying but I
 
06:09:31.468 --> 06:09:31.478 align:start position:0%
I have to ask one question because
 
06:09:34.670 --> 06:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
it the question before was if you had
 
06:09:36.868 --> 06:09:36.878 align:start position:0%
for example an outboard
 
06:09:40.070 --> 06:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
boat uh you could make that a Ballance
 
06:09:42.548 --> 06:09:42.558 align:start position:0%
boat or Not by simply adding or taking
 
06:09:45.430 --> 06:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
away bags or the other things so really
 
06:09:47.190 --> 06:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
the weight boat is a
 
06:09:50.350 --> 06:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
configuration not a specific boat is
 
06:09:53.030 --> 06:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
that is that the way you read this no
 
06:09:56.030 --> 06:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
that is not the way I sorry but um no
 
06:09:58.050 --> 06:09:58.060 align:start position:0%
that is not the way I read it
 
06:09:58.060 --> 06:10:00.150 align:start position:0%
that is not the way I read it
[Music]

06:10:00.150 --> 06:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:10:03.270 --> 06:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
um because this just says it's a boat
 
06:10:06.310 --> 06:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
equipped with the ballast tanks and bags
 
06:10:09.190 --> 06:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
um I don't it's not my bill I mean I'm
 
06:10:11.510 --> 06:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
the I'm co-sponsoring the idea of
 
06:10:13.708 --> 06:10:13.718 align:start position:0%
defining wake boats but I did not write
 
06:10:16.070 --> 06:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
this bill so I can't comment any further
 
06:10:18.670 --> 06:10:18.680 align:start position:0%

meaningful and productive
 
06:12:21.670 --> 06:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
Endeavor the commission received
 
06:12:23.628 --> 06:12:23.638 align:start position:0%
numerous presentations and developed a
 
06:12:26.430 --> 06:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
21-page final report which might be
 
06:12:28.390 --> 06:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
terrifically helpful in answering some
 
06:12:31.468 --> 06:12:31.478 align:start position:0%
questions on how to speak to Bast boats
 
06:12:33.468 --> 06:12:33.478 align:start position:0%
versus Wake
 
06:12:36.830 --> 06:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
boats uh HB 137 wake boolt commission
 
06:12:39.110 --> 06:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
did not recommend defining wake bolts in
 
06:12:41.430 --> 06:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
statute it has since been made clear
 
06:12:43.708 --> 06:12:43.718 align:start position:0%
through in-person meetings reading
 
06:12:45.430 --> 06:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
written comments from supporters of
 
06:12:48.150 --> 06:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
defining the craft and past experience
 
06:12:50.750 --> 06:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
involving other type crafts that this is
 
06:12:53.510 --> 06:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
the first step in an agenda to ban and
 
06:12:55.628 --> 06:12:55.638 align:start position:0%
or restrict the use of wake bools in New
 
06:12:55.638 --> 06:12:57.430 align:start position:0%

06:13:00.788 --> 06:13:00.798 align:start position:0%
the passage of HB 229 would devastate

directly about our
 
06:13:11.548 --> 06:13:11.558 align:start position:0%
economy recent data composed by our
 
06:13:13.430 --> 06:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
industry states that recreational

more recreational boating is a true

Family Affair and wake boats continue to
 
06:13:52.670 --> 06:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
lead the industry in growth because of
 
06:13:54.750 --> 06:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
their popularity and
 
06:13:57.670 --> 06:13:57.680 align:start position:0%

connect multiple generations of families
 
06:14:02.030 --> 06:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
and friends than a day boating on the

lake and during the most recent pandemic
 
06:14:07.468 --> 06:14:07.478 align:start position:0%
voting was particularly popular it's
 
06:14:09.390 --> 06:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
been said that voting saved the summer
 
06:14:11.548 --> 06:14:11.558 align:start position:0%
for many people in New Hampshire this
 
06:14:11.558 --> 06:14:12.948 align:start position:0%

past
 
06:14:17.070 --> 06:14:17.080 align:start position:0%
year let's talk briefly about AIS
 
06:14:18.590 --> 06:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
because you'll hear a lot about this
 
06:14:21.510 --> 06:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
topic this afternoon aquatic invasive
 
06:14:24.548 --> 06:14:24.558 align:start position:0%

waterways as any Marina operator will
 
06:14:33.948 --> 06:14:33.958 align:start position:0%
tell you our businesses rely on healthy
 
06:14:36.708 --> 06:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
lakes and keeping Lakes clean is
 
06:14:39.110 --> 06:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
critical to a strong boating
 
06:14:41.868 --> 06:14:41.878 align:start position:0%
economy we learned through the study in
 
06:14:45.910 --> 06:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
commission uh of HP 137 the truth about
 
06:14:49.750 --> 06:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
boats all boats get wet we learned that
 
06:14:52.868 --> 06:14:52.878 align:start position:0%
the droplets of water can contain
 
06:14:54.910 --> 06:14:54.920 align:start position:0%

Paramount a decal program that requires
 
06:15:18.510 --> 06:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
outof State voters to purchase an AIS
 
06:15:21.708 --> 06:15:21.718 align:start position:0%
decal is a new prog program that's not
 
06:15:24.110 --> 06:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
been implemented due to the pandemic we
 
06:15:26.230 --> 06:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
need to allow time for these important
 
06:15:27.830 --> 06:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
new laws to
 
06:15:30.270 --> 06:15:30.280 align:start position:0%
work we also learned in the commission
 
06:15:31.868 --> 06:15:31.878 align:start position:0%
through data provided by the New
 
06:15:34.350 --> 06:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lakes lak host program that
 
06:15:37.468 --> 06:15:37.478 align:start position:0%
less than 5% of wake Vats are
 
06:15:39.990 --> 06:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
transient even at this minimal risk
 
06:15:42.948 --> 06:15:42.958 align:start position:0%
concerns about ballast and AIS are real
 
06:15:44.948 --> 06:15:44.958 align:start position:0%
and manufacturers are currently testing
 
06:15:47.670 --> 06:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
new systems to improve the technology to
 
06:15:50.548 --> 06:15:50.558 align:start position:0%
further lower the risk of AIS and both
 
06:15:54.350 --> 06:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
new built and used field
 
06:15:56.868 --> 06:15:56.878 align:start position:0%
boats I'd like to quickly speak to
 
06:15:58.830 --> 06:15:58.840 align:start position:0%
education rather than supporting
 
06:16:00.708 --> 06:16:00.718 align:start position:0%
government laws that lead to restriction
 
06:16:03.788 --> 06:16:03.798 align:start position:0%
of use New Hampshire Marine trades along
 
06:16:05.190 --> 06:16:05.200 align:start position:0%
with our partnership with New Hampshire
 
06:16:07.670 --> 06:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol have embarked on an effort
 
06:16:09.868 --> 06:16:09.878 align:start position:0%
to better educate water sports families
 
06:16:11.190 --> 06:16:11.200 align:start position:0%
on best
 
06:16:14.270 --> 06:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
practices this new initiative is called
 
06:16:17.070 --> 06:16:17.080 align:start position:0%
the Wake responsibly campaign it was
 
06:16:19.190 --> 06:16:19.200 align:start position:0%
started toward the end of the 2020
 
06:16:21.590 --> 06:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
voting season and is focused on
 
06:16:24.468 --> 06:16:24.478 align:start position:0%
promoting that wake boats remain 200
 
06:16:26.830 --> 06:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
feet away from Shore and object
 
06:16:29.310 --> 06:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
keeping music at reasonable levels and
 
06:16:31.590 --> 06:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
minimizing repetitive passes in the same
 
06:16:34.990 --> 06:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
area of a water body We Believe focusing
 
06:16:37.230 --> 06:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
on the boat operator should be the pro
 
06:16:39.750 --> 06:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
approach not focusing on the boat or
 
06:16:42.110 --> 06:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
product we intend to ramp up this
 
06:16:44.590 --> 06:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
educational campaign immediately in the
 
06:16:47.030 --> 06:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
spring in conclusion I believe that the
 
06:16:49.190 --> 06:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
efforts to Define and restrict a large
 
06:16:50.708 --> 06:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
number of Voters on New Hampshire
 
06:16:53.150 --> 06:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
waterways is the wrong message for a
 
06:16:55.548 --> 06:16:55.558 align:start position:0%
state that boasts such a strong outdoor
 
06:16:55.558 --> 06:16:57.310 align:start position:0%
state that boasts such a strong outdoor
economy

06:16:57.310 --> 06:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
economy
 
06:16:59.070 --> 06:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
education and enforcement of current
 
06:17:01.230 --> 06:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
laws are the key not bans and
 
06:17:04.030 --> 06:17:04.040 align:start position:0%
restrictions my business industry and
 
06:17:06.070 --> 06:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
Association stands ready to work with
 
06:17:08.910 --> 06:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
all stakeholder holders to resolve these
 
06:17:11.230 --> 06:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
conflicts I respectfully urge this

question stand
 
06:17:48.070 --> 06:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
by Kelly representative Kelly
 
06:17:51.390 --> 06:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly for a question Mr M

licensing fee
 
06:18:07.030 --> 06:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
to uh to pay for greater enforcement for
 
06:18:11.948 --> 06:18:11.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:14.628 --> 06:18:14.638 align:start position:0%
officers added Revenue Al always will
 
06:18:16.590 --> 06:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
assist with a problem and there's no
 
06:18:17.948 --> 06:18:17.958 align:start position:0%
question that New Hampshire Marine
 
06:18:20.628 --> 06:18:20.638 align:start position:0%
Patrol suffers Staffing so I would I
 
06:18:22.510 --> 06:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
would say that uh if that was one way to
 
06:18:24.910 --> 06:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
gain revenue our group would be in
 
06:18:24.920 --> 06:18:26.990 align:start position:0%

you representative gusy question thank
 
06:18:44.750 --> 06:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh Mr mcallum you had
 
06:18:47.310 --> 06:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned the uh equatic invasive
 
06:18:51.628 --> 06:18:51.638 align:start position:0%
species can you give us any additional
 
06:18:53.468 --> 06:18:53.478 align:start position:0%
information as far as are the boat
 
06:18:56.670 --> 06:18:56.680 align:start position:0%
Builders are they doing anything to to
 
06:18:58.948 --> 06:18:58.958 align:start position:0%
combat that specific
 
06:19:02.510 --> 06:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
issue uh and if so could you if they are
 
06:19:04.030 --> 06:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
could you explain as to what they're
 
06:19:07.070 --> 06:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
looking at and how that will impact the
 
06:19:09.110 --> 06:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
these boats on our
 
06:19:11.670 --> 06:19:11.680 align:start position:0%
waterways sure so for the remaining
 
06:19:14.468 --> 06:19:14.478 align:start position:0%
five% of the Wake fols that travel from
 
06:19:16.990 --> 06:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
Lake to Lake in the state the industry
 
06:19:19.670 --> 06:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
speaks directly to that uh they they are
 
06:19:22.468 --> 06:19:22.478 align:start position:0%
developing uh patented technology that
 
06:19:24.390 --> 06:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
could involve a number of mediums to
 
06:19:26.830 --> 06:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
cure uh number one is increased
 
06:19:29.110 --> 06:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
filtration as water is brought into the
 
06:19:31.468 --> 06:19:31.478 align:start position:0%
ballast tank it has a higher level of
 
06:19:34.430 --> 06:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
filtration to keep uh aquatic invasive
 
06:19:38.548 --> 06:19:38.558 align:start position:0%
species out uh there's a technology that
 
06:19:41.110 --> 06:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
involves heat and there's technology
 
06:19:44.030 --> 06:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
that involves ultr light uh treatments
 
06:19:46.990 --> 06:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
as well as uh mild bleaching Solutions
 
06:19:49.030 --> 06:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
so there there's a number of uh
 
06:19:50.628 --> 06:19:50.638 align:start position:0%
solutions that are on the table
 
06:19:50.638 --> 06:19:51.868 align:start position:0%
solutions that are on the table
representative

06:19:51.868 --> 06:19:51.878 align:start position:0%

thank you Tom O'Brien I'm the president
 
06:20:42.910 --> 06:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire Lakes we're a Statewide
 
06:20:45.548 --> 06:20:45.558 align:start position:0%
membership organization working to
 
06:20:47.910 --> 06:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
ensure the long-term health of our
 
06:20:51.070 --> 06:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
Lakes our members of course are almost
 
06:20:53.150 --> 06:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
all Boat Owners many of whom are
 
06:20:56.310 --> 06:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
lakefront property owners but not all
 
06:20:59.310 --> 06:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
uh and we think that wake booting as a
 
06:21:02.468 --> 06:21:02.478 align:start position:0%
as a sport as a as an activity is
 
06:21:05.110 --> 06:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
everything that it has been described by
 
06:21:05.120 --> 06:21:05.948 align:start position:0%
everything that it has been described by
Mr

06:21:05.948 --> 06:21:05.958 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
06:21:09.628 --> 06:21:09.638 align:start position:0%
mallum uh popular to those who do it uh
 
06:21:11.350 --> 06:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
and certainly important from an economic
 
06:21:13.070 --> 06:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
standpoint so New Hampshire Lakes is not
 
06:21:17.110 --> 06:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
seeking to ban wake boating or uh
 
06:21:20.830 --> 06:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
anything of the like we are strongly in
 
06:21:22.070 --> 06:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
support of this
 
06:21:24.548 --> 06:21:24.558 align:start position:0%
bill wake boats when they're operated in
 
06:21:26.270 --> 06:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
a certain way and please understand that
 
06:21:30.030 --> 06:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
the whole ballast design um and this
 
06:21:32.510 --> 06:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
definition by the way as was was was
 
06:21:35.868 --> 06:21:35.878 align:start position:0%
described by representative McDonald
 
06:21:39.590 --> 06:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
this is a definition that that voting
 
06:21:41.830 --> 06:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
law administrators Marine Patrol
 
06:21:44.030 --> 06:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
agencies across the country have worked
 
06:21:48.430 --> 06:21:48.440 align:start position:0%
long and hard to come up with so I i' i'
 
06:21:51.548 --> 06:21:51.558 align:start position:0%
respectfully suggest not modifying that
 
06:21:54.310 --> 06:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
definition um they bring years and years
 
06:21:56.788 --> 06:21:56.798 align:start position:0%
of experience to this so the idea here
 
06:21:59.910 --> 06:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
is that specific boats designed in the
 
06:22:03.590 --> 06:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
way that this is these described in this
 
06:22:06.430 --> 06:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
legislation create the largest wave
 
06:22:08.910 --> 06:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
possible it's a much larger wave than
 
06:22:10.990 --> 06:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
it's normally used for other toe sports
 
06:22:11.000 --> 06:22:12.510 align:start position:0%
it's normally used for other toe sports
like

06:22:12.510 --> 06:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
like
 
06:22:15.628 --> 06:22:15.638 align:start position:0%
watering it also has a Stern because of
 
06:22:18.030 --> 06:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
the ballast that is lower in the water
 
06:22:19.468 --> 06:22:19.478 align:start position:0%
and so there's a different activity
 
06:22:21.070 --> 06:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
going on
 
06:22:23.830 --> 06:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
underneath so in addition to the spread
 
06:22:25.830 --> 06:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
or the Potential Threat to the spreading
 
06:22:28.350 --> 06:22:28.360 align:start position:0%
of aquatic invasive species when these
 
06:22:30.708 --> 06:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
boats are operated uh as they're
 
06:22:33.070 --> 06:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
designed for creating these larger than
 
06:22:35.708 --> 06:22:35.718 align:start position:0%
normal waves they these waves are
 
06:22:37.788 --> 06:22:37.798 align:start position:0%
pounding the shorelines we have people
 
06:22:40.548 --> 06:22:40.558 align:start position:0%
who whose boats and and Moorings and
 
06:22:42.310 --> 06:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
Hardware are literally getting snapped
 
06:22:44.510 --> 06:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
off people who can't sit out on their
 
06:22:46.430 --> 06:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
docks and floats because of the Waves
 
06:22:49.430 --> 06:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
washing over them uh we're concerned
 
06:22:51.948 --> 06:22:51.958 align:start position:0%
about shoreline erosion and when they're
 
06:22:54.708 --> 06:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
operated in Shallow Waters with the
 
06:22:56.948 --> 06:22:56.958 align:start position:0%
sediment that gets turned up from the
 
06:22:59.310 --> 06:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
lake bottom and the release of nutrients
 
06:23:02.350 --> 06:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
from that Lake Bottom sediment is what
 
06:23:04.788 --> 06:23:04.798 align:start position:0%
contributes to algo blooms and cyano
 
06:23:04.798 --> 06:23:06.030 align:start position:0%
contributes to algo blooms and cyano
bacteria

06:23:06.030 --> 06:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
bacteria
 
06:23:07.910 --> 06:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
outbreaks when we're talking about
 
06:23:10.590 --> 06:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
economics I can tell you that when
 
06:23:13.350 --> 06:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
Winter Harbor up in wolfboro had a cyano
 
06:23:16.910 --> 06:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
bacteria outbreak about two years ago
 
06:23:18.468 --> 06:23:18.478 align:start position:0%
our phone started ringing when people
 
06:23:20.468 --> 06:23:20.478 align:start position:0%
said am I going to be able to rent my
 
06:23:22.788 --> 06:23:22.798 align:start position:0%
place for the month of July or whatever
 
06:23:25.830 --> 06:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
the case might be uh and tell my tenants
 
06:23:28.430 --> 06:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
that they can safely go into Lake wiip
 
06:23:30.868 --> 06:23:30.878 align:start position:0%
pasak uh we couldn't of course tell them
 
06:23:34.750 --> 06:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
that so we're we're not trying to ban a
 
06:23:37.310 --> 06:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
sport we're not trying to ban a boat
 
06:23:39.030 --> 06:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
we're saying that these boats need to be
 
06:23:41.590 --> 06:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
operated in such a fashion and not might
 
06:23:43.390 --> 06:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
be a certain distance from Shore and
 
06:23:44.948 --> 06:23:44.958 align:start position:0%
frankly there are lakes in New Hampshire
 
06:23:47.030 --> 06:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
that are working this out as Squam Lakes
 
06:23:49.590 --> 06:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
alluded to there are some Lakes whose
 
06:23:52.230 --> 06:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
associations have significant capacity
 
06:23:54.390 --> 06:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
and they can engage in these Community
 
06:23:54.400 --> 06:23:56.070 align:start position:0%
and they can engage in these Community
conversations

06:23:56.070 --> 06:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
06:23:58.190 --> 06:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
around the appropriate place for these
 
06:23:59.948 --> 06:23:59.958 align:start position:0%
boats to operate so that they're far
 
06:24:02.310 --> 06:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
enough from Shore they're in deep enough
 
06:24:05.510 --> 06:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
water uh and it works so but in order to
 
06:24:08.390 --> 06:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
do that we do have to Define them uh the
 
06:24:10.390 --> 06:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
the reality is is that the industry has
 
06:24:12.430 --> 06:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
pushed back so hard on even this
 
06:24:14.750 --> 06:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
Prospect of defining him that the
 
06:24:17.150 --> 06:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
conversation is constantly muddled all
 
06:24:20.750 --> 06:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
boats cause wakes all boats cause waves
 
06:24:22.708 --> 06:24:22.718 align:start position:0%
it's all water skiing and that simply
 
06:24:25.468 --> 06:24:25.478 align:start position:0%
isn't you know isn't the case here we're
 
06:24:27.590 --> 06:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
talking about a distinct type of boat
 
06:24:29.990 --> 06:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
designed to create the largest wave
 
06:24:32.270 --> 06:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
possible and as a result of that when
 
06:24:34.590 --> 06:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
they're operated in certain places and
 
06:24:36.830 --> 06:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
in certain ways they're having very
 
06:24:38.990 --> 06:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
definite impacts both on Lake water
 
06:24:41.868 --> 06:24:41.878 align:start position:0%
quality and the safety of other boers
 
06:24:43.910 --> 06:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
and swimmers so we're just looking for a
 
06:24:46.708 --> 06:24:46.718 align:start position:0%
reasonable path uh towards a a
 
06:24:48.990 --> 06:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
management approach a management
 
06:24:51.390 --> 06:24:51.400 align:start position:0%
approach that will include education and
 
06:24:54.468 --> 06:24:54.478 align:start position:0%
it may uh involve specific setbacks or
 
06:24:56.030 --> 06:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
water depths
 
06:24:58.150 --> 06:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
and it's doable we're not proposing any
 
06:25:00.270 --> 06:25:00.280 align:start position:0%
of that here today we're simply
 
06:25:02.868 --> 06:25:02.878 align:start position:0%
suggesting that it needs to begin with a
 
06:25:05.350 --> 06:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
definition of these craft a definition
 
06:25:08.590 --> 06:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
that has been developed by a nationwide
 
06:25:12.070 --> 06:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
agency uh task with this work uh and I
 
06:25:13.390 --> 06:25:13.400 align:start position:0%
can tell you that there are there are a
 
06:25:15.430 --> 06:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
dozen or more states that we're in
 
06:25:17.510 --> 06:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
contact with that are wrestling with
 
06:25:19.110 --> 06:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
this very same thing because these
 
06:25:21.270 --> 06:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
impacts are being felt throughout the
 
06:25:24.670 --> 06:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
lakes of of of the country I'm happy to
 
06:25:25.990 --> 06:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
take any questions question that you may
 
06:25:27.868 --> 06:25:27.878 align:start position:0%
have thank
 
06:25:33.270 --> 06:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:35.788 --> 06:25:35.798 align:start position:0%
O'Brien sir I see no questions you see
 
06:25:38.150 --> 06:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
no questions thank you very much for
 
06:25:38.160 --> 06:25:39.070 align:start position:0%

represent uh it's
 
06:26:21.910 --> 06:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
slowly uh turn on your video if you've
 
06:26:25.510 --> 06:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
got it uh and give me the time how much
 
06:26:29.868 --> 06:26:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:29.878 --> 06:26:32.830 align:start position:0%
 
half

06:26:32.830 --> 06:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
half
 
06:26:35.430 --> 06:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
so the floor is
 
06:26:38.350 --> 06:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
yours thank you I'm John Wall-E from
 
06:26:39.948 --> 06:26:39.958 align:start position:0%
Gilford New Hampshire I'm the general
 
06:26:41.948 --> 06:26:41.958 align:start position:0%
manager of silver SS Marina I was a
 
06:26:44.230 --> 06:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
member of the House Bill 137 wake boo
 
06:26:46.548 --> 06:26:46.558 align:start position:0%
study commission and I'm also the vice
 
06:26:47.868 --> 06:26:47.878 align:start position:0%
president of the Hampshire Marines
 
06:26:50.030 --> 06:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
trades Association thank you for
 
06:26:51.430 --> 06:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
allowing me to talk Mr chairman and
 
06:26:53.948 --> 06:26:53.958 align:start position:0%
members of the house I'm here to oppose
 
06:26:55.948 --> 06:26:55.958 align:start position:0%
House Bill 229
 
06:26:57.868 --> 06:26:57.878 align:start position:0%
um just from conversation just hearing
 
06:26:59.830 --> 06:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
this now um I like to point out that
 
06:27:02.708 --> 06:27:02.718 align:start position:0%
wake boats towboats our goal is not to
 
06:27:04.788 --> 06:27:04.798 align:start position:0%
make the largest wake possible our boats
 
06:27:07.030 --> 06:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
are versatile where you can water ski
 
06:27:10.230 --> 06:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
tube wake board wake surf do a multiple
 
06:27:12.468 --> 06:27:12.478 align:start position:0%
different things of family activities it
 
06:27:15.310 --> 06:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
is not the goal to create waves to rock
 
06:27:17.910 --> 06:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
the shoreline erode the shoreline it is
 
06:27:20.868 --> 06:27:20.878 align:start position:0%
our goal to allow people to recreate
 
06:27:23.628 --> 06:27:23.638 align:start position:0%
safely and do activities that they s of
 
06:27:27.350 --> 06:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
choose um H spill 229 includes the term
 
06:27:29.868 --> 06:27:29.878 align:start position:0%
ballast and if you don't know ballast is
 
06:27:32.510 --> 06:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
a form of weight and the ballast can do
 
06:27:34.230 --> 06:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
multiple different things it can improve
 
06:27:36.270 --> 06:27:36.280 align:start position:0%
the performance of a boat it can improve
 
06:27:38.190 --> 06:27:38.200 align:start position:0%
the ride of a boat it can improve the
 
06:27:40.150 --> 06:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
stability of a boat and it can also
 
06:27:42.990 --> 06:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
manipulate the characteristics of awake
 
06:27:46.590 --> 06:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
Bast is seen as steel weights concrete
 
06:27:49.230 --> 06:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
lead and water and these systems can be
 
06:27:50.510 --> 06:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
installed from the factory by
 
06:27:51.990 --> 06:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturers or purchased in
 
06:27:55.030 --> 06:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
aftermarket stores and online retailers
 
06:27:56.350 --> 06:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
it's important to point out though that
 
06:27:59.910 --> 06:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
ballast is also people and Fuel and
 
06:28:02.510 --> 06:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
boers can ask their passengers to sit on
 
06:28:04.628 --> 06:28:04.638 align:start position:0%
one side of a boat or better to improve
 
06:28:08.310 --> 06:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
the ride or change this the shape of a
 
06:28:11.468 --> 06:28:11.478 align:start position:0%
wake even coolers can be used as a form
 
06:28:14.070 --> 06:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
of Bast and it's also important to point
 
06:28:16.310 --> 06:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
out that in this bill it this talk of
 
06:28:18.590 --> 06:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
underwater equipment and this was
 
06:28:21.590 --> 06:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
installed as early as the mid 1990s and
 
06:28:23.468 --> 06:28:23.478 align:start position:0%
this characteristics will shape and
 
06:28:26.230 --> 06:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
alter wakes both to to increase and
 
06:28:28.990 --> 06:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
decrease the size of wakes on inboard
 
06:28:32.310 --> 06:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
skib boats thus adding confusion to the
 
06:28:34.708 --> 06:28:34.718 align:start position:0%
proposed wake boat
 
06:28:37.190 --> 06:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
definition my father Mike Wally was a
 
06:28:38.548 --> 06:28:38.558 align:start position:0%
member of the New Hampshire house
 
06:28:40.190 --> 06:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
actually a member of this committee
 
06:28:42.150 --> 06:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
before serving as the deputy speaker of
 
06:28:44.510 --> 06:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
the house he was a businessman we ran a
 
06:28:45.948 --> 06:28:45.958 align:start position:0%
power sports dealership that sold
 
06:28:48.628 --> 06:28:48.638 align:start position:0%
motorcycles cobs and jet skis in the
 
06:28:51.948 --> 06:28:51.958 align:start position:0%
late 1980s there was a law defined to
 
06:28:54.708 --> 06:28:54.718 align:start position:0%
Define jet skis as ski craft once that
 
06:28:58.230 --> 06:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
law was proven and made to a law it
 
06:28:58.240 --> 06:28:59.510 align:start position:0%
law was proven and made to a law it
banned

06:28:59.510 --> 06:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
banned
 
06:29:02.150 --> 06:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
40% of ski Craft on New Hampshire's
 
06:29:04.990 --> 06:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
navigable Waters in by Statute and by
 
06:29:08.150 --> 06:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
petition consumer driven Market changes
 
06:29:10.468 --> 06:29:10.478 align:start position:0%
to these watercraft allowed them that to
 
06:29:13.430 --> 06:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
broaden the law in doing so renewed
 
06:29:16.190 --> 06:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
efforts to try and ban these jet skis
 
06:29:18.708 --> 06:29:18.718 align:start position:0%
was lost in legislature because they
 
06:29:21.270 --> 06:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
repeatedly figured out that during this
 
06:29:23.670 --> 06:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
the public lost its rights to public
 
06:29:25.948 --> 06:29:25.958 align:start position:0%
Waters and Public Access
 
06:29:28.270 --> 06:29:28.280 align:start position:0%
my father also saw it needed to improve
 
06:29:30.390 --> 06:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
our voting conditions and he with a
 
06:29:31.948 --> 06:29:31.958 align:start position:0%
bipartisan group of
 
06:29:34.910 --> 06:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
legislatur put into law border education
 
06:29:36.788 --> 06:29:36.798 align:start position:0%
and the safe border program became
 
06:29:40.350 --> 06:29:40.360 align:start position:0%
effective in May of 2002 prior to that
 
06:29:42.750 --> 06:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
in 2001 there was
 
06:29:48.230 --> 06:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
115 accidents on the lakes in 2002 there
 
06:29:53.110 --> 06:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
was 122 I like to point out that by 2019
 
06:29:56.030 --> 06:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
with over 96,000 Boer registrations in
 
06:29:58.430 --> 06:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire just 35
 
06:30:00.830 --> 06:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
accidents were recorded by the state re
 
06:30:03.150 --> 06:30:03.160 align:start position:0%
Patrol and reductions were down by
 
06:30:06.468 --> 06:30:06.478 align:start position:0%

a definition of wake boats will not
 
06:30:24.830 --> 06:30:24.840 align:start position:0%

06:34:16.788 --> 06:34:16.798 align:start position:0%
representative of uh Lakes uh with fewer
 
06:34:19.628 --> 06:34:19.638 align:start position:0%

uh Suzanne
 
06:34:31.590 --> 06:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
Smith uh and uh Mr mallum I think that
 
06:34:35.030 --> 06:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh everyone who has spoken has
 
06:34:37.830 --> 06:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
contributed an important part of the
 
06:34:41.350 --> 06:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
discussion that took place I'm speaking
 
06:34:46.868 --> 06:34:46.878 align:start position:0%
very much in favor of the uh uh House
 
06:34:46.878 --> 06:34:47.788 align:start position:0%
very much in favor of the uh uh House
Bill

06:34:47.788 --> 06:34:47.798 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
06:34:50.388 --> 06:34:50.398 align:start position:0%
229 with its
 
06:34:53.070 --> 06:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
definition uh the only thing I would add
 
06:34:57.030 --> 06:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
to the definition uh is that uh
 
06:34:59.788 --> 06:34:59.798 align:start position:0%
following the word
 
06:35:04.150 --> 06:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
Plumbing um the word pumps also be
 
06:35:07.070 --> 06:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
included because I think that pumps are
 
06:35:11.110 --> 06:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
an important part of moving uh water
 
06:35:16.230 --> 06:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
from uh into tanks or out of
 
06:35:19.948 --> 06:35:19.958 align:start position:0%
Tanks um I think the discussion this
 
06:35:23.270 --> 06:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
afternoon has been extremely useful and
 
06:35:26.990 --> 06:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
I think it points to the usefulness of
 
06:35:28.548 --> 06:35:28.558 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill
 
06:35:33.628 --> 06:35:33.638 align:start position:0%
229 by seeking to uh clarify what it is
 
06:35:37.230 --> 06:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
that's being spoken of in terms of a
 
06:35:42.230 --> 06:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
wake boo uh it's clear that there are
 
06:35:45.110 --> 06:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
questions as to what a wake boo is and I
 
06:35:48.830 --> 06:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
think this serves to uh clarify that I
 
06:35:51.910 --> 06:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
think the definition as given here
 
06:35:55.948 --> 06:35:55.958 align:start position:0%
indicates no uh inclination on the part
 
06:36:02.788 --> 06:36:02.798 align:start position:0%
of anyone to uh support uh wake boats or
 
06:36:05.670 --> 06:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
to uh prohibit wake
 
06:36:09.868 --> 06:36:09.878 align:start position:0%
boats and uh so I think that uh the use
 
06:36:14.350 --> 06:36:14.360 align:start position:0%
I think this um is uh quite useful for
 
06:36:16.350 --> 06:36:16.360 align:start position:0%
the clarity that it
 
06:36:20.070 --> 06:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
brings uh thank you very
 
06:36:23.270 --> 06:36:23.280 align:start position:0%

06:36:26.990 --> 06:36:27.000 align:start position:0%

Ralph Samson who pondered the idea you
 
06:38:21.628 --> 06:38:21.638 align:start position:0%
know we all love snow skiing he said if
 
06:38:25.310 --> 06:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
you can ski on snow then you can ski on

06:38:49.110 --> 06:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
229 as representative gunky indicated I
 
06:38:53.628 --> 06:38:53.638 align:start position:0%
was also a member of House Bill 137 on a
 
06:38:55.030 --> 06:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
part of that
 
06:38:57.750 --> 06:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
commission and the commission did not in
 
06:38:59.990 --> 06:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
our opinion recommend defining wake
 
06:39:03.830 --> 06:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
boats I actually own a a ski Nati uh
 
06:39:05.590 --> 06:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
that that is a ski boat that's what it's
 
06:39:08.468 --> 06:39:08.478 align:start position:0%
defined as but it does have ballast bags
 
06:39:11.030 --> 06:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
in the back for trick skiing one of our
 
06:39:12.788 --> 06:39:12.798 align:start position:0%
competitions that we actually hold up in
 
06:39:16.150 --> 06:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
wolfboro in Back Bay and so that's very
 
06:39:19.110 --> 06:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
important to us we feel that that
 
06:39:21.830 --> 06:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
particular definition uh unfortunately
 
06:39:24.430 --> 06:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
does not really Define our sport or
 
06:39:27.868 --> 06:39:27.878 align:start position:0%
activity and that it it really has
 
06:39:30.708 --> 06:39:30.718 align:start position:0%
impending consequences that surround
 
06:39:33.430 --> 06:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
that as as many of you know in in snow
 
06:39:37.150 --> 06:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
skiing uh there is adaptive Sports we
 
06:39:39.230 --> 06:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
also have adaptive Sports in water
 
06:39:42.310 --> 06:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
skiing the Northeast passage of Durham
 
06:39:43.830 --> 06:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
in collaboration with
 
06:39:46.990 --> 06:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
UNH uh is very active in that and that's
 
06:39:48.468 --> 06:39:48.478 align:start position:0%
something that those that those ballast
 
06:39:51.310 --> 06:39:51.320 align:start position:0%
bags are required to help folks uh have
 
06:39:53.230 --> 06:39:53.240 align:start position:0%
a good experience behind the boat uh it
 
06:39:54.468 --> 06:39:54.478 align:start position:0%
gives them
 
06:39:57.708 --> 06:39:57.718 align:start position:0%
ability uh to you know gain air just
 
06:39:59.350 --> 06:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
like you would in say snowboarding or
 
06:40:02.190 --> 06:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
other aerial Sports and so in our
 
06:40:04.868 --> 06:40:04.878 align:start position:0%
opinion that's something that uh you we
 
06:40:07.830 --> 06:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
really feel uh is is pretty important uh
 
06:40:10.190 --> 06:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
one thing just to bring up that was part
 
06:40:12.548 --> 06:40:12.558 align:start position:0%
of the commission study uh was the
 
06:40:15.190 --> 06:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
impact Beyond of what was considered
 
06:40:18.830 --> 06:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
with uh wake booat waves was actually
 
06:40:21.628 --> 06:40:21.638 align:start position:0%
the natural occurrence of the natural
 
06:40:23.750 --> 06:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
freeze and thaw that we experience every
 
06:40:26.030 --> 06:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
year year uh you know wind waves
 
06:40:29.788 --> 06:40:29.798 align:start position:0%
flooding from rains Dam regulation and
 
06:40:33.030 --> 06:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
most of those concerns of of shorel
 
06:40:34.708 --> 06:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
owners are those that have modified that
 
06:40:37.070 --> 06:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
property front you know they've made
 
06:40:38.430 --> 06:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
they've turned into grass they've
 
06:40:40.948 --> 06:40:40.958 align:start position:0%
they've cut down the blueberry bushes so
 
06:40:44.110 --> 06:40:44.120 align:start position:0%
uh again thank you for your time uh we
 
06:40:48.150 --> 06:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:51.750 --> 06:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
229 thank you any questions from members

four-term state representative I'm a
 
06:41:49.110 --> 06:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
member of House Bill 137 commissioned to
 
06:41:53.030 --> 06:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
study wake boats I'm a resident of snipe
 
06:41:57.190 --> 06:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
and an owner of a tobo and I will speak
 
06:41:59.190 --> 06:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
for less than five minutes I'm going to

try to speak slowly um I'm here to
 
06:42:04.948 --> 06:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
testify in opposition to House Bill
 
06:42:08.350 --> 06:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
229 the bill before you today seeks to
 
06:42:11.830 --> 06:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
Define wake boats it simply defines one
 
06:42:14.468 --> 06:42:14.478 align:start position:0%
type of boat without specifying what is
 
06:42:15.910 --> 06:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
to be done with the
 
06:42:18.948 --> 06:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
definition when I was in the legislature
 
06:42:21.788 --> 06:42:21.798 align:start position:0%
we identified problems determined
 
06:42:24.510 --> 06:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
Solutions and defined who who the
 
06:42:27.590 --> 06:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
solution or change in law pertain to
 
06:42:30.590 --> 06:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
this bill sets the definition without
 
06:42:33.830 --> 06:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
identifying a problem or solution a
 
06:42:37.030 --> 06:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
definition can only do one thing and
 
06:42:39.468 --> 06:42:39.478 align:start position:0%
that is to lead to further restriction
 
06:42:41.788 --> 06:42:41.798 align:start position:0%
and regulation down the
 
06:42:45.350 --> 06:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
road that this is not a recommendation
 
06:42:47.948 --> 06:42:47.958 align:start position:0%
of the commission the commission heard
 
06:42:50.430 --> 06:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
from a number of organizations on the
 
06:42:54.150 --> 06:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
subject AIS spread is down because of
 
06:42:57.990 --> 06:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
vigilance on all boats the manufacturers
 
06:43:00.510 --> 06:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
are adding new technology the water
 
06:43:03.388 --> 06:43:03.398 align:start position:0%
sport industry Association is leading a
 
06:43:06.270 --> 06:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
Boer education and wake responsibly
 
06:43:09.150 --> 06:43:09.160 align:start position:0%
campaign recommending in part boers stay
 
06:43:12.110 --> 06:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
200 foot from Shore while wake surfing
 
06:43:15.788 --> 06:43:15.798 align:start position:0%
we learned from a retired MIT engineer
 
06:43:17.510 --> 06:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
who conducted a
 
06:43:20.628 --> 06:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
scientific wave action study that wake
 
06:43:23.270 --> 06:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
surf waves are the largest just behind
 
06:43:24.468 --> 06:43:24.478 align:start position:0%
the boat
 
06:43:26.708 --> 06:43:26.718 align:start position:0%
and they subside quickly as they get
 
06:43:29.868 --> 06:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
closer to shore the larger waves lose
 
06:43:32.510 --> 06:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
their energy quicker than the smaller
 
06:43:35.830 --> 06:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
waves and the study showed that the wave
 
06:43:38.670 --> 06:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
from a wake surfing boat was no
 
06:43:41.868 --> 06:43:41.878 align:start position:0%
different than a wave from a 10 m hour
 
06:43:44.350 --> 06:43:44.360 align:start position:0%
wind the busiest days on the lake are
 
06:43:46.310 --> 06:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
the weekends and in the summer and
 
06:43:49.708 --> 06:43:49.718 align:start position:0%
approximate 20 days which has which has
 
06:43:51.750 --> 06:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
much less impact on the shore than a
 
06:43:55.030 --> 06:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
year round wind we received many letters
 
06:43:56.830 --> 06:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
to the commission the majority from
 
06:43:59.190 --> 06:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
families who enjoy water sports and
 
06:44:01.868 --> 06:44:01.878 align:start position:0%
don't want to see them limited or banned
 
06:44:05.548 --> 06:44:05.558 align:start position:0%
by restricting type of boats there is a
 
06:44:07.670 --> 06:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
segment of the population that dislike
 
06:44:10.190 --> 06:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
the boats and they blame them for all
 
06:44:13.990 --> 06:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
the ills on their Lake we did not see
 
06:44:16.510 --> 06:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
evidence to support
 
06:44:19.150 --> 06:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
this the commission was able to agree on
 
06:44:20.948 --> 06:44:20.958 align:start position:0%
a number of recommendations and that was
 
06:44:22.548 --> 06:44:22.558 align:start position:0%
the subject of house
 
06:44:26.590 --> 06:44:26.600 align:start position:0%
bill5 five that you previously heard
 
06:44:29.110 --> 06:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
personally our family has participated
 
06:44:32.270 --> 06:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
in a range of water sports for over 30
 
06:44:35.590 --> 06:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
years we live on the water in the summer
 
06:44:38.030 --> 06:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
we love our towboat because we can do
 
06:44:40.990 --> 06:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
everything behind it ski wakeboard surf
 
06:44:43.910 --> 06:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
kneeboard and tube and now we're sharing
 
06:44:46.230 --> 06:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
our love for the water with our two
 
06:44:49.310 --> 06:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
grandkids ages 5 and three the
 
06:44:51.548 --> 06:44:51.558 align:start position:0%
confidence and excitement our grandson
 
06:44:54.670 --> 06:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
shows when kneeboarding tubing and yes

balance the competing uses of the public

to share the water responsibly and not

clearly voters who create problems that

need to be addressed but house bill 229
 
06:45:58.510 --> 06:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
is not the answer House Bill 229 takes a
 
06:46:00.750 --> 06:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
drastic step towards limiting the rights
 
06:46:03.070 --> 06:46:03.080 align:start position:0%

06:46:21.310 --> 06:46:21.320 align:start position:0%
the voting Community has the right to

the reasonable use of New Hampshire's
 
06:46:28.310 --> 06:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
public waterways I ask that you find
 
06:46:31.150 --> 06:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
this bill inexpedient to legislate and I
 
06:46:34.590 --> 06:46:34.600 align:start position:0%
will submit my testimony uh to you all
 
06:46:37.070 --> 06:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
after thank you very much Mr chairman
 
06:46:38.990 --> 06:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
and members of the
 
06:46:41.590 --> 06:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
committee thank you representative is
 
06:46:43.628 --> 06:46:43.638 align:start position:0%
there any questions by the members of
 
06:46:46.110 --> 06:46:46.120 align:start position:0%
the committee sir I see no questions
 
06:46:47.990 --> 06:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very
 
06:46:48.000 --> 06:46:51.590 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very
much

06:46:51.590 --> 06:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:53.830 --> 06:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative representative

06:47:02.868 --> 06:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
R hello again uh colleagues on the
 
06:47:05.548 --> 06:47:05.558 align:start position:0%
resources committee um for the record my
 
06:47:07.708 --> 06:47:07.718 align:start position:0%
name is Rosemarie rang I'm a state
 
06:47:09.628 --> 06:47:09.638 align:start position:0%
representative from marac which is
 
06:47:12.990 --> 06:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 21 um I'm actually speaking to
 
06:47:16.070 --> 06:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
you today as a summer resident of molten
 
06:47:18.670 --> 06:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
Boro New Hampshire my husband and I have
 
06:47:22.310 --> 06:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
a summer home on Lake kisaka which is a
 
06:47:26.548 --> 06:47:26.558 align:start position:0%
371 acre Lake um right on the edge of
 
06:47:28.948 --> 06:47:28.958 align:start position:0%
molteno uh kind of straddling Center
 
06:47:31.590 --> 06:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
Harbor um it's a small Lake but it's
 
06:47:35.548 --> 06:47:35.558 align:start position:0%
large enough for um motorboats skiing um
 
06:47:38.230 --> 06:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
sailing swimming everything everything
 
06:47:41.230 --> 06:47:41.240 align:start position:0%
like that um one of our residents has
 
06:47:44.190 --> 06:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
purchased a wake boat and has had it on
 
06:47:47.468 --> 06:47:47.478 align:start position:0%
uh on the lake for last summer and I can
 
06:47:49.270 --> 06:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
tell you I I know we've heard a lot
 
06:47:50.868 --> 06:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
about people saying oh these boats
 
06:47:53.590 --> 06:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
aren't really different I invite each of
 
06:47:56.190 --> 06:47:56.200 align:start position:0%
you to come up to my place in the summer
 
06:47:58.270 --> 06:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
and you will see quite clearly the
 
06:48:00.670 --> 06:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
difference between a wake booat and a
 
06:48:04.468 --> 06:48:04.478 align:start position:0%
regular motorboat um it will swamp the
 
06:48:07.548 --> 06:48:07.558 align:start position:0%
shoreline um and I'm sure that it does
 
06:48:09.430 --> 06:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
it does contribute to
 
06:48:13.628 --> 06:48:13.638 align:start position:0%
erosion um I also think that um this
 
06:48:16.708 --> 06:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
past summer we had a lake wide cyano
 
06:48:18.910 --> 06:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
bacteria Bloom it made our lake look
 
06:48:22.830 --> 06:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
like PE soup and um there and like Mr
 
06:48:25.030 --> 06:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
oon ran said from the new New Hampshire
 
06:48:27.868 --> 06:48:27.878 align:start position:0%
Lakes is that our Lake doesn't isn't
 
06:48:30.948 --> 06:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
necessarily deep like other Lakes um we
 
06:48:32.948 --> 06:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
have certain spots that are deep but
 
06:48:35.468 --> 06:48:35.478 align:start position:0%
wake boats definitely turn up churn up
 
06:48:37.990 --> 06:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
the sediment and and increase the
 
06:48:41.070 --> 06:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
phosphorous load of the water um
 
06:48:43.830 --> 06:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
someone's pet dog nearly died children
 
06:48:47.190 --> 06:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
got sick um parent a swimmer that swims
 
06:48:50.468 --> 06:48:50.478 align:start position:0%
the lake every day got very sick um so
 
06:48:53.190 --> 06:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
wake boats you know they they can
 
06:48:56.990 --> 06:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
contribute to uh conditions which can
 
06:48:59.110 --> 06:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
can lead to cyano bacteria blooms and
 
06:49:00.788 --> 06:49:00.798 align:start position:0%
and actually and actually actually have
 
06:49:01.750 --> 06:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
actually have a
 
06:49:04.388 --> 06:49:04.398 align:start position:0%
very um no one could be in our Lake for
 
06:49:06.590 --> 06:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
a month because of that cyano bacteria
 
06:49:09.270 --> 06:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
Bloom and then we had localized blooms
 
06:49:12.270 --> 06:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
followed for several weeks so I'm not
 
06:49:15.430 --> 06:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
against wake boats um my husband and I
 
06:49:17.430 --> 06:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
we had a motorboat we now have gotten
 
06:49:20.030 --> 06:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
old enough for a pontoon boat so we just
 
06:49:21.510 --> 06:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
kind of you know do our little cruise
 
06:49:24.388 --> 06:49:24.398 align:start position:0%
around the lake but um wake boats are
 
06:49:27.070 --> 06:49:27.080 align:start position:0%
different and we need to Define them um
 
06:49:29.948 --> 06:49:29.958 align:start position:0%
just as this committee redefined or
 
06:49:32.350 --> 06:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
defined a personal watercraft a couple
 
06:49:35.150 --> 06:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
years ago um we need to have these
 
06:49:37.468 --> 06:49:37.478 align:start position:0%
definitions in place yes there may come
 
06:49:39.670 --> 06:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
a time when on certain lakes that don't
 
06:49:41.830 --> 06:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
have the depths of others that wake
 
06:49:44.628 --> 06:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
boats might have to be restricted um to
 
06:49:47.830 --> 06:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
have a a greater distance from Shore um
 
06:49:49.868 --> 06:49:49.878 align:start position:0%
some shallow Lakes they may not be able
 
06:49:52.190 --> 06:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
to to to be maneuvered because of the
 
06:49:54.350 --> 06:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
damage they can cause so I strongly
 
06:49:56.948 --> 06:49:56.958 align:start position:0%
support this bill and I hope you uh vote
 
06:50:00.468 --> 06:50:00.478 align:start position:0%
ought to pass thank
 
06:50:03.590 --> 06:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
you any questions by members of the
 
06:50:09.310 --> 06:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:11.670 --> 06:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
question representative post
 
06:50:14.190 --> 06:50:14.200 align:start position:0%
representative post for a question thank
 
06:50:17.110 --> 06:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and um thank you uh
 
06:50:21.510 --> 06:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative r i my question is on
 
06:50:25.430 --> 06:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
your leg around your Lake do most of the
 
06:50:30.830 --> 06:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
homes have uh grass around it on their
 
06:50:30.840 --> 06:50:32.670 align:start position:0%
homes have uh grass around it on their
property

06:50:32.670 --> 06:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
property
 
06:50:35.270 --> 06:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh there there's some that have grass
 
06:50:38.750 --> 06:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
but we are a a lake that is striving to
 
06:50:41.990 --> 06:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
be a lak smart Community it's a
 
06:50:45.110 --> 06:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
designation by the New Hampshire Lakes
 
06:50:48.628 --> 06:50:48.638 align:start position:0%
um we have mainly around there's uh
 
06:50:52.468 --> 06:50:52.478 align:start position:0%
trees uh we try to keep a natural uh uh
 
06:50:52.478 --> 06:50:53.468 align:start position:0%
trees uh we try to keep a natural uh uh
buffer

06:50:53.468 --> 06:50:53.478 align:start position:0%
buffer
 
06:50:55.788 --> 06:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
between land and in the lake but there
 
06:50:58.868 --> 06:50:58.878 align:start position:0%
are a few homes that do have more of a
 
06:51:01.350 --> 06:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
grassy front I know in our property we
 
06:51:04.430 --> 06:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
actually have a natural Beach for it
 
06:51:06.310 --> 06:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
might be I don't know maybe 20 or 30
 
06:51:06.320 --> 06:51:08.788 align:start position:0%
might be I don't know maybe 20 or 30
feet

06:51:08.788 --> 06:51:08.798 align:start position:0%
feet
 
06:51:12.190 --> 06:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
long it's a mix if I had to
 
06:51:17.030 --> 06:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
say m Mr chairman may I do a followup to
 
06:51:21.830 --> 06:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
that we have a time go right ahead okay
 
06:51:24.430 --> 06:51:24.440 align:start position:0%
yes um so in in reading about cob
 
06:51:26.990 --> 06:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
bacterial blooms it's usually from
 
06:51:29.548 --> 06:51:29.558 align:start position:0%
excess nutrients coming in from uh
 
06:51:31.670 --> 06:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
people fertilizing and things like that
 
06:51:35.590 --> 06:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
it's also caused in times of heat so how
 
06:51:38.830 --> 06:51:38.840 align:start position:0%
how do you attribute um the cob bacteria
 
06:51:41.590 --> 06:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
in lakes that don't have these to the
 
06:51:43.910 --> 06:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
situation you had this
 
06:51:46.910 --> 06:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
year well um I've kind of actually
 
06:51:49.628 --> 06:51:49.638 align:start position:0%
become uh more or less a semi-expert on
 
06:51:51.868 --> 06:51:51.878 align:start position:0%
cyano bacteria Blooms from our
 
06:51:51.878 --> 06:51:53.388 align:start position:0%
cyano bacteria Blooms from our
experience

06:51:53.388 --> 06:51:53.398 align:start position:0%
experience
 
06:51:56.150 --> 06:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
we've always had I mean the only thing
 
06:51:58.510 --> 06:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
that's changed on our lake has been the
 
06:52:02.430 --> 06:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
Wake booat um we also have uh you know
 
06:52:04.750 --> 06:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
some sometimes animal droppings can
 
06:52:06.910 --> 06:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
increase the phosphorus load but the
 
06:52:11.270 --> 06:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
cyano bacteria Bloom is generated or
 
06:52:13.468 --> 06:52:13.478 align:start position:0%
primarily caused from an increase in
 
06:52:17.070 --> 06:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
phosphorus and phosphorus can come from
 
06:52:20.388 --> 06:52:20.398 align:start position:0%
disruption of sediment uh yes we do have
 
06:52:22.990 --> 06:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
other areas that may be sources of a of
 
06:52:25.310 --> 06:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
a cyano bacteria Bloom but what we
 
06:52:27.788 --> 06:52:27.798 align:start position:0%
experienced last summer was was Lake
 
06:52:30.070 --> 06:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
wide the whole lake was like PE soup it
 
06:52:32.430 --> 06:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't as though you look on a Shore and
 
06:52:35.628 --> 06:52:35.638 align:start position:0%
you see a scum from a cyanobacteria
 
06:52:37.948 --> 06:52:37.958 align:start position:0%
bloom there are different types the type
 
06:52:40.548 --> 06:52:40.558 align:start position:0%
we experien was from Lake wide
 
06:52:40.558 --> 06:52:42.830 align:start position:0%
we experien was from Lake wide
phosphorus

06:52:42.830 --> 06:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
phosphorus
 
06:52:44.670 --> 06:52:44.680 align:start position:0%

06:52:46.190 --> 06:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
your qu I mean there are many different
 
06:52:48.750 --> 06:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
sources of cyanobacteria blooms but
 
06:52:50.468 --> 06:52:50.478 align:start position:0%
almost all of them are caused from
 
06:52:52.270 --> 06:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
increase in phosphorus loading from
 
06:52:52.280 --> 06:52:58.110 align:start position:0%
increase in phosphorus loading from
sediment

representing the towns of Guilford and
 
06:53:35.510 --> 06:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
Meredith both on Lake Winn pasak uh I
 
06:53:38.468 --> 06:53:38.478 align:start position:0%
have been asked by constituents to
 
06:53:43.110 --> 06:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
vigorously oppose H Bill 229 House Bill
 
06:53:46.548 --> 06:53:46.558 align:start position:0%
229 in in listening to the uh discussion
 
06:53:49.110 --> 06:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
of the committee on the prior Bill
 
06:53:52.230 --> 06:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
115 uh I noticed a lot of emphasis on
 
06:53:56.030 --> 06:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
the manner of propulsion of the boats
 
06:53:58.110 --> 06:53:58.120 align:start position:0%
and that we were talking in terms that
 
06:54:00.510 --> 06:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
wake boats did not have or should not
 
06:54:04.270 --> 06:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
have an outboard engine at the back or a
 
06:54:07.750 --> 06:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
a a rear drive to protect the person who
 
06:54:10.910 --> 06:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
was being tow there's no mention of the
 
06:54:13.628 --> 06:54:13.638 align:start position:0%
manner of propulsion in this definition
 
06:54:15.430 --> 06:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
this could apply the definition could
 
06:54:18.510 --> 06:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
certainly apply to a stern drive or an
 
06:54:21.628 --> 06:54:21.638 align:start position:0%
outboard engine propelled boat as
 
06:54:23.788 --> 06:54:23.798 align:start position:0%
written it doesn't focus on the
 
06:54:26.430 --> 06:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
propulsion method which is contrary to
 
06:54:29.670 --> 06:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
the intent of the safety Provisions in
 
06:54:33.388 --> 06:54:33.398 align:start position:0%
115 the the constituents that asked me
 
06:54:36.670 --> 06:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
to oppose this were first of all one in
 
06:54:39.628 --> 06:54:39.638 align:start position:0%
the Marine industry who sells the boats
 
06:54:41.708 --> 06:54:41.718 align:start position:0%
and the other was a physician who lives
 
06:54:45.468 --> 06:54:45.478 align:start position:0%
on the lake and who likes to to use uh
 
06:54:47.310 --> 06:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
the toast Sports likes to engage in the
 
06:54:49.990 --> 06:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
tow Sports including wake
 
06:54:53.190 --> 06:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
surfing our view is my view their view
 
06:54:56.788 --> 06:54:56.798 align:start position:0%
is that the definition is the beginning
 
06:54:59.430 --> 06:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
of a slippery slope the first step is
 
06:55:02.190 --> 06:55:02.200 align:start position:0%
you define something next you regulate
 
06:55:04.788 --> 06:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
it then you restrict it and ultimately
 
06:55:07.830 --> 06:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
you ban it and that's the concern here
 
06:55:09.628 --> 06:55:09.638 align:start position:0%
with putting this definition the way it
 
06:55:12.670 --> 06:55:12.680 align:start position:0%
is now is it's going to lead to a
 
06:55:15.388 --> 06:55:15.398 align:start position:0%
ultimately regulation restrictions and
 
06:55:19.548 --> 06:55:19.558 align:start position:0%
banning of uh surfing so we urge that
 
06:55:23.150 --> 06:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
the committee vote itl thank you
 
06:55:24.670 --> 06:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
06:55:26.788 --> 06:55:26.798 align:start position:0%
much I'm no longer going to take
 
06:55:29.388 --> 06:55:29.398 align:start position:0%

the low on uh out on the lake every day
 
06:56:04.750 --> 06:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
during the summer um I'll be honest with
 
06:56:07.430 --> 06:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
you there is absolutely no difference
 
06:56:09.948 --> 06:56:09.958 align:start position:0%
between a 56 foot boat that travels
 
06:56:12.430 --> 06:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
along the lake and what you guys want to
 
06:56:15.590 --> 06:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
declare as a wake boat um I think by
 
06:56:17.990 --> 06:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
defining this all you're doing is
 
06:56:20.388 --> 06:56:20.398 align:start position:0%
setting up future regulations against a
 
06:56:23.190 --> 06:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
good sport and a good uh help to our
 
06:56:25.948 --> 06:56:25.958 align:start position:0%
economy up here and I really think you
 
06:56:30.788 --> 06:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:33.388 --> 06:56:33.398 align:start position:0%

a lot of constituents um are very
 
06:56:42.628 --> 06:56:42.638 align:start position:0%

06:56:44.190 --> 06:56:44.200 align:start position:0%
want to be brief with you guys I thank
 
06:56:49.468 --> 06:56:49.478 align:start position:0%

honorable members of the resources
 
06:57:19.190 --> 06:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Tim Dunley and I am
 
06:57:21.150 --> 06:57:21.160 align:start position:0%
the captain of the State Police Marine
 
06:57:24.190 --> 06:57:24.200 align:start position:0%
Patrol unit uh the department of safety
 
06:57:26.030 --> 06:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh is taking a neutral position on this
 
06:57:29.430 --> 06:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
bill this is not uncommon for our agency
 
06:57:33.910 --> 06:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
to take this approach when there are uh
 
06:57:36.990 --> 06:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
potential impacts for various users of
 
06:57:39.548 --> 06:57:39.558 align:start position:0%
our public Waters uh it is the position
 
06:57:42.230 --> 06:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
of the department to allow the public
 
06:57:44.070 --> 06:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
process uh whether it be through the
 
06:57:46.030 --> 06:57:46.040 align:start position:0%
hearings process or the legislative
 
06:57:49.468 --> 06:57:49.478 align:start position:0%
process to implement restrictions Andor
 
06:57:52.868 --> 06:57:52.878 align:start position:0%
in this case definitions uh as they
 
06:57:55.350 --> 06:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh would would deem appropriate I'm
 
06:57:57.910 --> 06:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any uh background
 
06:58:00.310 --> 06:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
questions that any of you may have but
 
06:58:01.948 --> 06:58:01.958 align:start position:0%
uh the position of the department is to
 
06:58:04.548 --> 06:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
remain neutral in this
 
06:58:07.030 --> 06:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
case I will open
 
06:58:13.070 --> 06:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:15.990 --> 06:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
committee I see no questions no
 
06:58:18.788 --> 06:58:18.798 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very
 
06:58:21.310 --> 06:58:21.320 align:start position:0%

06:58:32.110 --> 06:58:32.120 align:start position:0%
Lakes hi Mr chair and members of the
 
06:58:35.670 --> 06:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
committee can you hear me uh yes uh can
 
06:58:38.590 --> 06:58:38.600 align:start position:0%
you try we're uh running out around the
 
06:58:41.270 --> 06:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
second half of this so
 
06:58:44.350 --> 06:58:44.360 align:start position:0%
whole I will keep this very brief um as
 
06:58:47.030 --> 06:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
Tom covered a lot of what I was planning
 
06:58:50.030 --> 06:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
to talk about um I am Michelle Davis I'm
 
06:58:51.750 --> 06:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
the advocacy program coordinator at New
 
06:58:54.110 --> 06:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lakes and I really just wanted
 
06:58:56.548 --> 06:58:56.558 align:start position:0%
to make a few points that New Hampshire
 
06:58:58.948 --> 06:58:58.958 align:start position:0%
Lakes is not now trying to ban ballast
 
06:59:00.948 --> 06:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
boats or that activities of wake
 
06:59:02.270 --> 06:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
boarding and wake
 
06:59:04.750 --> 06:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
surfing uh we're acting in response to
 
06:59:07.070 --> 06:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
increasing concerns from both members
 
06:59:09.270 --> 06:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
and non-members alike who are concerned
 
06:59:10.830 --> 06:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
about their property damage and
 
06:59:12.628 --> 06:59:12.638 align:start position:0%
increasing inability to use their
 
06:59:15.670 --> 06:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
favorite Lake safely for other uses uh
 
06:59:17.788 --> 06:59:17.798 align:start position:0%
we believe that any onw waterer activity
 
06:59:19.430 --> 06:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
that negatively impacts the health of
 
06:59:21.590 --> 06:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
our Lakes as well as negatively impacts
 
06:59:22.830 --> 06:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
other boers
 
06:59:25.708 --> 06:59:25.718 align:start position:0%
swimmers Shoreline structures Mor boats
 
06:59:28.110 --> 06:59:28.120 align:start position:0%
Etc needs to be better managed than it
 
06:59:31.150 --> 06:59:31.160 align:start position:0%
is now uh our lakes are in the public
 
06:59:33.388 --> 06:59:33.398 align:start position:0%
trust and for the use and enjoyment of
 
06:59:35.868 --> 06:59:35.878 align:start position:0%
everyone ballast boats are I will remind
 
06:59:37.788 --> 06:59:37.798 align:start position:0%
you prohibitively expensive and choosing
 
06:59:40.270 --> 06:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
not to manage or mitigate their impacts
 
06:59:42.548 --> 06:59:42.558 align:start position:0%
is choosing the enjoyment of a few over
 
06:59:44.030 --> 06:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
the protection of the
 
06:59:46.830 --> 06:59:46.840 align:start position:0%
many and the Boating industry would have
 
06:59:48.750 --> 06:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
you believe that the waves created by
 
06:59:50.708 --> 06:59:50.718 align:start position:0%
ballast boats are no different than
 
06:59:52.670 --> 06:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
wakes created by any other boat
 
06:59:55.230 --> 06:59:55.240 align:start position:0%
while simultaneously advertising huge
 
06:59:58.150 --> 06:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
wakes to prospective buyers right now
 
07:00:00.830 --> 07:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
Malibu is advertising an engine called
 
07:00:04.110 --> 07:00:04.120 align:start position:0%
the Malibu Monsoon for an example so
 
07:00:06.110 --> 07:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
wake boats are fundamentally designed to
 
07:00:07.990 --> 07:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
create enhanced wakes and therefore have
 
07:00:11.708 --> 07:00:11.718 align:start position:0%
a greater impact on our Lakes thank
 
07:00:21.110 --> 07:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:21.120 --> 07:00:23.110 align:start position:0%
 
much

07:00:23.110 --> 07:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
much
 
07:00:25.190 --> 07:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
yeah back to the top of the list where
 
07:00:28.910 --> 07:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
we go to Daniel
 
07:00:32.750 --> 07:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
frin of the public opposed to the bill
 
07:00:35.750 --> 07:00:35.760 align:start position:0%

world outside of our tiny state in which
 
07:02:55.350 --> 07:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
we were bornn and raised in 2016 we made
 
07:02:57.070 --> 07:02:57.080 align:start position:0%
the conscious choice to move our family
 
07:02:59.270 --> 07:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
back to New Hampshire to create the same
 
07:03:00.990 --> 07:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity for our children to be
 
07:03:02.430 --> 07:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
raised in the beautiful lakes and
 
07:03:04.948 --> 07:03:04.958 align:start position:0%

up on lake wiip pasak and felt drawn
 
07:03:09.628 --> 07:03:09.638 align:start position:0%
back home two years ago we purchas
 
07:03:11.910 --> 07:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
purchased our first wake boat from
 
07:03:14.948 --> 07:03:14.958 align:start position:0%
Silver Sands Marina we chose the boat we
 
07:03:17.270 --> 07:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
did because as an active family we knew
 
07:03:19.030 --> 07:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
we needed a boat that would keep us
 
07:03:20.868 --> 07:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
active and engaged in a healthy
 
07:03:23.230 --> 07:03:23.240 align:start position:0%
lifestyle the boat we purchased offered
 
07:03:26.868 --> 07:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
us that exact opportunity come 2020 we
 
07:03:28.628 --> 07:03:28.638 align:start position:0%
decided it was time to upgrade and we
 
07:03:30.468 --> 07:03:30.478 align:start position:0%
traded in our first boat and purchased
 
07:03:32.868 --> 07:03:32.878 align:start position:0%
another wake boat from Silver Sands yes
 
07:03:34.868 --> 07:03:34.878 align:start position:0%
we bought two boats in two years and
 
07:03:37.430 --> 07:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
this shows our passion for the lifestyle
 
07:03:38.830 --> 07:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
that we as a family have become
 
07:03:41.150 --> 07:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
accustomed to during this time we made
 
07:03:42.830 --> 07:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
friends with some amazing families that
 
07:03:44.750 --> 07:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
share the same passion for wake surfing
 
07:03:47.230 --> 07:03:47.240 align:start position:0%
that we do we watched our young kids
 
07:03:49.510 --> 07:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
collectively progress gain confidence
 
07:03:51.510 --> 07:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
where otherwise they may not have and
 
07:03:54.150 --> 07:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
quick become a community of families who
 
07:03:55.948 --> 07:03:55.958 align:start position:0%
would join together for the love of the
 
07:03:59.110 --> 07:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
lake and water sports we have created a
 
07:04:00.670 --> 07:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
tradition in our family that we ride
 
07:04:02.310 --> 07:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
mountain bikes in the morning and then
 
07:04:04.110 --> 07:04:04.120 align:start position:0%
hang up the bikes and hedge the marina
 
07:04:06.910 --> 07:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon to Surf with family and
 
07:04:08.750 --> 07:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
friends this is something we all look
 
07:04:11.310 --> 07:04:11.320 align:start position:0%
forward to and it keeps our kids active
 
07:04:13.868 --> 07:04:13.878 align:start position:0%
with us off screens and engaged in
 
07:04:15.230 --> 07:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
something that brings them Joy
 
07:04:17.628 --> 07:04:17.638 align:start position:0%
confidence and friendship beyond my
 
07:04:19.468 --> 07:04:19.478 align:start position:0%
passion for my family's love of our wake
 
07:04:22.350 --> 07:04:22.360 align:start position:0%
booat we we I'd like to speak speak
 
07:04:25.190 --> 07:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
briefly from the business perspective
 
07:04:27.270 --> 07:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
being the fourth generation of the Nazar

Resort and a successful real estate
 
07:04:31.270 --> 07:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
agent I can tell you I know how
 
07:04:32.910 --> 07:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions made on the Lakes will
 
07:04:35.070 --> 07:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
impact our businesses in tourism I
 
07:04:36.830 --> 07:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
recently showed a couple from New Jersey
 
07:04:40.110 --> 07:04:40.120 align:start position:0%
a smaller home a a lake a home on a
 
07:04:42.468 --> 07:04:42.478 align:start position:0%
smaller Lake in our area they love the
 
07:04:44.350 --> 07:04:44.360 align:start position:0%
lake they love the house but did not
 
07:04:45.910 --> 07:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
purchase because they would not be able
 
07:04:47.468 --> 07:04:47.478 align:start position:0%
to have their personal watercraft on
 
07:04:49.910 --> 07:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
this Lake that seller's buyer pool was
 
07:04:52.150 --> 07:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
directly affected by that by the fact
 
07:04:53.548 --> 07:04:53.558 align:start position:0%
that personal watercraft were not
 
07:04:55.990 --> 07:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
allowed on this Lake the naasa is a
 
07:04:57.708 --> 07:04:57.718 align:start position:0%
prominent business on Lake wiip pasak
 
07:05:00.230 --> 07:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
for over 86 years this business relies
 
07:05:02.030 --> 07:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
on our boating community servicing the
 
07:05:05.388 --> 07:05:05.398 align:start position:0%
local tourism industry with over 85
 
07:05:07.350 --> 07:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
rooms and 50 dock slips and two
 
07:05:09.868 --> 07:05:09.878 align:start position:0%
restaurants my family's businesses rely
 
07:05:12.150 --> 07:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
directly on these tourism dollars and as
 
07:05:14.150 --> 07:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
we add more and more restrictions we
 
07:05:15.590 --> 07:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
will see these tourists second
 
07:05:17.430 --> 07:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
homeowners choose different areas to
 
07:05:19.548 --> 07:05:19.558 align:start position:0%
recreate causing these family run
 
07:05:25.350 --> 07:05:25.360 align:start position:0%

07:05:49.628 --> 07:05:49.638 align:start position:0%
Boer two and three minutes I understand
 
07:05:51.868 --> 07:05:51.878 align:start position:0%
that my background is I own an OP the
 
07:05:53.270 --> 07:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
dinner boats on Lake Sun I've been a
 
07:05:55.590 --> 07:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
lifelong boater here and I'm an
 
07:05:57.788 --> 07:05:57.798 align:start position:0%
passionate water skier and also an owner
 
07:06:00.788 --> 07:06:00.798 align:start position:0%
of an 18t Century Resorter I'm speaking
 
07:06:03.990 --> 07:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
to support this bill on safety concerns
 
07:06:05.830 --> 07:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
when we water ski in the morning despite
 
07:06:07.628 --> 07:06:07.638 align:start position:0%
the fact that the Wake surge boats are
 
07:06:10.230 --> 07:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
away from us the only safe way we can
 
07:06:11.788 --> 07:06:11.798 align:start position:0%
accomplish that wake is to take our
 
07:06:13.830 --> 07:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
water ski boat from 32 miles hour to
 
07:06:16.910 --> 07:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
zero it's a 21 foot Mumba we cannot
 
07:06:18.830 --> 07:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
safely go over those wakes even when the
 
07:06:21.070 --> 07:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
wake surf boat is a couple three 400
 
07:06:23.750 --> 07:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
yards away from us also when I'm driving
 
07:06:26.910 --> 07:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
my Century resor on a windy day I need
 
07:06:28.590 --> 07:06:28.600 align:start position:0%
to be conscious of those waves as well
 
07:06:30.628 --> 07:06:30.638 align:start position:0%
because when they hit my bow Century
 
07:06:33.670 --> 07:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
Resort 1986 when I hit my bow it slows
 
07:06:35.708 --> 07:06:35.718 align:start position:0%
my boat down dramatically a knot or two
 
07:06:38.948 --> 07:06:38.958 align:start position:0%
or three causing my prop to cavitate
 
07:06:41.750 --> 07:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
causing my motor to overr I wasn't too
 
07:06:43.670 --> 07:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
happy this summer when we did Miss awake
 
07:06:46.190 --> 07:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
on a windy day and my butt came off the
 
07:06:50.070 --> 07:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
boat cushion 10 inches that's a lot
 
07:06:52.830 --> 07:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
that's unsafe now I'd like to see this
 
07:06:56.468 --> 07:06:56.478 align:start position:0%
bill passed so that a class of boats
 
07:06:58.788 --> 07:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
wake surge boats just as with jet skis
 
07:07:00.548 --> 07:07:00.558 align:start position:0%
and I'm familiar with that legislation
 
07:07:03.468 --> 07:07:03.478 align:start position:0%
can be enacted so that
 
07:07:06.150 --> 07:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
responsible let's call them responsible
 
07:07:08.830 --> 07:07:08.840 align:start position:0%

looking for three minutes keep it under
 
07:08:49.868 --> 07:08:49.878 align:start position:0%
three minutes if I I will definitely
 
07:08:51.548 --> 07:08:51.558 align:start position:0%
keep it under three minutes my name is
 
07:08:54.510 --> 07:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
Al I live on Lake sopy I've booted on
 
07:08:56.548 --> 07:08:56.558 align:start position:0%
Lake sopy since
 
07:09:00.510 --> 07:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
1985 um and I'm speaking against uh the
 
07:09:04.910 --> 07:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
bill um um I'm not going to repeat the
 
07:09:08.110 --> 07:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
comments uh Pam price uh really
 
07:09:09.430 --> 07:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
addressed most of what I was going to
 
07:09:13.030 --> 07:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
say I think she said it very well um I I
 
07:09:14.430 --> 07:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
just want to add this one of the
 
07:09:18.350 --> 07:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
representatives commented on uh whether
 
07:09:20.110 --> 07:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
Pete mcallum would support or his
 
07:09:21.910 --> 07:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
Association would support more money for
 
07:09:24.030 --> 07:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement on the lake I actually think
 
07:09:25.990 --> 07:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
that that's a problem that's much more
 
07:09:28.150 --> 07:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
important than the problem being
 
07:09:30.468 --> 07:09:30.478 align:start position:0%
addressed uh today by this definition of
 
07:09:34.150 --> 07:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
a wake surfing boat uh uh on Lake sunap
 
07:09:37.230 --> 07:09:37.240 align:start position:0%
we can sometimes go weeks without seeing
 
07:09:41.548 --> 07:09:41.558 align:start position:0%
um a marine safety officer um I suspect
 
07:09:43.350 --> 07:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
on some of the smaller Lakes you never
 
07:09:46.388 --> 07:09:46.398 align:start position:0%
see a marine safety officer and I think
 
07:09:49.110 --> 07:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
we should spend our time focusing on
 
07:09:52.628 --> 07:09:52.638 align:start position:0%
raising revenue for more boating safety
 
07:09:56.110 --> 07:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
officers uh I I've never seen an issue
 
07:09:59.110 --> 07:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
with a safety uh from a wake surfing
 
07:10:00.310 --> 07:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
boat they move
 
07:10:03.510 --> 07:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
slowly um I've seen a lot of issues with
 
07:10:06.110 --> 07:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
boats going too fast regardless of the
 
07:10:07.350 --> 07:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
weight they're putting out whether it's
 
07:10:09.548 --> 07:10:09.558 align:start position:0%
a ski booat going too quickly and Too
 
07:10:12.750 --> 07:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
Close um and so I think this committee
 
07:10:14.830 --> 07:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
would would be well served to spend its
 
07:10:18.230 --> 07:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
time figuring out ways to increase uh
 
07:10:20.270 --> 07:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the existing rules with
 
07:10:24.670 --> 07:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:29.708 --> 07:10:29.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:36.510 --> 07:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:38.708 --> 07:10:38.718 align:start position:0%

representing Lake wiip Baki Association
 
07:12:04.230 --> 07:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
today um so thank you for taking my
 
07:12:07.468 --> 07:12:07.478 align:start position:0%
testimony um we've been lwa has been
 
07:12:09.590 --> 07:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
advocating for the big lake for over 40
 
07:12:12.230 --> 07:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
years um our primary focus is on
 
07:12:15.070 --> 07:12:15.080 align:start position:0%
protecting the water quality of the lake
 
07:12:17.110 --> 07:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
we support the wide variety of uses by
 
07:12:19.388 --> 07:12:19.398 align:start position:0%
motor boers and everybody else unlik
 
07:12:21.948 --> 07:12:21.958 align:start position:0%
wiip as long as as those uses are
 
07:12:24.708 --> 07:12:24.718 align:start position:0%
not disproportionately harmful to water
 
07:12:27.110 --> 07:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
quality um due to the newness of
 
07:12:28.830 --> 07:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
wakeboarding there's not a large body of
 
07:12:32.628 --> 07:12:32.638 align:start position:0%
data on their impact um but we have
 
07:12:34.230 --> 07:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
received dozens of reports from our
 
07:12:36.388 --> 07:12:36.398 align:start position:0%
members and others that they are
 
07:12:38.070 --> 07:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
witnessing seemingly more and
 
07:12:40.750 --> 07:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
significant erosion to the Shoreline and
 
07:12:42.388 --> 07:12:42.398 align:start position:0%
churning of the lake bed in relation to
 
07:12:43.708 --> 07:12:43.718 align:start position:0%
the use of wake
 
07:12:46.468 --> 07:12:46.478 align:start position:0%
boats um those things it's already been
 
07:12:49.628 --> 07:12:49.638 align:start position:0%
covered uh once you start moving
 
07:12:51.030 --> 07:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
sediment around in the water column
 
07:12:52.030 --> 07:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to get all kinds of
 
07:12:54.070 --> 07:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
problems like growing mil foil and algae
 
07:12:56.948 --> 07:12:56.958 align:start position:0%
and plant growth and stuff
 
07:12:59.670 --> 07:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
um so I would just like to point out
 
07:13:01.590 --> 07:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
that the increase in popularity of the
 
07:13:04.910 --> 07:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
Wake boats which is understandable and
 
07:13:07.270 --> 07:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
the increase in residents directly
 
07:13:09.270 --> 07:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
observing changes to their water quality
 
07:13:11.990 --> 07:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
is likely to continue even if you do not
 
07:13:15.030 --> 07:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
act this year setting up all kinds of
 
07:13:17.350 --> 07:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
conflicts between the lake
 
07:13:21.388 --> 07:13:21.398 align:start position:0%
users um so we think that all Lake using
 
07:13:23.468 --> 07:13:23.478 align:start position:0%
constituents voters kayakers swimmers
 
07:13:26.150 --> 07:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
Etc deserve a way to define the issues
 
07:13:27.868 --> 07:13:27.878 align:start position:0%
so that their needs can be addressed
 
07:13:30.670 --> 07:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
whatever way we move forward on that um
 
07:13:33.388 --> 07:13:33.398 align:start position:0%
so lakip Association urges you to
 
07:13:37.830 --> 07:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
support HB 229 in this session thank
 
07:13:40.670 --> 07:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you very

07:16:24.030 --> 07:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
construction management I have spent
 
07:16:26.388 --> 07:16:26.398 align:start position:0%
most of my 22-year career dedicated to
 
07:16:28.628 --> 07:16:28.638 align:start position:0%
improving the environment we live in
 
07:16:29.990 --> 07:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
with that said I would not
 
07:16:31.910 --> 07:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly support a sport that
 
07:16:34.230 --> 07:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
damaged the natural resources we are all
 
07:16:36.150 --> 07:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
so lucky to have in New Hampshire and
 
07:16:38.270 --> 07:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
that I have worked every day to protect
 
07:16:41.110 --> 07:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
and restore I am disappointed that this
 
07:16:43.430 --> 07:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
effort to Define and later potentially
 
07:16:45.910 --> 07:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
ban or restrict wake boats is being led
 
07:16:47.868 --> 07:16:47.878 align:start position:0%
by a loud minority that doesn't like
 
07:16:50.150 --> 07:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
wake boats mainly due to their own
 
07:16:52.388 --> 07:16:52.398 align:start position:0%
personal reasons I even more
 
07:16:54.270 --> 07:16:54.280 align:start position:0%
disappointed than an organization such
 
07:16:56.388 --> 07:16:56.398 align:start position:0%
as New Hampshire Lakes is diverting from
 
07:16:58.190 --> 07:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
their important mission to keep New
 
07:17:00.310 --> 07:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lakes clean and healthy in its
 
07:17:02.590 --> 07:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
willingness to employ its resources and
 
07:17:04.548 --> 07:17:04.558 align:start position:0%
falsely utilize the environment as its
 
07:17:07.350 --> 07:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
rally and cry to regulate wake boats
 
07:17:09.150 --> 07:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
issues they blame on Wake boats such as
 
07:17:12.590 --> 07:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
erosion are impacted far greater by wind
 
07:17:15.150 --> 07:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
ice fluctuating water levels and
 
07:17:18.070 --> 07:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
improper Shoreline development concerns
 
07:17:20.230 --> 07:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
such as invasive species apply to all
 
07:17:20.240 --> 07:17:21.310 align:start position:0%
such as invasive species apply to all
boats

07:17:21.310 --> 07:17:21.320 align:start position:0%
boats
 
07:17:22.910 --> 07:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
however why aren't they as concerned
 
07:17:25.270 --> 07:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
about live wells and bass boats
 
07:17:27.350 --> 07:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
regardless of personal agendas New
 
07:17:28.868 --> 07:17:28.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a state where safe and
 
07:17:31.230 --> 07:17:31.240 align:start position:0%
responsible use of our resources is part
 
07:17:32.788 --> 07:17:32.798 align:start position:0%
of what makes New Hampshire and its
 
07:17:35.948 --> 07:17:35.958 align:start position:0%
recreational economy so great rules and
 
07:17:38.110 --> 07:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
regulations are already in place to
 
07:17:40.190 --> 07:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
allow safe and responsible use of our
 
07:17:42.590 --> 07:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
Water Resources no matter what Pastime
 
07:17:45.310 --> 07:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
you might enjoy in closing more focus
 
07:17:47.230 --> 07:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
should be spent on education and
 
07:17:49.350 --> 07:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement through proper funding of
 
07:17:50.948 --> 07:17:50.958 align:start position:0%
such State organizations as New
 
07:17:53.070 --> 07:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Marine Patrol and less focus
 
07:17:54.990 --> 07:17:55.000 align:start position:0%

07:18:21.590 --> 07:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
minutes I will certainly yes thank you

my name is Shannon Reed I am a full-time
 
07:18:25.990 --> 07:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
resident of epom New Hampshire and I
 
07:18:27.708 --> 07:18:27.718 align:start position:0%
live on Northwood lake with my husband
 
07:18:30.590 --> 07:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
and kids I'm speaking in opposition to

and kids I'm speaking in opposition to
hospital

07:18:31.548 --> 07:18:31.558 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
07:18:33.788 --> 07:18:33.798 align:start position:0%
229 I sent a letter to the committee
 
07:18:35.628 --> 07:18:35.638 align:start position:0%
earlier this week so you have that and I
 
07:18:38.310 --> 07:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
will not repeat what I said here I'll
 
07:18:40.590 --> 07:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
just make three quick points and refer
 
07:18:43.270 --> 07:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
you to my letter for the rest first and
 
07:18:44.910 --> 07:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
most important I believe this bill
 
07:18:47.388 --> 07:18:47.398 align:start position:0%
scapegoats one type of boat instead of
 
07:18:49.030 --> 07:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
setting and enforcing rules for all
 
07:18:51.948 --> 07:18:51.958 align:start position:0%
boter to follow all boers can cause an
 
07:18:54.190 --> 07:18:54.200 align:start position:0%
impact on New Hampshire's Lakes whether
 
07:18:56.230 --> 07:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
it's operators of small fishing boats or
 
07:18:58.110 --> 07:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
kayaks that can spread aquatic weeds by
 
07:19:00.868 --> 07:19:00.878 align:start position:0%
moving from one Lake to another or very
 
07:19:02.590 --> 07:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
large boats that make a big wake no
 
07:19:04.868 --> 07:19:04.878 align:start position:0%
matter what they do any kind of boat
 
07:19:06.670 --> 07:19:06.680 align:start position:0%
that comes too close to Shore or to
 
07:19:09.030 --> 07:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
other people or any boater creating
 
07:19:10.868 --> 07:19:10.878 align:start position:0%
unsafe conditions by not absorbing the
 
07:19:12.948 --> 07:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
rules about sharing our
 
07:19:15.190 --> 07:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
waterways second wake surfing can be
 
07:19:16.868 --> 07:19:16.878 align:start position:0%
done on a variety of different types of
 
07:19:19.510 --> 07:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
boats people are Innovative it's unclear
 
07:19:21.510 --> 07:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
if this bill is even working
 
07:19:23.430 --> 07:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
the bill defines wake surfing which can
 
07:19:26.510 --> 07:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
be accomplished in a variety of ways
 
07:19:28.510 --> 07:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
third the commission last year which
 
07:19:30.468 --> 07:19:30.478 align:start position:0%
studied this issue at length after
 
07:19:32.590 --> 07:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
hearing extensive and well-informed
 
07:19:34.590 --> 07:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
testimony reviewing research and
 
07:19:36.230 --> 07:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully considering this issue from
 
07:19:38.388 --> 07:19:38.398 align:start position:0%
many perspectives the commission
 
07:19:40.468 --> 07:19:40.478 align:start position:0%
expressly declined to recommend the
 
07:19:43.230 --> 07:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
measures in hille 229 but unanimously
 
07:19:43.240 --> 07:19:44.670 align:start position:0%
measures in hille 229 but unanimously
recommended

07:19:44.670 --> 07:19:44.680 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
07:19:47.468 --> 07:19:47.478 align:start position:0%
education on a personal note I can't say
 
07:19:49.468 --> 07:19:49.478 align:start position:0%
enough about how these multi-purpose
 
07:19:51.110 --> 07:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
bootes have brought
 
07:19:53.948 --> 07:19:53.958 align:start position:0%
me really cherished family time I my
 
07:19:55.270 --> 07:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
husband and I have two
 
07:19:57.788 --> 07:19:57.798 align:start position:0%
teenagers as I have gotten older there
 
07:19:59.430 --> 07:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
are a lot of things I can no longer do
 
07:20:01.628 --> 07:20:01.638 align:start position:0%
that I used to love like water skiing
 
07:20:03.510 --> 07:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
surfing is pretty gentle actually and
 
07:20:05.510 --> 07:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
something I can still do at the same
 
07:20:07.670 --> 07:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
time my teenagers love it and this has
 
07:20:09.430 --> 07:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
been almost the one thing that can
 
07:20:11.750 --> 07:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
always peel them away from their screens
 
07:20:13.670 --> 07:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
make them just happy and Outdoors and
 
07:20:15.910 --> 07:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
engaged something we all do and love to
 
07:20:18.150 --> 07:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
do together it gave my daughter
 
07:20:19.788 --> 07:20:19.798 align:start position:0%
confidence it helped my son learn
 
07:20:21.430 --> 07:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
responsibil ability for taking care of
 
07:20:23.350 --> 07:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
something it's created the kind of
 
07:20:24.910 --> 07:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
family memories that will last a
 
07:20:27.230 --> 07:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
lifetime I hope you will not take steps
 
07:20:28.910 --> 07:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
that will eventually make it just a
 
07:20:31.190 --> 07:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
memory but will allow other families to
 
07:20:33.910 --> 07:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
experience what we have voting activity
 
07:20:35.750 --> 07:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
done responsibly can and should be
 
07:20:37.350 --> 07:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
preserved and I hope you will not single
 
07:20:40.350 --> 07:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
out one type of vote against evidence
 
07:20:42.270 --> 07:20:42.280 align:start position:0%

07:23:48.788 --> 07:23:48.798 align:start position:0%
wakeboard and doing so has had them fall
 
07:23:51.110 --> 07:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
in love with new new cure Lakes like I
 
07:23:52.628 --> 07:23:52.638 align:start position:0%
did in my early
 
07:23:55.190 --> 07:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
20s I believe that creating a separate
 
07:23:57.548 --> 07:23:57.558 align:start position:0%
category for Wake boats is completely
 
07:24:00.350 --> 07:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
misguided it is not right to Target wake
 
07:24:03.070 --> 07:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
boats as many non wake boats create
 
07:24:05.990 --> 07:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
similar or even significantly larger
 
07:24:09.628 --> 07:24:09.638 align:start position:0%
wakes than wake boats boats such as bow
 
07:24:13.308 --> 07:24:13.318 align:start position:0%
Riders loaded with people or any large
 
07:24:16.270 --> 07:24:16.280 align:start position:0%
heavy boat creates larger wakes than
 
07:24:20.030 --> 07:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
wake boats to State Wake boats create
 
07:24:23.110 --> 07:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
the largest wakes possible is misleading
 
07:24:25.150 --> 07:24:25.160 align:start position:0%
as many non- wake boats create
 
07:24:28.150 --> 07:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
significantly larger wakes I know there
 
07:24:31.628 --> 07:24:31.638 align:start position:0%
are times that wake booat operators play
 
07:24:34.670 --> 07:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
loud music but the same can be said for
 
07:24:36.910 --> 07:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
pontoon boat operators
 
07:24:39.990 --> 07:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
too it's just not right for Wake boats
 
07:24:41.788 --> 07:24:41.798 align:start position:0%
to be classified differently when
 
07:24:43.670 --> 07:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
clearly this is a first step in
 
07:24:45.990 --> 07:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
targeting them for increased regul
 
07:24:49.350 --> 07:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
regulation for which there is no basis
 
07:24:50.670 --> 07:24:50.680 align:start position:0%
I've been a proud New Hampshire
 
07:24:53.270 --> 07:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
Lakefront landowner and boat owner since
 
07:24:56.150 --> 07:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
1990 and I love New Hampshire's motto of
 
07:24:58.750 --> 07:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die please do everything
 
07:25:00.990 --> 07:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
you can to avoid unnecessary and
 
07:25:04.030 --> 07:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
misplaced first step of targeting reg or
 
07:25:07.350 --> 07:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
targeted regulation of wake boats in our
 
07:25:07.360 --> 07:25:10.150 align:start position:0%
targeted regulation of wake boats in our
free

07:25:10.150 --> 07:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
free
 
07:25:15.350 --> 07:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:17.910 --> 07:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
much Robin
 
07:25:25.110 --> 07:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:29.190 --> 07:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
Shield she's on mute okay all right
 
07:25:31.430 --> 07:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you okay I'm Robin shield and I'm
 
07:25:33.750 --> 07:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
from Center Harbor and during the summer
 
07:25:36.430 --> 07:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
I live uh Lakeside in holderness and I'm
 
07:25:38.350 --> 07:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
here representing myself and my family
 
07:25:40.070 --> 07:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
and I'll speak less than two
 
07:25:43.350 --> 07:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
minutes okay as a lifelong motorboating
 
07:25:45.670 --> 07:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
Enthusiast I support this wake booat
 
07:25:48.150 --> 07:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
defining bill I live on the shore of a
 
07:25:50.150 --> 07:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
particularly popular Cove for water
 
07:25:53.070 --> 07:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
skiing tubing and toe Sports my Cove has
 
07:25:55.910 --> 07:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
a permitted water ski course even I have
 
07:25:57.948 --> 07:25:57.958 align:start position:0%
seen firsthand in practice that wake
 
07:25:59.708 --> 07:25:59.718 align:start position:0%
boats are fundamentally different from
 
07:26:01.628 --> 07:26:01.638 align:start position:0%
other motorboats despite contrary
 
07:26:04.388 --> 07:26:04.398 align:start position:0%
descriptions today I am not anti- motor
 
07:26:06.948 --> 07:26:06.958 align:start position:0%
boating and the family FR fun it brings
 
07:26:09.750 --> 07:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
to our economy my father owns a marina
 
07:26:11.388 --> 07:26:11.398 align:start position:0%
on little Squam so I'm definitely not
 
07:26:13.548 --> 07:26:13.558 align:start position:0%
any motorboating I'd like to tell you
 
07:26:14.830 --> 07:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
what I personally have seen that
 
07:26:16.430 --> 07:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
describes how wake booat waves are
 
07:26:18.628 --> 07:26:18.638 align:start position:0%
different at the shore even when
 
07:26:20.308 --> 07:26:20.318 align:start position:0%
generated from much more more distant
 
07:26:22.910 --> 07:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
than 200 yards from Shore and I wouldn't
 
07:26:24.590 --> 07:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
be here today if Wake boats are just
 
07:26:25.590 --> 07:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
like other
 
07:26:27.868 --> 07:26:27.878 align:start position:0%
boats now though with wake boats I have
 
07:26:29.628 --> 07:26:29.638 align:start position:0%
a situation in which the waves are much
 
07:26:32.948 --> 07:26:32.958 align:start position:0%
larger than even a natural storm Gale
 
07:26:34.468 --> 07:26:34.478 align:start position:0%
could blow up on the particular
 
07:26:37.830 --> 07:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
Shoreline that my property is on this is
 
07:26:39.910 --> 07:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
not the case with other style motorboats
 
07:26:42.628 --> 07:26:42.638 align:start position:0%
Shores cannot withstand the force of
 
07:26:45.230 --> 07:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
that unnaturally High wake it is
 
07:26:46.948 --> 07:26:46.958 align:start position:0%
entirely different from all the other
 
07:26:50.190 --> 07:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
motorboat wake which is considerable in
 
07:26:53.030 --> 07:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
the Cove that I'm in Wake boats are
 
07:26:55.190 --> 07:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
different my hundred-year-old ston wall
 
07:26:57.628 --> 07:26:57.638 align:start position:0%
at the shore had withstood all previous
 
07:27:00.468 --> 07:27:00.478 align:start position:0%
boat activity until now due to the
 
07:27:02.948 --> 07:27:02.958 align:start position:0%
intense sloshing wave action at the
 
07:27:05.788 --> 07:27:05.798 align:start position:0%
shoreline wake booat wake is different
 
07:27:07.750 --> 07:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
so now my boat and dock is sloshed
 
07:27:10.030 --> 07:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
around much more causing me to need to
 
07:27:11.708 --> 07:27:11.718 align:start position:0%
purchase a boat lift to get my boat out
 
07:27:14.430 --> 07:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
of the water spending money to save both
 
07:27:16.708 --> 07:27:16.718 align:start position:0%
my Dock and boat from the tugging and
 
07:27:19.308 --> 07:27:19.318 align:start position:0%
banging from the confused water sloshing
 
07:27:21.990 --> 07:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
at the Shore wake booat wake is
 
07:27:23.750 --> 07:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
different the shoreline sediments are
 
07:27:26.110 --> 07:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
being disrupted and washed into the lake
 
07:27:28.070 --> 07:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
at the shoreline the natural shrub
 
07:27:29.910 --> 07:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
Shoreline The Roots the little plant
 
07:27:32.150 --> 07:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
life and the sediments are sosed
 
07:27:34.548 --> 07:27:34.558 align:start position:0%
inundated exposed and washed into the
 
07:27:37.150 --> 07:27:37.160 align:start position:0%
lake now many of the reasons that the
 
07:27:39.548 --> 07:27:39.558 align:start position:0%
dees protects the shorelines I'm seeing
 
07:27:42.150 --> 07:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
are being harmed by these unnaturally
 
07:27:44.868 --> 07:27:44.878 align:start position:0%
large wakes much bigger than anything
 
07:27:47.788 --> 07:27:47.798 align:start position:0%
that is blown up by winds in my area of
 
07:27:50.548 --> 07:27:50.558 align:start position:0%
the lake wake boats are different than
 
07:27:52.350 --> 07:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
all other motorboats they're causing New
 
07:27:55.350 --> 07:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
Economic costs to me and environmental
 
07:27:57.190 --> 07:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
damage to the plants and animals in the
 
07:27:59.350 --> 07:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
shallows at the edge of the lake and
 
07:28:01.548 --> 07:28:01.558 align:start position:0%
damage to the Natural community on the
 
07:28:04.030 --> 07:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
shoreline their extra- llarge wake does
 
07:28:06.510 --> 07:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
make them different category of boat and
 
07:28:09.590 --> 07:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
I think they need defining thank
 
07:28:18.590 --> 07:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:18.600 --> 07:28:22.388 align:start position:0%
 
grimas

07:28:22.388 --> 07:28:22.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:22.398 --> 07:28:24.230 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

07:28:24.230 --> 07:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:28:27.830 --> 07:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:33.948 --> 07:28:33.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:37.868 --> 07:28:37.878 align:start position:0%
me floor is yours hi for the record my
 
07:28:40.510 --> 07:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
name is Jody gmis I represent the water
 
07:28:43.070 --> 07:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
sports industry Association I sent to
 
07:28:45.510 --> 07:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
the committee last night a letter from
 
07:28:47.628 --> 07:28:47.638 align:start position:0%
the industry um and want to make sure
 
07:28:49.230 --> 07:28:49.240 align:start position:0%
that you had seen that if not I can make
 
07:28:51.590 --> 07:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
sure send it again couple of points I
 
07:28:52.788 --> 07:28:52.798 align:start position:0%
will make and then be brief because
 
07:28:54.548 --> 07:28:54.558 align:start position:0%
there are others that want to
 
07:28:56.628 --> 07:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
testify first there was a discussion
 
07:28:59.788 --> 07:28:59.798 align:start position:0%
about a Nas BL definition being adopted
 
07:29:00.990 --> 07:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
um at the national level for a
 
07:29:03.110 --> 07:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
definition of wake boo that definition
 
07:29:04.948 --> 07:29:04.958 align:start position:0%
has not been actually adopted it's
 
07:29:07.430 --> 07:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
actually just being discussed um so we
 
07:29:09.308 --> 07:29:09.318 align:start position:0%
ask that you you know consider that that
 
07:29:11.510 --> 07:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
there is no national definition of wakeo
 
07:29:14.350 --> 07:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
at this time while there are discussions
 
07:29:17.510 --> 07:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
um we we would oppose those discussions
 
07:29:19.548 --> 07:29:19.558 align:start position:0%
um and we certainly see that there's
 
07:29:21.628 --> 07:29:21.638 align:start position:0%
what the impact of a definition will do
 
07:29:23.548 --> 07:29:23.558 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is our
 
07:29:26.110 --> 07:29:26.120 align:start position:0%
concern second in the email that I sent
 
07:29:28.388 --> 07:29:28.398 align:start position:0%
there's also a video of the study on
 
07:29:31.150 --> 07:29:31.160 align:start position:0%
wave action that was brought before the
 
07:29:32.990 --> 07:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 137 commission it's a
 
07:29:35.468 --> 07:29:35.478 align:start position:0%
two-minute video I can resend it if
 
07:29:36.868 --> 07:29:36.878 align:start position:0%
anybody would like to see but I think it
 
07:29:39.110 --> 07:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
shows you gives you a good sense of what
 
07:29:40.670 --> 07:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
the waves look like as they come to
 
07:29:42.948 --> 07:29:42.958 align:start position:0%
shore um again it's in the email that I
 
07:29:45.830 --> 07:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
sent and I can certainly follow up again
 
07:29:48.110 --> 07:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
um and then third just another point on
 
07:29:50.270 --> 07:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
the Wake responsibly campaign it's an
 
07:29:53.030 --> 07:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
educational campaign supported by just
 
07:29:55.030 --> 07:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
not only the national associations but
 
07:29:56.868 --> 07:29:56.878 align:start position:0%
also the local New Hampshire dealers and
 
07:30:00.548 --> 07:30:00.558 align:start position:0%
voters um that education campaign kicked
 
07:30:02.708 --> 07:30:02.718 align:start position:0%
off uh quite honestly in the middle of
 
07:30:05.308 --> 07:30:05.318 align:start position:0%
the summer after house schille 137 um
 
07:30:07.708 --> 07:30:07.718 align:start position:0%
came up with its recommendations that
 
07:30:09.270 --> 07:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
campaign is going to go into full effect
 
07:30:11.548 --> 07:30:11.558 align:start position:0%
and we believe that campaign with again
 
07:30:14.030 --> 07:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
asking wake Surfers to do so 200 feet
 
07:30:16.230 --> 07:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
away from Shore as well as the other
 
07:30:18.708 --> 07:30:18.718 align:start position:0%
best practices will go a long way to
 
07:30:20.670 --> 07:30:20.680 align:start position:0%
making sure that everybody is using this
 
07:30:23.590 --> 07:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
the waterways responsibly I am happy to
 
07:30:25.468 --> 07:30:25.478 align:start position:0%
answer any questions I can um if there
 
07:30:26.948 --> 07:30:26.958 align:start position:0%
are questions that you need further
 
07:30:28.510 --> 07:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
followup I'm happy to get those answers
 
07:30:30.670 --> 07:30:30.680 align:start position:0%
for you but I appreciate your time and

07:30:59.510 --> 07:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
do Hampshire I'm here representing
 
07:31:04.110 --> 07:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
myself um uh Amy my family uh Amy and
 
07:31:06.990 --> 07:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
Alexia we live on the Bellamy River in
 
07:31:10.110 --> 07:31:10.120 align:start position:0%
the Great Bay Area um so we're on the
 
07:31:12.830 --> 07:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
water all the time we have this we have
 
07:31:15.548 --> 07:31:15.558 align:start position:0%
uh we do care about our um our property
 
07:31:18.270 --> 07:31:18.280 align:start position:0%
as well but we also have a wakeboard um
 
07:31:20.628 --> 07:31:20.638 align:start position:0%
boat and we've been both voting for many
 
07:31:23.350 --> 07:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
years myself uh starting 30 years ago
 
07:31:26.788 --> 07:31:26.798 align:start position:0%
and wake surfing for 20 years um I'm not
 
07:31:27.990 --> 07:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
going to repeat the things that have
 
07:31:30.270 --> 07:31:30.280 align:start position:0%
already been discussed but I want to
 
07:31:31.750 --> 07:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
point out some things that haven't been
 
07:31:33.590 --> 07:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
discussed and focused on the definition
 
07:31:35.868 --> 07:31:35.878 align:start position:0%
itself um first of all I'm opposed to
 
07:31:37.468 --> 07:31:37.478 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
07:31:41.190 --> 07:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
229 defining a wake booat to limit wakes
 
07:31:43.150 --> 07:31:43.160 align:start position:0%
is like trying to define a sports car to
 
07:31:46.388 --> 07:31:46.398 align:start position:0%
limit fast cars all cars go fast all
 
07:31:48.948 --> 07:31:48.958 align:start position:0%
boats create can create a big weight you
 
07:31:51.430 --> 07:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
just put enough people on it that's how
 
07:31:53.270 --> 07:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
surfing got started you put a bunch of
 
07:31:55.350 --> 07:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
friends on the boat you created a big
 
07:31:59.070 --> 07:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
wake and you can go wake surfing um this
 
07:32:02.110 --> 07:32:02.120 align:start position:0%
definition instead of creating a
 
07:32:05.270 --> 07:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
definition to go after the Wake boats
 
07:32:07.548 --> 07:32:07.558 align:start position:0%
you enforce the laws like we enforce
 
07:32:07.558 --> 07:32:08.868 align:start position:0%
you enforce the laws like we enforce
speeding

07:32:08.868 --> 07:32:08.878 align:start position:0%
speeding
 
07:32:11.350 --> 07:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
laws where do you draw the line the
 
07:32:13.150 --> 07:32:13.160 align:start position:0%
current definition of wake booat doesn't
 
07:32:16.190 --> 07:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
even capture all current wake boats one
 
07:32:17.830 --> 07:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
feature that hasn't been discussed that
 
07:32:20.590 --> 07:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
one manufacturer makes is a plane it's
 
07:32:22.590 --> 07:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
like a wing underneath the boat that
 
07:32:25.628 --> 07:32:25.638 align:start position:0%
pulls the bow down into the water the
 
07:32:28.030 --> 07:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
definition does not capture
 
07:32:31.110 --> 07:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
that there's other ways that you can uh
 
07:32:32.990 --> 07:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
weigh the boat down that's what makes
 
07:32:36.110 --> 07:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
the Wake the definition therefore is
 
07:32:39.708 --> 07:32:39.718 align:start position:0%
unfair improper and arbitrary it targets
 
07:32:42.230 --> 07:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
only certain manufacturers of boats
 
07:32:44.388 --> 07:32:44.398 align:start position:0%
owners and manufacturers will find a way
 
07:32:46.868 --> 07:32:46.878 align:start position:0%
around the definition the result is that
 
07:32:49.868 --> 07:32:49.878 align:start position:0%
it will not solve the problem the
 
07:32:53.468 --> 07:32:53.478 align:start position:0%
solution educate instead of eradicate
 
07:32:55.788 --> 07:32:55.798 align:start position:0%
people create the big disturbing wakes
 
07:32:58.708 --> 07:32:58.718 align:start position:0%
not the Wake boats it's a few bad apples
 
07:33:01.590 --> 07:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
spoiling the bunch two recent students
 
07:33:03.590 --> 07:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
attending boating certificate course
 
07:33:05.308 --> 07:33:05.318 align:start position:0%
said that they weren't taught that they
 
07:33:08.510 --> 07:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
own their own weake we need to educate
 
07:33:10.388 --> 07:33:10.398 align:start position:0%
we also need to educate Shoreline
 
07:33:12.190 --> 07:33:12.200 align:start position:0%
Property Owners to start parking their
 
07:33:14.548 --> 07:33:14.558 align:start position:0%
boats perpendicular to shore with the
 
07:33:18.150 --> 07:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
bow facing deep water use of moing whips
 
07:33:20.430 --> 07:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
to also prevent boating damage or any of
 
07:33:22.830 --> 07:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
their concerns also educate them on
 
07:33:24.388 --> 07:33:24.398 align:start position:0%
vegetation and things that they can
 
07:33:28.350 --> 07:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
plant to prevent erosion the the the
 
07:33:31.510 --> 07:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
definition is is also I got three
 
07:33:32.750 --> 07:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
important points that haven't been
 
07:33:34.628 --> 07:33:34.638 align:start position:0%
discussed that I would like to discuss
 
07:33:37.910 --> 07:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
if you would please the definition is
 
07:33:41.110 --> 07:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
putting undue burden on Marine Patrol if
 
07:33:43.868 --> 07:33:43.878 align:start position:0%
this is ever turned into a law Marine
 
07:33:45.548 --> 07:33:45.558 align:start position:0%
Patrol would have to be looking for
 
07:33:47.708 --> 07:33:47.718 align:start position:0%
ballast tanks bags compartments
 
07:33:50.190 --> 07:33:50.200 align:start position:0%
containers Plumbing and doing a full
 
07:33:52.548 --> 07:33:52.558 align:start position:0%
search of a boat this is undue burden on
 
07:33:54.830 --> 07:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol and then what is quote
 
07:33:58.510 --> 07:33:58.520 align:start position:0%
unquote A system that is too vague for a
 
07:34:00.150 --> 07:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
definition to be put into this
 
07:34:02.708 --> 07:34:02.718 align:start position:0%
definition even the commission is split
 
07:34:05.270 --> 07:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
on what the definition of wakeboard boat
 
07:34:07.830 --> 07:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
would be we can't it's just way too
 
07:34:10.590 --> 07:34:10.600 align:start position:0%
vague to have a proper definition then
 
07:34:17.910 --> 07:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:19.628 --> 07:34:19.638 align:start position:0%
detain uh
 
07:34:28.990 --> 07:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:32.190 --> 07:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
ashor are you there yep can you hear me
 
07:34:36.270 --> 07:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
now all right uh you've asked for uh 10
 
07:34:38.230 --> 07:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
minutes oh I don't need 10 minutes I
 
07:34:39.948 --> 07:34:39.958 align:start position:0%
didn't know how to estimate it honestly
 
07:34:44.708 --> 07:34:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:47.670 --> 07:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
governor minutes I appreciate it sure
 
07:34:50.190 --> 07:34:50.200 align:start position:0%
sure um good afternoon honorable members
 
07:34:51.670 --> 07:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
of the resource Recreation and
 
07:34:53.308 --> 07:34:53.318 align:start position:0%
development committee thank you for
 
07:34:56.150 --> 07:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
giving me an opportunity to talk today I
 
07:34:59.190 --> 07:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose the house bill 229 I
 
07:35:00.868 --> 07:35:00.878 align:start position:0%
have grave concerns that this bill wants
 
07:35:03.350 --> 07:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
to identify one type of boat to single
 
07:35:05.270 --> 07:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
it out and ultimately ban it or restrict
 
07:35:07.270 --> 07:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
its use on specific lakes and waterways
 
07:35:08.190 --> 07:35:08.200 align:start position:0%
in our
 
07:35:10.350 --> 07:35:10.360 align:start position:0%
state first I want you to know I'm a
 
07:35:12.270 --> 07:35:12.280 align:start position:0%
resident of Guilford New Hampshire and
 
07:35:14.270 --> 07:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
I've lived in the state for 11 years and
 
07:35:16.270 --> 07:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
live on the water in Saunders Bay in
 
07:35:19.150 --> 07:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
Guilford I have 100 feet of Shoreline
 
07:35:20.830 --> 07:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
with a perched beach that is supported
 
07:35:23.070 --> 07:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
with a stone wall a permanent wooden
 
07:35:25.990 --> 07:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
dock a moing and stone
 
07:35:28.548 --> 07:35:28.558 align:start position:0%
Shoreline we have a Mastercraft wake
 
07:35:30.708 --> 07:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
booat this is actually the second that
 
07:35:32.830 --> 07:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
we've had for over 10 years two of them
 
07:35:35.308 --> 07:35:35.318 align:start position:0%
purchased from Silver Sands and Guilford
 
07:35:36.910 --> 07:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
this is a wonderful place to live and
 
07:35:38.670 --> 07:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
raise two daughters I also want to
 
07:35:41.150 --> 07:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
mention with our wake booat that we wake
 
07:35:43.868 --> 07:35:43.878 align:start position:0%
board water ski and two behind our boat
 
07:35:45.948 --> 07:35:45.958 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't put off much of a wake at
 
07:35:49.190 --> 07:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
all nothing more than a typical water
 
07:35:49.200 --> 07:35:50.070 align:start position:0%
all nothing more than a typical water
sports

07:35:50.070 --> 07:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
sports
 
07:35:52.150 --> 07:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
boat to Define our boat would
 
07:35:54.110 --> 07:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
potentially limit all water sports we do
 
07:35:56.030 --> 07:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
with our boat not just wake
 
07:35:59.030 --> 07:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
surfing my understanding is individuals
 
07:36:00.708 --> 07:36:00.718 align:start position:0%
have concerns that wake boats cause
 
07:36:02.948 --> 07:36:02.958 align:start position:0%
erosion of the shoreline have to say I
 
07:36:05.150 --> 07:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
believe the waves caused by the large
 
07:36:07.230 --> 07:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
Carver boats and Yachts over 40 feet
 
07:36:08.510 --> 07:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
even the Mount Washington and the
 
07:36:10.868 --> 07:36:10.878 align:start position:0%
mailboat with a wide beam put off much
 
07:36:13.548 --> 07:36:13.558 align:start position:0%
larger wakes than wake
 
07:36:16.150 --> 07:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
boats I'm just trying to make this
 
07:36:20.190 --> 07:36:20.200 align:start position:0%
smaller for you here um the waves that
 
07:36:22.468 --> 07:36:22.478 align:start position:0%
they put off when they leave the leave
 
07:36:25.510 --> 07:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
the bay we have the marina right to the
 
07:36:28.388 --> 07:36:28.398 align:start position:0%
right of our property it goes to the far
 
07:36:30.868 --> 07:36:30.878 align:start position:0%
reaches of the shoreline of our Bay if a
 
07:36:33.230 --> 07:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
wake surf boat is offshore by at least
 
07:36:35.830 --> 07:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
150 to 200 feet and away from other
 
07:36:38.788 --> 07:36:38.798 align:start position:0%
boers sub borders Kay actors by at least
 
07:36:41.788 --> 07:36:41.798 align:start position:0%
100 feet there shouldn't be any issues
 
07:36:44.150 --> 07:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
we surf on a daily basis in our Bay and
 
07:36:46.070 --> 07:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
have never had an issue with erosion of
 
07:36:49.270 --> 07:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
our walk rock wall our property are any
 
07:36:51.708 --> 07:36:51.718 align:start position:0%
damage to our boats on our permanent
 
07:36:53.590 --> 07:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
dock or the boat that's on our moing in
 
07:36:55.350 --> 07:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
front of our house neither have any of
 
07:36:58.150 --> 07:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
our neighbors when we surf it's at a
 
07:37:00.388 --> 07:37:00.398 align:start position:0%
very low rate of speed only nine to 10
 
07:37:04.910 --> 07:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
miles an hour when our ball
 
07:37:08.708 --> 07:37:08.718 align:start position:0%
yes your two minutes are up okay can I
 
07:37:11.430 --> 07:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
just let me just finish I'm I'm making
 
07:37:15.350 --> 07:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
it smaller just wrap it up yep if we
 
07:37:18.350 --> 07:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
went any faster we would lose our wave
 
07:37:20.990 --> 07:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
and we do not surf in Shallow Waters so
 
07:37:24.350 --> 07:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
we are not causing any sediment issues
 
07:37:26.830 --> 07:37:26.840 align:start position:0%
or stirring up the bottom a nor Easter
 
07:37:29.548 --> 07:37:29.558 align:start position:0%
storm causes far more erasion erosion
 
07:37:31.150 --> 07:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
than a surfing session behind a wake
 
07:37:33.708 --> 07:37:33.718 align:start position:0%
booat and a typical surf session is not
 
07:37:36.388 --> 07:37:36.398 align:start position:0%
more than an hour just so that you know
 
07:37:40.150 --> 07:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
it's a very athletic Sport and we
 
07:37:42.150 --> 07:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have that opportunity and nor
 
07:37:44.308 --> 07:37:44.318 align:start position:0%
would it cause any erosion I just want
 
07:37:46.150 --> 07:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
to let you know that I ask that you do
 
07:37:48.190 --> 07:37:48.200 align:start position:0%
not support any legislation to Define
 
07:37:50.590 --> 07:37:50.600 align:start position:0%
wake surf boats on winaki these boats
 
07:37:52.548 --> 07:37:52.558 align:start position:0%
are used for family cruises across the
 
07:37:55.110 --> 07:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
lake Family Ice Cream run on the lake a
 
07:37:56.510 --> 07:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
date night for dinner they're not just
 
07:37:59.350 --> 07:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
for surfing I thank you to take the time
 
07:38:00.990 --> 07:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
to hear my thoughts and observations and
 
07:38:02.468 --> 07:38:02.478 align:start position:0%
hope it provides you with a positive

able to enjoy my time on Squam as much
 
07:39:04.190 --> 07:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
as those in a boat that creates these
 
07:39:08.270 --> 07:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
large wakes is enjoying their time um th
 
07:39:10.150 --> 07:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
people are debating whether the large
 
07:39:13.150 --> 07:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
wakes cause a problem they do I can no
 
07:39:15.750 --> 07:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
longer sit in my Dock and read a book on
 
07:39:18.708 --> 07:39:18.718 align:start position:0%
a towel I can wave at motor at the the
 
07:39:21.150 --> 07:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
motorboats going by with skiers but when
 
07:39:24.350 --> 07:39:24.360 align:start position:0%
a ballast boat goes by I if I don't get
 
07:39:26.948 --> 07:39:26.958 align:start position:0%
up and get off the dock I am drenched my
 
07:39:29.350 --> 07:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
book is drenched the towel is drenched
 
07:39:31.110 --> 07:39:31.120 align:start position:0%
my grandchildren when they swim in their
 
07:39:33.788 --> 07:39:33.798 align:start position:0%
little floaties on the side of the dock
 
07:39:35.830 --> 07:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh this summer in in fact we were in the
 
07:39:37.948 --> 07:39:37.958 align:start position:0%
Water swimming with them a ballast boat
 
07:39:41.230 --> 07:39:41.240 align:start position:0%
or a wake boat went by and the boat's
 
07:39:44.150 --> 07:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
wave actually knocked the kids under the
 
07:39:46.190 --> 07:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
water even we were there so it was fine
 
07:39:47.990 --> 07:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
I mean it was safe we were there but
 
07:39:50.430 --> 07:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
that is it incredible amount of water it
 
07:39:53.468 --> 07:39:53.478 align:start position:0%
has diminished our ability to enjoy our
 
07:39:56.270 --> 07:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
spot on the lake I don't want to ban
 
07:39:57.910 --> 07:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
anything but there's a place where all
 
07:39:59.628 --> 07:39:59.638 align:start position:0%
of these things can be done
 
07:40:01.788 --> 07:40:01.798 align:start position:0%
appropriately but you can't even have a
 
07:40:03.628 --> 07:40:03.638 align:start position:0%
conversation about it until you
 
07:40:05.388 --> 07:40:05.398 align:start position:0%
understand the difference that these
 
07:40:07.468 --> 07:40:07.478 align:start position:0%
boats are the different kind of boat
 
07:40:09.070 --> 07:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
they are from what has traditionally
 
07:40:10.350 --> 07:40:10.360 align:start position:0%
been on the lake and we've been on the
 
07:40:13.948 --> 07:40:13.958 align:start position:0%
lake 35 years this is a very different
 
07:40:16.910 --> 07:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
phenomenon and it does impact everyone's
 
07:40:19.910 --> 07:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
equal ability to enjoy enjoy the lake
 
07:40:22.670 --> 07:40:22.680 align:start position:0%

on the lake almost every day in the
 
07:41:25.270 --> 07:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
summer months I enjoy our tobo for
 
07:41:27.708 --> 07:41:27.718 align:start position:0%
personal and work related purposes
 
07:41:29.230 --> 07:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
whether it be for cruising the lake

taking clients to showings or teaching

teaching new Surfers of all ages from 7
 
07:41:47.948 --> 07:41:47.958 align:start position:0%
to 70 years old the thrill of Surfing
 
07:41:51.430 --> 07:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
tubing or water skiing on the lake many
 
07:41:53.708 --> 07:41:53.718 align:start position:0%
different types of boats participate in
 
07:41:56.430 --> 07:41:56.440 align:start position:0%
this same recreational sport as towboats
 
07:41:58.308 --> 07:41:58.318 align:start position:0%
a large difference being that inboard
 
07:42:00.750 --> 07:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
motor we've been discussing this allows
 
07:42:02.430 --> 07:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
for the water sport known as wake
 
07:42:03.788 --> 07:42:03.798 align:start position:0%
surfing to take place since the
 
07:42:06.510 --> 07:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
propeller is safe distance underneath
 
07:42:08.110 --> 07:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
wake surfing takes place at an average
 
07:42:10.670 --> 07:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
speed of 10 miles an hour on the wakes
 
07:42:13.788 --> 07:42:13.798 align:start position:0%
wave a three 10 3 to 10 ft from the back
 
07:42:16.150 --> 07:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
of the boat platform there are less boat
 
07:42:18.590 --> 07:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
passes in water than surfing with
 
07:42:21.388 --> 07:42:21.398 align:start position:0%
surfing than any other water sport while
 
07:42:24.070 --> 07:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
wig surfing on a towboat only one side
 
07:42:26.430 --> 07:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
of the boat has a wake wave where the
 
07:42:28.510 --> 07:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
other is minimal resulting with half the
 
07:42:30.350 --> 07:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
impact of any other type of boat that
 
07:42:32.510 --> 07:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
does not have the control of the size of
 
07:42:35.548 --> 07:42:35.558 align:start position:0%
their wave nor on just using one side
 
07:42:38.430 --> 07:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
for waves in the real estate world it is
 
07:42:40.270 --> 07:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
my experience that many buyers are
 
07:42:42.150 --> 07:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
looking to move here to enjoy all the
 
07:42:44.670 --> 07:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
Lakes have to offer including water
 
07:42:47.308 --> 07:42:47.318 align:start position:0%
sports using all kinds of boats they
 
07:42:49.070 --> 07:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
want the recreation Lake Life water
 
07:42:52.270 --> 07:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
sports particularly wake surfing and if
 
07:42:54.230 --> 07:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
they were to be affected I know buyers
 
07:42:56.708 --> 07:42:56.718 align:start position:0%
would begin looking elsewhere when it
 
07:42:59.590 --> 07:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
comes okay your time is
 
07:43:02.830 --> 07:43:02.840 align:start position:0%

employees we we oppos this uh proposed
 
07:43:46.468 --> 07:43:46.478 align:start position:0%
legislation I I am however sympathetic
 
07:43:50.430 --> 07:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
to uh the individual that uh that that
 
07:43:53.270 --> 07:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
are proposing uh the legislation I
 
07:43:56.110 --> 07:43:56.120 align:start position:0%
understand that um you know large waves
 
07:43:58.670 --> 07:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
and repetitive passes and loud music
 
07:44:01.868 --> 07:44:01.878 align:start position:0%
these things are um you know and they're
 
07:44:04.230 --> 07:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
inconvenient um in some cases they've
 
07:44:06.628 --> 07:44:06.638 align:start position:0%
done damage uh to boats and and docks
 
07:44:10.548 --> 07:44:10.558 align:start position:0%
and things um you know I I think that uh
 
07:44:12.590 --> 07:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
other comments and so I'll just be brief
 
07:44:14.350 --> 07:44:14.360 align:start position:0%
uh you know other comments are accurate
 
07:44:18.190 --> 07:44:18.200 align:start position:0%
that um uh you know this is a an
 
07:44:20.708 --> 07:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
education issue uh not necessarily a
 
07:44:23.910 --> 07:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
regulation issue uh imposing additional
 
07:44:27.150 --> 07:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
uh limitations or uh restrictions um
 
07:44:29.308 --> 07:44:29.318 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily prevent um any of
 
07:44:31.190 --> 07:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
these things from happening and so I'm
 
07:44:33.350 --> 07:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
excited to work with uh individuals that
 
07:44:35.150 --> 07:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
want to point their time and energy and
 
07:44:38.670 --> 07:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
resources to uh creating opportunities
 
07:44:41.990 --> 07:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
to educate uh and influence behavior for
 
07:44:44.750 --> 07:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
the voters and voter voting public um
 
07:44:47.190 --> 07:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
you know to uh better utilize their
 
07:44:49.990 --> 07:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
equipment more uh closely follow the
 
07:44:52.830 --> 07:44:52.840 align:start position:0%

07:46:11.548 --> 07:46:11.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak my name is Karen
 
07:46:12.990 --> 07:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
Maya and I'm a mother of three kids
 
07:46:14.948 --> 07:46:14.958 align:start position:0%
under five and I'm a resident of Bedford
 
07:46:16.868 --> 07:46:16.878 align:start position:0%
I've been boting my entire life on lakes
 
07:46:19.510 --> 07:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
in our great state I oppose House Bill
 
07:46:22.190 --> 07:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
229 to Define wake votes because I
 
07:46:23.628 --> 07:46:23.638 align:start position:0%
honestly don't believe it'll solve any
 
07:46:25.190 --> 07:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
of the issues brought forward by
 
07:46:28.270 --> 07:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
proponents of the bill before us today I
 
07:46:29.670 --> 07:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
believe this is the first step to
 
07:46:31.548 --> 07:46:31.558 align:start position:0%
restricting the access to our
 
07:46:33.308 --> 07:46:33.318 align:start position:0%
outstanding natural resources to only
 
07:46:35.350 --> 07:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
certain activities while the problems
 
07:46:36.830 --> 07:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
that proponents who have spoken ahead of
 
07:46:38.430 --> 07:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
me brought forward will continue to
 
07:46:40.788 --> 07:46:40.798 align:start position:0%
exist despite more laws in the books I
 
07:46:42.708 --> 07:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
firmly believe Boer education is much
 
07:46:44.190 --> 07:46:44.200 align:start position:0%
more critical than legislation when it
 
07:46:45.590 --> 07:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
comes to safety and courteously
 
07:46:47.948 --> 07:46:47.958 align:start position:0%
navigating our Waters my family
 
07:46:49.230 --> 07:46:49.240 align:start position:0%
participates in multiple toad water
 
07:46:51.110 --> 07:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
sports including water skiing wake
 
07:46:53.430 --> 07:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
boarding wake surfing others as we teach
 
07:46:55.388 --> 07:46:55.398 align:start position:0%
our kids to love the lake life our boat
 
07:46:56.948 --> 07:46:56.958 align:start position:0%
would be defined as a wake boat with
 
07:46:58.548 --> 07:46:58.558 align:start position:0%
this definition but by no means is it
 
07:47:00.830 --> 07:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
only a wake boat we use our boat to take
 
07:47:02.548 --> 07:47:02.558 align:start position:0%
folks in the disabled Community water
 
07:47:04.190 --> 07:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
skiing in partnership with North East
 
07:47:06.628 --> 07:47:06.638 align:start position:0%
passage out of Durham we like so many
 
07:47:08.350 --> 07:47:08.360 align:start position:0%
others we know use our boat for cruising
 
07:47:10.308 --> 07:47:10.318 align:start position:0%
floating date nights and so much more we
 
07:47:11.868 --> 07:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
have three generations getting enjoyment
 
07:47:13.468 --> 07:47:13.478 align:start position:0%
from our boat and especially this past
 
07:47:15.388 --> 07:47:15.398 align:start position:0%
summer it was such a great outlet for
 
07:47:18.270 --> 07:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
our mental health and to be together in
 
07:47:20.270 --> 07:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
our Bay there are generally multiple
 
07:47:22.230 --> 07:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
towboats out and we have had neighbors
 
07:47:23.510 --> 07:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
purchase new towboats over the last
 
07:47:25.110 --> 07:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
several years in our experience
 
07:47:26.510 --> 07:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
educating our neighbors has been the
 
07:47:28.510 --> 07:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
most effective way to ensure that all of
 
07:47:30.110 --> 07:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
us have a great time safely and with
 
07:47:31.910 --> 07:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
respect for our surrounding neighbors
 
07:47:33.708 --> 07:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
Boer education is Paramount because we
 
07:47:35.868 --> 07:47:35.878 align:start position:0%
already have laws on the books the 150
 
07:47:37.468 --> 07:47:37.478 align:start position:0%
foot safe passage that ensures our
 
07:47:39.548 --> 07:47:39.558 align:start position:0%
waters are safe and these laws apply to
 
07:47:41.868 --> 07:47:41.878 align:start position:0%
all boats I ask this committee to not
 
07:47:43.788 --> 07:47:43.798 align:start position:0%
focus on singling out a particular style
 
07:47:46.590 --> 07:47:46.600 align:start position:0%
of boat that is not well understood or
 
07:47:48.948 --> 07:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
quite frankly simple to at all but to
 
07:47:51.110 --> 07:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
focus on educating voters and enforcing
 
07:47:52.948 --> 07:47:52.958 align:start position:0%
the laws that we already have this is
 
07:47:53.948 --> 07:47:53.958 align:start position:0%
where the real difference and
 
07:47:55.270 --> 07:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
Improvement to our New Hampshire
 
07:47:57.070 --> 07:47:57.080 align:start position:0%

just hang out and swim I have found that
 
07:48:59.110 --> 07:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
it's the best way to spend quality time
 
07:49:01.430 --> 07:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
with the kids their families their
 
07:49:03.750 --> 07:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
friends um and I think that this is a
 
07:49:05.468 --> 07:49:05.478 align:start position:0%
great diversion from the craziness of
 
07:49:07.388 --> 07:49:07.398 align:start position:0%
today's world and keeps the screen time
 
07:49:09.510 --> 07:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
down for the kids and gets them outside
 
07:49:11.990 --> 07:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
engaging in outdoor activities with

friends and family my wife and I have
 
07:49:15.308 --> 07:49:15.318 align:start position:0%

with the kids in their families and has
 
07:49:18.590 --> 07:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
really helped develop great
 
07:49:20.948 --> 07:49:20.958 align:start position:0%
relationships with their friends and get
 
07:49:23.830 --> 07:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
to know more I've spent the last year as
 
07:49:26.110 --> 07:49:26.120 align:start position:0%
a member of the House Bill 137
 
07:49:27.350 --> 07:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
commission where we heard a lot of
 
07:49:29.670 --> 07:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
testimony regarding wake boats it was
 
07:49:32.150 --> 07:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
clear that the complaints we heard were
 
07:49:34.110 --> 07:49:34.120 align:start position:0%
the result of negligent operators
 
07:49:36.190 --> 07:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
usually going too close to shore when
 
07:49:38.548 --> 07:49:38.558 align:start position:0%
participating in water sports after
 
07:49:40.750 --> 07:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
almost a year of work we came to the
 
07:49:43.510 --> 07:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation to support HB
 
07:49:45.948 --> 07:49:45.958 align:start position:0%
115 which we spoke about earlier today
 
07:49:48.110 --> 07:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
the bill about wake surf and safety we
 
07:49:49.868 --> 07:49:49.878 align:start position:0%
did not come to a recommendation on
 
07:49:52.628 --> 07:49:52.638 align:start position:0%
defining wake boat because the def to
 
07:49:54.750 --> 07:49:54.760 align:start position:0%
Define wake boats is the wrong approach
 
07:49:56.190 --> 07:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
I feel that the boats are not the
 
07:49:58.548 --> 07:49:58.558 align:start position:0%
problem it is the education of the users
 
07:50:01.708 --> 07:50:01.718 align:start position:0%
more emphas emphasis needs to be put on
 
07:50:04.308 --> 07:50:04.318 align:start position:0%
education um rather than trying to
 
07:50:08.270 --> 07:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
Define what a wake boat is uh real world
 
07:50:10.350 --> 07:50:10.360 align:start position:0%
example we had a boater who lives on our
 
07:50:12.468 --> 07:50:12.478 align:start position:0%
Lake that was upset in a few homeowners
 
07:50:14.030 --> 07:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
because they were going too close to the
 
07:50:15.830 --> 07:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
shore and going on the same path each
 
07:50:18.110 --> 07:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
time I spoke with the boat owner owner
 
07:50:19.430 --> 07:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
and made him aware of the people's
 
07:50:22.510 --> 07:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
concern with this repeated boat path and
 
07:50:24.948 --> 07:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
the requirement to be 150 ft or greater
 
07:50:27.868 --> 07:50:27.878 align:start position:0%
from Shore or other boats the boat was
 
07:50:29.670 --> 07:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
appreciative as he did not realize that
 
07:50:32.110 --> 07:50:32.120 align:start position:0%
he was causing an issue I let him know
 
07:50:34.350 --> 07:50:34.360 align:start position:0%
that he needed to be at least 150 F feet
 
07:50:36.190 --> 07:50:36.200 align:start position:0%
from Shore and to change his boat path
 
07:50:38.910 --> 07:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
each pass the boater has altered his way
 
07:50:43.590 --> 07:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
and is now Towing um and stays 150 ft or
 
07:50:45.590 --> 07:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
more from Shore as required does not
 
07:50:47.628 --> 07:50:47.638 align:start position:0%
stay in the same boat path this was a
 
07:50:50.070 --> 07:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
wiwin situation the homeowners are
 
07:50:51.750 --> 07:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
happier the Boer is enjoying time with
 
07:50:55.430 --> 07:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:50:59.430 --> 07:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
lake I think your time has has expired
 
07:51:02.750 --> 07:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:09.388 --> 07:51:09.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:14.510 --> 07:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
Witcher you got yeah Michael Witcher yep
 
07:51:15.548 --> 07:51:15.558 align:start position:0%

07:51:23.308 --> 07:51:23.318 align:start position:0%
it short um my name is Michael Witcher
 
07:51:25.868 --> 07:51:25.878 align:start position:0%
uh I live in straford New Hampshire I
 
07:51:27.150 --> 07:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
boat on B
 
07:51:31.910 --> 07:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
Lake I'll speak for under a minute the
 
07:51:35.590 --> 07:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
um I just want to say I am opposed to
 
07:51:38.868 --> 07:51:38.878 align:start position:0%
this bill uh I am a toeo operator on B
 
07:51:42.548 --> 07:51:42.558 align:start position:0%
Lake um I won't go on to say everything
 
07:51:43.990 --> 07:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
everyone else has already said to save
 
07:51:47.628 --> 07:51:47.638 align:start position:0%
your time and move on to the next person
 
07:51:49.110 --> 07:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
but I
 
07:51:51.830 --> 07:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
believe that this would lead its way to
 
07:51:55.548 --> 07:51:55.558 align:start position:0%
regulate towboats and be a negative
 
07:51:59.468 --> 07:51:59.478 align:start position:0%
thing in the future thank you thank you

because everybody has said everything
 
07:52:42.468 --> 07:52:42.478 align:start position:0%
perfectly uh my name is hail col Tucker
 
07:52:44.910 --> 07:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
I live in New London New Hampshire with
 
07:52:46.868 --> 07:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
my wife Erica and three kids we boat on
 
07:52:46.878 --> 07:52:48.510 align:start position:0%
my wife Erica and three kids we boat on
Lake

07:52:48.510 --> 07:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
Lake
 
07:52:50.708 --> 07:52:50.718 align:start position:0%
uh been boting on Lake sopy for the past
 
07:52:53.070 --> 07:52:53.080 align:start position:0%
five years um we're small business
 
07:52:54.990 --> 07:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
owners in the State uh we operate
 
07:52:56.708 --> 07:52:56.718 align:start position:0%
restaurants throughout the state and we
 
07:52:58.430 --> 07:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
love New Hampshire and we love boating
 
07:53:00.350 --> 07:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so we are here to
 
07:53:03.590 --> 07:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose House Bill 229 uh which
 
07:53:05.830 --> 07:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
looks to single out wake boats uh and I
 
07:53:08.150 --> 07:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
think will undoubtedly pave the way for
 
07:53:10.230 --> 07:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
further restrictions um I think we can
 
07:53:13.388 --> 07:53:13.398 align:start position:0%
see where this is all headed um I I had
 
07:53:15.670 --> 07:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
a long presentation and I'll and I'll um
 
07:53:18.510 --> 07:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
submit that to the committee um
 
07:53:21.910 --> 07:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
later but the key points are um please
 
07:53:24.190 --> 07:53:24.200 align:start position:0%
do not let the actions of a few speak
 
07:53:28.590 --> 07:53:28.600 align:start position:0%
for the many um I participate in uh
 
07:53:31.070 --> 07:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
boating in Lake sopy with a large
 
07:53:33.308 --> 07:53:33.318 align:start position:0%
community of like-minded people who
 
07:53:37.910 --> 07:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
favor education um over restrictions and
 
07:53:40.670 --> 07:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
just when the the Wake responsibility
 
07:53:43.150 --> 07:53:43.160 align:start position:0%
campaign came out this year um I talked
 
07:53:45.388 --> 07:53:45.398 align:start position:0%
to everybody that I could about the key
 
07:53:48.230 --> 07:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
pillars of that campaign um and I think
 
07:53:50.190 --> 07:53:50.200 align:start position:0%
those type of
 
07:53:53.628 --> 07:53:53.638 align:start position:0%
educational um opportunities make a lot
 
07:53:55.070 --> 07:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
of sense and I think that what you'll
 
07:53:57.468 --> 07:53:57.478 align:start position:0%
find is the wake surf Community are
 
07:53:59.070 --> 07:53:59.080 align:start position:0%
like-minded people they're people that
 
07:54:02.308 --> 07:54:02.318 align:start position:0%
are just out trying to enjoy time with
 
07:54:04.270 --> 07:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
their families and have a true Lust For
 
07:54:06.750 --> 07:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
Life and they don't want to lose that
 
07:54:08.990 --> 07:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
and so educational opportunities
 
07:54:11.030 --> 07:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
everything that they can do to to
 
07:54:15.070 --> 07:54:15.080 align:start position:0%
further the sport um they will do it um
 
07:54:17.868 --> 07:54:17.878 align:start position:0%
and lastly I've had a unique opportunity
 
07:54:20.708 --> 07:54:20.718 align:start position:0%
to see the wak surf Community um across
 
07:54:22.030 --> 07:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
the country my son actually got
 
07:54:24.910 --> 07:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
extremely passionate about it and uh
 
07:54:27.430 --> 07:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
wakfs in competitions across the country
 
07:54:29.110 --> 07:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
and I'll say the entire wak surf
 
07:54:31.350 --> 07:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
Community across the country is like
 
07:54:33.230 --> 07:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
that um we want to see the sport
 
07:54:35.468 --> 07:54:35.478 align:start position:0%
continue to progress it's not going
 
07:54:37.670 --> 07:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
anywhere um so let's make sure we do
 
07:54:39.830 --> 07:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
everything we can to to promote
 
07:54:42.388 --> 07:54:42.398 align:start position:0%
education um and that's that's all I
 
07:54:46.070 --> 07:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
have thank you very much the uh that is
 
07:54:48.830 --> 07:54:48.840 align:start position:0%

Dennis

07:55:28.788 --> 07:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
Dennis
 
07:55:31.590 --> 07:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
staco I would like to state that I
 
07:55:33.350 --> 07:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
oppose House Bill
 
07:55:36.910 --> 07:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
229 my family and I uh vat up on
 
07:55:39.510 --> 07:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
Milton's three ponds in Milton New
 
07:55:42.948 --> 07:55:42.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh and I also agree with what
 
07:55:45.430 --> 07:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
other folks have said about education I
 
07:55:49.270 --> 07:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
believe education is the key to uh you
 
07:55:52.948 --> 07:55:52.958 align:start position:0%
know uh safe boating conservative
 
07:55:55.430 --> 07:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
boating I I believe that there are rules
 
07:55:57.468 --> 07:55:57.478 align:start position:0%
and regulations already in place about
 
07:55:57.478 --> 07:55:58.708 align:start position:0%
and regulations already in place about
Shoreline

07:55:58.708 --> 07:55:58.718 align:start position:0%
Shoreline
 
07:56:02.750 --> 07:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
protection um I I don't think that wake
 
07:56:06.910 --> 07:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
voting uh diminishes the the shoreline I
 
07:56:10.350 --> 07:56:10.360 align:start position:0%
believe that it's unjust to classify one
 
07:56:13.190 --> 07:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
single type of boat or one single type
 
07:56:17.350 --> 07:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
of toe boo uh I agree with the majority
 
07:56:19.190 --> 07:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
of the speakers that have already spoken
 
07:56:21.948 --> 07:56:21.958 align:start position:0%

give your
 
07:57:26.430 --> 07:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:28.750 --> 07:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
fratkin did you spell
 
07:57:35.468 --> 07:57:35.478 align:start position:0%
that f r a d k i n okay all right all
 
07:57:37.150 --> 07:57:37.160 align:start position:0%
right just
 
07:57:39.468 --> 07:57:39.478 align:start position:0%
just just literally to take a minute my
 
07:57:41.150 --> 07:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
name is Dan fratkin I'm a resident of
 
07:57:44.150 --> 07:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
molten Boro uh live on the shoreline so
 
07:57:47.270 --> 07:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
very sensitive to wakes and Lake life
 
07:57:49.110 --> 07:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
our whole family's been through Boer
 
07:57:51.750 --> 07:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
education and our basic understanding is
 
07:57:53.350 --> 07:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
is that you can have fun as long as your
 
07:57:55.750 --> 07:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
fun doesn't disrupt other people and
 
07:57:57.150 --> 07:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
that's how we've tried to
 
07:58:02.230 --> 07:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
operate um so I wanted to really not
 
07:58:03.750 --> 07:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
repeat everyone else's point but I think
 
07:58:05.750 --> 07:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
the main thing is it's the boater not
 
07:58:08.430 --> 07:58:08.440 align:start position:0%
the boat we've all seen people on jet
 
07:58:10.270 --> 07:58:10.280 align:start position:0%
skis disrupting the fun of others we've
 
07:58:13.190 --> 07:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
seen people on Big high-speed boats and
 
07:58:16.030 --> 07:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
they can disturb others uh the the the
 
07:58:18.430 --> 07:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
courtesy and the all of that is more
 
07:58:20.830 --> 07:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
important than what is made on the boat
 
07:58:23.030 --> 07:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
personally I would be I'm I'm all with
 
07:58:24.830 --> 07:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
everyone else on the education and
 
07:58:27.270 --> 07:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement and I think perhaps when you
 
07:58:28.868 --> 07:58:28.878 align:start position:0%
register one of these boats you have to
 
07:58:30.830 --> 07:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
say I agree to do these things if there
 
07:58:33.110 --> 07:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
are repeated violations we need to deal
 
07:58:34.948 --> 07:58:34.958 align:start position:0%
with those violators more than we need
 
07:58:37.590 --> 07:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
to deal with a particular class of boats
 
07:58:41.628 --> 07:58:41.638 align:start position:0%
so let me just wrap it up there and um
 
07:58:43.230 --> 07:58:43.240 align:start position:0%
and just say that I I think everyone
 
07:58:45.308 --> 07:58:45.318 align:start position:0%
needs to operate responsibly but taking
 
07:58:47.548 --> 07:58:47.558 align:start position:0%
a class of boats that seems difficult to
 
07:58:50.670 --> 07:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
Define and creating limitations for that
 
07:58:53.150 --> 07:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
is not the right direction so I speak in
 
07:58:54.590 --> 07:58:54.600 align:start position:0%
opposition to the
 
07:58:57.910 --> 07:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you very much that's that's
 
07:58:59.510 --> 07:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
the last
 
07:59:05.468 --> 07:59:05.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:11.270 --> 07:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
have 100 support the bill and
 
07:59:15.830 --> 07:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:15.840 --> 07:59:22.510 align:start position:0%
 
billly

07:59:22.510 --> 07:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
