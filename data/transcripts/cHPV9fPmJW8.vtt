00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 align:start position:0%
provide the committee with a copy of the
 
00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
stakeholder membership of the solid
 
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
waste working group which basically um
 
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
we have representa representatives from
 
00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
um uh landfill operators
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
recyclers uh
 
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities we have someone from UNH
 
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
we have many many people so what I bring
 
00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:57.319 align:start position:0%
forward um a bill that is supported by
 
00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 align:start position:0%
the solid waste working group I think
 
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that um it's a
 
00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 align:start position:0%
bill that has broad support within the
 
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
industry and within the various
 
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.589 align:start position:0%
industry and within the various
stakeholder

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
stakeholder
 
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
groups um this bill uh as I said would
 
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
create a postc consumer paint
 
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
stewardship program it's a fully
 
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill as you can see um and it
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
follows the Prototype that's used in
 
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
many other states by paint manufacturers
 
00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
and the related stewardship
 
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
organizations it is uh supported by the
 
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
paint industry and there is a
 
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
representative of the American codings
 
00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
association with us today who can talk
 
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh to you about the program in much
 
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
greater detail than I can but as an
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
overview uh consumers can bring their
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
leftover paint and related products to
 
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
participating retailers
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
there's absolutely no requirement that
 
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 align:start position:0%
the retailers participate it is
 
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
voluntary and folks can come and bring
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
their paint there for recycling
 
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.150 align:start position:0%
their paint there for recycling
similarly

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
similarly
 
00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities which host uh expensive
 
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
Hol household hazardous waste collection
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
days which many of you may be familiar
 
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 align:start position:0%
with can turn over the paint That's
 
00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:26.199 align:start position:0%
brought in for disposal by their
 
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
residents to the manufacturer created
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
steward ship Organization for
 
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
recycling I will say and you'll you'll
 
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
hear more about this about half of all
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
households hazardous waste I'm going to
 
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
call it hHw because easier to say um
 
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
that's collected is paint and in
 
00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:48.759 align:start position:0%
addition to uh the ability of consumers
 
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
to bring in their paint for recycling
 
00:07:54.029 --> 00:07:54.039 align:start position:0%
businesses can also bring in their paint
 
00:07:56.149 --> 00:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
for recycling and that includes small
 
00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
and large entities once the program is
 
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
up and running as I said anyone can
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
bring in their paint for recycling and
 
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
it is true that uh you can bring it you
 
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
can bring all the paint that you have
 
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
gathering in your basement to the uh
 
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
program for
 
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
recycling even if you bought the uh the
 
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
um substances prior to the program being
 
00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:27.039 align:start position:0%
initiated there is a small search charge
 
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
on the paint That's charged at the point
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
of purch purch that funds the program
 
00:08:34.509 --> 00:08:34.519 align:start position:0%
and it's payable at the time of sale the
 
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
sear charges help to fund the program
 
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
and those uh sear charges and we've
 
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
worked very closely with Dees on this
 
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:45.320 align:start position:0%
bill would entirely defay any
 
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
administrative expenses by Dees and what
 
00:08:51.389 --> 00:08:51.399 align:start position:0%
you can see uh from the fiscal note
 
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
those expenses are very minimal about
 
00:08:59.910 --> 00:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
$50,000 and actually uh there's very
 
00:09:03.069 --> 00:09:03.079 align:start position:0%
little um administrative responsibility
 
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
that for falls on the
 
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
agency um as I mentioned we worked
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
closely with Dees in the development of
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
the bill we did get their technical
 
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
advice um over the course of quite a few
 
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
drafts um and their input on the
 
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
structure and implementation plan for
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
the bill and uh the staff is here today
 
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
to respond to any specific questions the
 
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
committee might have from from their
 
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.470 align:start position:0%
committee might have from from their
stand

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
stand
 
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
point we work very
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
collaboratively um with industry and
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
with the agency in the development of
 
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
that bill so the next important thing is
 
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
to just note the dees recently adopted a
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
new Solid Waste Management plan to help
 
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
guide the state through its solid waste
 
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
management issues and challenges over
 
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
the next several years one of the
 
00:09:58.910 --> 00:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
important uh goals or purposes of the
 
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group is to work
 
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:05.240 align:start position:0%
with Dees just generally as a resource
 
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
for them but also to help put fourth
 
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
legislation that supports the goals of
 
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
the solid waste management plan this
 
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959 align:start position:0%
bill supports the goals of the diversion
 
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
of um hazardous waste as well just for
 
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
recycling and also it diverts it from um
 
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
from being put in landfills over time
 
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
additionally it should help with
 
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
improper dumping of paint and paint
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
related products our groundwater and our
 
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
soil obviously isn't a good place for
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
these products paint can contain many
 
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839 align:start position:0%
toxics and unfortunately folks do get
 
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
frustrated trying to figure out what to
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
do with it and sometimes they can um
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
improperly dispose of it and I will say
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
that it's an ongoing uh issue for
 
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:57.160 align:start position:0%
consumers who have paint in their
 
00:10:58.829 --> 00:10:58.839 align:start position:0%
basements they don't know what to do
 
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
with it they really want to do the right
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
thing there we have a regional Facebook
 
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:06.680 align:start position:0%
group in my area and two or three people
 
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
last week POS the question what the heck
 
00:11:11.949 --> 00:11:11.959 align:start position:0%
am I supposed to do with this paint so
 
00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
um it is a common and frequent problem
 
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:17.720 align:start position:0%
and consumers definitely are interested
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
in doing the right thing um the next
 
00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
thing I just want to point out is that
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is both industry and business
 
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
supported um we all benefit when we help
 
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
our citizens appropriately deal with
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
these products as I mentioned the
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
American codings Association
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
representative is here and uh the paint
 
00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:42.200 align:start position:0%
manufacturers agree they've created a
 
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
nonprofit specifically to Steward post
 
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
consumer paint it's called Paint care
 
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
and um as I mentioned we worked with
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
both their industry and Dees in the
 
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
development of the bill so the bill that
 
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
you have before you is is a model for
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
the paint Care Program which uh operates
 
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
throughout the United States many
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
hardware stores uh from a business
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
standpoint they sell they sell paint and
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
there is there is support among uh small
 
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
hardware stores they like this recycling
 
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
program because actually when they bring
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
the paint when folks bring the paint to
 
00:12:29.189 --> 00:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
the retailers um if they choose to part
 
00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:31.519 align:start position:0%
participate the retailers uh folks can
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
bring in their paint um and it builds
 
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
foot traffic for the hardware stores and
 
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
for that reason you find many um smaller
 
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
businesses participating in the takeback
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
program and um they like it a
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
lot um from the standpoint of the bill
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
history this bill uh a similar uh
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
concept of this um idea came before
 
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
House of environment and agriculture
 
00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
last term it passed uh unanimously out
 
00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:09.399 align:start position:0%
of that committee it was on the consent
 
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
calendar and it passed unanimously out
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
of the house last year um the chair of
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
environment and a is here to talk about
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
um her committee's view on the bill and
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
so if you have specific questions there
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
you can ask um you can ask
 
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
her lastly um this benefits
 
00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities it will save tax and it
 
00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
should save tax dollar taxpayer dollars
 
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
and from your own experience you know
 
00:13:45.629 --> 00:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
you know that towns or groups of towns
 
00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
hold periodic household hazardous waste
 
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
collection days and as you also know
 
00:13:54.189 --> 00:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
there can be some uh uh I don't know
 
00:13:57.069 --> 00:13:57.079 align:start position:0%
impatience around those do those those
 
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
days because people want to do the right
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
thing and they only occur at a very
 
00:14:06.189 --> 00:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
periodic basis and as I mentioned paint
 
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
is about half of what is collected
 
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
during those days and what happens is
 
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
the towns sometimes they get Grant
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
programs sometimes they don't or the
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
regions uh operate them they basically
 
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
collect the uh hazardous waste and then
 
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:26.959 align:start position:0%
they have to deal with its disposal they
 
00:14:29.749 --> 00:14:29.759 align:start position:0%
have to pay for it and it's extremely
 
00:14:32.829 --> 00:14:32.839 align:start position:0%
expensive for the towns so um you'll
 
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
also see in the fiscal note while it's
 
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
very hard to estimate um this could be a
 
00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:42.759 align:start position:0%
taxpayer savings
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
um program for our towns and I know that
 
00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
there are folks that can speak more uh
 
00:14:53.069 --> 00:14:53.079 align:start position:0%
definitively about that and also the New
 
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association is
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
supportive of this measure just uh
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
lastly you know once the paint is
 
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
collected it ends up too at these
 
00:15:06.189 --> 00:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
household hazardous waste events um too
 
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
frequently it ends up in landfills along
 
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
with all the containers that it comes in
 
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
the state recently adopted Solid Waste
 
00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
diversion goals we're trying to divert
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
25% in weight from our landfills and
 
00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
waste to energy plants landfills um as
 
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
you know have been a Hot Topic around
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
here and anything that we can do to
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
preserve our uh landfill capacity would
 
00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
be terrific if we can conserve it for
 
00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
those things that really need to be
 
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:39.160 align:start position:0%
landfill because unfortunately some
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
things just do um paint does not have to
 
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
be landfilled and it can be recycled and
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
we should take advantage of recycling
 
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
any commodity that we can and then very
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
lastly uh for the committee um I want to
 
00:15:58.990 --> 00:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
say that this has very broad coalition
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
report we worked very hard to get um to
 
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
get interested parties to step forward
 
00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
to indicate that report I'm proud to
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
present to you a bill that um has been
 
00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
supported not only by the ACA uh but the
 
00:16:19.949 --> 00:16:19.959 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association the
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
national waste recycling Association
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
Waste Management cassella as I mentioned
 
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal
 
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
Association the the conservation law
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
Foundation a Consortium of Statewide en
 
00:16:35.309 --> 00:16:35.319 align:start position:0%
environmental groups that includes the
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
society for the protection of New
 
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Forest nature conservancy and
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
the aabon society among others and I can
 
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
say with some assurity that that there
 
00:16:51.309 --> 00:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
this collection of folks probably hasn't
 
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
stood together um universally supporting
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
a bill many times in the past this
 
00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
indicates that that the management of
 
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
solid waste is neither partisan nor is
 
00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
concerned for it uh just related to
 
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
particular interest groups everybody has
 
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
an issue with solid waste they use
 
00:17:20.029 --> 00:17:20.039 align:start position:0%
products and they generate it and I
 
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
think it behooves all of us to do better
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
with um with our trash so on that basis
 
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm pleased to bring before you a
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
carefully crafted broadly supported
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill and I urge the committee
 
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
to support its passage and I'm happy to
 
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
take any
 
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
spear this is actually a a curiosity
 
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
question when you say that this the
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
paint can be recycled that means when
 
00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
when it goes to one of these collection
 
00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:57.640 align:start position:0%
places it's not going to go in the
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
landfill I I take it and somehow some
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
organization is going to do what with it
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
they're not going to throw it in a
 
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
landfill are they no obviously yeah
 
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
death that's the point of this program
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
um and the the um representative of the
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
ACA is here and she can take talk in
 
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
Greater detail about what happens but
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
basically um the and this is another
 
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
issue for municipalities is the ISS the
 
00:18:26.909 --> 00:18:26.919 align:start position:0%
issue and the cost of hauling but they
 
00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
arrange for the collection from The
 
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
Collection sites and they bring it to a
 
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
recycling facility so from the time that
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
a consumer or a business turns over the
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
paint their responsibility the paint
 
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
care uh organization responsibility
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
kicks in and um they'll take it over and
 
00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
obviously they're supporting this
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
program because they feel that is
 
00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
worthwhile to recycle the paint and um
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
from that standpoint again you know when
 
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
you think about it it's really good to
 
00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:03.559 align:start position:0%
be recycling things that we shouldn't be
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
throwing away representative burrow
 
00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question before I
 
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
do that I just want to say this is an
 
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
amazing piece of work it really is and I
 
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
my hat off to you bringing all these
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
people together um representative spear
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
asked half my question are the buckets
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
thanks representative Henry um is there
 
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
any anything in this program that uh
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
pays people to collect this stuff and
 
00:19:37.149 --> 00:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
in um I'm not quite sure what you mean
 
00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
but the um well actually I was just
 
00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
chatting with the with the ACA
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
representative if and she again can give
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
you more details about that but you're
 
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
if a you're if you're a a large
 
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
generator of paint you can arrange with
 
00:19:57.549 --> 00:19:57.559 align:start position:0%
the with the paint care folks to come
 
00:19:59.310 --> 00:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
and pick up the paint
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
um free of charge but as far as going
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
around and picking it up from
 
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
Individual homeowners or businesses
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
no I mean it's a volume question
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
representative M uh thank you very much
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
real quick question you said that a a
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
paint store or hardware store can
 
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
voluntarily into the program and take it
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
take the paint back would they be a if
 
00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
they didn't V unteer to be in the
 
00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:31.400 align:start position:0%
program would they be allowed to to
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
charge that se charge the SE charge
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
would be a universal SE charge on all
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
paint products sold in the state thank
 
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
you and that's where I want to go I
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
figured okay so we're about to pass a
 
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
sales tax and would you please tell me
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
how this is going to be collected I read
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
in the bill here about the fees read it
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
but I don't uh and I see we got an
 
00:20:59.549 --> 00:20:59.559 align:start position:0%
independent auditor
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure but I just how are we
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
collecting the sales tax and how do we
 
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that every can of paint H is
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh accounted for and and properly taxed
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm not going to refer to it as a
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
sales tax I'm going to refer to it
 
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
because s because the sales tax implies
 
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
that uh it can be used for many purposes
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
in this case it is a sear charge put on
 
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
paint specifically and only for the
 
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
recycling of paint so at the point of
 
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
sale the retailers would be collecting
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
the funds and they would turn it over to
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
whatever system is set up for the
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
collection of those funds and again uh
 
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair definitely uh a good question
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
and I would ask you to ask it to the
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
American codings Association
 
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
representative um but the whole
 
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
structure of the collection of the SE
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
charges is a constrained
 
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
overseen well documented
 
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.950 align:start position:0%
overseen well documented
transparent

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
00:22:14.269 --> 00:22:14.279 align:start position:0%
process uh I'm sure it is in states that
 
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
have a sales tax but for New Hampshire
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
we're now asking every sale uh
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
every you know Home Depot to have a
 
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
field on their system to collect that
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
tax when when the person makes a
 
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
purchase let alone what are we going to
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
do about people who buy it off of Amazon
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
so these are the questions that I will
 
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:39.039 align:start position:0%
have and hopefully you can respond to
 
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
that so the I I again I'll I'll turn
 
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
this over to um Miss mlli but I did see
 
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
that within the body of the within the
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
program it's the retailer can either
 
00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
break it out um as an independent charge
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
or roll it into the overall cost so
 
00:22:58.159 --> 00:22:59.190 align:start position:0%
or roll it into the overall cost so
however

00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
but um I I would ask that you um discuss
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
the retail collection uh
 
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
piece with her well that will be I'm
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
sure you will that would be my my only
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
problem only only issue with it the fact
 
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
volunteer to collect it that's great you
 
00:23:18.669 --> 00:23:18.679 align:start position:0%
good I love volunteer but the the
 
00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
collection of the of the taxes whatever
 
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
oh excuse me the user fee please use the
 
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.110 align:start position:0%
oh excuse me the user fee please use the
right

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
term it is what it is okay okay
 
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
representative bur thanks for taking my
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
question might this be more um um what's
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
the word might it be better to
 
00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
characterize this not as a sales tax but
 
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
as a fee for service well that's exactly
 
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
what it is it's exactly what it is and
 
00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
that's why I said when you talk about
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
taxes those taxes are generally used for
 
00:23:55.149 --> 00:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
many other purposes this is a fee for
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
the for the um for the collection and
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
recyc cycling of the product and you
 
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
know I obviously I knew that this was
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
going to come up and um I think from a
 
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal standpoint it really makes great
 
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
sense for us to be recycling Commodities
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
that otherwise towns and all of us are
 
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
having to pay for to get rid of them and
 
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
um you know it just doesn't make sense
 
00:24:27.789 --> 00:24:27.799 align:start position:0%
to be tossing into landfills and paying
 
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
the Tipping fees things that we could
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
otherwise be reusing um I just think
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a yane thing to do right
 
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
followup well you've already had a
 
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
couple questions so let me have some
 
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
there's a followup I know but she hasn't
 
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
had a question yet
 
00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:47.559 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you thank you very much
 
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
representative burrows for letting me
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
ask a question ahead of you thank you
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you know
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
obviously it's a good idea but I am
 
00:24:57.789 --> 00:24:57.799 align:start position:0%
looking through the bill and I have a
 
00:24:59.269 --> 00:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
couple of question questions about the
 
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
fees the tax on the
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
sale um is one fee there's an
 
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
administrative fee for um collecting and
 
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
then there's an additional part-time
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
environmentalist that will need to be
 
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
hired which will probably go to fulltime
 
00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
as the program gets running so how much
 
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
more is my gallon of paint going to cost
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
and paint is so expensive as it is is
 
00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
this going to really be a hardship for
 
00:25:35.549 --> 00:25:35.559 align:start position:0%
people that want to buy uh paint and do
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
the right thing um well first of all
 
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
just as far as the fee for service I
 
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
like that term is concerned um it's
 
00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
charged at the point of sale I I think
 
00:25:52.029 --> 00:25:52.039 align:start position:0%
the administrative fee that you're that
 
00:25:54.389 --> 00:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
you're talking about are you talking
 
00:25:54.399 --> 00:25:56.789 align:start position:0%
you're talking about are you talking
about

00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
Dees because thing is it's page four um
 
00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:04.950 align:start position:0%
Dees because thing is it's page four um
line

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
31 they'll collectively pay the
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
Department's Administration
 
00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
administrative fee it's the yeah it's
 
00:26:15.549 --> 00:26:15.559 align:start position:0%
the agency so basically let's say um
 
00:26:19.389 --> 00:26:19.399 align:start position:0%
over the course of the program um I
 
00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:22.120 align:start position:0%
don't know let's just say $100,000 is
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
collected within the paint fund um and
 
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.830 align:start position:0%
collected within the paint fund um and
then

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
Dees will figure out what it costs to
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
administer the program and then let's
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
say I don't know we we talked about this
 
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
quite a bit they don't think it's
 
00:26:42.389 --> 00:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
actually going to cost that much but
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
let's just say
 
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
$2500 then is
 
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
transferred as the administrative cost
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
to Dees so there's no additional money
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
being spent it's all coming out of the
 
00:26:59.149 --> 00:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
One Fund which is the the
 
00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
$100,000 so that administrate there's no
 
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
additional administrative fee and I
 
00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
would ask that you um discuss the issue
 
00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:14.799 align:start position:0%
of personnel with um with director
 
00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:18.440 align:start position:0%
whimet who I think is here after seeing
 
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note I had some question as
 
00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
to whether they actually were going to
 
00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:25.559 align:start position:0%
need to hire somebody to do this and he
 
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
thought because the responsibilities of
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
the department Department were minimal
 
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
that it could be absorbed into the
 
00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
department but either way the way this
 
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
is set up um the administrative costs
 
00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:41.480 align:start position:0%
whatever they are for the department
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
will be fully defrayed and one of the
 
00:27:47.549 --> 00:27:47.559 align:start position:0%
things we also talked about in detail
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
because I wanted to make sure that the
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
that the cost to the department uh
 
00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
weren't only paid once the program was
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
up and running I wanted to make sure
 
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
that the costs for the Department in the
 
00:28:03.909 --> 00:28:03.919 align:start position:0%
runup to the development of the program
 
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
were also re um were were paid for and
 
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
so that's been built into the bill so
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
it's from Soup To Nuts the and just sort
 
00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
of recognizing what the revenue
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
situation is in the state of New
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it was really important to
 
00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:22.919 align:start position:0%
make sure that Dees is Administrative
 
00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
costs were covered but again the direct
 
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
answer to your question is the only fee
 
00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
is the fee on the paint and that is
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
circumscribed by the terms of the
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
statute to a to a limited
 
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
amount right so the that helps the
 
00:28:42.269 --> 00:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
simple answer to the question is on page
 
00:28:47.509 --> 00:28:47.519 align:start position:0%
two line 2728 so if you're buying half
 
00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
pint or one gallon it's going to be
 
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
$1.75 Max a gallon but if you buy a uh
 
00:28:58.509 --> 00:28:58.519 align:start position:0%
anything from a two gallon or larger uh
 
00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
you're going to pay $3 per
 
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
gallon okay now representative bur you
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
may ask another question um
 
00:29:09.149 --> 00:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
representative thanks for taking my
 
00:29:11.509 --> 00:29:11.519 align:start position:0%
question has there been any cost benefit
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
analysis to this service fee versus what
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
it would be the cost to clean this stuff
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
all up out of our out of our environment
 
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
if it were just to be dumped um I'm not
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
aware of one but I think it's kind of an
 
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
obvious point that it can be um
 
00:29:30.909 --> 00:29:30.919 align:start position:0%
that it can it can contaminate
 
00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
groundwater if it's not handled properly
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't think there's a lot of us
 
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
that are out there dumping our cans of
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
paint but I mean you just don't know
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
with with bigger users they don't know
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
what to do with it they I
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
mean they might just want to put it in a
 
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
forest somewhere and forget about it so
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
it I mean it it can happen um and I know
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
there's again there's someone here from
 
00:29:58.509 --> 00:29:58.519 align:start position:0%
Dees and there's also some someone here
 
00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
from the American codings Association
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
that can maybe answer more details with
 
00:30:06.509 --> 00:30:06.519 align:start position:0%
that oh we have more questions
 
00:30:08.909 --> 00:30:08.919 align:start position:0%
representative miles thank you Mr
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
question um I just want to make sure I'm
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
clear so there would be no option for a
 
00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
retailer or a consumer to opt in
 
00:30:21.389 --> 00:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
volunteer this fee it would just simply
 
00:30:25.509 --> 00:30:25.519 align:start position:0%
go through as a blanket a blanket tax
 
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
for all retailers and all consumers
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
um in order to make the program work
 
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
that's the way the um the fee is is uh
 
00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
treated yes okay thank you yeah ju uh
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
just a little side um I once we have a
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
summer home in Rhode Island and we went
 
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
in to buy a
 
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
mattress and Rhode Island has a mattress
 
00:30:54.029 --> 00:30:54.039 align:start position:0%
fee charge do we have one of those here
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we don't but it's a
 
00:30:59.710 --> 00:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
it's you know the thing is with
 
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
mattresses I mean we can go down a
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
rabbit hole on mattresses you answered
 
00:31:06.629 --> 00:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
my question you're almost can I just I
 
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
just need to say I'm sorry I'm just
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
going to say it when you when you
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
license landfills they are licensed
 
00:31:15.389 --> 00:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
based on volume and to tell you the
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
truth and there are people here that can
 
00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
talk about it the issue of mattresses is
 
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
huge uh because they occupy massive
 
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
amounts of space in the landfill that
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
again could be used for better purposes
 
00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559 align:start position:0%
and so actually the mattress programs
 
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
are very popular I mean I don't know
 
00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:37.720 align:start position:0%
have you ever disposed of a mattress you
 
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
got to yourself pay 20 or 30 bucks to
 
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
get rid of it right but that's that's at
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
the and you have to have a when I get
 
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
rid of it they I My Town charges me to
 
00:31:52.669 --> 00:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
take that mattress right yeah so there's
 
00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:55.039 align:start position:0%
feed not up front but up back all right
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much thank you the
 
00:31:59.870 --> 00:31:59.880 align:start position:0%

house in that body we've worked on this
 
00:32:59.549 --> 00:32:59.559 align:start position:0%
bill for for at least the past two years
 
00:33:02.669 --> 00:33:02.679 align:start position:0%
or more and it's ready to be passed
 
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
through working with the solid waste
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%

00:33:13.269 --> 00:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
operators and other stakeholders I
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
greatly why should we pass this bill
 
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
what problems does it seek to address
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
and solve first and foremost it is a
 
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
bill that creates a solution ution to
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
keeping toxic paint waste out of our
 
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
landfills which is important because
 
00:33:36.509 --> 00:33:36.519 align:start position:0%
that unused paint buried in landfills
 
00:33:38.669 --> 00:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
will eventually become part of the toxic
 
00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:40.360 align:start position:0%
leachate in our
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
landfills when people have unused paint
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
what do they normally do with it if they
 
00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
don't store it for future use they are
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
told to mix it with kitty litter and let
 
00:33:52.509 --> 00:33:52.519 align:start position:0%
it dry out and then just toss it in the
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
trash that's how it gets into our
 
00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:58.120 align:start position:0%
landfills the other problem that this
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
bill seeks to solve by creating a
 
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
mechanism to recycle paint is that we
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
are saving our municipalities and our
 
00:34:08.109 --> 00:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money because all that dried
 
00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:10.919 align:start position:0%
paint mixed with kitty litter is heavy
 
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
and adds weight to the refu being
 
00:34:15.149 --> 00:34:15.159 align:start position:0%
trucked from our municipalities transfer
 
00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:17.960 align:start position:0%
stations to our landfill
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
facilities recycling makes a lot more
 
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
sense than continuing to dump paint into
 
00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.310 align:start position:0%
sense than continuing to dump paint into
our

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
landfills paint stewardship programs
 
00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
work and by establishing collection
 
00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
points they are easy for our consumers
 
00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
to use once you're done with your paint
 
00:34:37.629 --> 00:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
project you can take any remaining paint
 
00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:39.800 align:start position:0%
and simply drop it off at a place where
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
it can be sent to be
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
recycled you might even be able to
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
purchase that less expensive recycled
 
00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
paint to use for painting a shed or for
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
some other project where you may not
 
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
care what the color is more importantly
 
00:34:56.669 --> 00:34:56.679 align:start position:0%
our paint manufacturers support this
 
00:34:58.589 --> 00:34:58.599 align:start position:0%
program because because they also want
 
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure that their product doesn't
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
end up polluting our landfills and
 
00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
harming the
 
00:35:07.069 --> 00:35:07.079 align:start position:0%
environment as for consumers I've talked
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
to people who have said that they would
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
welcome paying just a little bit more
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
for the paint in order to not to have to
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
worry how to dispose of their leftovers
 
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:19.640 align:start position:0%
and to know that dealing with paint
 
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
that's left over won't be a problem in
 
00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
their transfer stations or end up
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
polluting the
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
environment and for
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
people who consider the modest extra
 
00:35:35.069 --> 00:35:35.079 align:start position:0%
cost of a gallon of paint to be a paint
 
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
tax I would just say that a tax could
 
00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
either be paid towards an incredibly
 
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
sensible recycling program or paid to
 
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
the municipality and trucking fees to
 
00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
bring the dried leftover paint to
 
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
landfills to become toxic leech eight
 
00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:53.720 align:start position:0%
which will later cost the taxpayer much
 
00:35:56.829 --> 00:35:56.839 align:start position:0%
more money to deal with the program
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
outlined in this bill just makes a lot
 
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
of sense and it's a win for
 
00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:04.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturers consumers municipalities
 
00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
and for the environment we put a lot of
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
thought into the all the pieces of this
 
00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
program and this program has operated
 
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
very successfully in other states it's
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
just a win-win all around and I truly
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
hope that you will support this bill and
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
help pass it out of the house just like
 
00:36:26.109 --> 00:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
it was passed the last time thank
 
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
you uh we do have have a question
 
00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:31.750 align:start position:0%
you uh we do have have a question
representative

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:36.280 align:start position:0%
post um my question is when they have
 
00:36:38.309 --> 00:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
the paint they mix it all together put
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
it in a big barrel or whatever it is do
 
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
they clean out the
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
cans so as far as I understand and I
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
guess you know the American coding
 
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
Association can and also people from
 
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
paint cares can clarify but as I
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
understand paint is collected um they
 
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
might put similar white paints together
 
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:02.839 align:start position:0%
and commingle that similar red paints
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
together commingle that and this you
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
know come up with General colors uh for
 
00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
paint that can't be recycled they may
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
send it to a waste to energy plant to be
 
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
burned and used to create energy so
 
00:37:19.309 --> 00:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
there's several different ways that this
 
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
paint is recycled the cans are recycled
 
00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:24.280 align:start position:0%
as well and that's how I understand that
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
the recycling part of it works so so
 
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
they do clean it as far as I understand
 
00:37:32.829 --> 00:37:32.839 align:start position:0%
so then if they clean it are they using
 
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
solutions to prevent it to go going into
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
you know down the drain or when you when
 
00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:41.960 align:start position:0%
you say clean it do you mean like they
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
strain the paint or I'm not quite sure
 
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
we will we'll have the American coding
 
00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:48.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not quite sure they will
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
explain that process how she
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
handles empty cans
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
yeah okay any other questions see none
 
00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you and I
 
00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate you here heing this bill no
 
00:38:08.109 --> 00:38:08.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
Bixby good morning committee members um
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
for the record uh representative Peter
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
Bixby from do straford 13 and ranking
 
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
member of environment and agriculture uh
 
00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
and our committee has heard this bill
 
00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
several times in the last decade decade
 
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
and a half uh and uh the when we had it
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
last year we had the most enthusiasm for
 
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
this bill in our committee that I have
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
ever seen uh ranging from our most
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
conservative members to our most you
 
00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
know liberal members everyone said this
 
00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
is a really good idea it is stupid to
 
00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:49.079 align:start position:0%
just throw paint into a landfill uh and
 
00:38:50.589 --> 00:38:50.599 align:start position:0%
there are much better ways of dealing
 
00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
with it uh
 
00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
so uh it is not surprising that it came
 
00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
out of our committee unanimously uh
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with Amendment the am uh
 
00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:02.440 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we produced was based
 
00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
on the uh the Vermont uh paint care uh
 
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
program that has been running for a
 
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
number of years and when the bill came
 
00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
to the body on the other side of the
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
wall uh the um the uh codings industry
 
00:39:22.109 --> 00:39:22.119 align:start position:0%
pointed out several issues that
 
00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:25.880 align:start position:0%
uh in having observed these bills uh in
 
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
different country different states
 
00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
around the country they over the last um
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
couple decades they have seen what
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
really works what doesn't work quite as
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
well they noted a few things in the
 
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
Vermont model that weren't uh really as
 
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
well suited for Massachusetts they
 
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
suggested that perhaps we wanted to
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
interim study it so that we could come
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
up with an amendment that uh was uh
 
00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
really tailored exactly to New
 
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's needs and Drew on all the
 
00:39:58.349 --> 00:39:58.359 align:start position:0%
experience from from the other states so
 
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh the coding industry worked with a
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
number of stakeholders a number of
 
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:05.720 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh with the es with the
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group over the past
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh since last spring in order to come up
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
with this piece of legislation you see
 
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:17.720 align:start position:0%
before you which uh is really tailored
 
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
towards what we need in New Hampshire
 
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
now uh so uh I think that I was
 
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
disappointed it didn't go all the way
 
00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
through last year but I think that what
 
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
we have in front of us is actually an
 
00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
improved version over the good version
 
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
we had last year so I would on that
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
basis I I'd really urge you to uh carry
 
00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
through on the good work and um and and
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
pass this i' just want to make uh there
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
was some question about um the relative
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
costs of the uh fees that are charged to
 
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
uh at the purchase point for the paint
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
versus what the end costs are uh
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron very well described
 
00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:03.400 align:start position:0%
what happens with latex paint in ter uh
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
in in disposal now which is that uh in
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
order to be willing to take it waste
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
holler uh the the waste hollers want
 
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
that to be filled with kitty litter or
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
sand so that it is no longer liquid but
 
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
is solid so it doesn't spill on the
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
highway when they're driving it to the
 
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
landfill uh which I it's reasonable to
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
they're concerned that it not spill uh
 
00:41:27.069 --> 00:41:27.079 align:start position:0%
but that does add a lot of weight and
 
00:41:29.069 --> 00:41:29.079 align:start position:0%
that weight is reflected in the Tipping
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
fees which are reflected in your
 
00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
contracts with wa with waste hollers at
 
00:41:38.109 --> 00:41:38.119 align:start position:0%
the municipal level so that is that goes
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
onto your property tax another thing
 
00:41:43.069 --> 00:41:43.079 align:start position:0%
that goes onto your property tax at even
 
00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
an even higher rate is the non-latex
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
paint paint oilbased
 
00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
paints uh are classified as Sol as
 
00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste in the State uh because
 
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
of the Sol that they have in them and
 
00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
when you're disposing of hazardous
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
weights the disposal rates are way
 
00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
higher than tipping fees and that also
 
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
goes onto your M Municipal tax bill so
 
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
what one thing that this bill does is it
 
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
redefines for the purpose of
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
recycling the uh the um the oilbased
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
paints as non-hazardous
 
00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
waste through the part of the process
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
where uh it would have to you know clear
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
the the various regulatory barriers to
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
get to the recycling plant uh so by
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
redefining it as as non-hazardous waste
 
00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
I I think there's another specific term
 
00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
that someone from Dees could probably
 
00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
correct me on but that's the general
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
idea by re by reclassifying it it means
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
that the disposal of it is a lot less
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
expensive in fact because it's now in a
 
00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
recycling program the cost of disposing
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
of it is that 75 to .75 you pay uh at
 
00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:05.480 align:start position:0%
the um at the retailer and we have on
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
our committee last year we had one
 
00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
member who does an awful lot of painting
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
in in in one of his uh you know other
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
other professions when he's not working
 
00:43:18.589 --> 00:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
here at the legislature and he said that
 
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
the suggested uh fees for the program
 
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
were really cheap a really cheap way to
 
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
deal with the um cost of and headache of
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
having to deal with leftover
 
00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
paint so I'm willing to take any
 
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
questions guess for question doubt thank
 
00:43:42.589 --> 00:43:42.599 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh chair we'll Now call in
 
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:45.480 align:start position:0%

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
suppliers 95% of the paint that is
 
00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
manufactured in this country is made by
 
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
companies that are members of our trade
 
00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
Association and one of the Hallmarks uh
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
of this program that we're talking about
 
00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
today is that our association came
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
together in the early 2000s with um
 
00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
environmental agencies across the
 
00:44:40.829 --> 00:44:40.839 align:start position:0%
country um environmental groups across
 
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
the country um the product stewardship
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
Institute to sort of develop the
 
00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.079 align:start position:0%
framework for this program um after
 
00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
several years of conversations um on how
 
00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
best to deal with the issue of leftover
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
paint we came up with this solution
 
00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
solution uh this framework solution and
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
we made a commitment that the industry
 
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
would move forward to try to implement
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
this program as a test and we started
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
that test in the state of Oregon we
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
passed this law basically in the state
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
of Oregon as a two-year pilot and um at
 
00:45:18.109 --> 00:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
the end of two years promised to
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
re-evaluate it if it was successful we
 
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
would move forward with a permanent
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
program that was in 2008 that program's
 
00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
been operating successfully ever since
 
00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:31.960 align:start position:0%
and in the meantime we have passed this
 
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
law and implemented programs in 11 other
 
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
states we are currently working on two
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
other states at the moment that will
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
come online and launch programs in
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
2025 um really thrilled to hear the
 
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:49.960 align:start position:0%
testimony of Representative eel um
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron and representative
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
Bixby um to talk about the the
 
00:45:54.319 --> 00:45:55.589 align:start position:0%
Bixby um to talk about the the
stakeholder

00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
stakeholder
 
00:45:59.309 --> 00:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
base and group that has come to De
 
00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
together to support this program and
 
00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:03.160 align:start position:0%
help us develop the program for the
 
00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:05.839 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire I'm not sure that
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
I've ever uh testified in front of other
 
00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:14.079 align:start position:0%
states with quite that broad base of
 
00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:17.720 align:start position:0%
support um and quite and quite frankly
 
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:19.240 align:start position:0%
the assistance in developing the
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
language for this program I think what
 
00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:23.480 align:start position:0%
you're looking at really is the
 
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:25.480 align:start position:0%
state-ofthe-art for a stewardship
 
00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
program for a liquid formulated product
 
00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:31.720 align:start position:0%
so um I would like to tell you how this
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
program works just a broad overview it
 
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
is um once we pass this law it is
 
00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon the stewardship
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
organization called Paint care which is
 
00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:45.160 align:start position:0%
a organization the American codings
 
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
Association created to run this
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
program they will develop a program plan
 
00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:54.079 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire working
 
00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
closely with Dees they will develop
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
the entire program and submit that to
 
00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
Dees for its review and approval what
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
the program plan will include is our
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
plan how we're going
 
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
to um develop the collection
 
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
locations how we're going to work with
 
00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
the haulers the
 
00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:17.839 align:start position:0%
Transporters and how we're going to work
 
00:47:21.069 --> 00:47:21.079 align:start position:0%
with processors to manage the end of
 
00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
life of this material so we will go out
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
our staff will go out and talk to all of
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
the different retail locations as well
 
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
as all of your Municipal uh facilities
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
that are currently doing household
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste
 
00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
collection ask them to participate on a
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
voluntary basis with us as collection
 
00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:41.720 align:start position:0%
locations our goal is to make it as
 
00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
convenient as possible for your
 
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
residents to bring back paint that they
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
no longer want um we right now we are
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
working with over 2,000 retailers across
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
the country in those 11 states that I've
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
already mentioned mentioned we will then
 
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
contract with haulers and Transporters
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
they're all hazardous waste uh certified
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
haulers and Transporters that will go to
 
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
those collection sites pick up all of
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
the postc consumer paint material take
 
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
it to a processor at that processing
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
facility decisions will be made about
 
00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
latex paint and about solvent-based
 
00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
paint latex paint can be recycled paint
 
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
into paint and paint sometimes into
 
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
other types of products like cement um
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
or you know sidewalk blocks and things
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
nature the solvent-based paint typically
 
00:48:43.309 --> 00:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
cannot be recycled there just isn't the
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
technology available um it I will say
 
00:48:49.069 --> 00:48:49.079 align:start position:0%
it's an emerging technology there is one
 
00:48:51.789 --> 00:48:51.799 align:start position:0%
company that we know of in Canada that
 
00:48:54.789 --> 00:48:54.799 align:start position:0%
is currently taking solvent-based paint
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
and recycling it back into paint but for
 
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
the most part that technology isn't
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
widely available there isn't really the
 
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
capacity to handle as much as we
 
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
collect but our goal is to pick up all
 
00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
of that postc consumer paint latex and
 
00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
solvent and divert it from the landfills
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
we take it to the processor like I said
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
where those decisions are made with
 
00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
regard to the latex paint we are
 
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
recycling approximately 75 to 80% of
 
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
that product and diverting it from the
 
00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:27.270 align:start position:0%
that product and diverting it from the
landfill

00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:29.480 align:start position:0%
there is a certain percentage of that
 
00:49:31.309 --> 00:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
latex paint that has been frozen and
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
thawed so many times or it's otherwise
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
contaminated that we may not be able to
 
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
do anything with so some of that
 
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
eventually will go to a landfill but
 
00:49:44.829 --> 00:49:44.839 align:start position:0%
it's a a it's a very small amount the
 
00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
solvent-based paint is then is sent for
 
00:49:50.829 --> 00:49:50.839 align:start position:0%
Waste to energy recovery so we can
 
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
extract the energy uh from the solvents
 
00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
in those products
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
so that's the
 
00:50:01.789 --> 00:50:01.799 align:start position:0%
overall structure of of how the program
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
from the consumer side when a
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
consumer comes into a paint store and
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
wants to return their paint it's a
 
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
pretty painless process they bring their
 
00:50:14.309 --> 00:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
paint into a collection location give it
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
to a customer service agent and
 
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully they shop around and buy some
 
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
other products there's no charge when
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
they drop it off it is completely free
 
00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
of charge the only fee involved to a
 
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
consumer is when a consumer purchases a
 
00:50:31.549 --> 00:50:31.559 align:start position:0%
new can of paint and at that point in
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
time there is a we call it an assessment
 
00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
I like the fee for service um uh phrase
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
but there is a fee for service that is
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
added to the cost of that
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
paint the cost of paint right now ranges
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
anywhere from between $20 to $100 a
 
00:50:50.079 --> 00:50:51.670 align:start position:0%
anywhere from between $20 to $100 a
gallon

00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
gallon
 
00:50:56.109 --> 00:50:56.119 align:start position:0%
typically the cost for a 1gallon can in
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
our program programs ac across the
 
00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:01.720 align:start position:0%
country averages about 75 cents I don't
 
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
know what it will be for the State of
 
00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that is something that
 
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
we'll evaluate once this program is is
 
00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
adopted into
 
00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%
law and I do want to talk about that
 
00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
process for just a
 
00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:18.559 align:start position:0%
moment 100% of the revenue that funds
 
00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
this activity is that fee for service so
 
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
every time a can of paint is purchased
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
that fee goes directly to Pain Care and
 
00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
here's how the cash flow really
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
works once we're working in New
 
00:51:35.069 --> 00:51:35.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're going to talk to every
 
00:51:35.079 --> 00:51:35.990 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're going to talk to every
single

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
single
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
manufacturer that sells paint in this
 
00:51:41.309 --> 00:51:41.319 align:start position:0%
state that fee for service is assessed
 
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
on every single can of paint whether
 
00:51:46.829 --> 00:51:46.839 align:start position:0%
it's a Sherman Williams a bear paint or
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
any any other brand of paint it's
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
Universal if it's an architectural paint
 
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
it's going to get this
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
fee manufacturers will submit that fee
 
00:51:59.349 --> 00:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
they will figure out what their sales
 
00:52:01.549 --> 00:52:01.559 align:start position:0%
are in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
multiply it times the fee and send a
 
00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
check directly to paint care the
 
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:09.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturer then includes that fee on
 
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
the price of the paint that they are
 
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
sending to Distributors and retailers
 
00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
retailers when they sell the paint to a
 
00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:19.720 align:start position:0%
consumer gets that 75 cents or whatever
 
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
the fee is when they sell the paint so
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
it it's a very seamless operation in
 
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
terms of the cash flow for this for this
 
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
program on the expense Side Of The
 
00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
Ledger we will go out and talk to
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
Transporters will issue uh um an RFP to
 
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
the Transporters in the state and the
 
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
processors ask them to submit bids to
 
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
work with us um once we figure out what
 
00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:49.559 align:start position:0%
the sales are in the state of New
 
00:52:51.309 --> 00:52:51.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we figure out what the
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
cost for transportation and processing
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
and other administrative you know
 
00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
typical business type costs like
 
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
insurance and salaries and things we can
 
00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
then figure out what our budget is and
 
00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
then really determine what the schedule
 
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
of fees should be it's a smaller fee for
 
00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
a smaller can larger fee for a larger
 
00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:12.440 align:start position:0%
can but like I said
 
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
typically on average a one gallon can
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
typically the fee for service is about
 
00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:20.829 align:start position:0%
typically the fee for service is about
75

00:53:20.829 --> 00:53:20.839 align:start position:0%
75
 
00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
cents so that's how the the um the
 
00:53:28.109 --> 00:53:28.119 align:start position:0%
budget process works we are really proud
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
of this program um we try very hard to
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
make this a zeroc cost program so we
 
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
will be working very closely with Dees
 
00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
as our oversight agency and we will pay
 
00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
them for their time to administer this
 
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
program we will not only pay them for
 
00:53:48.589 --> 00:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
their time reviewing our program plan
 
00:53:51.309 --> 00:53:51.319 align:start position:0%
reviewing our annual report and any
 
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement activity that they believe
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
is necessary we'll pay them an
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
administrative fee to submit our plan at
 
00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
the very beginning of this process so um
 
00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
as I said our goal is to make this a a
 
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
zero cost program for the State of New
 
00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:10.990 align:start position:0%
zero cost program for the State of New
Hampshire

00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
um I guess a couple of other points I
 
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
would just like to make um and I hope
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not running out of time I don't mean
 
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
to go over
 
00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:24.200 align:start position:0%
um once this program launches um on day
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
one retailers will begin processing that
 
00:54:30.670 --> 00:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
fee for service on a can of paint on day
 
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
one you can empty your basement or
 
00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:35.480 align:start position:0%
garage doesn't matter how old that paint
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
is all of that Legacy paint we want out
 
00:54:40.829 --> 00:54:40.839 align:start position:0%
of your basement and garage you know we
 
00:54:42.349 --> 00:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
want to be able to divert it from the
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
landfill and recycle as much as possible
 
00:54:47.789 --> 00:54:47.799 align:start position:0%
so all that Legacy paint comes in there
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
were a couple questions about the
 
00:54:53.549 --> 00:54:53.559 align:start position:0%
containers paint being a liquid
 
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:55.720 align:start position:0%
formulated product we can't collect it
 
00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
unless it's in container so we
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
absolutely take the containers paint
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
cans you know sometimes they're all
 
00:55:05.069 --> 00:55:05.079 align:start position:0%
plastic sometimes they're all metal
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're hybrid um our goal is
 
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
to recycle the containers as much as we
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
possibly can that really depends upon
 
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
capacity in the region for Plastics
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
Recycling and metal recycling we do
 
00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
better with the metal cans obviously
 
00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:25.480 align:start position:0%
it's a higher value uh recycling
 
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
activity um we struggle a little bit
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
with the plastic side of it but we're
 
00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:32.200 align:start position:0%
getting better and better but our our
 
00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
intent and our goal is to recycle those
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
plastic containers as much as
 
00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
possible and the question about do we
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
clean them out um we
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
don't we will work with the container
 
00:55:48.069 --> 00:55:48.079 align:start position:0%
recyclers whatever their process is we
 
00:55:52.029 --> 00:55:52.039 align:start position:0%
do our best to work with them so I'm not
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
aware that we're doing that in any state
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
actually cleaning the containers
 
00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
themselves that's something the the
 
00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
processors and the recyclers are doing
 
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
um but whatever that cost is it's added
 
00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:09.029 align:start position:0%
 
process

00:56:09.029 --> 00:56:09.039 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
and if I could just one other thing I
 
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to describe before I I end there
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
we do have a program called a large
 
00:56:20.349 --> 00:56:20.359 align:start position:0%
volume pickup so our retail collections
 
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
in our Municipal facilities that we're
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
working with they're designed for
 
00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
residents so you know I don't know about
 
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
all of you but I have about eight cans
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
in my garage right now and when Marilyn
 
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
gets their program up and running I
 
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
can't wait to get
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
there but commercial entities small
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
businesses sometimes collect large
 
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
volumes of um leftover paint so we do
 
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
have this program and we don't want them
 
00:56:47.789 --> 00:56:47.799 align:start position:0%
you know loading up their car with a 100
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
cans and bringing it to a retailer
 
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
you're going to overwhelm any retailer
 
00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
you go to with that kind of volume so in
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
order to service those small business
 
00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
businesses we've developed this program
 
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
that will send a transporter directly to
 
00:57:03.549 --> 00:57:03.559 align:start position:0%
that commercial business pick up all of
 
00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:05.799 align:start position:0%
that paint and take it directly to a
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
processor that's included no extra
 
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
charge we actually have regular
 
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
customers that can just call us up and
 
00:57:15.069 --> 00:57:15.079 align:start position:0%
say okay I've I've got my 100 gallons
 
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
come and get it they don't have to move
 
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
it we send the transporter there who
 
00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
moves it themselves so it it's working
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
beautifully and it's a real Boon to
 
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
small small businesses and you know
 
00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:31.720 align:start position:0%
hotels schools prisons um painting
 
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
contractors lots of small businesses
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
utilize this program so I think with
 
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to take any questions
 
00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:43.309 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to take any questions
representa

00:57:43.309 --> 00:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
spear thank you excuse me you mentioned
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
that certain types of paint or in are
 
00:57:53.309 --> 00:57:53.319 align:start position:0%
going to be end up uh being burned what
 
00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:55.000 align:start position:0%
kind of chemicals come out of that I
 
00:57:57.789 --> 00:57:57.799 align:start position:0%
mean we are we careful about pollution
 
00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
or air pollution or anything like that
 
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
what kind of chemicals we sld from that
 
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
there um I don't know a lot about that
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
process but all of the the facilities
 
00:58:09.549 --> 00:58:09.559 align:start position:0%
that specialize in waste to energy
 
00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
combustion um are you know are fully C
 
00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
certified I mean we make a commitment
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
that our endof life management for paint
 
00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:20.680 align:start position:0%
products is going to be environmentally
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
sound and we ensure that all of our
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
processors are um
 
00:58:29.029 --> 00:58:29.039 align:start position:0%
you know in compliance with
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
environmental regulations federal and
 
00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
state so I'm happy to look into that a
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
little bit further for you but it's a
 
00:58:39.789 --> 00:58:39.799 align:start position:0%
pretty common process I I would like to
 
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
follow on that with just one comment we
 
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
have a a plant in um Manchester that
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
burns waste and it's turning out to be
 
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
quite the problem so I'm very concerned
 
00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
about what kind of chemicals are coming
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
out of this would you believe uh would
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
you believe yeah representative
 
00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
BRS thank you and thank you for taking
 
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
my question um I was curious about the
 
00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
program in Oregon and I'm wondering if
 
00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
there was any data in terms of the
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
return on investment of the program
 
00:59:12.109 --> 00:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
versus the costs of cleaning up all this
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
are um are you familiar with the product
 
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
stewardship Institute
 
00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
okay um the product stewardship
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
Institute is a thirdparty organization
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
um that that
 
00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:36.309 align:start position:0%
um that that
[Music]

00:59:36.309 --> 00:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
um endorses extended producer
 
00:59:41.549 --> 00:59:41.559 align:start position:0%
responsibility programs they're very
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
engaged in lots of different consumer
 
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
Commodities and have been for
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
years um they have done some studies of
 
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
our programs um I believe the Oregon
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
program the Connecticut program and our
 
00:59:56.829 --> 00:59:56.839 align:start position:0%
Colorado program
 
00:59:59.309 --> 00:59:59.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure that they specifically
 
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
follow a strict cost benefit analysis
 
01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:07.160 align:start position:0%
but um they have been you know studies
 
01:00:10.109 --> 01:00:10.119 align:start position:0%
Implement case studies on our program
 
01:00:12.029 --> 01:00:12.039 align:start position:0%
after the program's been in operation
 
01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:13.880 align:start position:0%
for a certain number of years and I'm
 
01:00:17.029 --> 01:00:17.039 align:start position:0%
happy to share those with you um in
 
01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
terms of cost benefit analysis one thing
 
01:00:23.309 --> 01:00:23.319 align:start position:0%
I I would I would say is one of the big
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
benefits for the state and for your you
 
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
your local government entities that run
 
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
the household hazardous waste facilities
 
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
and I know um representative eel did a
 
01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
good job describing this but just to
 
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
emphasize when we partner with them we
 
01:00:43.789 --> 01:00:43.799 align:start position:0%
basically pay for all the costs related
 
01:00:43.799 --> 01:00:44.750 align:start position:0%
basically pay for all the costs related
to

01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:00:47.349 --> 01:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
paint end of life
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
management so we will pay for the
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
transportation and processing of all of
 
01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:53.720 align:start position:0%
the paint That's collected at that those
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
local facilities um so that really frees
 
01:00:59.910 --> 01:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
up part of their budget to spend on
 
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
other program priorities um it it's a
 
01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:06.039 align:start position:0%
very significant benefit for the local
 
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh government
 
01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
sesa thanks for taking a question um it
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
seems like a very wonderful program I
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
see that based on the chart that this
 
01:01:23.789 --> 01:01:23.799 align:start position:0%
program started in 2010 in Oregon but in
 
01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:27.640 align:start position:0%
last 14 years I see only 13 states have
 
01:01:29.589 --> 01:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
signed up so far so what is the main
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
push back from majority majority of the
 
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
states what I'm sorry your question is
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
what are the challenges what is the main
 
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
push back from majority of States why
 
01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:43.480 align:start position:0%
only 13 State have signed up so far in
 
01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:46.549 align:start position:0%
only 13 State have signed up so far in
14

01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.549 --> 01:01:51.559 align:start position:0%
years um well part of it I I will say
 
01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:55.559 align:start position:0%
part of it is um resources um I'm I'm
 
01:01:59.029 --> 01:01:59.039 align:start position:0%
only one person I'm basically the the
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
government Affairs person that's pushing
 
01:02:03.029 --> 01:02:03.039 align:start position:0%
this in different states across the
 
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
country and any given moment we have
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
bills in five other states uh to move
 
01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:11.240 align:start position:0%
forward with this um some states work
 
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
more quickly than others um
 
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I've been working in
 
01:02:18.269 --> 01:02:18.279 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts for probably eight or nine
 
01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
years and I still haven't um been able
 
01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
to move forward with it um we passed the
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
bill in Colorado in one year
 
01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
um but other states you know have taken
 
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
some time uh to get the bill across the
 
01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
the Finish Line it it's really an
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
education issue it it probably takes um
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of time to do some
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
education for decision makers working
 
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
with the agency developing the the
 
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
stakeholder group um in some states even
 
01:02:52.829 --> 01:02:52.839 align:start position:0%
where we have no opposition whatsoever
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
it takes us several years um in in aate
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
state where there there's some
 
01:02:59.829 --> 01:02:59.839 align:start position:0%
opposition it takes us a while to
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
educate that opposition group on the
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
benefits and try to answer all their
 
01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
questions um follow up quick followup
 
01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
further question yeah so my question is
 
01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
what is the what what are some of the
 
01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
main concerns those states have shown to
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
you who have done opposition so far in
 
01:03:20.349 --> 01:03:20.359 align:start position:0%
14 years what are the main concern they
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
have shared with you I I mean I the
 
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
biggest you know I'm not what is the
 
01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
biggest concern perhaps the the biggest
 
01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
question is really the issue of the fee
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
it's understanding how the fee works and
 
01:03:37.349 --> 01:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
trusting um the industry to do this job
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
the way we say we're going to do it um
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
but you know we have now almost 15 years
 
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
of history and we have 11 states with
 
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
data to show you our our website is
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
completely transparent you can see the
 
01:03:52.589 --> 01:03:52.599 align:start position:0%
financials for every single state that
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
we're working and right now if you go to
 
01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
my website
 
01:03:58.750 --> 01:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
um so you know at the beginning when we
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
were trying to to move this this process
 
01:04:05.109 --> 01:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
or this program across the states nobody
 
01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
had heard of epr an extended producer
 
01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility was new it it's not new
 
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
any longer it's it's much more
 
01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
mainstream there are lots of programs
 
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
out there the concepts are much better
 
01:04:21.789 --> 01:04:21.799 align:start position:0%
understood thank you okay let me let's
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
cut to the chase all right I'm trying to
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
follow the bouncing ball here here okay
 
01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
cuz you T first you said the
 
01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturers are reporting
 
01:04:35.309 --> 01:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
yes and they're collecting a they are
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:44.269 --> 01:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
time because then it sounded like you
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
were doing it was a value added tax
 
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
because then because the the fee is
 
01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
actually collected at point of
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
sale but I wasn't sure what the Manu
 
01:04:58.910 --> 01:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
facturers are reporting are they not are
 
01:05:01.269 --> 01:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
they they're reporting how where how
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
much paint they're making and where it
 
01:05:03.359 --> 01:05:05.069 align:start position:0%
much paint they're making and where it
went

01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:05.079 align:start position:0%
went
 
01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
yes are but they're not writing a check
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
at the time the the money doesn't come
 
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
until it's assessed at the point of
 
01:05:20.190 --> 01:05:20.200 align:start position:0%
purchase and then who sends the money
 
01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
to to you or the state I was a little
 
01:05:27.309 --> 01:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
fuzzy on that too so the the
 
01:05:29.829 --> 01:05:29.839 align:start position:0%
that man at the beginning of this
 
01:05:33.549 --> 01:05:33.559 align:start position:0%
program in every single year
 
01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturers estimate what their sales
 
01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
are in the state of New Hampshire at the
 
01:05:40.029 --> 01:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
very beginning they're going to cut a
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
check send it directly to paint care so
 
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
before any paint is sold they've already
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
invested in this
 
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
program um otherwise we would have no
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
money to operate so they've sent the
 
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
money to paint
 
01:05:59.029 --> 01:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
care then they sell the paint in the
 
01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they add that fee to the
 
01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
retailers or to Distributors and
 
01:06:07.039 --> 01:06:08.750 align:start position:0%
retailers or to Distributors and
retailers

01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
retailers
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
retailers obviously they're paying for
 
01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:13.240 align:start position:0%
the paint that they're selling so
 
01:06:15.549 --> 01:06:15.559 align:start position:0%
they're paying that fee the retailers
 
01:06:18.990 --> 01:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
are but the retailers recoup their money
 
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
when they sell the paint to
 
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
Consumers typically that's 75 cents
 
01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
that's they re coup you're getting paid
 
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
so that retailers are not doing any
 
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
reporting they're not paying anybody
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
other than they're buying the paint so
 
01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
it's built into the wholesale price to
 
01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:41.480 align:start position:0%
them correct ah so here's the solution
 
01:06:43.549 --> 01:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
to the problem we actually do this in
 
01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and it's called the beer
 
01:06:51.269 --> 01:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
tax the beer tax the consumer has no
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
idea that it exists as a matter of fact
 
01:06:57.549 --> 01:06:57.559 align:start position:0%
even the retail ER doesn't even know it
 
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
exists it's collected at the
 
01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:03.710 align:start position:0%
exists it's collected at the
distribution

01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
level and right at this moment because
 
01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:09.640 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the beer tax collector is
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
actually just enter the room because
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to be executing a bill but I
 
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
going to say at this moment that if
 
01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to deal with the number one
 
01:07:22.109 --> 01:07:22.119 align:start position:0%
problem the push back is that the cost
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
of this fee for this service is got got
 
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
to be built into the wholesale price
 
01:07:34.029 --> 01:07:34.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire just just an idea we'll talk
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
further but I just want you to know
 
01:07:41.309 --> 01:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
that's where I personally would be
 
01:07:45.029 --> 01:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
trying to take this bill but I is that
 
01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%
different than what I described well in
 
01:07:51.269 --> 01:07:51.279 align:start position:0%
the sense that that the consumer is
 
01:07:53.589 --> 01:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
going to be is paying the the whole
 
01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
value at the time the
 
01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
purchase okay that's a sales tax okay
 
01:08:03.150 --> 01:08:03.160 align:start position:0%
call it what it is that's a sales tax
 
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
okay but when a tax is collected at the
 
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
wholesale or distributor
 
01:08:13.470 --> 01:08:13.480 align:start position:0%
level okay yes we do call it a tax but
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
it's unbeknownst to the consumer it has
 
01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:17.480 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the consumer and it
 
01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with what the margin
 
01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
the retailer decides to sell the product
 
01:08:26.349 --> 01:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
for and what the consumer is paying
 
01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
and that's where the consumer is
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
shopping around now you might argue the
 
01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
downside of this is is that you're going
 
01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
to end up they're going to pass on the
 
01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
full cost in the when it comes time to
 
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
sell it and the and the consumer says oh
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
look that gallon of paint is
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
a175 more in New Hampshire than when I
 
01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:49.719 align:start position:0%
can pay for it in Massachusetts because
 
01:08:51.870 --> 01:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
they didn't pass the
 
01:08:54.749 --> 01:08:54.759 align:start position:0%
law that might be the downside yet not
 
01:08:57.669 --> 01:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
yet that's what I that's but I'm saying
 
01:08:59.630 --> 01:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
is what if we were going to do something
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
like this the model we have here in New
 
01:09:03.789 --> 01:09:03.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is our beer tax model which is
 
01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
built around the distributor collecting
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
the tax the tax is is is the fee is
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
collected ahead just like you're already
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
saying they're going to estimate their
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
fee okay but in this case we don't even
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
want to estimate we want every time they
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
ship we want them to send the fee the
 
01:09:23.669 --> 01:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
fee and it's based on gallonage Purely
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
gallonage we don't care what the size of
 
01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
the container is we're not even worried
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
about the size it's based on gallonage
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
that's a model we have here in New
 
01:09:35.709 --> 01:09:35.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire something to think about okay
 
01:09:38.309 --> 01:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
would you believe would you believe
 
01:09:41.149 --> 01:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
excuse me okay representative
 
01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
solivan would you would you believe Mr
 
01:09:44.669 --> 01:09:44.679 align:start position:0%
chairman I've been sitting here thinking
 
01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
the same thing you just said for the
 
01:09:49.470 --> 01:09:49.480 align:start position:0%
most of this this presentation right
 
01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
guess you you're familiar with it okay
 
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
represent macul thank it it it seems to
 
01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
me and correct if I'm wrong but the
 
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
model that you suggested is exactly what
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
chairman Hutt is saying because it's
 
01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
it's actually paid by the manufacture
 
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
then it's passed on to the wholesaler
 
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
and then it's passed on to the retailer
 
01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
but I think it's exactly the same thing
 
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
as the way you're doing the beer tax
 
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
unless I misunderstood what you said I I
 
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
I have to feain ignorance about your
 
01:10:21.790 --> 01:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
beer beer tax so it's hard for me to say
 
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
that's exactly it but it sounds very
 
01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
similar to what we want to accomplish I
 
01:10:29.709 --> 01:10:29.719 align:start position:0%
you know in other states we have had
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
this conversation of should the fee
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
be um itemized on a receipt or an
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
invoice there you go and um and it's
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
interesting that conversation goes both
 
01:10:45.149 --> 01:10:45.159 align:start position:0%
ways some states want it on the invoice
 
01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
other states don't want it on the
 
01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
invoice typically we at ACA and paint
 
01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
care have never really taken a position
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
on that I mean our
 
01:10:57.870 --> 01:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
the fee has to be
 
01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
Universal it has to be the same fee on
 
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
every single brand of paint it has to be
 
01:11:06.149 --> 01:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
collected retailers cannot have the
 
01:11:08.110 --> 01:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
option of assessing it or not assessing
 
01:11:11.070 --> 01:11:11.080 align:start position:0%
it it has to be there otherwise the
 
01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
program you know financially won't be
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
sound um there are some consumer
 
01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
protection laws that we're running into
 
01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
um right now that are
 
01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
requiring additional information about
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
any fees added on to Consumer products
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
that's an issue we've been dealing with
 
01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
just in the last year or
 
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
okay representative G thank you thank
 
01:11:43.390 --> 01:11:43.400 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question on page five
 
01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
lines 7 through n you're changing the
 
01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
designation from hazardous waste to
 
01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
Universal waste can we talk about that
 
01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
services we want to be able to collect
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
solvent-based paint and latex paint
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
which is oilbased the latex paint
 
01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
typically is not hazardous the
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
solvent-based paint is it's typically
 
01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:14.950 align:start position:0%
solvent-based paint is it's typically
flammable

01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
flammable
 
01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:19.960 align:start position:0%
um all of our haulers are you know have
 
01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
a hazardous waste uh certification so
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
that's not really an issue for them but
 
01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
for the retail locations to collect that
 
01:12:32.229 --> 01:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
type of um material and hang on to it
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
until we can get a transporter there
 
01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
there are some issues um Universal waste
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
is a way to manage
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
lowrisk um uh waste products it's a
 
01:12:46.270 --> 01:12:46.280 align:start position:0%
pretty well accepted Concept in
 
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste management um we
 
01:12:50.830 --> 01:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
actually have a petition pending with
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
EPA to designate all paint waste as a
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
Universal waste and and this helps us um
 
01:13:02.430 --> 01:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
sort of streamline some of the processes
 
01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
um that we have to um engage in to
 
01:13:08.830 --> 01:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
collect the solvent based
 
01:13:10.990 --> 01:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
paint thank you very
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
much you okay uh Mike winstat from
 
01:13:31.149 --> 01:13:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chair members of the
 
01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:34.280 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
01:13:36.629 --> 01:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
Mike whimet I serve as the Director of
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
the waste management division for the
 
01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of
 
01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services I'm joined this
 
01:13:45.070 --> 01:13:45.080 align:start position:0%
morning by Mike knor who heads up our
 
01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
material he tricked me he was I was
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
gonna be yeah I didn't quite actually
 
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
I'm joined by Todd pisit who heads up
 
01:13:55.629 --> 01:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
our haard space management Bureau and I
 
01:13:57.390 --> 01:13:57.400 align:start position:0%
think we we switched a little because we
 
01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
knew there was going to be a question
 
01:14:00.430 --> 01:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
about hazardous way so Todd's going to
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
be here to help with that um the
 
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
department is not taking a position on
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
this bill um however we thought it would
 
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
be helpful to we always try to share
 
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
with any committee any uh thoughts we
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
have about a bill like this even though
 
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
we may not be taking a position and to
 
01:14:17.550 --> 01:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
give a little context in history um as
 
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
uh the sponsor indicated this is a bill
 
01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
that has been around for more than 10
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
years um this concept um we so we worked
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
on it off and on in a number of
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
legislative sessions um I think that uh
 
01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
at the time we first started talking
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
about it it was a nent program in other
 
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
states and there was some discomfort
 
01:14:37.470 --> 01:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
about whether we really could understand
 
01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
how it was going to work and whether it
 
01:14:41.149 --> 01:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
would work for New Hampshire um so it
 
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
has gone through a number of iterations
 
01:14:44.910 --> 01:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
but I think the the overall program and
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
certainly the paint CARE program that uh
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
Miss mcalli described to you um has
 
01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
really matured and and evolved over that
 
01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
time um we uh
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh we did indeed as the sponsor
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
indicated work very closely with the
 
01:15:03.550 --> 01:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
sponsors and with the folks from the ACA
 
01:15:05.629 --> 01:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
to uh address concerns that we had about
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
the original drafts of this uh
 
01:15:09.629 --> 01:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
legislation and and many of those
 
01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
concerns were were able to be really
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
addressed through that process so it was
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
a very collaborative and productive
 
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
process for doing so um I will say that
 
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh this bill and the concept of a paint
 
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh stewardship program and this is at
 
01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
its heart this isn't a product
 
01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
stewardship program it's really about
 
01:15:31.629 --> 01:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers taking responsibility
 
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
for not just the production and sale of
 
01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
their materials but also dealing with it
 
01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
on the tail end when there's a disposal
 
01:15:42.910 --> 01:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
sounds like past to me right exactly so
 
01:15:45.229 --> 01:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
um so I will say that this uh this kind
 
01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
of a program is very consistent with um
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
the statutory Provisions in RSA 149 M
 
01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
the solid waste management act based on
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
trying to have respon responsible
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
management of all wastes and ensuring
 
01:16:00.030 --> 01:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
that we recycle whenever we can versus
 
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
sending for disposal it's also
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
consistent with the goals of the solid
 
01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
waste management plan which um you know
 
01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
further puts more meat on the bones on
 
01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
that that we worked very hard on and
 
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
published a couple of years ago and it
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
was definitely an area that we
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
identified for work so it's very
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
consistent with the the work plan that
 
01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
we've set out over the next several
 
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
years the other thing I would raise and
 
01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
then we can we' be happy to go to
 
01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
questions um is that and I'm not sure
 
01:16:26.229 --> 01:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
it's it's been touched on a little bit
 
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
here but there's really a public health
 
01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
and safety component to this as well
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
because we know and I know my own
 
01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
personal experience that um if you're a
 
01:16:35.790 --> 01:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
homeowner and you're doing maintenance
 
01:16:38.189 --> 01:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
and such and you you can end up
 
01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
accumulating pretty significant amount
 
01:16:42.629 --> 01:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
of both latex and and and and
 
01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
solvent-based paints and Coatings in
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
your home and most people uh because
 
01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
they don't want to put it out in the
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
garage or in the shed because they can't
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
they don't want it to freeze they keep
 
01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
it in their basement and so all of those
 
01:16:55.629 --> 01:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
things slowly over time if you have a
 
01:16:57.950 --> 01:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
can of paint and a few years later you
 
01:16:59.950 --> 01:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
go to it and it's a hockey puck there's
 
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
a reason for that all the solvents and
 
01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
material and and volatile substances in
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
that have leaked out into your home and
 
01:17:09.629 --> 01:17:09.639 align:start position:0%
you've been breathing them so um that's
 
01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
not a great thing obviously and in many
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
cases people keep those because they
 
01:17:15.629 --> 01:17:15.639 align:start position:0%
don't really have a place to bring they
 
01:17:17.310 --> 01:17:17.320 align:start position:0%
don't they they know that they you know
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's not that convenient to try to
 
01:17:20.629 --> 01:17:20.639 align:start position:0%
bring it out and spread it with K if
 
01:17:22.189 --> 01:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
it's latex paint mix it with kitty
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
litter and dispose of it and if it's
 
01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
solvent-based paint really the only
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate option is to bring it to a
 
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
household collection day which in most
 
01:17:31.149 --> 01:17:31.159 align:start position:0%
towns if they have them at all or only
 
01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
once a year and you've got a time it and
 
01:17:34.709 --> 01:17:34.719 align:start position:0%
make sure you've got it on your calendar
 
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
and you get it there and then I will
 
01:17:39.550 --> 01:17:39.560 align:start position:0%
note that when we've talked to towns we
 
01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
do provide grants to towns matching
 
01:17:43.709 --> 01:17:43.719 align:start position:0%
grants for holding household collection
 
01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
days for for household hazardous waste
 
01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
the towns will tell you that the line
 
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
share of the cost that they incur with
 
01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
their contractors for those collection
 
01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
days are tied to paint products um they
 
01:17:55.870 --> 01:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
don't even take the latex paints but the
 
01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
solvent-based paints end up being on a
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
per gallon basis famously expensive
 
01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
because they you know they've got a hire
 
01:18:04.229 --> 01:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
a Houser space contractor who's got a
 
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
chemist on site and they're overpacking
 
01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
each individual container it's a very
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
inefficient and expensive way to do it
 
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
and what I've also heard from folks who
 
01:18:16.110 --> 01:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
operate landfills or transfer stations
 
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
is that the most uh uh high volume day
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
for disposal of paint products at a
 
01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
landfill is the Monday after a household
 
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
collection day happened because somebody
 
01:18:29.709 --> 01:18:29.719 align:start position:0%
had a soccer game or they forgot about
 
01:18:31.709 --> 01:18:31.719 align:start position:0%
it on their calendar and they didn't get
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
there and so now they've been they get
 
01:18:34.990 --> 01:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
mad because they've waited a year for
 
01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
the collection day and they missed it so
 
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
they just bring it all to the landfill
 
01:18:42.189 --> 01:18:42.199 align:start position:0%
so it's not a great system and you know
 
01:18:43.629 --> 01:18:43.639 align:start position:0%
something like this is going to be
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
potentially uh providing a much better
 
01:18:47.629 --> 01:18:47.639 align:start position:0%
more costeffective way of dealing with
 
01:18:50.430 --> 01:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
these materials so with that um I will
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh we'll go to
 
01:18:56.030 --> 01:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
questions okay yeah represent
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:02.110 --> 01:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
neutral that is a fair question and to
 
01:19:04.510 --> 01:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
be very candid um we we're we're
 
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
basically not taking positions really on
 
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
any bills right now because we've just
 
01:19:11.470 --> 01:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to get um it's quality
 
01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
time with the governor's office to to
 
01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
outline where the policy positions on
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
bills are going to be so across the
 
01:19:18.430 --> 01:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
board that's what we've been doing we
 
01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
expect that will change in future but
 
01:19:22.189 --> 01:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
for now that's that's where we're
 
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
at great thank you very much
 
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
Binet from
 
01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
Northeast uh re resource recovery
 
01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
Association oh this is where I get my
 
01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:44.750 align:start position:0%
Association oh this is where I get my
blue

01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:46.830 --> 01:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
bags morning you have to push the good
 
01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
morning you
 
01:19:50.669 --> 01:19:50.679 align:start position:0%
good yes thank you I'm Reagan biset I'm
 
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
with the Northeast resource recovery
 
01:19:56.310 --> 01:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
Association we are a Cooperative style
 
01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
recycling nonprofit and we work with 90%
 
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
of the communities in New Hampshire um
 
01:20:04.030 --> 01:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
who are members of our organization so
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
our mission is to make sure that we can
 
01:20:10.030 --> 01:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
have Municipal recycling programs be
 
01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
both environmentally sustainable but
 
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
also environmentally s uh financially
 
01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:17.800 align:start position:0%
sustainable and environmentally uh
 
01:20:20.669 --> 01:20:20.679 align:start position:0%
responsible so our organization as a
 
01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
general policy doesn't take positions on
 
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
legislation but I am here to just
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
provide some information that I thought
 
01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
would be useful to the committee as you
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
consider this
 
01:20:34.270 --> 01:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
bill um I'll also add that I serve on
 
01:20:36.430 --> 01:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
the solid waste working group as a
 
01:20:37.629 --> 01:20:37.639 align:start position:0%
representative for the Northeast
 
01:20:39.070 --> 01:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
resource recovery
 
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
Association so our organization Among
 
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
The Cooperative programs that we offer
 
01:20:46.149 --> 01:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
for our Municipal members we offer
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
household hazardous uh waste collection
 
01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
days we work with a reputable vendor who
 
01:20:55.149 --> 01:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
uh manages and recycles
 
01:20:57.229 --> 01:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
waste that is collected at these Town
 
01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
program events and I have some data I
 
01:21:03.070 --> 01:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
can share with you about the cost that
 
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh incur related to paint
 
01:21:10.270 --> 01:21:10.280 align:start position:0%
collection so we looked at data from uh
 
01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
recent years for over a dozen
 
01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
communities for which we've worked uh to
 
01:21:15.629 --> 01:21:15.639 align:start position:0%
help them manage their household
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste collection days the
 
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
average population of these communities
 
01:21:25.470 --> 01:21:25.480 align:start position:0%
that we looked at was 9,600 people
 
01:21:29.229 --> 01:21:29.239 align:start position:0%
and the average cost of their collection
 
01:21:32.189 --> 01:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
Day event was about
 
01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
$113,000 a little over half of all of
 
01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
the items collected by weight which is
 
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
how they pay for the cost of the event a
 
01:21:42.270 --> 01:21:42.280 align:start position:0%
little over half of what they collected
 
01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
was paint so what that means is that for
 
01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:46.639 align:start position:0%
these communities that we looked at on
 
01:21:50.590 --> 01:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
average they spent uh about
 
01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
$7,100 for the collection and recycling
 
01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
of paint for their community
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
um and as you heard uh often communities
 
01:22:02.189 --> 01:22:02.199 align:start position:0%
will only offer these events once a year
 
01:22:04.270 --> 01:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
or maybe even once every two years to
 
01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:05.639 align:start position:0%
their residents because of the
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
significant cost to municipalities to
 
01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:11.800 align:start position:0%
offer these programs and therefore uh
 
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
you know you could see that how a bill
 
01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
like this would offer more opportunities
 
01:22:19.629 --> 01:22:19.639 align:start position:0%
for residents to be able to access free
 
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
Recycling and and management of their
 
01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
paint without having to wait for a once
 
01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:27.719 align:start position:0%
a year event um and this bill does seem
 
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
like it would provide opportunities to
 
01:22:31.470 --> 01:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
help mitigate some of the costs that
 
01:22:33.870 --> 01:22:33.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities are currently incurring
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
in order to recycle
 
01:22:40.149 --> 01:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
paint so thank you thank
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much I have three
 
01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:45.679 align:start position:0%

such as that that's proposed by House
 
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
Bill 451 help to manage problematic
 
01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
materials in the waist streams and I
 
01:24:28.270 --> 01:24:28.280 align:start position:0%
don't need to get into the particulars
 
01:24:29.629 --> 01:24:29.639 align:start position:0%
about that I think you've heard enough
 
01:24:32.270 --> 01:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
about that but paint is one of those
 
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
difficult to manage
 
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
materials in addition to paint some
 
01:24:38.629 --> 01:24:38.639 align:start position:0%
other examples that have been mentioned
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
earlier um included in some of these uh
 
01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
product stewardship programs include
 
01:24:46.830 --> 01:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
items like textiles
 
01:24:49.870 --> 01:24:49.880 align:start position:0%

wind turbines batteries and appliances
 
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
stewardship programs like this promote
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
and create a safe and meaningful process
 
01:25:03.870 --> 01:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
in which everyone involved in the life
 
01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
cycle of a particular product has
 
01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility for endof Life management
 
01:25:11.709 --> 01:25:11.719 align:start position:0%
of that product that otherwise may be
 
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
cumbersome difficult or unsafe to
 
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
process for these reasons cassella
 
01:25:19.629 --> 01:25:19.639 align:start position:0%
supports House Bill
 
01:25:22.629 --> 01:25:22.639 align:start position:0%
451 thank you very much chair will'll
 
01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
management you know the best for speech
 
01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
I ever said is
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
ditto yes uh I I I'll be a little longer
 
01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
than ditto uh just um Waste Management
 
01:25:44.109 --> 01:25:44.119 align:start position:0%
uh runs the turkey landfill uh in
 
01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
Rochester we accept about a third or
 
01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
manage about a third of the waste that's
 
01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
generated in the State uh Waste
 
01:25:53.870 --> 01:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
Management supports the bill um it's
 
01:25:56.229 --> 01:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
cons consistent with uh current state
 
01:25:59.070 --> 01:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
law right now back in
 
01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
1996 this
 
01:26:04.270 --> 01:26:04.280 align:start position:0%
legislature um passed a law that created
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
a solid waste management hierarchy and
 
01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
the number one uh preference for dealing
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
with waste is Source reduction which is
 
01:26:15.310 --> 01:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
don't create the waste in the first
 
01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
place second is reuse and Recycling and
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
that's consistent with this bill um
 
01:26:22.990 --> 01:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
third is
 
01:26:28.189 --> 01:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
composting the there's um energy uh uh
 
01:26:32.149 --> 01:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
the incineration with energy recovery um
 
01:26:34.270 --> 01:26:34.280 align:start position:0%
and then it's landfilling so putting
 
01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
this stuff in landfills is not the
 
01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
preferred option there are other options
 
01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
which the state law already directs us
 
01:26:45.109 --> 01:26:45.119 align:start position:0%
to try to achieve uh to representative
 
01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
Spears uh point about uh incineration in
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester so that incinerator is a
 
01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
sewage and sludge incinerator it does
 
01:26:59.870 --> 01:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
not burn uh Municipal Solid Waste um so
 
01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
it's I I think it's different uh from
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
the go can we talk about this afterwards
 
01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
I have some more questions okay but
 
01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
anyways Waste Management supports the
 
01:27:13.709 --> 01:27:13.719 align:start position:0%
bill um and that's it D all perfect
 
01:27:16.350 --> 01:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
thank you and last but not least Nash
 
01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
Grace from the Bia and I believe he did
 
01:27:22.830 --> 01:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
distribute a letter I did Mr chair n gra
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
for the Bia we are the state why Chamber
 
01:27:26.910 --> 01:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
of Commerce and the Allied manufacturing
 
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
association uh we I just want to be 100%
 
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
clear we do not support sales taxes but
 
01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:35.480 align:start position:0%
we do support our business Community uh
 
01:27:37.629 --> 01:27:37.639 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here although I
 
01:27:41.109 --> 01:27:41.119 align:start position:0%
know there's debate about the phrase fee
 
01:27:42.270 --> 01:27:42.280 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:27:45.390 --> 01:27:45.400 align:start position:0%
manufacturers across the board and the
 
01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
paint manufacturers want to raise their
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
prices equally across the board that's
 
01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
an antitrust issue it's commonly known
 
01:27:55.070 --> 01:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
as price collusion we want to make sure
 
01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
there's an exception for that because
 
01:28:00.109 --> 01:28:00.119 align:start position:0%
there's a good public policy reason to
 
01:28:04.030 --> 01:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
allow that that Universal raise to occur
 
01:28:05.950 --> 01:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
uh and that would be for the everything
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
you've heard over the last hour and a
 
01:28:10.510 --> 01:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
half to uh to deal with paint so not a
 
01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
tax it is manufacturers across the board
 
01:28:16.350 --> 01:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
raising their prices equally and then
 
01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
using that for a good public
 
01:28:23.109 --> 01:28:23.119 align:start position:0%
purpose thank you Mr chair Mr
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you oh we do have a
 
01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
question representative M thank you
 
01:28:30.189 --> 01:28:30.199 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question when when
 
01:28:33.870 --> 01:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
I was asking that question of Miss mlli
 
01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
I saw you back there nodding your head
 
01:28:40.669 --> 01:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
so I believe that you agree with me that
 
01:28:42.590 --> 01:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
the way that they're doing this is
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
exactly the way we tax beer the
 
01:28:47.709 --> 01:28:47.719 align:start position:0%
difference is is that we shouldn't at
 
01:28:50.669 --> 01:28:50.679 align:start position:0%
the retail lever level put in the
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
receipt that they paid the
 
01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
tax do you agree with that just to be
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
clear not a taxia does not support sales
 
01:29:01.629 --> 01:29:01.639 align:start position:0%
taxes we do support manufacturers who
 
01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
want to raise their prices equally
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
across the board and use that for a good
 
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
public policy purpose but is is not this
 
01:29:10.669 --> 01:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
the way question you mean CL is not just
 
01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
the way that chairman uh suggested that
 
01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
that the way the beer Tax Works the beer
 
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
fee Works in my conversation with the uh
 
01:29:21.790 --> 01:29:21.800 align:start position:0%
the paint manufacturers and their
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
representatives my understanding is is
 
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
this is the way that that the chairman
 
01:29:29.070 --> 01:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
uh had previously described that you
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
would that you would allow industry to
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
tax and with that I will thank you very
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
much and I will close the public hearing
 
01:29:45.390 --> 01:29:45.400 align:start position:0%
on houseb
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
451 okay so NE to say we're we're a
 
01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
little bit behind
 
01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
here so I ask the members not to run off
 
01:29:57.990 --> 01:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
um because I believe we have the
 
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
liquor liquor
 
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:52.910 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:52.920 --> 01:31:22.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:52.830 align:start position:0%

01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
okay all right so we'll take up first
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%

four five five zip you put it here
 
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
yep are we executing no this is the
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee sub committee we we will be
 
01:35:41.910 --> 01:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:45.189 --> 01:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
momentarily okay next one all right
 
01:35:49.229 --> 01:35:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:49.239 --> 01:35:50.790 align:start position:0%
 
77

01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
77
 
01:35:55.030 --> 01:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
um so House Bill 77 this amendment is as
 
01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:57.679 align:start position:0%
kind of uh I handed out in the
 
01:36:00.109 --> 01:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and in terms of how we are
 
01:36:18.030 --> 01:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:28.189 --> 01:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:31.990 --> 01:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
oops okay so in this case uh we took it
 
01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
out uh of where it was weigh in uh under
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
licenses and we took it and even though
 
01:36:41.189 --> 01:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
we played with the idea of the consumer
 
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
protection act but I think we got it
 
01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
reaffirmed by by our consumer protection
 
01:36:48.430 --> 01:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
division again yesterday to please go
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
lightly with anything that gets stuck in
 
01:36:53.550 --> 01:36:53.560 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act uh but this
 
01:36:56.149 --> 01:36:56.159 align:start position:0%
abely made the most sense given the
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement is already uh in the powers
 
01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
of the uh Liquor Commission so in this
 
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
case The Liquor Commission is already
 
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
there they're looking at all the toys
 
01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
that uh that any retailer might have to
 
01:37:13.350 --> 01:37:13.360 align:start position:0%
uh look at licenses um so it makes
 
01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
perfect sense and they have all the
 
01:37:18.149 --> 01:37:18.159 align:start position:0%
power of being able to research and find
 
01:37:20.830 --> 01:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
out whether there's any secret files
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
being kept on their computer but I can
 
01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
never imagine you have they've ever done
 
01:37:27.709 --> 01:37:27.719 align:start position:0%
that before but they had that authority
 
01:37:33.189 --> 01:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
to do that okay any questions about the
 
01:37:36.910 --> 01:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
amendment all right uh I I
 
01:37:41.149 --> 01:37:41.159 align:start position:0%
move okay so this is yeah this just to
 
01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
pass on the
 
01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
amendment I'll move it or actually P two
 
01:37:47.709 --> 01:37:47.719 align:start position:0%
SEC moves it I'll
 
01:37:53.550 --> 01:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:54.910 --> 01:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
had a question but I guess it's too late
 
01:37:56.669 --> 01:37:56.679 align:start position:0%
okay you do have a question yes what is
 
01:38:00.030 --> 01:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
your question and I'm sorry if I if I
 
01:38:02.510 --> 01:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
didn't catch it before yes this is
 
01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
strictly talking about the scanners for
 
01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
the licenses for uh when we go to buy
 
01:38:09.149 --> 01:38:09.159 align:start position:0%
alcohol or whatever it's not anything to
 
01:38:11.990 --> 01:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
do with uh some of the other things that
 
01:38:13.709 --> 01:38:13.719 align:start position:0%
actually like porn shops that actually
 
01:38:16.109 --> 01:38:16.119 align:start position:0%
have to scan it exactly this is just
 
01:38:18.669 --> 01:38:18.679 align:start position:0%
this is simply and and we have the added
 
01:38:22.589 --> 01:38:22.599 align:start position:0%
benefit this is not only uh uh liquor
 
01:38:24.109 --> 01:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
but it's also cigarettes
 
01:38:27.149 --> 01:38:27.159 align:start position:0%
right right of course okay so and then
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:31.990 align:start position:0%

yeah okay uh the amendment um basically
 
01:52:24.830 --> 01:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh moves it out of of U safety puts it
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
into the liquor statute and this would
 
01:52:29.709 --> 01:52:29.719 align:start position:0%
be something The Liquor Commission would
 
01:52:32.229 --> 01:52:32.239 align:start position:0%
enforce and and what the enforcement is
 
01:52:35.790 --> 01:52:35.800 align:start position:0%
is to ensure that the machines that uh
 
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
all they do is have a red red green
 
01:52:43.069 --> 01:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
light bulb and cannot H store any
 
01:52:43.079 --> 01:52:45.270 align:start position:0%
light bulb and cannot H store any
personal

01:52:45.270 --> 01:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
personal
 
01:52:48.910 --> 01:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
information so a good question yes
 
01:52:52.030 --> 01:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
represent shance so they are going to
 
01:52:54.589 --> 01:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
guarantee that the scanner is not going
 
01:52:56.350 --> 01:52:56.360 align:start position:0%
to store the information they are that
 
01:52:59.109 --> 01:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
is their their guarantee so so normally
 
01:53:01.030 --> 01:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
in a case like this if someone were to
 
01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:02.109 align:start position:0%
in a case like this if someone were to
be

01:53:02.109 --> 01:53:02.119 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:53:05.390 --> 01:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
suspicious that it's storing
 
01:53:07.470 --> 01:53:07.480 align:start position:0%
information what people have been doing
 
01:53:09.430 --> 01:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
is calling up the Attorney General's
 
01:53:12.069 --> 01:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
office and the consumer protection
 
01:53:13.589 --> 01:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
division who was here he was here
 
01:53:16.870 --> 01:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday and he was saying is you know
 
01:53:19.510 --> 01:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
he he's just on that call he's not going
 
01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:22.639 align:start position:0%
to go in and you know to a merchant and
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
to find out what they're doing what
 
01:53:27.310 --> 01:53:27.320 align:start position:0%
they're going what's going on so in this
 
01:53:29.629 --> 01:53:29.639 align:start position:0%
case because the Liquor Commission
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
already has statutory authority to do
 
01:53:35.189 --> 01:53:35.199 align:start position:0%
investigations on any
 
01:53:37.870 --> 01:53:37.880 align:start position:0%
lensey The Liquor Commission absolutely
 
01:53:39.470 --> 01:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
will know what machines they're looking
 
01:53:42.510 --> 01:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
at and if and they'll know the machines
 
01:53:44.270 --> 01:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
because there's only a handful of them
 
01:53:46.229 --> 01:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
out there and so they'll look at the
 
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
machine and they'll know which machine
 
01:53:50.950 --> 01:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
you know if the machine is what they
 
01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
expect they'll already know that that
 
01:53:56.589 --> 01:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
machine does not store any data that the
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of the machine is Simply Red Red
 
01:54:02.669 --> 01:54:02.679 align:start position:0%
Light Green Light then then there won't
 
01:54:04.629 --> 01:54:04.639 align:start position:0%
be a problem however if they see a
 
01:54:07.390 --> 01:54:07.400 align:start position:0%
machine they've never seen before yeah
 
01:54:09.589 --> 01:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
then absolutely they will do their home
 
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
homework on that machine to find out
 
01:54:12.870 --> 01:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
whether that machine has the capability
 
01:54:17.310 --> 01:54:17.320 align:start position:0%
of storing and if it does the uh The
 
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
Establishment runs the risk of losing
 
01:54:21.189 --> 01:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
their license and there also a
 
01:54:24.510 --> 01:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
discussion uh that was that right now
 
01:54:28.669 --> 01:54:28.679 align:start position:0%
there's no Universal scanner per se so
 
01:54:30.870 --> 01:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
did are they going to work on that yeah
 
01:54:32.109 --> 01:54:32.119 align:start position:0%
they're they're
 
01:54:34.430 --> 01:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely they believe it or not
 
01:54:35.830 --> 01:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
they're actually seen plenty of these
 
01:54:37.669 --> 01:54:37.679 align:start position:0%
machines already they already know about
 
01:54:39.109 --> 01:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
these machines because they see them all
 
01:54:42.390 --> 01:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
the time okay so but that it's uh the
 
01:54:46.310 --> 01:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
problem was that the the bill as it was
 
01:54:49.629 --> 01:54:49.639 align:start position:0%
introduced was piggybacking on a statute
 
01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
that was already in lure that was
 
01:54:54.350 --> 01:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
related to pawn
 
01:54:57.470 --> 01:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
shops which absolutely stored the
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
driver's license number because that's
 
01:55:01.870 --> 01:55:01.880 align:start position:0%
what the pawn shops were you know they
 
01:55:05.589 --> 01:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
wanted so in that case those machines
 
01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
cannot be used in a liquor establishment
 
01:55:12.510 --> 01:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
okay they just they they be barred
 
01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
01:55:16.629 --> 01:55:16.639 align:start position:0%
statute any other discussion on the
 
01:55:20.589 --> 01:55:20.599 align:start position:0%

all right we'll open up the public
 
03:38:02.710 --> 03:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
hearing at house go 186 and here from
 
03:38:05.429 --> 03:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor representative
 
03:38:08.990 --> 03:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
Sullivan good afternoon representative
 
03:38:09.000 --> 03:38:19.070 align:start position:0%
Sullivan good afternoon representative
Sullivan

03:38:19.070 --> 03:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:21.870 --> 03:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman hunt and
 
03:38:24.750 --> 03:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
everybody else on my fellow committee um
 
03:38:27.830 --> 03:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
we've all been here before and we've H
 
03:38:30.349 --> 03:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
us out a bunch in the last couple years
 
03:38:32.870 --> 03:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
and uh my motivation behind this bill is
 
03:38:35.590 --> 03:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
many uh first and foremost I think it's
 
03:38:36.910 --> 03:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
ridiculous we continue to arrest people
 
03:38:39.229 --> 03:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for possession of
 
03:38:42.710 --> 03:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
cannabis and I think that needs to stop
 
03:38:44.990 --> 03:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
and so this is one of two bills I put in
 
03:38:46.510 --> 03:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
the other one was in front of Criminal
 
03:38:49.670 --> 03:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
Justice where they um are just the part
 
03:38:51.950 --> 03:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
that legalizes it this does legalization
 
03:38:54.469 --> 03:38:54.479 align:start position:0%
plus sale and regulation of the Commerce
 
03:38:57.030 --> 03:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
part of it which is why it's here this
 
03:38:59.030 --> 03:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
bill is largely modeled on the bill that
 
03:39:01.870 --> 03:39:01.880 align:start position:0%
we passed uh close to unanimously out of
 
03:39:03.750 --> 03:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
our committee in
 
03:39:07.110 --> 03:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
2023 and then we overwhelmingly passed
 
03:39:09.110 --> 03:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
it out of the house in 2023 as well I
 
03:39:12.550 --> 03:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
think it was 290 votes or something I
 
03:39:15.030 --> 03:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
don't remember the exact vote um so
 
03:39:17.550 --> 03:39:17.560 align:start position:0%
basic Bally it was 53030 I think it was
 
03:39:19.630 --> 03:39:19.640 align:start position:0%
539 back in uh
 
03:39:23.790 --> 03:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
2023 so a few differences is we are just
 
03:39:27.110 --> 03:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
going to use the room and meals tax um
 
03:39:30.110 --> 03:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
so we will still have a very low tax
 
03:39:32.349 --> 03:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
rate on it I think uh in the previous
 
03:39:36.710 --> 03:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
Bill if I recall um it was more like the
 
03:39:38.429 --> 03:39:38.439 align:start position:0%
beer model where we were going to be
 
03:39:40.590 --> 03:39:40.600 align:start position:0%
taxing like cultivation but there
 
03:39:42.469 --> 03:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
there's problems with doing it that way
 
03:39:44.150 --> 03:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
particularly if it becomes legal
 
03:39:46.950 --> 03:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
federally um cultivation could be moving
 
03:39:49.510 --> 03:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
out of state um there's a lot of lot a
 
03:39:51.309 --> 03:39:51.319 align:start position:0%
lot of reasons into why I thought just
 
03:39:54.229 --> 03:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
the r runin meals tax would be better it
 
03:39:55.030 --> 03:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
would be consider it would be
 
03:39:57.030 --> 03:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
undercutting all of our neighbors so in
 
03:39:59.110 --> 03:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
the same way that we attract a lot of
 
03:40:01.710 --> 03:40:01.720 align:start position:0%
alcohol sales here from neighboring
 
03:40:03.990 --> 03:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
states that have more expensive uh
 
03:40:05.950 --> 03:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
alcohol products we would hopefully be
 
03:40:08.030 --> 03:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
doing the same here in the way that
 
03:40:10.750 --> 03:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
right now New Hampshire money is leaving
 
03:40:12.150 --> 03:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
to go to our neighboring states because
 
03:40:13.670 --> 03:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
we don't have it legal we would start
 
03:40:15.910 --> 03:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
attracting some other states
 
03:40:17.469 --> 03:40:17.479 align:start position:0%
residents to come here because our
 
03:40:19.189 --> 03:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
products would presumably be cheaper
 
03:40:20.950 --> 03:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
because the tax regime would be a lot
 
03:40:24.349 --> 03:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
lower than they are in Massachusetts
 
03:40:27.110 --> 03:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
Vermont Maine it would be whatever the
 
03:40:29.070 --> 03:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
state's room meals tax right now that is
 
03:40:31.189 --> 03:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
8 and a half% so unless that were to
 
03:40:34.269 --> 03:40:34.279 align:start position:0%
change um it would be the lowest of
 
03:40:36.910 --> 03:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
lowest of all the states uh in New
 
03:40:40.070 --> 03:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
England um a few things in here so we
 
03:40:43.030 --> 03:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
have a independent cannabis commission
 
03:40:46.189 --> 03:40:46.199 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:40:46.199 --> 03:40:47.110 align:start position:0%
so um
this

03:40:47.110 --> 03:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:40:51.229 --> 03:40:51.239 align:start position:0%
commission you this is on uh page 11 so
 
03:40:53.710 --> 03:40:53.720 align:start position:0%
this commission would would be
 
03:40:55.990 --> 03:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
established and you can see starting on
 
03:40:59.750 --> 03:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
line 10 the various experts that would
 
03:40:59.760 --> 03:41:00.469 align:start position:0%
line 10 the various experts that would
be

03:41:00.469 --> 03:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:41:03.830 --> 03:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
appointed um the the governor would be
 
03:41:06.349 --> 03:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
in charge of creating this Advisory
 
03:41:10.429 --> 03:41:10.439 align:start position:0%
Board and this uh I worked with a lot of
 
03:41:13.630 --> 03:41:13.640 align:start position:0%
the various interests in this in this
 
03:41:16.269 --> 03:41:16.279 align:start position:0%
this sphere to help create the various
 
03:41:18.429 --> 03:41:18.439 align:start position:0%
um experts that we would need to have
 
03:41:21.550 --> 03:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
this commission created so that we could
 
03:41:23.710 --> 03:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully have um really sensible
 
03:41:26.189 --> 03:41:26.199 align:start position:0%
regulations because this while it's a
 
03:41:29.349 --> 03:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
bill to legalize and regulate at some
 
03:41:30.870 --> 03:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
level there's going to be a lot of Ru
 
03:41:32.429 --> 03:41:32.439 align:start position:0%
making required to get into the
 
03:41:35.149 --> 03:41:35.159 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty that isn't able to be done
 
03:41:37.429 --> 03:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
in this bill and this this commission
 
03:41:38.910 --> 03:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
will be the ones that do that they're
 
03:41:40.910 --> 03:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
the ones that that are the same way that
 
03:41:42.429 --> 03:41:42.439 align:start position:0%
we have plenty of rule making in all
 
03:41:47.229 --> 03:41:47.239 align:start position:0%
other industries that we regulate um
 
03:41:49.990 --> 03:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
03:41:52.990 --> 03:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
um expenses there will be some expenses
 
03:41:55.910 --> 03:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
going out right away uh to start start
 
03:41:57.590 --> 03:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
establishing this but you know within a
 
03:41:59.910 --> 03:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
couple years we should start having some
 
03:42:02.790 --> 03:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
licenses and and hopefully start U
 
03:42:05.269 --> 03:42:05.279 align:start position:0%
selling selling cannabis to start
 
03:42:07.429 --> 03:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
bringing in in additional Revenue into
 
03:42:09.590 --> 03:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
the state um and eventually this would
 
03:42:11.229 --> 03:42:11.239 align:start position:0%
become a profitable industry for the
 
03:42:14.630 --> 03:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
state but certainly there would be an
 
03:42:14.640 --> 03:42:15.990 align:start position:0%
state but certainly there would be an
upfront

03:42:15.990 --> 03:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
upfront
 
03:42:16.000 --> 03:42:18.429 align:start position:0%
upfront
expenditure

03:42:18.429 --> 03:42:18.439 align:start position:0%
expenditure
 
03:42:21.910 --> 03:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that while
 
03:42:24.830 --> 03:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not I mean I would I would love
 
03:42:26.830 --> 03:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
to see
 
03:42:29.790 --> 03:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm not that concerned
 
03:42:33.710 --> 03:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
about public smoking myself I think you
 
03:42:36.229 --> 03:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
know to the extent that we allow people
 
03:42:38.349 --> 03:42:38.359 align:start position:0%
smoking cigarettes in
 
03:42:41.429 --> 03:42:41.439 align:start position:0%
public I I I don't see the harm in this
 
03:42:43.469 --> 03:42:43.479 align:start position:0%
uh i' I've heard loud and clear from
 
03:42:45.750 --> 03:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
many people that I
 
03:42:47.790 --> 03:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
who that would be a deal breaker for
 
03:42:50.309 --> 03:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
them that is in here so that you you
 
03:42:53.110 --> 03:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
know we' be prohibited from smoking in
 
03:42:56.510 --> 03:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
public um and so hopefully that will
 
03:42:58.590 --> 03:42:58.600 align:start position:0%
address one of the concerns that I heard
 
03:43:00.469 --> 03:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
from numerous people who were kind of on
 
03:43:03.510 --> 03:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
the fence not on this committee but in
 
03:43:05.630 --> 03:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
conversations on in the other body as
 
03:43:08.269 --> 03:43:08.279 align:start position:0%
well as members in our in our own body
 
03:43:09.870 --> 03:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
um so that's one of the things that
 
03:43:11.429 --> 03:43:11.439 align:start position:0%
wasn't exactly what I was looking for
 
03:43:13.309 --> 03:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
but I thought that was a a reasonable
 
03:43:14.830 --> 03:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
compromise to make because people were
 
03:43:18.149 --> 03:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
conc concerned about that um let me see
 
03:43:20.870 --> 03:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
any other high
 
03:43:20.880 --> 03:43:23.910 align:start position:0%
any other high
levels

03:43:23.910 --> 03:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:26.630 --> 03:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think with that I can open up
 
03:43:28.870 --> 03:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
to some questions
 
03:43:31.429 --> 03:43:31.439 align:start position:0%
um hopefully I can get the support on
 
03:43:33.149 --> 03:43:33.159 align:start position:0%
this committee and hopefully in in our
 
03:43:34.349 --> 03:43:34.359 align:start position:0%
house I know it's going to be a tough
 
03:43:38.110 --> 03:43:38.120 align:start position:0%
year I'm I'm not going through life with
 
03:43:40.030 --> 03:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
rosecolor glasses about the environment
 
03:43:41.750 --> 03:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
with respect to cannabis legalization at
 
03:43:44.389 --> 03:43:44.399 align:start position:0%
the state but the house has often been
 
03:43:46.790 --> 03:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
able to push out good bills on this
 
03:43:48.309 --> 03:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
subject and I hope that we can do so
 
03:43:50.750 --> 03:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
again this year U the majority of people
 
03:43:53.990 --> 03:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire want it and I think if
 
03:43:56.030 --> 03:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
we continue to push out good bills when
 
03:43:58.710 --> 03:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
the environment is suitable hopefully
 
03:44:01.149 --> 03:44:01.159 align:start position:0%
we'll have a good framework by which to
 
03:44:06.469 --> 03:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:09.389 --> 03:44:09.399 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
03:44:13.630 --> 03:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
shm uh so did I understand correctly
 
03:44:15.510 --> 03:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
when he said
 
03:44:19.149 --> 03:44:19.159 align:start position:0%
uh public smoking of uh cannabis will
 
03:44:21.309 --> 03:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
still not be permitted that's under this
 
03:44:23.189 --> 03:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
bill correct yeah that yeah it be it
 
03:44:24.309 --> 03:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
would be prohibited and I think there's
 
03:44:26.910 --> 03:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
a a fine a fine schedule in here that
 
03:44:28.510 --> 03:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
you could look at first fine I think
 
03:44:30.550 --> 03:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
it's $100 it could go up to 500 after
 
03:44:33.349 --> 03:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
two or three um it'd be like a
 
03:44:34.910 --> 03:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor wouldn't be it be a fine
 
03:44:36.870 --> 03:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor situation you wouldn't be
 
03:44:38.510 --> 03:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
arrested and convicted and become a
 
03:44:39.830 --> 03:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
felon or anything like that but yeah
 
03:44:41.189 --> 03:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
there'd be some sort of penalty
 
03:44:43.870 --> 03:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
associated with it can I can I ask a
 
03:44:46.349 --> 03:44:46.359 align:start position:0%
follow question further question me
 
03:44:49.590 --> 03:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
inquire so uh is will will it also not
 
03:44:53.630 --> 03:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
permitted uh to uh to smoke cannabis in
 
03:44:55.830 --> 03:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
restaurants and
 
03:44:58.510 --> 03:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
uh no I mean right now you can't even
 
03:45:01.590 --> 03:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
smoke cigarettes in restaurants so that
 
03:45:03.710 --> 03:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't be allowed office
 
03:45:06.630 --> 03:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
yeah no so anywhere that you can't smoke
 
03:45:09.389 --> 03:45:09.399 align:start position:0%
you can't smoke any marijuana uh oh
 
03:45:11.349 --> 03:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
sorry anywhere you can't smoke tobacco
 
03:45:12.429 --> 03:45:12.439 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't suddenly be allowed to
 
03:45:14.590 --> 03:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
smoke marijuana alone but off office
 
03:45:16.349 --> 03:45:16.359 align:start position:0%
spaces there are designated areas where
 
03:45:19.429 --> 03:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
people can smoke cigarettes will they
 
03:45:22.030 --> 03:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
permitted to smoke there you talking
 
03:45:23.710 --> 03:45:23.720 align:start position:0%
about designated smokeing designated
 
03:45:25.950 --> 03:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
smoking area uh I would I would say
 
03:45:27.910 --> 03:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
probably not I mean that's not
 
03:45:29.710 --> 03:45:29.720 align:start position:0%
specifically defined in here I think the
 
03:45:32.469 --> 03:45:32.479 align:start position:0%
intent and and that that could be maybe
 
03:45:34.469 --> 03:45:34.479 align:start position:0%
fleshed out in the ru making part of
 
03:45:37.229 --> 03:45:37.239 align:start position:0%
this I mean I think so I think that
 
03:45:39.550 --> 03:45:39.560 align:start position:0%
would go against the intent of why I put
 
03:45:42.229 --> 03:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
that in here because and I'm not sure
 
03:45:45.910 --> 03:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
that this is accurate it I've heard
 
03:45:45.920 --> 03:45:47.630 align:start position:0%
that this is accurate it I've heard
mixed

03:45:47.630 --> 03:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
mixed
 
03:45:51.750 --> 03:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh mixed evidence of this so perhaps
 
03:45:53.469 --> 03:45:53.479 align:start position:0%
it's unsettled at this moment in terms
 
03:45:55.070 --> 03:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
of the science on it
 
03:45:58.309 --> 03:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
but I heard from a few people who ID
 
03:46:00.830 --> 03:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
hoped to gain support by putting this me
 
03:46:02.870 --> 03:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
this language in there that they're
 
03:46:05.830 --> 03:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
concerned about secondhand smoke if
 
03:46:07.990 --> 03:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
somebody's smoking marijuana because so
 
03:46:10.349 --> 03:46:10.359 align:start position:0%
long as it remains a legal federally it
 
03:46:11.910 --> 03:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
could potentially make somebody who
 
03:46:14.950 --> 03:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
isn't smoking unable to pass a drug test
 
03:46:16.269 --> 03:46:16.279 align:start position:0%
and that would be something that would
 
03:46:17.590 --> 03:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
be a problem for anything that requires
 
03:46:19.630 --> 03:46:19.640 align:start position:0%
a drug test for federal positions
 
03:46:21.349 --> 03:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
whether whether or not that's true from
 
03:46:24.189 --> 03:46:24.199 align:start position:0%
the science perspective I wasn't able to
 
03:46:27.110 --> 03:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
like consistently find one answer one or
 
03:46:28.590 --> 03:46:28.600 align:start position:0%
the one way or the other so maybe it's
 
03:46:31.429 --> 03:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
sort of like it's theoretically possible
 
03:46:34.590 --> 03:46:34.600 align:start position:0%
so yeah this would a designated smoking
 
03:46:37.389 --> 03:46:37.399 align:start position:0%
area at an office for example would go
 
03:46:39.550 --> 03:46:39.560 align:start position:0%
against the spirit of what we're trying
 
03:46:41.070 --> 03:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
to accomplish here which is to prevent
 
03:46:43.510 --> 03:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
people from inhaling secondhand smoke of
 
03:46:46.189 --> 03:46:46.199 align:start position:0%
it where obviously a designated smoking
 
03:46:48.550 --> 03:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
area if I walk through I could
 
03:46:53.070 --> 03:46:53.080 align:start position:0%
theoretically inhale something um so can
 
03:46:54.590 --> 03:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
I ask another follow quick Qui quick
 
03:46:57.030 --> 03:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
followup further
 
03:46:59.910 --> 03:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
question so if I
 
03:47:03.550 --> 03:47:03.560 align:start position:0%
correctly so in the office space that's
 
03:47:06.790 --> 03:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
area they cannot smoke
 
03:47:09.750 --> 03:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
marijuana can they smoke marijuana and
 
03:47:10.790 --> 03:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
come to the
 
03:47:13.630 --> 03:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
office you could smoke marijuana at home
 
03:47:16.870 --> 03:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
and come to the office so long as I mean
 
03:47:19.389 --> 03:47:19.399 align:start position:0%
that's not breaking a law I mean maybe
 
03:47:20.750 --> 03:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't do that maybe you
 
03:47:22.630 --> 03:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do that for a work reason but
 
03:47:25.110 --> 03:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I mean it's not it's not illegal
 
03:47:27.830 --> 03:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
to be high in public if that's the
 
03:47:29.269 --> 03:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
question you're
 
03:47:31.910 --> 03:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
asking I think he's asking is it okay
 
03:47:34.550 --> 03:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
for the employer to Bar anybody from
 
03:47:36.910 --> 03:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
being stoned when they come to work uh I
 
03:47:39.670 --> 03:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
think that would be similar I think yes
 
03:47:42.429 --> 03:47:42.439 align:start position:0%
I think a a corporation could certainly
 
03:47:46.229 --> 03:47:46.239 align:start position:0%
pass a rule or their own policy where
 
03:47:47.429 --> 03:47:47.439 align:start position:0%
you know we don't want somebody to be
 
03:47:50.469 --> 03:47:50.479 align:start position:0%
drunk or high when when employed by us
 
03:47:52.670 --> 03:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
while on the clock I think that's a fair
 
03:47:55.309 --> 03:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
rule but this doesn't touch that that's
 
03:47:57.590 --> 03:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
sort of a private
 
03:48:00.389 --> 03:48:00.399 align:start position:0%
company's um
 
03:48:03.070 --> 03:48:03.080 align:start position:0%
policies thank
 
03:48:05.349 --> 03:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:48:08.110 --> 03:48:08.120 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair um
 
03:48:09.830 --> 03:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative celan first of all I want
 
03:48:13.110 --> 03:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
to compliment you um I think this bill
 
03:48:15.149 --> 03:48:15.159 align:start position:0%
um is an improvement on the previous
 
03:48:17.630 --> 03:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
bill from the last session uh both in
 
03:48:20.229 --> 03:48:20.239 align:start position:0%
the creation of a cannabis commission
 
03:48:22.670 --> 03:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
and in the way the bill bases the
 
03:48:26.189 --> 03:48:26.199 align:start position:0%
Cannabis tax on the rooms and meals tax
 
03:48:30.269 --> 03:48:30.279 align:start position:0%
um I have one really minor question um
 
03:48:32.429 --> 03:48:32.439 align:start position:0%
in the bill there is a reference and I
 
03:48:34.110 --> 03:48:34.120 align:start position:0%
can't tell you where it is because I
 
03:48:38.110 --> 03:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
read the bill last night on my iPad um
 
03:48:40.189 --> 03:48:40.199 align:start position:0%
but there's a reference to reporting to
 
03:48:43.269 --> 03:48:43.279 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission um am I right in
 
03:48:46.229 --> 03:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
thinking that that should say report to
 
03:48:49.229 --> 03:48:49.239 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis commission yes so it's not
 
03:48:51.630 --> 03:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
set up right now to report to the Liquor
 
03:48:54.229 --> 03:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
Commission uh I don't remember reading
 
03:48:56.070 --> 03:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
that when I saw that so I might have
 
03:48:57.950 --> 03:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
missed that because that was not the
 
03:49:04.189 --> 03:49:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:07.830 --> 03:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
you guess we're all set all right thank
 
03:49:11.870 --> 03:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
you chair Colin Heath Howard who is a
 
03:49:11.880 --> 03:49:19.389 align:start position:0%
you chair Colin Heath Howard who is a
co-sponsor

03:49:19.389 --> 03:49:19.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:20.830 --> 03:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and fellow
 
03:49:22.469 --> 03:49:22.479 align:start position:0%
committee members uh my name is
 
03:49:24.349 --> 03:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
representative Heath Howard I represent
 
03:49:25.750 --> 03:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
the towns of straford and barington and
 
03:49:28.389 --> 03:49:28.399 align:start position:0%
straford District 4 uh I come in front
 
03:49:32.510 --> 03:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
of you today in support of HB uh 186
 
03:49:35.309 --> 03:49:35.319 align:start position:0%
because it to me is pretty common sense
 
03:49:37.590 --> 03:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
right now we've been seeing huge Revenue
 
03:49:40.269 --> 03:49:40.279 align:start position:0%
declines and this is a great way that we
 
03:49:42.070 --> 03:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
can help kind of climb out of that hole
 
03:49:44.710 --> 03:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
without introducing new tax burdens onto
 
03:49:47.469 --> 03:49:47.479 align:start position:0%
our public it also gives people new
 
03:49:48.990 --> 03:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
Liberties which I do believe that they
 
03:49:51.309 --> 03:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
should have access to in being able to
 
03:49:53.469 --> 03:49:53.479 align:start position:0%
possess cannabis as representative
 
03:49:55.950 --> 03:49:55.960 align:start position:0%
Sullivan had said it has nothing to do
 
03:49:58.149 --> 03:49:58.159 align:start position:0%
with public use of cannabis and would
 
03:50:03.110 --> 03:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
still Outlaw that uh as uh this has been
 
03:50:05.590 --> 03:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
kind of a uh a point that I had made a
 
03:50:08.550 --> 03:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
point on uh during the the floor debate
 
03:50:11.149 --> 03:50:11.159 align:start position:0%
uh last session I had spoken in
 
03:50:15.149 --> 03:50:15.159 align:start position:0%
opposition uh to uh some change that
 
03:50:19.030 --> 03:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
would prevent any sort or would impose a
 
03:50:22.189 --> 03:50:22.199 align:start position:0%
ban on public uh smoking or vaping uh
 
03:50:24.309 --> 03:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
I've since compromised on that part of
 
03:50:27.269 --> 03:50:27.279 align:start position:0%
the issue and am willing to uh try and
 
03:50:29.550 --> 03:50:29.560 align:start position:0%
work to get this through in any way
 
03:50:32.349 --> 03:50:32.359 align:start position:0%
possible uh so again it's not
 
03:50:33.830 --> 03:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily what I would have preferred
 
03:50:36.429 --> 03:50:36.439 align:start position:0%
or would have wanted but it's something
 
03:50:38.189 --> 03:50:38.199 align:start position:0%
that I think that we can get across the
 
03:50:39.469 --> 03:50:39.479 align:start position:0%
finish line and at least get to the
 
03:50:44.830 --> 03:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:46.870 --> 03:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
03:50:49.750 --> 03:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
members seeing none thank you very much
 
03:50:49.760 --> 03:50:51.550 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Chiefs of police have
 
03:51:47.910 --> 03:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
identified several areas of concern from
 
03:51:49.670 --> 03:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
Public Safety perspective surrounding
 
03:51:52.070 --> 03:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
the legalization of marijuana the
 
03:51:54.630 --> 03:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
operating of vehicles and the inability
 
03:51:59.670 --> 03:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
to test uh for legal limits um that's a
 
03:52:02.510 --> 03:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
huge concern for Public Safety um
 
03:52:06.070 --> 03:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
protecting law enforcement profession um
 
03:52:08.590 --> 03:52:08.600 align:start position:0%
currently a person cannot possess a
 
03:52:11.309 --> 03:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
firearm under federal law while using
 
03:52:16.189 --> 03:52:16.199 align:start position:0%
marijuana or having used marijuana
 
03:52:19.070 --> 03:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
if portions of this law are enacted or
 
03:52:22.469 --> 03:52:22.479 align:start position:0%
this bill are enacted it would require
 
03:52:22.479 --> 03:52:23.469 align:start position:0%
this bill are enacted it would require
police

03:52:23.469 --> 03:52:23.479 align:start position:0%
police
 
03:52:26.590 --> 03:52:26.600 align:start position:0%
officers to be able to use marijuana and
 
03:52:28.030 --> 03:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
have a
 
03:52:31.550 --> 03:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
firearm um hom grow will remove any
 
03:52:33.870 --> 03:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
potential revenue and will saturate the
 
03:52:36.590 --> 03:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
state with untested uncontrolled
 
03:52:38.950 --> 03:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
marijuana the analment section we
 
03:52:40.910 --> 03:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
believe is unnecessary language there
 
03:52:42.750 --> 03:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
was already a process in place for an
 
03:52:44.910 --> 03:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
nments which review the case and
 
03:52:46.710 --> 03:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances in a
 
03:52:49.189 --> 03:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
totality finally the restricting of
 
03:52:50.990 --> 03:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
denial of employment for the use of
 
03:52:53.710 --> 03:52:53.720 align:start position:0%
marijuana endangers all Granite Staters
 
03:52:55.149 --> 03:52:55.159 align:start position:0%
from the police officer wearing a
 
03:52:57.389 --> 03:52:57.399 align:start position:0%
firearm as I previously mentioned the
 
03:53:00.990 --> 03:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
commercial truck operator to the pilot
 
03:53:03.830 --> 03:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
and the driver of our children's school
 
03:53:06.550 --> 03:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
buses that's a concern for that we
 
03:53:08.269 --> 03:53:08.279 align:start position:0%
should all have concerning our children
 
03:53:12.910 --> 03:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:16.309 --> 03:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
you representative Herbert has a
 
03:53:19.429 --> 03:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
question in terms of uh the
 
03:53:24.590 --> 03:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
potency of uh the various strains of
 
03:53:28.630 --> 03:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
marijuana are they uh greater
 
03:53:33.469 --> 03:53:33.479 align:start position:0%
or uh less potent than previous
 
03:53:35.790 --> 03:53:35.800 align:start position:0%
strains when you say previous strains
 
03:53:38.510 --> 03:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
and we're talking back in the 70s um
 
03:53:42.070 --> 03:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
I've heard it's 80 90% stronger um and I
 
03:53:44.710 --> 03:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
don't have the exact numbers but as I
 
03:53:50.429 --> 03:53:50.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:53.030 --> 03:53:53.040 align:start position:0%

um Mr Sullivan uh I was reading an
 
03:55:20.750 --> 03:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
article in the Wall Street Journal the
 
03:55:22.630 --> 03:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
other day about
 
03:55:24.429 --> 03:55:24.439 align:start position:0%
THC the
 
03:55:27.750 --> 03:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
THC uh from back in my day in 60s and
 
03:55:29.990 --> 03:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
70s was about
 
03:55:35.149 --> 03:55:35.159 align:start position:0%
6% the THC of the 21st century tested
 
03:55:37.510 --> 03:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
last year was
 
03:55:41.229 --> 03:55:41.239 align:start position:0%
90% just FYI would you believe I would
 
03:55:43.910 --> 03:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
and thank you I that's well within lines
 
03:55:46.590 --> 03:55:46.600 align:start position:0%
of what I've been hearing
 
03:55:48.910 --> 03:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
but representative
 
03:55:51.670 --> 03:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair uh this is
 
03:55:53.630 --> 03:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
basically a follow up on on my previous
 
03:55:56.309 --> 03:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
question um can you tell us anything
 
03:55:57.710 --> 03:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
about how other states that have
 
03:56:02.070 --> 03:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
legalized marijuana um determine whether
 
03:56:06.229 --> 03:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
um a driver uh is impaired after using
 
03:56:08.309 --> 03:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
marijuana there are several different
 
03:56:10.830 --> 03:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
programs aide
 
03:56:15.429 --> 03:56:15.439 align:start position:0%
um such as those detection classes
 
03:56:19.030 --> 03:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
um again we have very limited resources
 
03:56:21.189 --> 03:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire as far as training
 
03:56:24.030 --> 03:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
the number of police officers that need
 
03:56:24.040 --> 03:56:30.550 align:start position:0%
the number of police officers that need
that

03:56:30.550 --> 03:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:33.990 --> 03:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
certification represent
 
03:56:37.910 --> 03:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
spear I know that at BAE Systems of
 
03:56:39.309 --> 03:56:39.319 align:start position:0%
course you can't you can't go to work
 
03:56:41.670 --> 03:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
over there but that's a federal those
 
03:56:43.830 --> 03:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
are federal contracts but is there
 
03:56:46.830 --> 03:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
anything stopping the police from saying
 
03:56:49.790 --> 03:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
you we don't want you to have uh
 
03:56:52.189 --> 03:56:52.199 align:start position:0%
marijuana I mean can't they just say as
 
03:56:55.110 --> 03:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
an employer under
 
03:56:59.429 --> 03:56:59.439 align:start position:0%
this yeah bill it says it cannot be
 
03:57:03.309 --> 03:57:03.319 align:start position:0%
discriminate you cannot as an employer
 
03:57:05.429 --> 03:57:05.439 align:start position:0%
discriminate and so you're taking that
 
03:57:07.469 --> 03:57:07.479 align:start position:0%
to mean that you can't you can't say
 
03:57:10.790 --> 03:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:13.590 --> 03:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
marijuana or you can't discriminate a
 
03:57:20.630 --> 03:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:25.229 --> 03:57:25.239 align:start position:0%
recall oh boy we have another round repr
 
03:57:30.910 --> 03:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
Teresa so uh based on your experience so
 
03:57:33.189 --> 03:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
far uh the states where they have
 
03:57:34.710 --> 03:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
legalized the neighboring state
 
03:57:36.309 --> 03:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Maine
 
03:57:41.030 --> 03:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
Vermont from the police department
 
03:57:44.269 --> 03:57:44.279 align:start position:0%
perspective have they seen increase in
 
03:57:47.070 --> 03:57:47.080 align:start position:0%
criminalization or increase in law
 
03:57:50.229 --> 03:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
breaking or disruption that you that you
 
03:57:51.910 --> 03:57:51.920 align:start position:0%

03:57:55.070 --> 03:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
increases in impaired driving um
 
03:57:57.630 --> 03:57:57.640 align:start position:0%
increases in
 
03:58:01.590 --> 03:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
fatals as far as the employment portion
 
03:58:04.950 --> 03:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to that I I don't know and

Committee thank you for the introduction
 
03:59:03.870 --> 03:59:03.880 align:start position:0%
chairman uh my name is Joe Hannon um I
 
03:59:05.309 --> 03:59:05.319 align:start position:0%
served on the governance commission to
 
03:59:07.469 --> 03:59:07.479 align:start position:0%
regulate uh the commission to regulate
 
03:59:10.830 --> 03:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
Taxation and uh sale of marijuana at the
 
03:59:13.349 --> 03:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
time uh back in 2018 I think it was 18
 
03:59:13.359 --> 03:59:14.550 align:start position:0%
time uh back in 2018 I think it was 18
19

03:59:14.550 --> 03:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
19
 
03:59:16.070 --> 03:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm also on the board of New
 
03:59:17.630 --> 03:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cannabis Association on their
 
03:59:20.870 --> 03:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board um I stand in favor of
 
03:59:22.990 --> 03:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
this bill it's it's very similar I'm
 
03:59:25.269 --> 03:59:25.279 align:start position:0%
sure if you flip through it you wouldn't
 
03:59:26.790 --> 03:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
see it too different than bills that had
 
03:59:28.229 --> 03:59:28.239 align:start position:0%
passed this Committee in the house at
 
03:59:29.670 --> 03:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
least once in the past probably more
 
03:59:33.070 --> 03:59:33.080 align:start position:0%
than that um I think it's a good start
 
03:59:35.189 --> 03:59:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh one thing I I didn't find I was
 
03:59:36.670 --> 03:59:36.680 align:start position:0%
listening to other people testifying I
 
03:59:37.790 --> 03:59:37.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't find anything in this bill that
 
03:59:39.990 --> 03:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
says that people have to use cannabis
 
03:59:42.429 --> 03:59:42.439 align:start position:0%
like you cops don't have to start using
 
03:59:44.309 --> 03:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
it and Pilots don't have to start using
 
03:59:46.189 --> 03:59:46.199 align:start position:0%
it you don't have to do it this isn't
 
03:59:48.110 --> 03:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
making anyone do anything it's giving
 
03:59:51.070 --> 03:59:51.080 align:start position:0%
someone a choice um and they can be
 
03:59:52.790 --> 03:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
prevented from those positions if they
 
03:59:54.389 --> 03:59:54.399 align:start position:0%
are under the influence especially
 
03:59:55.950 --> 03:59:55.960 align:start position:0%
because of federal law being what it is
 
03:59:57.349 --> 03:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
so I don't I don't think that's really
 
04:00:00.630 --> 04:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
an issue uh in 2022 the national survey
 
04:00:03.550 --> 04:00:03.560 align:start position:0%
on drug use uh and health about half of
 
04:00:06.710 --> 04:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
us adults uh 50.3% were found to have
 
04:00:08.269 --> 04:00:08.279 align:start position:0%
used cannabis at some point in their
 
04:00:09.349 --> 04:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
lives I'm not going to ask anyone in
 
04:00:11.030 --> 04:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
here to raise hands but that would be
 
04:00:11.040 --> 04:00:12.309 align:start position:0%
here to raise hands but that would be
about

04:00:12.309 --> 04:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:00:15.510 --> 04:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
10.3 of you uh that would be have at
 
04:00:18.670 --> 04:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
least used it once in your lives in 2023
 
04:00:20.469 --> 04:00:20.479 align:start position:0%
it was estimated there were 55 a. half
 
04:00:22.550 --> 04:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
million us adults who had used at least
 
04:00:24.510 --> 04:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
once in the previous
 
04:00:28.469 --> 04:00:28.479 align:start position:0%
year okay now Lincoln once said that in
 
04:00:30.469 --> 04:00:30.479 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing the best way to to get a
 
04:00:32.229 --> 04:00:32.239 align:start position:0%
bad law repealed is to enforce it
 
04:00:35.429 --> 04:00:35.439 align:start position:0%
strictly cannabis laws are not enforced
 
04:00:37.149 --> 04:00:37.159 align:start position:0%
strictly obviously and they're certainly
 
04:00:39.469 --> 04:00:39.479 align:start position:0%
not enforced fairly you're five times
 
04:00:40.950 --> 04:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
more likely and sometimes six times
 
04:00:42.910 --> 04:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
depending on your jurisdiction more
 
04:00:44.469 --> 04:00:44.479 align:start position:0%
likely to be arrested for cannabis
 
04:00:47.070 --> 04:00:47.080 align:start position:0%
missed a possession offense if you are a
 
04:00:49.550 --> 04:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
person of color or other minority so
 
04:00:54.269 --> 04:00:54.279 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not uniformly um enforced
 
04:00:56.469 --> 04:00:56.479 align:start position:0%
if 55 million Americans were rounded up
 
04:00:57.950 --> 04:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
and sent to prison for up to seven and a
 
04:01:00.110 --> 04:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
half years for their first defense there
 
04:01:02.229 --> 04:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be just uh a protest or some
 
04:01:04.070 --> 04:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
rioting there'd be another Revolution
 
04:01:05.389 --> 04:01:05.399 align:start position:0%
that would make the one we did over the
 
04:01:09.070 --> 04:01:09.080 align:start position:0%
1% Stamp Act look like peanuts you
 
04:01:10.750 --> 04:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't lock up one out of seven people
 
04:01:13.269 --> 04:01:13.279 align:start position:0%
in this country and not see consequences
 
04:01:14.389 --> 04:01:14.399 align:start position:0%
but we have a long on the books that
 
04:01:16.790 --> 04:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
everyone wants to enforce but not too
 
04:01:18.870 --> 04:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
much because if they did it would we
 
04:01:20.389 --> 04:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
would have the result of we wouldn't
 
04:01:21.630 --> 04:01:21.640 align:start position:0%
have to listen to these bills every year
 
04:01:23.269 --> 04:01:23.279 align:start position:0%
if it was actually enforced nobody would
 
04:01:25.070 --> 04:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
be here discussing it it would be a
 
04:01:25.080 --> 04:01:26.910 align:start position:0%
be here discussing it it would be a
no-brainer

04:01:26.910 --> 04:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
no-brainer
 
04:01:29.389 --> 04:01:29.399 align:start position:0%
um and for roadside tests we only have a
 
04:01:31.469 --> 04:01:31.479 align:start position:0%
roadside test for alcohol and that was
 
04:01:33.349 --> 04:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
not even invented till almost 20 years
 
04:01:36.710 --> 04:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
after prohibition was repealed initially
 
04:01:38.269 --> 04:01:38.279 align:start position:0%
uh we don't have a roadside test for any
 
04:01:39.590 --> 04:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs any over-the-counter
 
04:01:42.550 --> 04:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
medications cold medication narcotics
 
04:01:44.269 --> 04:01:44.279 align:start position:0%
lots of things that many millions and
 
04:01:46.149 --> 04:01:46.159 align:start position:0%
millions of Americans are on on a daily
 
04:01:48.510 --> 04:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
basis zero roadside test they have other
 
04:01:50.070 --> 04:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
means of doing that I think it's good to
 
04:01:51.750 --> 04:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
have uh you know drug enforcement ex
 
04:01:53.269 --> 04:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
drug recognition experts and people out
 
04:01:54.830 --> 04:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
there doing their job I think we need to
 
04:01:56.670 --> 04:01:56.680 align:start position:0%
fund more of that that's a great thing
 
04:01:59.030 --> 04:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
to keep people from driving impaired but
 
04:02:01.469 --> 04:02:01.479 align:start position:0%
I think that um you know thinking that
 
04:02:03.670 --> 04:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
we are an island of prohibition is a
 
04:02:05.950 --> 04:02:05.960 align:start position:0%
good thing is is shortsighted we're
 
04:02:08.110 --> 04:02:08.120 align:start position:0%
surrounded by not just every state
 
04:02:09.590 --> 04:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
around us that is legalized it but
 
04:02:11.469 --> 04:02:11.479 align:start position:0%
another country has legalized it we are
 
04:02:13.309 --> 04:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
completely surrounded now that's great
 
04:02:15.229 --> 04:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
we can say we a moral superiority to
 
04:02:16.429 --> 04:02:16.439 align:start position:0%
them because we haven't legalized it
 
04:02:18.710 --> 04:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
here but that's ignorant to think that
 
04:02:20.830 --> 04:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
people can't drive 20 minutes or 30
 
04:02:22.309 --> 04:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
minutes in any direction and buy it and
 
04:02:24.149 --> 04:02:24.159 align:start position:0%
bring it right back that's what people
 
04:02:25.950 --> 04:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
do we're losing the revenue we're making
 
04:02:27.110 --> 04:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
people travel more so you don't want
 
04:02:28.269 --> 04:02:28.279 align:start position:0%
people to drive under the influence but
 
04:02:30.149 --> 04:02:30.159 align:start position:0%
we want them to drive further to get
 
04:02:33.950 --> 04:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
it um you know it's okay to sell grain
 
04:02:36.389 --> 04:02:36.399 align:start position:0%
alcohol or high uh content liquor in the
 
04:02:38.950 --> 04:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
stores and the state does that as a as a
 
04:02:42.630 --> 04:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
as a government entity so to speak and
 
04:02:44.750 --> 04:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
that's not questioned whatsoever no no
 
04:02:46.070 --> 04:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
one's saying well they sell grain that's
 
04:02:47.590 --> 04:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
killing people well yeah it's not a good
 
04:02:48.990 --> 04:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
idea to drink it and you shouldn't be
 
04:02:50.990 --> 04:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
using high doses of high amounts of THC
 
04:02:52.429 --> 04:02:52.439 align:start position:0%
unless you have a reason people are
 
04:02:54.229 --> 04:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
going to do it but it also gives people
 
04:02:56.349 --> 04:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
who smoke or inhale those products which
 
04:02:57.670 --> 04:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
is still unfortunately a higher
 
04:02:59.510 --> 04:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
percentage of people the ability to
 
04:03:02.550 --> 04:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
smoke less you know if something is if
 
04:03:04.710 --> 04:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
you're drinking a something that's 40%
 
04:03:06.429 --> 04:03:06.439 align:start position:0%
alcohol you know if you have 10 drinks
 
04:03:07.630 --> 04:03:07.640 align:start position:0%
that's a lot but you don't have to have
 
04:03:09.229 --> 04:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
as many drinks if you're drinking
 
04:03:11.910 --> 04:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
something that's stronger necessarily uh
 
04:03:13.070 --> 04:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
same with pain medication when I
 
04:03:14.510 --> 04:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
prescribe pain medic ation I would give
 
04:03:16.389 --> 04:03:16.399 align:start position:0%
people sometimes a very strong pain
 
04:03:18.710 --> 04:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
medication for severe pain but I would
 
04:03:20.670 --> 04:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
give them the lowest dose possible and
 
04:03:22.469 --> 04:03:22.479 align:start position:0%
you know someone instead of taking 10 15
 
04:03:23.750 --> 04:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
20 pills a day if I can give them a
 
04:03:25.349 --> 04:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
smaller dose of something that's a
 
04:03:30.110 --> 04:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
better thing to do a smaller quantity um
 
04:03:32.429 --> 04:03:32.439 align:start position:0%
anyway so no one's forcing people to do
 
04:03:34.349 --> 04:03:34.359 align:start position:0%
it and as far as uh you know the federal
 
04:03:36.189 --> 04:03:36.199 align:start position:0%
courts and second amendment rights there
 
04:03:37.469 --> 04:03:37.479 align:start position:0%
have been at least two federal courts
 
04:03:38.950 --> 04:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
that have said they can't do it hasn't
 
04:03:40.790 --> 04:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
been in our district federal district
 
04:03:43.030 --> 04:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
yet but the the trend is happening that
 
04:03:45.030 --> 04:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
it's not something is constitutional and
 
04:03:46.630 --> 04:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
I I can't wait for that debate to happen
 
04:03:50.309 --> 04:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
at the federal level even further um and
 
04:03:52.070 --> 04:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
I think that's about it unless you have
 
04:03:53.910 --> 04:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
any questions I'd be happy to answer any
 
04:03:55.229 --> 04:03:55.239 align:start position:0%
questions you have I've been doing this
 
04:03:57.149 --> 04:03:57.159 align:start position:0%
for many years from an advocacy level
 
04:03:59.429 --> 04:03:59.439 align:start position:0%
and I've worked with patients people in
 
04:04:01.710 --> 04:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
recovery uh providers and people in the
 
04:04:03.750 --> 04:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
business and obviously legislators and
 
04:04:05.590 --> 04:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions or
 
04:04:07.389 --> 04:04:07.399 align:start position:0%
concerns you may
 
04:04:09.710 --> 04:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
have represent
 
04:04:13.870 --> 04:04:13.880 align:start position:0%
Teresa so will this bill require a label
 
04:04:15.710 --> 04:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
on the marijuana product being sold
 
04:04:18.990 --> 04:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
saying marijuana is injurious to health
 
04:04:20.149 --> 04:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
the way
 
04:04:22.950 --> 04:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
alcohol uh that label is always there in
 
04:04:25.830 --> 04:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
every alcohol product or even cigarette
 
04:04:28.710 --> 04:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
smoking products will this require to
 
04:04:31.349 --> 04:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
put that label so people know that it is
 
04:04:33.830 --> 04:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
injurious to help that
 
04:04:36.349 --> 04:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
is um there are there are several I
 
04:04:37.790 --> 04:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
don't I can't find the specific sentence
 
04:04:39.030 --> 04:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question I I don't
 
04:04:41.189 --> 04:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
know the specific part of this that says
 
04:04:43.229 --> 04:04:43.239 align:start position:0%
that but there are several areas that
 
04:04:43.239 --> 04:04:44.870 align:start position:0%
that but there are several areas that
have

04:04:44.870 --> 04:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:04:47.269 --> 04:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
um Market Mass marketing prohibitions
 
04:04:49.910 --> 04:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
Pro marketing to miners uh labeling
 
04:04:52.550 --> 04:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
requirements about content uh and that
 
04:04:53.790 --> 04:04:53.800 align:start position:0%
that effect I don't know if there's a
 
04:04:55.070 --> 04:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
specific health warning maybe someone
 
04:04:57.149 --> 04:04:57.159 align:start position:0%
else could answer that it it may be in
 
04:05:00.590 --> 04:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
here but uh I'm not sure followup
 
04:05:03.349 --> 04:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
question not against it further question
 
04:05:06.269 --> 04:05:06.279 align:start position:0%
and uh as we just heard the testimony
 
04:05:08.750 --> 04:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
from the law enforcement will this bill
 
04:05:13.750 --> 04:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
all require uh some guideline or some uh
 
04:05:13.760 --> 04:05:14.950 align:start position:0%
all require uh some guideline or some uh
restriction

04:05:14.950 --> 04:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
restriction
 
04:05:18.990 --> 04:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
that uh they a person can have only so
 
04:05:22.349 --> 04:05:22.359 align:start position:0%
much amount of
 
04:05:26.630 --> 04:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
marijuana to be not impaired or to be
 
04:05:28.349 --> 04:05:28.359 align:start position:0%
like for example in alcohol they say in
 
04:05:30.149 --> 04:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
driving school that you can have one
 
04:05:32.429 --> 04:05:32.439 align:start position:0%
drink an hour and it'll go away from a
 
04:05:35.229 --> 04:05:35.239 align:start position:0%
system so is this going to set any
 
04:05:37.030 --> 04:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
guideline like that standard that this
 
04:05:39.790 --> 04:05:39.800 align:start position:0%
is how much a person can have consume
 
04:05:42.070 --> 04:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
within certain time frame not more than
 
04:05:44.429 --> 04:05:44.439 align:start position:0%
that for a law enforcement to be able to
 
04:05:46.389 --> 04:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
get alerted something like that the
 
04:05:48.389 --> 04:05:48.399 align:start position:0%
education or something like that it's
 
04:05:51.030 --> 04:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
it's I I believe it comes to the most
 
04:05:52.950 --> 04:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
people without with alcohol it's not ex
 
04:05:54.830 --> 04:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
a perfectly linear relationship but for
 
04:05:56.990 --> 04:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
a certain size and weight we can fairly
 
04:05:59.030 --> 04:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
estimate fairly well how impaired
 
04:06:01.590 --> 04:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
someone is generally by how many drinks
 
04:06:03.630 --> 04:06:03.640 align:start position:0%
they have per body weight with cannabis
 
04:06:05.110 --> 04:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
that's not the case people do react
 
04:06:06.670 --> 04:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
differently someone who is a regular
 
04:06:08.670 --> 04:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
medical user even just recreational user
 
04:06:11.149 --> 04:06:11.159 align:start position:0%
may be using higher Doses and that may
 
04:06:13.870 --> 04:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
affect them differently um it may affect
 
04:06:15.830 --> 04:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
stronger or even less they may be able
 
04:06:17.429 --> 04:06:17.439 align:start position:0%
to handle it better uh there are some
 
04:06:18.630 --> 04:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
people who think they can drive better
 
04:06:20.990 --> 04:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
when they drink more and probably not a
 
04:06:24.990 --> 04:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
not a good uh idea but um the fact that
 
04:06:27.790 --> 04:06:27.800 align:start position:0%
people with uh cannabis use may have
 
04:06:29.910 --> 04:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
something in their system means a blood
 
04:06:32.389 --> 04:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
test might show elevated levels of
 
04:06:34.510 --> 04:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
metabolites in their system that are not
 
04:06:35.990 --> 04:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily indicative of being under
 
04:06:37.990 --> 04:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
the influence so having a per se limit
 
04:06:39.750 --> 04:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
like a specific number of what's
 
04:06:42.389 --> 04:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
considered impaired you can't do now
 
04:06:44.070 --> 04:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
because you can't do that
 
04:06:45.750 --> 04:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
currently scientifically does that mean
 
04:06:47.030 --> 04:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't do this I mean after
 
04:06:48.349 --> 04:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
prohibition was appealed it was a good
 
04:06:49.670 --> 04:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
20 years before they even invented a
 
04:06:51.269 --> 04:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
test and then it was another 20 or 30
 
04:06:52.349 --> 04:06:52.359 align:start position:0%
years before that it was a good idea to
 
04:06:55.030 --> 04:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
enforce it um we know it's not a good
 
04:06:56.510 --> 04:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
idea but people that drive under the
 
04:06:58.510 --> 04:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
influence of alcohol are 12 times more
 
04:06:59.670 --> 04:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
likely than the average individual to
 
04:07:02.550 --> 04:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
get into a traffic accident um and
 
04:07:04.349 --> 04:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
people under the use of cannabis and I
 
04:07:05.990 --> 04:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
don't have the exact number but I know
 
04:07:08.469 --> 04:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
it's under 2% between one and two one
 
04:07:09.910 --> 04:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
and two times more likely so it's
 
04:07:11.830 --> 04:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
definitely more likely and I'm not
 
04:07:12.910 --> 04:07:12.920 align:start position:0%
saying people should drive under the
 
04:07:15.870 --> 04:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
influence but I'm saying it's not nearly
 
04:07:17.070 --> 04:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
as dangerous as driving under the
 
04:07:20.710 --> 04:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
influence of alcohol on a overall level
 
04:07:24.389 --> 04:07:24.399 align:start position:0%
of just pure numbers now um the other
 
04:07:26.510 --> 04:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
thing is people do drink less in some
 
04:07:28.510 --> 04:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
location some areas especially young
 
04:07:31.429 --> 04:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
people are obviously drinking less and
 
04:07:33.309 --> 04:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
smoking more at certain certain times
 
04:07:34.429 --> 04:07:34.439 align:start position:0%
now I'm not saying high school kids
 
04:07:35.469 --> 04:07:35.479 align:start position:0%
because there's tons of studies that
 
04:07:37.750 --> 04:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
show that High School aged uh use has
 
04:07:39.710 --> 04:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
gone down in states of legalized medical
 
04:07:45.510 --> 04:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:49.670 --> 04:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:52.149 --> 04:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
question the answer your question about
 
04:07:54.750 --> 04:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
what is written on the package for
 
04:07:57.389 --> 04:07:57.399 align:start position:0%
disclosures is on page the bottom of
 
04:08:00.550 --> 04:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
page 22 Yeah okay thank
 
04:08:03.790 --> 04:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:06.469 --> 04:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
you yep morning label caution when eaten
 
04:08:07.790 --> 04:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
or swallowed the intoxicating effects of
 
04:08:10.429 --> 04:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:10.439 --> 04:08:11.990 align:start position:0%
 
delayed

04:08:11.990 --> 04:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
delayed
 
04:08:14.950 --> 04:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
okay anything else are we good I was
 
04:08:16.830 --> 04:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
able to find it pretty quickly I guess
 
04:08:19.389 --> 04:08:19.399 align:start position:0%
this does look pretty familiar to me I
 
04:08:19.399 --> 04:08:20.870 align:start position:0%
this does look pretty familiar to me I
thought

04:08:20.870 --> 04:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
thought
 
04:08:24.429 --> 04:08:24.439 align:start position:0%
so okay any other questions for Dr
 
04:08:26.550 --> 04:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
Hannon seeing done thank you very much
 
04:08:31.950 --> 04:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
have a great having no more cards oh
 
04:08:34.870 --> 04:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
no I will close the public hearing on
 
04:08:36.790 --> 04:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:08:39.750 --> 04:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
186 and like all bills in Commerce it
 
04:08:43.710 --> 04:08:43.720 align:start position:0%
will go to a subcommittee and it's and
 
04:08:53.710 --> 04:08:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:55.910 --> 04:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee okay so for committee
 
04:08:58.510 --> 04:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
members um I have scheduled next
 
04:09:01.429 --> 04:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
Wednesday Tuesday's off Thursday is a
 
04:09:05.429 --> 04:09:05.439 align:start position:0%
session day um after Wednesday we uh
 
04:09:07.910 --> 04:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
theoretically uh haven't heard any
 
04:09:09.990 --> 04:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
different that I have now scheduled all
 
04:09:11.990 --> 04:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
bills we have we'll have all our
 
04:09:15.229 --> 04:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
hearings done so so then as we go March
 
04:09:18.229 --> 04:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
through the rest of the of the of of the
 
04:09:20.030 --> 04:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
month we will be just doing
 
04:09:23.030 --> 04:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and we getting through the
 
04:09:26.229 --> 04:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
we getting through the weeds and of all
 
04:09:26.239 --> 04:09:27.910 align:start position:0%
we getting through the weeds and of all
those

04:09:27.910 --> 04:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:09:30.630 --> 04:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
bills and I will try to do Tuesday
 
04:09:33.070 --> 04:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
Wednesday um you know if I can get
 
04:09:34.510 --> 04:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
community rooms on Tuesday but it's
 
04:09:37.229 --> 04:09:37.239 align:start position:0%
really it's based upon availability
 
04:09:39.469 --> 04:09:39.479 align:start position:0%
because I refuse to meet on
 
04:10:01.149 --> 04:10:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:04.030 --> 04:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
read it there's something in there that
 
04:10:07.149 --> 04:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
says you cannot you know especially on
 
04:10:10.910 --> 04:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
on on crisis emergency something you
 
04:10:13.349 --> 04:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
know you can't yeah you can't you can't
 
04:10:16.309 --> 04:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
can't uh get crazy about charging you
